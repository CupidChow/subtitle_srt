{\an8}DIVORCE PROTECTION INSURANCE

5
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,080
{\an8}Is this the promo flyer
you used at the wedding fair?

6
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,874
-Yes.
-Yes.

7
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,629
We received a complaint.

8
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,005
-What?
-What?

9
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,675
{\an8}The flyer contains information
that violates insurance regulations.

10
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,014
{\an8}A complaint, sir?

11
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,517
{\an8}This isn't a contract
or terms and conditions.

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,353
{\an8}We just made a small batch
for promotion purposes.

13
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,355
{\an8}We've secured pre-approval

14
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,398
{\an8}and included all required notices.

15
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,901
{\an8}I'm aware of that,
but that isn't the issue.

16
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,487
{\an8}"During the execution and solicitation
of insurance contracts,

17
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,616
{\an8}items exceeding 30,000 won
may not be provided to consumers."

18
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,910
{\an8}This is the provision
you allegedly violated.

19
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,703
{\an8}-But…
-Jeez.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,458
We only handed out wet wipes
and tissues that day.

21
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,419
They might've cost 3,000 won,
but certainly not over 30,000 won.

22
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,965
Maybe they confused the promo gift
with another company's?

23
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,349
DIVORCE CEREMONY

24
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,851
This part right here.

25
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,229
Can you host a divorce ceremony
for less than 30,000 won?

26
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,149
A divorce ceremony…

27
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,818
My understanding is that

28
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,904
the insurance law was recently updated.

29
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,198
The new regulation sets a limit
of 200,000 won per product

30
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,993
or 10% of the annual premium.

31
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,202
Exactly.

32
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,037
That's right. You're well-informed.

33
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,247
Then what's the issue?

34
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,373
{\an8}The part that says,

35
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:48,669
{\an8}"However, this applies solely to items
that reduce the risk of an accident."

36
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,296
A divorce ceremony

37
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,382
does not qualify as an item
that reduces the risk of an accident,

38
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,677
meaning it does not lower
the divorce rate for policyholders.

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,720
This is the issue.

40
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,894
The person who filed the complaint
pointed out this violation,

41
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,353
which even we had overlooked.

42
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,024
Yes, it seems so.

43
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,193
This person's skill
matches that of an underwriter.

44
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,862
I know.

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,031
Then I'll take that

46
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,533
as you admitting to it.

47
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,369
-But…
-Excuse me!

48
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,414
We didn't violate anything.

49
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,917
He's right. We haven't hosted
a divorce ceremony yet.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,001
Maybe not now,

51
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,503
but you will later, right?

52
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,673
No, sir. We won't provide
any divorce ceremonies.

53
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,177
Then was that false advertisement?

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,512
Would you rather face
the harsher penalty of that provision?

55
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,557
No, sir. It definitely wasn't
a false advertisement.

56
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,100
Look here, Mr. Noh Ki-jun.

57
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,435
I mean…

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,104
It'll be fine as long as

59
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,106
none of the first ten people
who signed up get divorced.

60
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,653
How does that even make sense?

61
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,780
We'll provide divorce prevention
management until the contract term ends.

62
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,907
Just like the health management services.

63
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,883
If that's what you're willing to do, fine.

64
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,804
However,

65
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,807
if you end up hosting a divorce ceremony,

66
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,725
you will be held fully accountable,
including today's issue,

67
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,103
which means no limited-time sales.

68
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,938
And of course, no official launch.

69
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,898
Are we clear?

70
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,483
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,195
Yes, sir. Understood.

72
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,364
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

73
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,991
-Your bag.
-Oh, my.

74
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,200
Get your bag.

75
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,911
-Hurry.
-Goodbye, sir!

76
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,882
DIRECTOR OH MI-YEONG

77
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,260
MARRIAGE COUNSELING CENTER

78
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,354
This is my guess
based on the material you provided.

79
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,439
Thank you.

80
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,484
You know it's unreasonable
to make judgments based on this, right?

81
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,652
Yes, of course.

82
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:23,032
It's unreasonable for anyone to judge
others' marital issues in the first place.

83
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,707
We appreciate that you responded
to our unreasonable request.

84
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,837
Please consider this a type of
multidimensional data collection analysis.

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,297
Of course.

86
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,058
This is unexpected, though.

87
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,392
This policyholder came up top?

88
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:54,229
The questionnaire showed
no signs of marital conflict.

89
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,774
They even put down zero number of fights.

90
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,442
You're right.

91
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,530
Is there a married couple in this world
without any conflicts?

92
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,615
No.

93
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,533
Almost none, probably.

94
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,494
That's right.

95
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,456
Conflict among people
is both natural and unavoidable.

96
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,043
Claiming there's no conflict
actually suggests there's a problem.

97
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,630
This person is doing everything possible
to avoid conflict.

98
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,802
Confronting the truth doesn't mean
it will resolve everything,

99
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,763
but avoiding it will
certainly change nothing.

100
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,681
It means there's no room for improvement.

101
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,850
So that's why…

102
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,145
Now, do you understand
why this person was my top pick?

103
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,438
-Yes.
-Yes.

104
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,612
I thought if a married couple
baked cookies or a cake together,

105
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,156
it could help mend their relationship.

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,867
So I'd like to arrange
some couples baking classes.

107
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,452
If that's the case, I'm not sure.

108
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,206
Baking requires much more focus
and effort than you'd expect.

109
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,083
It's one thing if they're on good terms.

110
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,253
But if they're not,
it could end up causing more frustration.

111
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,131
There are actually many couples
who end up fighting and leave.

112
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,011
Jeez, what the heck?

113
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,930
It's you.

114
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:12,724
Do you know him?

115
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,768
No.

116
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,563
His father owns this place.

117
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,939
He's just full of energy.

118
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,943
He handles the building maintenance here

119
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,571
and teaches at a dance studio.

120
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,908
Actually, I think dancing
will help you more.

121
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,910
There's more physical interaction
in dancing.

122
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,417
We meet again.

123
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,501
Oh, my.

124
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,753
So you do know him.

125
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,299
I'll go bake a nice cake for you.

126
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,850
-This must be fate.
-No.

127
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:55,934
It's just a coincidence.

128
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:00,147
I asked the couples manager for
your number because I wanted to see you,

129
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,858
but you didn't ask for a second date.

130
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,569
There were privacy issues, so--

131
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,112
I want you to teach dance lessons.

132
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,034
You're very proactive.

133
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,330
If that's what you want, Ms. Ah-young.

134
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,414
No.

135
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,583
This is a business proposition.

136
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,212
I want you to teach married policyholders
who are at risk of divorce

137
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,546
how to dance.

138
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,258
Okay.

139
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,681
Thank you for becoming a partner
of our divorce prevention program.

140
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,767
Excuse me?

141
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,645
What's this…

142
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,396
But, wait…

143
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,817
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE

144
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,657
Management until the contract term ends?

145
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,575
What made you say something so outrageous?

146
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,536
Well, our goal was
to have a divorce rate of zero.

147
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,539
But that was for a six-month term,
not the end of a contract term.

148
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,625
Yes, but we still don't lose out on this.

149
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,254
It's bad enough we have to meet
the company's conditions, but now this?

150
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,422
There are too many things to consider.

151
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,592
We just have to think of it
as people showing interest.

152
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,427
Right.

153
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,430
Ms. Ah-young!

154
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,933
If you dance on the street again,
I'll call the cops on you.

155
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,476
Will we continue to see each other?

156
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,603
Not on a personal level.

157
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,606
-Why not?
-I told you I don't believe in marriage.

158
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,608
But you can still date, right?

159
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,528
Just as there are
different types of vegans,

160
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,655
it's the same for people
who don't believe in marriage.

161
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,865
-I'm the type who doesn't even date.
-Why?

162
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,493
Because I refuse to waste time and energy
on something useless.

163
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,869
Then what do you do in your free time?

164
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,121
I don't have any free time.

165
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,622
Come on.

166
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,542
If I have free time,
I learn something new or pursue a hobby.

167
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,127
I invest that time in myself.

168
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,921
You sure keep yourself busy.

169
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,007
On that note, I got you a gift.

170
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,341
Please don't.

171
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,847
It's napa cabbage from my farm.

172
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,059
Actually, I'm a farmer.

173
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,604
I thought your father owned this building.

174
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,440
That's right.

175
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,484
But I gave up my parents'
financial support to pursue dancing.

176
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,780
So I looked for a job I could do
alongside dancing,

177
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,074
and I ended up finding this part-time job
harvesting napa cabbage.

178
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,370
Then I took a liking to farming
and became a farmer.

179
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,459
Make a wrap and eat it.

180
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,044
It's sweet and tasty.

181
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,595
Fine, then.

182
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,974
Being nonchalant
is what makes you attractive.

183
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,478
Stop, unless you want to
get slapped by this cabbage.

184
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,604
I'll be off now.

185
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,566
Goodbye, Ms. Ah-young!

186
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
Take care!

187
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,368
{\an8}What the hell are you talking about?

188
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,203
Say that again.

189
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,080
Do what until the term ends?

190
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,044
Why are there more obstacles to overcome?

191
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,046
We already have more than enough
challenges to prevent as it is!

192
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,465
Here are more special management cases
we have to prevent.

193
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,175
What's the matter with you?

194
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,259
Damn it.

195
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,845
DR. OH'S LIST

196
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:19,846
Ten people?

197
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,681
Ten more on top of
the first ten who signed up?

198
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,519
There's this list too.

199
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,062
Hey, Ms. Kang.

200
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,441
We can look at that later.
Why bring it up now?

201
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,111
What's this? Ten more people?

202
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,531
How many are there in total? Thirty?

203
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,157
Damn it.

204
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,701
We're not
a divorce prevention management team!

205
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,832
It's not 30 people, sir.

206
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,545
It's not?

207
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,549
But Ms. Kang, you're never wrong.

208
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,135
Is there something else, then?

209
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,095
The experts' lists are almost the same.

210
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,471
Take a look, sir.

211
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,266
No way.

212
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,227
{\an8}DR. OH'S LIST
PROFESSOR KIM'S LIST

213
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,606
So experts' views
are the same across the board?

214
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,692
It seems so, sir.

215
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,319
There's a shorter list
of people to manage now.

216
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,448
-Which means a higher risk.
-Why would you bring that up?

217
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,658
Don't you know logical conjunction?

218
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,827
Intersecting entity characteristics
combine multiplicatively.

219
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,247
But the number of entities
in the union has decreased.

220
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,500
When two or more entities
have corresponding input values--

221
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,751
Hey!

222
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,545
Yes, sir.

223
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,298
Take your arguing outside, damn it.

224
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,841
Read the room, will you?

225
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,885
What's even more shocking is that

226
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,179
the top pick is the same.

227
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,681
What?

228
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,434
What do you mean by that?

229
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,229
According to the experts, this person
is most likely to get divorced.

230
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,734
And this person is on the list
of the first ten people who signed up.

231
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,823
{\an8}NUMBER 1, GU MI-RAE

232
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,116
{\an8}What does this mean?

233
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,913
Am I the only one who doesn't get it?

234
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,582
Can someone explain this to me?

235
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,293
Anyone? Hello?

236
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,712
Excuse me. Hello?

237
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,755
Excuse me?

238
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,092
Let's see here.

239
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,472
If the experts chose the same person
as their number one pick,

240
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,433
that means their chance of divorce
is that much higher.

241
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:32,187
But if they're also on the list
of the first ten applicants,

242
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,730
that means…

243
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,652
Oh, damn it.

244
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,405
-Mr. Na!
-Mr. Na!

245
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,490
Are you okay, old man?

246
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,534
Hey, you jerk.
Don't call our team leader an old man!

247
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,994
-I'm sorry, Mr. Na!
-His eyes!

248
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,246
-We need to do CPR!
-Do CPR!

249
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,042
{\an8}PRESIDENT LEE JEONG-SIN

250
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,170
{\an8}This will hit them pretty hard.

251
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,466
Let's see how they handle it.

252
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,346
DIVORCE PROTECTION INSURANCE

253
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,726
Ms. Jeon.

254
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,811
Hello, sir.

255
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,980
What on earth happened?

256
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,898
Someone filed a complaint to the FSS?

257
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,984
Please take a seat.

258
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,530
We made a mistake
with one of the provisions on the flyer.

259
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,367
-What?
-I'm sorry. I should've been thorough.

260
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,703
This product must be launched
without any issues.

261
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,704
You know that.

262
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,872
I'll pay closer attention, sir.

263
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,958
Damn it.

264
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,169
However,

265
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,922
it's strange how they knew
such a provision.

266
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,301
This could be the job of an insider,
so I'll meet with the security manager.

267
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,719
What?

268
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,471
No, there's no way
it was someone from the inside.

269
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,851
We should also be more careful
when sending material to the China branch.

270
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,811
Yes, we should.

271
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,104
Don't worry about that.

272
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,897
I'll monitor things.

273
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,691
Damn it.

274
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,746
Hey, we need to tighten security
from now on,

275
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,539
so that no one suspects anything.

276
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,624
Yes.

277
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,792
Make sure to be discreet.

278
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,794
Okay.

279
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,888
Get out!

280
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,556
Get out, now!

281
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,600
Get out and take care of it.

282
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,394
Don't you dare come back
before solving this issue!

283
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,441
Beg as much as you want,

284
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,486
but I'm not opening this door!

285
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,113
Mr. Na is the one
trapped in there, not us.

286
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,371
Gu Mi-rae…

287
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,122
Gu Mi-rae?

288
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,751
This is the person I consulted
at the wedding fair.

289
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,835
I remember her name.

290
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,629
Do you remember anything else?

291
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,882
I think her outfit was a bit unusual.

292
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,803
I was all over the place that day,
so I don't remember.

293
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,180
Okay. What's the address?

294
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,598
Yangsam-dong.

295
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,017
Let's head to the scene for now.

296
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,019
We need to go to the scene to investigate.

297
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,104
"Investigate"?

298
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,147
Are you a detective?
What do you plan to do there?

299
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,400
Let's just go, Detective Kang.
I mean, Ms. Kang.

300
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,110
What? Right now?

301
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,113
We have to find signs of divorce.

302
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,408
If there are warning signs of divorce,
we must handle it within the golden hour.

303
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,702
-You sound like a doctor.
-Scalpel. Never mind.

304
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,954
Wait, we should call her first.

305
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,256
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello?</font></i>

306
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,758
Hello, is this Ms. Gu Mi-rae?

307
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,677
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Yes, it is. Who am I speaking with?</font></i>

Oh, I'm…

309
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,308
We met before at the wedding fair.

310
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,227
The thing is…

311
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,106
I'm not sure if you remember,

312
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,649
but you and I…

313
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,984
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Did I consult with you?</font></i>

314
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,570
Yes, that's right.

315
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,489
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I see. How can I help you?</font></i>

316
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,867
The thing is…

317
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,162
If it's okay with you,

318
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,247
may I visit your place

319
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,001
and speak with you…

320
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,295
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you asking for</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">a site-visit consultation?</font></i>

321
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,505
Yes, that's right.
A site-visit consultation.

322
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,717
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-When would you like to come?</font></i>
-Excuse me?

323
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,762
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">How about today?</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I happen to have some free time.</font></i>

324
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,930
Yes, we'll head out now.

325
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,725
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'll see you later, then.</font></i>

326
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,018
Yes, thank you.

327
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,317
She sounded way too happy to invite me.

328
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,736
-Really?
-Yes.

329
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,446
-Then we should go right away. Come on.
-Okay.

330
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,325
FIRST TO SIGN UP LIST, DR. OH'S LIST

331
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,791
I never violated
the promotional gift regulation

332
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,126
even when I was the top insurance agent
in Ssangmun-dong.

333
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,550
But you'd have to be an expert

334
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,011
to know such regulations.

335
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,849
No, there's no way someone would…

336
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,852
There must've been a lawyer
at the wedding fair that day.

337
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,563
APPROVAL DENIED

338
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,107
I forgot about these rejected cases.

339
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,821
Jeez. We have to prevent divorces
and secure contracts.

340
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,155
When will we get these done?

341
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,705
Do we need to recruit more staff?

342
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,211

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Even if you're not good at anything</font></i>

349

350

351
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,452
Very good!

352
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,706
Ladies, did you have a good time today?

353
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,249
-Yes!
-Yes!

354
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:31,296
To keep being happy like today
for the rest of your lives,

355
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,174
I prepared a premium dementia
insurance policy!

356
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,138
Okay, ladies.

357
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,347
Here we go.

358
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,182
It's premium insurance.

359
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,059
That's right.

360
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,854
You can't trust your kids,
but you can trust this.

361
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,606
Yes, that's right.

362
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,068
-It's a premium policy.
-Okay.

363
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,779
Do I have to fill out this part too?

364
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,406
Write 5 kg less than your actual weight.

365
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,782
Really? Can I do that?

366
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,409
Okay, looks good.

367
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,829
NA DAE-BOK

368
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,205
It's my respected senior colleague.

369
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:08,917
Hello, Mr. Na.

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,084
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Chang-hee, are you busy?</font></i>

371
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,295
I'm in the middle of a consultation.

372
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,379
A consultation?

373
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,089
I shouldn't interrupt, then. I'll hang up.

374
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,091
I'll visit you shortly.

375
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,384
Okay, goodbye.

376
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,764
Ma'am, just fill it out.

377
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,182
-Did I get it right?
-Yes, you did.

378
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,225
Look at this kid.

379
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,811
He reminds me of myself back in the day.

380
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,191
It's great how he's working hard.

381
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,861
Some employees were on their computer
outside of working hours.

382
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,740
Is that so?

383
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,452
As requested, I checked the system
activity from the last six months,

384
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,579
and there was no sign of hacking.

385
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,082
But there were employees
who used their computer

386
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,000
outside of working hours.

387
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
Who was it?

388
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,256
Mr. Noh Ki-jun and Ms. Kang Han-deul
of the New Product Development Team.

389
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,557
Is it possible
that an outsider accessed it?

390
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,934
No, that's impossible.

391
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,561
Outsiders are prohibited
from entering after business hours,

392
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,355
and company computers are securely locked.

393
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,484
Unless they stole an employee ID number,
it's impossible to use a computer.

394
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,568
Understood.

395
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,862
Please continue to check the system.

396
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,906
I'll report to you on a regular basis.

397
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,621
If it wasn't a hacker,

398
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,707
who could it have been?

399
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,590
{\an8}Yes?

400
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,181
You're here.

401
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,933
Yes, ma'am. How may I help you?

402
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,810
-Sir.
-Yes?

403
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,063
Let's launch a new product soon.

404
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,736
{\an8}DIVORCE INSURANCE
POLICY TERMS & CONDITIONS

405
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,487
Divorce insurance?

406
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,658
Adding benefits to existing products
is rather boring now,

407
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,076
don't you think?

408
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,289
I think our perspective
on what a crisis is needs to change.

409
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,916
But would this be commercially viable?

410
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,920
I'm suggesting a new paradigm
in the existing insurance industry.

411
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,882
This product will definitely
question societal trends

412
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,259
and create waves.

413
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,179
On that note,

414
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,016
I'd like to see the official launch
of divorce insurance…

415
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,103
by Best General Insurance.

416
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,991
I think it's around here.

417
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,705
This is it.

418
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,139
-Welcome.
-Hello.

419
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,519
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

420
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,313
Thank you.

421
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,616
The atmosphere here is rather unusual.

422
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,409
It looks pretty.

423
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,129
Thank you for making time for us.

424
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,047
I should be thanking you.

425
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,009
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

426
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,806
Shall we begin now?

427
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:52,932
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

428
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,308
Yes, of course.

429
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,644
Ms. Kang, do you want to explain?

430
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,854
-Me?
-Shall I do it?

431
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,606
-Oh, right.
-Ms. Kang, if you can explain…

432
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,568
Or shall I begin?

433
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,375
What's this?

434
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,515
So you're here because of insurance,
not a tarot reading?

435
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,351
-Yes.
-Yes.

436
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,813
I think there was a misunderstanding
during the explanation.

437
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,357
You sounded so welcoming on the phone

438
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,401
that I misunderstood.

439
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,237
I ran a tarot reading booth
at the wedding fair.

440
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,281
That's when I signed up for the insurance.

441
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,159
-I see.
-So that's why…

442
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,536
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

443
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,497
I thought you came
for a follow-up reading.

444
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,374
It's hard enough as it is
since I decided to get divorced.

445
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,043
-What?
-What?

446
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,836
Please leave.

447
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,963
Wait a minute, let's--

448
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,257
-Let's talk for a moment.
-It'll just take a second.

449
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,717
Please leave.

450
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,011
Are you sure we can't talk?

451
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,933
I want a divorce ceremony.

452
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,434
I'll contact you once I choose a date.

453
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,770
-But…
-Ma'am!

454
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,897
Ma'am?

455
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,620
Choosing a divorce date, huh?

456
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,623
I guess people
set divorce dates these days.

457
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,960
If they want a divorce,
they might as well do it on a good date.

458
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,044
I suppose so.

459
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,090
When you think about it, a divorce date
is more important than a wedding date.

460
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,841
Do you think this gate will open again?

461
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,352
What are you doing?

462
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,480
I don't think it's the right time.

463
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,316
Jeez.

464
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,319
We're here for a tarot reading.

465
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,824
Can we get a tarot consultation?

466
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,492
That's right. A tarot reading.

467
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,340
I guess it opened up again.

468
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:40,141
The tea has gone cold.
Let me brew a fresh pot for you.

469
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,225
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

470
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,564
What do you plan on doing?

471
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,857
I'm going to ask the tarot cards.

472
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,901
-Were you being serious?
-Yes.

473
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,538
Just a fair warning.
Tarot should not be taken lightly.

474
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,748
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:11,714
Please ask a question.

476
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,970
Will I be able to successfully carry out
the task assigned to me?

477
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,437
Please select three cards.

478
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,278
What about this one?

479
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:35,321
This one?

480
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,739
Or whatever you want.

481
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,074
Right.

482
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,158
This one.

483
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,121
-And this one.
-Yes, that one.

484
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
The cards say you'll eventually succeed

485
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,100
though the process may be difficult.

486
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,184
Really?

487
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,854
This card specifically indicates success.

488
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,273
Does this mean our project will succeed?

489
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,446
What is it that makes you so happy?

490
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,243
It's about helping you live happily
and not get divorced.

491
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,286
Excuse me?

492
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,548
So for the tarot reading to be true,
I can't get divorced.

493
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,967
If I get divorced,
the tarot reading will be false.

494
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,511
Is that it?

495
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,681
This is a dilemma.

496
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,726
Maybe this is a sign from above
that you should reconsider things.

497
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,689
"A sign from above"?

498
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,197
We first met while walking
the Camino de Santiago.

499
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,911
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">One day, I experienced severe burnout.</font></i>

500
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,582
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">So I quit my job</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and got plane tickets on a whim.</font></i>

501
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,964
Safe travels.

502
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,051
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">The person who held out his hand</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">while I was on the ground</font></i>

503
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,887
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">was my current husband.</font></i>

504
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,141
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">When we learned each other's names,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">we were fascinated</font></i>

505
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,726
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">because my name means "future"</font></i>

506
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,144
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">while his name, Hyeon-jae,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">means "present."</font></i>

507
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:36,859
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">And that's how</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">we just started walking together.</font></i>

508
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,672
-Don't your legs hurt?
-It's okay. We're going downhill.

509
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,433
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">When we saw 0 km on the Fisterra marker,</font></i>

510
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,020
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">we hugged each other and cried.</font></i>

511
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,022
-We need photos!
-Yes!

512
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,908
-Did you know?
-What?

513
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,451
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">When he shaved his beard,</font></i>

514

515
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,709
They say the Camino de Santiago
and Jeju Olle Trail

516
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,294
established a friendship pact.

517
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,547
Really?

518
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:44,009
Yes, so if you complete both trails,

519
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,844
you can get a dual completion certificate.

520
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,473
It's as if the end
of the Camino de Santiago

521
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,767
meets the beginning
of the Jeju Olle Trail.

522
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,186
It's a meaningful meeting.

523
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,396
You're right.

524
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,439
So…

525
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,609
Would you like to walk

526
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,030
the Jeju Olle Trail with me later?

527
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,704
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">That was his proposal.</font></i>

528
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,667
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">We registered our marriage</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">as soon as we returned to Korea.</font></i>

529
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,022
My husband is a documentary photographer.

530
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,065
He travels the world
to take photos of animals.

531
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,735
He's away for at least 3,500 hours
on each assignment.

532
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,906
We've never once gotten into a fight.

533
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,452
I'd rather that we fight all the time
like other married couples do.

534
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,537
I've spent more time alone
after getting married

535
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,623
than I have with him.

536
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,749
Actually, no.

537
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,127
I've always been alone.

538
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,385
I don't even know if he's dead or alive.

539
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,928
Now he's trying to photograph
Korean tigers.

540
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,764
That damn tiger!

541
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,483
I want to have a baby

542
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:26,111
and talk and laugh
as we watch them grow up.

543
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,739
That's the future I envisioned.

544
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,367
But he's only focused on the present,

545
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,868
just like his name.

546
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,913
I see.

547
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,417
I'm sure he's staying true to the present
to provide a better future.

548
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,046
If you still have feelings
for your husband…

549
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,009
You two should find a solution together.

550
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,683
Try and find one if you can.

551
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,850
If you do,

552
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,978
I'll take it as a sign from above.

553
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,651
Do you have any idea
where your husband might be?

554
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,695
No, not really.

555
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,615
But he tends to upload photos
of where he stays

556
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,409
as his profile pictures…

557
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,706
It's just green.

558
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,090
I'm just asking out of curiosity,

559
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,800
but do tigers really exist in our country?

560
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,643
They say they've gone extinct, sir.

561
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,271
But according to my husband,

562
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,399
they definitely exist
based on consistent witness accounts.

563
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,235
He got a tip from a hiker
who claimed he saw a tiger

564
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,404
at Balwangsan Mountain
in Gangwon Province last winter.

565
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,322
So he took photos
of footprints in the snow.

566
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,869
So it's possible they exist…

567
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:57,995
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:06,295
He drives an off-road car with antennas
that look like insect feelers.

569
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,714
If you see a man with a long beard
like a Puritan,

570
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,674
that'll be my husband.

571
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,260
Please let me know if you find him,

572
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:14,845
and I'll go there.

573
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,930
We'll find him and contact you.

574
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,141
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

575
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,897
Let's go.

576
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,441
Long antennas and a beard…

577
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,817
Has a Puritan beard…

578
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,659
What place looks that green
at this time of year?

579
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,411
I'll do an image search.

580
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:40,496
Okay.

581
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,295
I think this is the place.

582
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,507
{\an8}"Gorangae."

583
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,050
This is it, right?

584
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,135
Yes, I think so.

585
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,345
What's the address?

586
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,932
It's Gorangae Village, Daegiri,
Gangwon Province.

587
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,017
-Gorangae Village?
-Yes.

588
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,853
Let's get going.

589
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,980
What? Right now?

590
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:11,026
"If there are warning signs of divorce,
we must handle it within the golden hour."

591
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,653
Isn't that what you said?

592
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:17,950
Let's go.

593
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:23,247
You memorized it verbatim. Let's go, then.

594
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,801
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

595
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,685
CLEANING SUPPLIES BOX

596
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,578
A toy that uses inertia
and centrifugal force.

597
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,581
It's a thing of beauty.

598
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,543
It originally comes from
an indigenous weapon called a "<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">bola.</font></i>"

599
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,670
There are many other theories,
but that's the most plausible one.

600
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:13,463
And yo-yo means

601
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,924
"to come back" in the Filipino language.

602
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,843
Let me see it.

603
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,928
Do you know how to yo-yo?

604
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,097
No.

605
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,601
I just need to put my finger in it
and throw it, right?

606
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,687
No, you'll get hurt.
You said yourself it's a weapon.

607
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,024
And this model isn't
exactly for beginners.

608
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,783
Watch carefully.

609
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,495
Slip the ring on the yo-yo's string

610
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,663
onto your middle finger.

611
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,832
And you can't just wind the string
any way you like.

612
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,418
Use your left index finger
and wind it once first.

613
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,505
Then the rest of your fingers
go like this.

614
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,049
Think of them as support.

615
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,806
Okay, I got it.

616
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,564
-Slip it on your finger.
-Like this?

617
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,649
No.

618
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,610
-Like this?
-The direction is…

619
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,571
You have to…

620
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,699
Like this.

621
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,494
Right, just like this.

622
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,745
Then the rest of your fingers

623
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:30,040
go like this.

624
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,334
Move this here…

625
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,462
And then the rest of your fingers

626
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,048
act as support.

627
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,428
Once you grip the yo-yo,
raise it to shoulder level,

628
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,806
then extend your arm and release it.

629
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,183
Extend and release.

630
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,523
No, not like that.

631
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,817
Release it at the last second.

632
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,028
It goes in this direction.

633
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,156
Release at the last second.

634
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,117
-Release at…
-Release at the last second.

635
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,665
Your palm should face up.

636
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,167
Hold the yo-yo

637
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,920
in this direction.

638
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,465
And raise your arm to shoulder level.

639
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:21,883
Release at the count of three.

640
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,136
One, two, three. Release.

641
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,641
Hey, it's spinning.

642
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,980
Eyes forward.

643
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,983
It won't come back up if it's crooked.

644
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,570
Now, give it a tug.

645
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,544
Damn it.

646
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,879
TRAVESTY

647
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,637
What in the world? He wants to video chat?

648
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,722
Jeez.

649
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,223

Grab my arm, please.

663
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,884
-I'm sorry.
-Seriously?

664
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,761
Who was it that made you panic?

665
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,723
Damn it, I'm screwed.

666
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,517
VIDEO CALL ENDED

667
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,772
It was probably nothing.

668
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,482
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.

669
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,983
Like our intimate mattress scene?

670
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,008
Exactly. This is nothing
compared to what we did.

671
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,472
Where's Ms. Joh right now?

672
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,850
She says she's almost here.

673
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:36,810
Here she is.

674
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,353
There you are, Ah-young.

675
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,814
-You're here.
-You made it.

676
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,734
Isn't this too much?

677
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,862
Why are we being asked to find someone?

678
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,072
Think of it as going camping
where there's a nice view.

679
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,408
You said it was a countryside village.

680
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,534
There's nothing to see.

681
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,580
Still, let's get going.

682
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,713
TRAVESTY
GO TO GORANGAE VILLAGE RIGHT NOW

683
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,714
Holy cow.

684
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,090
What is it now?

685
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,758
He said to go
to Gorangae Village right now.

686
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,261
Gorangae Village?

687
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,265
Mr. Na!

688
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,600
Hey, Nam Chang-hee!

689
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,313
You look like you're doing great.

690
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,191
Why are you so early?
I came down early myself.

691
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,942
"Always arrive 30 minutes prior."

692
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,236
It's one of the Ten Commandments of Sales
you taught me.

693
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,321
Jeez.

694
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,114
But my revered mentor called me,

695
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,033
so I came one hour early.

696
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,077
You can do anything you set your mind to.

697
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,038
Come on.
I'll treat you to some great coffee.

698
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,122
Thank you, sir.

699
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,293
-Amazing, right?
-Yes, sir.

700
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,921
This coffee is for executives only.

701
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,089
The crema that forms on top is amazing.

702
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,217
-It's only for executives?
-Yes.

703
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,135
There's a senior managing director
on my team.

704
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,970
She's my direct superior.

705
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,766
I'm her right-hand man.

706
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,979
I'm amazed you started as an agent
and became a team leader.

707
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,856
If you keep this up,
you might become an executive.

708
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,818
No, that's only possible for those
from prestigious backgrounds.

709
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,072
I actually made more money back then.

710
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,866
Then why did you…

711
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,495
I was caught up in making sales.

712
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,538
I didn't get a chance
to watch the kids grow up.

713
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,875
There were days when I had ten meals
because I had to meet clients.

714
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,836
But on some days, if the timing was off,

715
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,880
I'd starve the whole day.

716
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:32,634
Then I'd have to entertain clients
and drink all night long.

717
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,223
That's why I always have
digestive issues now.

718
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,267
Hey, it's ready.

719
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,145
Now then.

720
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,315
The 11th Commandment of Sales.

721
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,526
"Eat your meals on time."

722
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,737
Yes, sir.

723
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,156
Let's go.

724
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,868
So how is it?
Selling insurance must be tough.

725
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,038
I still like making sales
since you earn as much as you work.

726
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,168
That sounds about right

727
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,337
since you don't have a wife or kids yet.

728
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,630
You're still in your prime.

729
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,090
On that note…

730
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,343
Do you want to work with me?

731
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,512
-Excuse me?
-I need you to make sales for me.

732
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,097
But I'm already doing that.

733
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,599
No, not for existing insurance.
It's for a new one.

734
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,728
My team has developed
a new insurance product.

735
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,937
Divorce insurance.

736
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,230
Divorce insurance?

737
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:30,317
-Yes, it's this right here.
-Yes, sir.

738
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,987
We're still in the testing stage
and need to meet some goals,

739
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,032
but two contracts got rejected.

740
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,366
Can you take care of them?

741
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,702
Do you think you can do it?

742
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:41,995
That's not that many cases.

743
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,457
Yes, but this insurance
is unlike any other, so it won't be easy.

744
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,167
Still, I know the ropes.

745
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,376
I'll take care of it right away.

746
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,006
Jeez. Baby Chang-hee is all grown up now.

747
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,968
It's still nothing
compared to your level of passion.

748
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,554
I suppose so.

749
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,349
I was really something back then.

750
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,189
It's Carrot Man!

751
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,483
Hey there, kids!

752
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,069
Kids, what color balloon do you want?

753
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,403
Red for you. Bye now!

754
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,988
Purple. Orange.

755
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,031
Give this to your mom.

756
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,699
Bye!

757
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,326
Ma'am!

758
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,205
Your child will ride a bike
on their own one day, right?

759
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,332
If you want your kid
to ride their bike worry-free,

760
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,917
even if they bump into a luxury car,

761
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,461
please sign up
for Child Accident Protection insurance.

762
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,880
Now, please take your child to school!

763
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,508
Get the coverage you need
with Child Accident Protection.

764
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,009
Sir, please take one!

765
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,260
Please take one.

766
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,595
I miss it.

767
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,350
I was pretty passionate back then.

768
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,147
I'll introduce you to my team members

769
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,691
once they come back
from their business trip,

770
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,318
so can you help me out until then?

771
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,738
If we get through the testing stage
and officially launch this product,

772
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,615
I'll make you the executive distributor.

773
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,952
Don't you worry about a thing, sir.

774
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,830
Hey, have some lunch before you go.

775
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,540
I'm sorry. I have to go meet a client.

776
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,293
Come on. Didn't I say
to eat your meals on time?

777
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,254
It's okay.
I'll drink something healthy there.

778
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,841
You have a coffee machine at home, right?

779
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,050
Wait a minute.

780
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,351
-Take these.
-But they're expensive.

781
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,519
Just take them.

782
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,646
It's okay. Take them.

783
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,274
Thank you.

784
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,775
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

785
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,051
GORANGAE VILLAGE

786
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,640
You said there's nothing to see
in the countryside.

787
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,434
The view is beautiful.

788
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,894
I'm glad we came.

789
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,902
Farmers these days
seem to have a totally new vibe.

790
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,612
They really are.

791
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,739
Gosh, nice moves.

792
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,116
Why does that guy look so familiar?

793
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,921
Why did you follow me here?

794
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,589
You followed me, Ms. Ah-young.

795
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,840
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

796
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,177
This is my field, by the way.

797
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,096
What?

798
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,307
I told you I was a farmer.

799
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,520
I'm the head of this village.

800
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:00,944
It's napa cabbage from my farm.

801
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,363
I thought your father owned this building.

802
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,282
Actually, I'm a farmer.

803
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,951
You're the village head?

804
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,245
I can't believe we met again.
This must be fate.

805
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:14,666
-No, it's not.
-We met on a blind date, we're partnering,

806
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,126
and now we've met again,
so what else can it be but fate?

807
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,336
They went on a blind date?

808
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,754
And they're partnering?

809
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,422
No, that's not it.

810
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:22,840
It must be fate.

811
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,509
It really is.

812
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,890
Nice to meet you.

813
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,977
-He's impressive.
-Hush, Han-deul.

814
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,521
You're the head of this village?

815
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,731
-Yes.
-Please help us.

816
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,567
Excuse me?

817
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,450
GORANGAE COMMUNITY CENTER

818
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,542
Hey, insect feelers. It's this car, right?

819
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,044
-Yes, it is.
-That's right.

820
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,297
There's footage of it coming in
but not leaving.

821
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,048
That means it's still in the village.

822
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:05,842
Yes.

823
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:09,429
There are only two ways to handle
food and accommodation in this village.

824
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,431
Either stay at a guesthouse
or camp in your car.

825
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,642
There are 32 households in the village

826
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,477
but only two places for car camping.

827
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,606
The first Resting Area
and second Resting Area near Windy Hill.

828
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,400
But some people make their way
up to Deulmeori Forest.

829
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,444
Okay, then let's split into two groups.

830
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,279
Ms. Ah-young and I
will search the village.

831
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,406
I don't want to.

832
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,824
It's a long way to the resting area.

833
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,201
It'll be easier
if you search the village with me.

834
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,330
We'll let the elderly
go on the long journey.

835
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,334
-All right, then.
-"Elderly"?

836
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,047
That's fine. The elders will go
on the long journey.

837
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,303
I almost forgot.
Have you chosen your accommodations?

838
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,263
Accommodations?

839
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,142
I can just sleep in my car, but…

840
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,019
I didn't think that far ahead.

841
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,896
We can drive home later tonight
if necessary.

842
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,731
Will you come back
if you don't find him today?

843
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,319
I know a farmhouse where you can stay.
I'll talk to the owner.

844
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,112
There are lots of rooms there,

845
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,740
and my dear Ms. Ah-young needs to sleep.

846
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,617
"My dear Ah-young"?

847
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,372
It's the house way over there
with the red windmill.

848
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,041
Please come down before sunset.

849
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,167
It's a high-altitude area,

850
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,461
so the weather is fickle,
and it can get dark quickly.

851
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,129
-Okay.
-Okay, see you later.

852
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:26,923
Okay. Oh, by the way…

853
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,258
Please be careful.

854
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:31,135
It's easy to get lost
with all the winding paths.

855
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,931
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm a human GPS.

856
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,266
-Then we'll see you two later.
-Okay.

857
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,434
Watch your step.

858
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,228
Just make sure you get back soon.

859
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,355
Shall we go, elder?

860
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,690
Yes.

861
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,943
Let's go to that village first.

862
00:49:58,871 --> 00:49:59,872
-Look.
-What?

863
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:01,165
WINDY HILL
GARDEN OF HEALING

864
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,000
-It's this way.
-Let's go.

865
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,336
Let's go.

866
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:21,853
This must be the place.

867
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:25,648
But it's not here.

868
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,609
-Let's go up farther.
-Okay.

869
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,173
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

870
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,359
Just take my hand.
It's steeper than we thought.

871
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,620
I'm coming. Jeez, you're in great shape.

872
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,829
-We're almost there.
-Right.

873
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,122
Ms. Kang.

874
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,375
-Can we slow down a bit, please?
-It's over there.

875
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,752
Man, I'm dying.

876
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,380
-How on earth are you so fit?
-We're here.

877
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,266
Insect feelers.

878
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,478
It's the insect feeler car.

879
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,523
-Let's check it out.
-Insect feeler car.

880
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,859
-Those are feelers, right?
-Yes.

881
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,451
-It's a camera!
-It is!

882
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,537
-We found him!
-Nice job.

883
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,462
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

884
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,217
I guess it's not him.

885
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,218
Right.

886
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,972
Let's go up and look for him some more.

887
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,320
Be careful. It's slippery.

888
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,282
Watch your step.

889
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:41,742
Be careful.

890
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,538
Come down slowly. Watch your step.

891
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,457
-It's slippery.
-Right.

892
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,961
Thank you.

893
00:52:58,759 --> 00:52:59,760
Watch your step.

894
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,847
Be careful and climb up slowly.

895
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,934
-Hurry. Is it…
-Where?

896
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,228
Is it supposed to be like this?

897
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,522
Let's go this way for now.

898
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,951
There's nothing here.

899
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:25,995
Hold on.

900
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,372
It's already gotten this late.

901
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,957
The sun is about to set.

902
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,126
-We should head back. It's dangerous.
-Right.

903
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,255
-Where are we going?
-Let's go this way.

904
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,885
Ms. Kang, you'll die
if you fall asleep here.

905
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,553
-I won't die.
-Yes, you will.

906
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,848
I think the sun is setting.

907
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,518
-Watch your step here.
-What?

908
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:54,565
It all looks the same,
so I can't tell where we are.

909
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,694
I know, right?
Why does everything look the same?

910
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,363
I think we've been here before.

911
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,032
Does your GPS not work?

912
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:08,788
GPS never works in places like this.

913
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,250
Where are we?

914
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,836
-You must be tired.
-I'm okay.

915
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,215
I'm sure if we go this way…

916
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,883
What's this?

917
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,177
It's raining.

918
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,389
-What should we do?
-Hey, it's raining.

919
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:43,340
Oh, jeez.

920
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,344
Are you okay? I'm okay too.

921
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,181
I think we're going deeper
into the mountain.

922
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,183
Are you sure GPS won't work here?

923
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,187
Actually,

924
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,814
my battery died a while ago.
What about yours?

925
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:02,026
If I still had any battery left,
I'd have called Ah-young ages ago.

926
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,028
I'm not using it because it's dead.

927
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,989
Yes, of course.

928
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,742
Don't worry about it.
We can find our way back.

929
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,328
All paths are connected to each other.

930
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,789
-This isn't the time for bravado.
-Because the Earth is round.

931
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,291
I'm afraid we'll come across
something scary here.

932
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,668
Seriously? Why would you say that?

933
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:54,203
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO HAN SEON-HWA AND
KWAK SI-YANG FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

934
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:39,999
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Right. I forgot I called you.</font></i>

935
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,250
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">You forgot you called me?</font></i>

936
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,378
{\an8}On what basis did you call
the team members here to Gangwon Province?

937
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,006
{\an8}I didn't call you, Ms. Jeon.

938
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,300
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm asking as your ex-ex-ex-wife.</font></i>

939
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,343
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">What's going on between you two?</font></i>

940
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,179
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you sure it's over?</font></i>

941
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,805
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">We didn't even last a season.</font></i>

942
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,432
{\an8}Does the other person think so too?

943
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,101
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">What's wrong with me?</font></i>

944
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,978
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">You found my husband?</font></i>

945
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,646
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">There's nothing we can do but wait.</font></i>

946
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,648
{\an8}We'll just have to wait
and hope for the box to open.

947
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,735
{\an8}What if it opens
and the outcome turns out to be a divorce?

948
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,778
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I think it's too late.</font></i>

949
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,323
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">If I see Mi-rae right now,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I think we'll really get divorced.</font></i>

950
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,658
{\an8}So we're just going to
let them get a divorce?

951
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,578
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Can we pull that off by today?</font></i>

952
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,246
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">And for less than 30,000 won at that?</font></i>

953
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:23,250
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Do you like hanging out with Mr. Noh?</font></i>

954
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,752
{\an8}You seem to be
in desperate need of escape.

955
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,213
{\an8}Can you help me escape?

956
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,798
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">If you want to make a confession,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">go to a priest.</font></i>

957
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,885
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I haven't committed a sin yet,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">so it's not a confession.</font></i>

958
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,595
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">We're not a good match.</font></i>

959
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:38,974
{\an8}It's too slow, rough, and uneven.

960
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,517
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Then I'll take that as you giving up</font></i>

961
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:43,729
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and claim the green one for myself.</font></i>

962
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,112
