1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,500
(The members are suddenly summoned
to a dry sauna.)

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,310
(The Great Escape began
from something SHINDONG said offhandedly.)

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,310
(A game for food before escaping)

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,110
(That's hilarious.)

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,140
Scissors.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,150
(It wouldn't be SUPER JUNIOR
if they played fair.)

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,150
You're dead.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,350
(Desperate struggle for food)

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,950
(Getting more and more intense)

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,990
(Crawling)

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,920
(Fighting spirit)

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,890
(In the end, giving up on food?)

13
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,690
(All because of food,)

14
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,330
(do we really have to go this far?)

15
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,160
(The members fill their stomachs
through games.)

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,270
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

17
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,570
(The real Great Escape begins now.)

18
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,800
So it's real now?

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,210
(Totally exhausted)

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,480
(I'll hold my tongue.)

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,410
The team that memorizes
17 lines first wins...

22
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,750
and can escape immediately.

23
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,180
I'm good at memorizing.

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay, let's go.

25
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,320
(If they succeed,
they can escape right away.)

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,890
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

27
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,920
(A four-to-four team match,
memorize to escape!)

28
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,790
(Each team
randomly assigns orders 1 to 4.)

29
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,130
(Each person memorizes 2 lines out of 17.
Memorize line 17 together.)

30
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,530
(After memorizing,
leave the steam room to give it a try.)

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,210
(Miss even a single word or no answer,
you fail.)

32
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,010
(Which team will escape first?)

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,610
(Team KYUHYUN is drawing their order.)

34
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,620
(Team KYUHYUN, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)

35
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,290
(Team RYEOWOOK draws next.)

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,290
(Team RYEOWOOK, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)

37
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,930
If you're ready,
go inside and start memorizing.

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,300
(Team RYEOWOOK enters the salt sauna.)

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,370
It's way too hot in here.

40
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,610
Wait a second.

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
(The lines are longer than expected.)

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,280
They're
from "Jeongnyeon: The Star is Born."

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,620
(The lines are from the lyrics
of the Changgeuk "Jamyeonggo.")

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,120
(Team KYUHYUN memorizes
in their own styles.)

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,020
(KYUHYUN inputs like an AI.)

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,460
(SIWON calmly memorizes
in the actor mode.)

47
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,600
(EUNHYUK is overly immersed in acting,
appealing emotionally.)

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,770
(Choked up)

49
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,840
Rain is pouring hard.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,940
(SHINDONG's shouting memorization method)

51
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,240
(Staring)

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,840
How do we memorize line 17?

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,710
Uh-heo-ri-ee-hee-heu-huh.

54
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,250
Uh-heo-ri-ee-hee-heu-huh.

55
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,510
Uh-heo-ri-ee-hee-heu-huh.

56
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,680
Let's go with "Uh-heo-ri," pause,
and "ee-hee-heu-huh."

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,850
(Let's practice together.)

58
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,290
Uh-heo-ri ee-hee-heu-huh
uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

59
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,590
(While Team KYUHYUN memorizes together...)

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,030
(They're shooting a variety show.)

61
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,370
(The polar opposite of Team KYUHYUN,
a dry sauna ASMR)

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,310
(YESUNG memorizes by taking a photo
like a Gen Z would.)

63
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,980
Wait, it's too hot.

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Wait, it's too hot.

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,580
(Running out)

66
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,350
It's too hot.

67
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,680
(Escaping sauna alone?)

68
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,020
(Spying?)

69
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,390
(Peekaboo)

70
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,830
(Unbothered by others leaving)

71
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,560
(Someone look at me.)

72
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,670
(Back after only 30 seconds)

73
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,100
It's really hot.

74
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,140
(DONGHAE, the musical actor,
already memorized it all?)

75
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,370
- Do we have to memorize the last line?
- Yes.

76
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,340
(RYEOWOOK's Statue of Liberty)

77
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,550
(Memorizing with his whole body)

78
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,850
(Struggling)

79
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,250
(The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.)

80
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,960
(From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.)

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,160
(Comes in, goes out, comes in)

82
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,130
My nation's fate is pitiful.

83
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,600
(He became the sorrowful lead character.)

84
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,500
The Han Dynasty from above.

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,900
North wind blows like the ground shaking.

86
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,840
(Swaying)

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,740
(He looks familiar somehow.)

88
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,310
(Memorizing in completely different ways)

89
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,880
(Losing it?)

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,390
When I memorize one line,
I forget another.

91
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,720
Focus. Let's go home!

92
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,520
(I memorized everything.)

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,860
(DONGHAE waits by the door ready to go.)

94
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,300
Who is it? That princess of Nakrang.

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,840
The princess of Nakrang,
our enemy who protects Jamyeonggo.

96
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,770
(That line sounds familiar.)

97
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,940
(Familiar lines from an unfamiliar voice)

98
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,250
Are you memorizing lines five and six?

99
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,620
Yes, lines five, six, 13, and 14.

100
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,180
(YESUNG is 3rd, lines 5, 6, 13, 15
DONGHAE is 4th, lines 7, 8, 15, 16)

101
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,520
I memorized the wrong lines.

102
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,320
- Really?
- The wrong lines.

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,060
(DONGHAE memorizes
lines 7, 8, 15, and 16 again.)

104
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,790
My lines are lines 11 and 12, right?

105
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,030
Mine are lines 7, 8, 15, and 16.

106
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,430
I memorized the wrong lines.

107
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,930
(Sweating)

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,240
(Showering in sweat)

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,170
(I just want to get out of here!)

110
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,740
I'll say my lines. Can you check?

111
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,680
Let's check each other.

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,580
North wind rushes like the ground shaking.

113
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
North wind blows like the ground shaking.

114
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,990
Rain is pouring from the east.

115
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,320
How can this be a peaceful era?

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,960
(AI KYUHYUN passes.)

117
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,630
The land of Goguryeo, my country,

118
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,100
ruthlessly trampled by our enemies.

119
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,400
They must pay for what they've done.

120
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,870
No, it's just "pay for it."

121
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,640
(AI KYUHYUN reacts fast
to the wrong line.)

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,610
Yes, I said "must pay."

123
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,910
("Must" is right,
but "for what they've done" is wrong.)

124
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,410
- It's not "pay for what they've done."
- They must pay for it.

125
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,980
- Should we just give it a try?
- Yes.

126
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,850
- Shall we?
- Let's give it a try.

127
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,550
Let's go out and try it.

128
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,680
We'll try.

129
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,350
(Team KYUHYUN's first try)

130
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,590
We'll try.

131
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,190
Hurry up. They're out.

132
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,190
I memorized the wrong lines before.

133
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,170
(Fire under Team RYEOWOOK's feet)

134
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,630
- Let's try.
- It's hot.

135
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,200
Does the first one to go sit here?

136
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,440
(I can't stay in there anymore.)

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,740
Let's just give it a try.

138
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,640
(Team KYUHYUN, Round One)

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,310
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

140
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,950
From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.

141
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,850
My nation's fate is pitiful.

142
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,990
(SIWON got his first line right.)

143
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,220
North wind blows...

144
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,190
North wind blows like...

145
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,430
(He managed to say the line.)

146
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,690
Wrong.

147
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,200
(They even let it slide once.
You fail when you hesitate.)

148
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,230
(Back to memorizing in the sauna)

149
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,630
What was it again?

150
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,300
(Team RYEOWOOK was waiting
for this moment.)

151
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,970
Okay, let's go.

152
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,570
Let's show them.
The first one to go sits there.

153
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,440
(They even gave up screen time...)

154
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,810
(and studied like mad.)

155
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,080
(It's time to show results.)

156
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,980
Just do the acting.

157
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,050
(Team RYEOWOOK, Round One)

158
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,390
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

159
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,430
From the east, the Nakrang sneak in.

160
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,060
Wrong.

161
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,660
(Sneak X, sneaks O)

162
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,070
(Failed just one minute in)

163
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Can't we try again?

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,540
Hold on.

165
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,300
It's "sneaks in."

166
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,340
I said "sneak."

167
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,080
(SIWON is also learning
the line RYEOWOOK got wrong.)

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,310
(SHINDONG was watching them.)

169
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,880
- Should we try again?
- Are they done? Shall we?

170
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,450
(Team KYUHYUN sneaks in.)

171
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,890
It's so hot.

172
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,360
It's cool here.

173
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,560
(Team KYUHYUN, Round Two)

174
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,330
The Han Dynasty bursts...

175
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,030
The Han Dynasty bursts from above?

176
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,370
- Wrong.
- Is that right?

177
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,240
- Wait.
- Wrong.

178
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,700
What are you doing?

179
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,910
Wrong.

180
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,270
What's wrong with you?

181
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,410
I memorized lines 9 and 10. Sorry.

182
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,180
Let's go again. Okay.

183
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,180
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

184
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,820
- That's long.
- Line One is the longest.

185
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,620
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

186
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,720
The east. From the east,
the Nakrang sneaks in.

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,250
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

188
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,890
From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.

189
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,520
The Han Dynasty...

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
(RYEOWOOK is also struggling
in the salt room.)

191
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,230
They messed up.

192
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,970
(Extra!)

193
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,910
(Is RYEOWOOK going back?)

194
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,110
(Let's succeed this time.)

195
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,410
Let's go.

196
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,710
RYEOWOOK, come.

197
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,110
(Team RYEOWOOK, Round Two)

198
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,180
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

199
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,990
From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.

200
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,890
My nation's fate is pitiful.

201
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,830
(He got the first line right.
Will he pass?)

202
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,130
North wind blows like...

203
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,670
Three.

204
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,870
(I won't watch.)

205
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,340
(Eyes shut tight)

206
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,070
Three, two, one. Wrong.

207
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,440
Wait.

208
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,740
- Hey!
- Wait. I'm so close.

209
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,580
(You cannot sleep here.)

210
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,880
You may enter the room again.

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,010
Even I'm starting to forget.

212
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,220
They messed up, too.

213
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,650
(Okay, let's proceed.)

214
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,460
(What?)

215
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,360
(Team RYEOWOOK is here again.)

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,800
No.

217
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,570
(Speedy YESUNG thinks
the first to sit gets the turn.)

218
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,070
You guys already went. We'll try it now.

219
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,400
(Confrontation)

220
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,610
We couldn't even say our lines
because RYEOWOOK kept messing up.

221
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,210
(Whatever)

222
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,710
(The staff decides
to let Team KYUHYUN go first.)

223
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,240
We'll go first this time.

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,180
You can start.

225
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,820
(No more mistakes allowed)

226
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,690
(Will they make it?
SIWON memorized while sweating.)

227
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,250
You can start.

228
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,060
(Team KYUHYUN, Round Three)

229
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,960
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

230
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,390
From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.

231
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,900
My nation's fate is pitiful.

232
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,560
North wind blows like the ground shaking.

233
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,230
Rain is pouring from the east.

234
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,870
How can this be the reign of peace?

235
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,940
(SHINDONG acts and passes.)

236
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,280
Who is it? That princess of Nakrang.

237
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,810
The princess of Nakrang,
our enemy who protects Jamyeonggo.

238
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,150
The land of Goguryeo, my country,
ruthlessly trampled by our enemies.

239
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,650
They must pay for it!

240
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,890
(Team KYUHYUN, the first team
to complete a round successfully)

241
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,490
(I'm amazing.)

242
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,460
I'll sneak into Nakrang,
slash the Jamyeonggo with this sword,

243
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,430
and see the princess's face.

244
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,300
(Team RYEOWOOK getting anxious
because they have only seven lines left.)

245
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,470
Heaven and earth, man and nature,

246
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,440
birds and beasts all have mates.

247
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,670
Wrong.

248
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
(Success?)

249
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,680
(Surprised)

250
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,020
(Beasts X, Land beasts O)

251
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,150
Let's go.

252
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,390
Get out.

253
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,620
(Team RYEOWOOK is frustrated and anxious.)

254
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,260
Okay, let's go now.

255
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,160
Let's do it, RYEOWOOK.

256
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,630
(No more mistakes. Let's go, RYEOWOOK.)

257
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,630
(Team RYEOWOOK, Round Three)

258
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,840
(Let us speak, too.)

259
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
The Han Dynasty...

260
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,180
What was it? Hold on.

261
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,850
(Our RYEOWOOK, again)

262
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,880
Bursts in.

263
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,020
(Running away)

264
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,050
Let me say my line once.

265
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,990
Keep going.

266
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,050
(Stampede)

267
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,890
Get out.

268
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,320
(Revenge from earlier)

269
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,060
I haven't gone even once.

270
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,130
Hold on.

271
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,600
So sorry.

272
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,130
(Staggering)

273
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,540
RYEOWOOK, let's go.

274
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,200
(I'm begging you.)

275
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,510
(Both teams failed Round Four.)

276
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,250
- Sneaks in.
- Sneaks in.

277
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,720
(Both teams also failed Round Five
due to sabotage.)

278
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,550
Please wake up anyone
sleeping in the steam room.

279
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,790
My fate is pitiful.

280
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,320
Wrong. It's "My nation's fate."

281
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,260
- What did I say?
- My fate.

282
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,060
(Except for RYEOWOOK,
nobody has spoken in 20 minutes.)

283
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,330
(RYEOWOOK, the weak line,
memorizing again)

284
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,930
My nation.

285
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,800
My nation.

286
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,040
My nation.

287
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,610
(Why can't you say "my nation" properly?)

288
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,540
(Frustrated, about to cry)

289
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,880
(Team KYUHYUN, Round Six)

290
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,320
(SIWON now reacts reflexively.)

291
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,250
North wind blows like the ground shaking.

292
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,850
Rain...

293
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,150
The land of Goguryeo...

294
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,890
Three, two, one. Wrong.

295
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,790
What was it?

296
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,100
(DONGHAE moves out
with his great acting.)

297
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,900
- Wrong.
- What was it?

298
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,470
(DONGHAE is pouring out his lines.)

299
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,870
They're so noisy.

300
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,640
(Finally, a peace treaty?)

301
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,610
(No way, only dirty games)

302
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,540
(Team RYEOWOOK, Round Six)

303
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,150
Rain is pouring!

304
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,780
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

305
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,090
From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.

306
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,090
My nation's fate is pitiful.

307
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,390
North wind blows like the ground shaking.

308
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,690
(Well done, RYEOWOOK.)

309
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,400
(Finally LEETEUK's turn)

310
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,100
(It'll be our turn soon.)

311
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,870
Rain is...

312
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,500
falling.

313
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,840
Wrong.

314
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,740
(I trusted you.)

315
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,980
(My goodness)

316
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,850
(Starring DONGHAE.
DONGHAE's "Jamyeonggo" solo performance)

317
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,820
They must...

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,990
Hey, get out.

319
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,420
(Are all of them weak lines?
Failing his line, the curtain closes.)

320
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,920
(When will they escape?
It's already Round Seven.)

321
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,190
You may begin.

322
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,330
The Han Dynasty bursts in from above.

323
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,670
From the east, the Nakrang sneaks in.

324
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,870
My nation's fate is pitiful.

325
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,740
North wind blows like the ground shaking.

326
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,740
Rain is pouring from the east.

327
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,080
How can this be the reign of peace?

328
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,180
Who is it? That princess of Nakrang.

329
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,580
The princess of Nakrang,
our enemy who protects Jamyeonggo.

330
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,820
The land of Goguryeo, my country,
ruthlessly trampled by our enemies.

331
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,520
They must pay for it.

332
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,290
(Team KYUHYUN completes
the first round again.)

333
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,590
I'll sneak into Nakrang,
slash the Jamyeonggo with this sword,

334
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,460
and see the princess's face.

335
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,900
Heaven and earth, man and nature,

336
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,270
The land of Goguryeo...

337
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,000
(DONGHAE is here again.)

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,300
That's mean.

339
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,370
Man and nature,

340
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,140
birds and land beasts all have mates.

341
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,480
The meeting of handsome man
and beautiful woman...

342
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,810
Three, two...

343
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,450
(Please fail.)

344
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,160
(Let's go home now.)

345
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Three, two, one.

346
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,460
Is nature's way.

347
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,360
(Chills)

348
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,400
(Emotionless delivery)

349
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,500
Jamyeonggo hanging in the sky,
close your eyes and don't look.

350
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,030
The heart I once tried to offer
to the nation.

351
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,970
(They already reached line 15.
If EUNHYUK succeeds, they escape.)

352
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,610
(Will the final player EUNHYUK succeed?)

353
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,250
My love, my tender one, doong-doong
doong-doong uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

354
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,850
My love, my tender one, doong-doong
doong-doong uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

355
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,880
Two, three.

356
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,620
Uh-heo-ri ee-hee-heu-huh
uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

357
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,360
Ee-hee-heu-huh uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

358
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,990
Ee-hee-heu-huh uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

359
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,400
(Team KYUHYUN succeeds.)

360
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,500
(Roaring SIWON)

361
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,840
Seriously?

362
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,140
Let's go out.

363
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,580
(Team RYEOWOOK didn't even complete
a single round.)

364
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,780
(We're finally going home.)

365
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,190
(Good job, baby.)

366
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,620
(Sweet escape)

367
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,060
(Prince DONGHAE seems
to have a lot to say.)

368
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,430
Give us one chance.

369
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,930
Start the car.

370
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,770
Wait, but this requires acting.

371
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,600
Did you guys just read it or did you act?

372
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,070
We acted.

373
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,110
I said my line
like General Gang Gamchan.

374
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,140
Show us.

375
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,340
Then show us.

376
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,780
- No.
- We didn't get to see it.

377
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,480
You heard our lines. It's done.

378
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,850
We can change now, right?

379
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,090
My love, my tender one,
doong-doong doong-doong,

380
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,090
uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

381
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,960
(Thinking about escape makes him dance.)

382
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,890
The very last line.

383
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,860
Didn't someone mess it up?

384
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,760
No, nobody messed up.

385
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,230
(Perfect success,
nothing can stop them now.)

386
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,700
We memorized that one first.

387
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,200
- We're off.
- Bye.

388
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,140
(Disappear before we stop you.)

389
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,670
Not all the members can go together.

390
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,140
How can this be the reign of peace?

391
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,610
Uh-heo-ri...

392
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,610
ee-hee-heu-huh...

393
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,680
uh-heo-doong-doong my love.

394
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,090
(SIWON, SHINDONG, KYUHYUN,
and EUNHYUK escape the dry sauna.)

395
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,160
This game will allow two people to escape.

396
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,590
It's the Game of Wit.

397
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,530
(Use the four rooms in the sauna.)

398
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,700
(Draw a room at random and go inside.)

399
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,670
(When you hear the whistle,
you must exit within 30 seconds...)

400
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,800
(and ring the bell to earn one point.
Earn three points to escape.)

401
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,970
(If you run into someone else...)

402
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,740
(or fail to ring the bell
within 30 seconds, you're out.)

403
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,240
I hate this.

404
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,080
(They're the same rules
as the Game of Wit with numbers.)

405
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,580
You can choose rooms now.

406
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,150
(YESUN drew a card early.)

407
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,480
The salt room.

408
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,720
(The salt room is farthest
from the table.)

409
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,890
(Worried)

410
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,890
(Among the four rooms,)

411
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,030
(the ice and red clay rooms are closest
to the table with the bell.)

412
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,330
(The comic and salt rooms are farther.)

413
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,730
(Which room will RYEOWOOK get?)

414
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,140
(The ice room close to the bell)

415
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,970
(LEETEUK chooses the red clay room.)

416
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,910
(DONGHAE gets the last remaining,
the comic room.)

417
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,910
(DONGHAE, RYEOWOOK, LEETEUK, YESUNG)

418
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,580
Go into your rooms.

419
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,020
But I have no wit.

420
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,250
My room is too far.

421
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,660
(The members head to their rooms
feeling anxious.)

422
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,520
It's freezing in there.

423
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,730
Then switch with me, RYEOWOOK.

424
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,560
No, that room is too far.

425
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
(Failed to switch rooms)

426
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,630
(YESUNG enters the salt room.)

427
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,030
It's so hot.

428
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,900
(All four have entered.)

429
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,170
You're working hard.

430
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,910
What should I do?

431
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,840
What do you think is best?

432
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,510
(Grabbing at straws)

433
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,520
(Someone give me the right answer.)

434
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,080
At the beginning,

435
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,220
I'm sure someone will get caught...

436
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,720
trying to go out first.

437
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,360
So I'll go out a little late.

438
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,460
I'm sure someone won't come out
right at the start.

439
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,630
They'll hesitate.

440
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,800
(He thinks nobody will come out at first.)

441
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,970
So I'll go out the moment it starts.

442
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,400
It's a gamble.

443
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,770
Life is a gamble.

444
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,370
I'm going out immediately.

445
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,210
This game is all about speed.

446
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,080
People are trying
to strategize right now...

447
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,610
thinking about when to go out.

448
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,110
I'm going out as soon as I hear the sound.

449
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,450
(The one who waits)

450
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,590
(vs. The one who tries to leave first)

451
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,550
I'm going out no matter what.

452
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,820
(What will happen in Round One?)

453
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,290
Let's begin the game.

454
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,560
(Game of Wit Round One)

455
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,000
(The two adventurous players are out.)

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,140
(And...)

457
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,970
(DONGHAE bolts right out?)

458
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,040
(Why is DONGHAE here?)

459
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,980
I think not going out at all
might work better.

460
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,620
Or should I try going out first?

461
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,950
(He changed his mind after thinking hard.)

462
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,060
(So DONGHAE dashed out
the moment the game started.)

463
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,030
(And just like that,
three adventurers are out.)

464
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,630
(But...)

465
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,630
Why'd you come out so fast?

466
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,100
I should've waited a bit.

467
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,040
(Dispirited)

468
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,740
(Wait, does this mean...)

469
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,970
Should I go?

470
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,340
(Slowly)

471
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,680
(RYEOWOOK remains.)

472
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,350
(Confused)

473
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,390
(Ring)

474
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,560
Did I make it?

475
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,330
(RYEOWOOK rings the bell
with 3 seconds left.)

476
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,130
(Round One, RYEOWOOK succeeds.)

477
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,170
Why is everyone so impatient?

478
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
(It's okay, there are still chances.)

479
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,440
(He needs two more points to escape.)

480
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,900
Let's go back inside.

481
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,440
Why is everyone so simple-minded?

482
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,980
(Look who's talking.)

483
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,410
I knew it.
Three people rushed out instantly.

484
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,820
(Win or lose, let's go.)

485
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,490
This time, someone will expect no one
to come out right away,

486
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,890
so he'll leave his room.

487
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,760
Will everyone think like me?

488
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,060
No.

489
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,530
(Work, brain.)

490
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,230
What should I do?
Should I just go out right away?

491
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,040
(Everyone is overthinking now.)

492
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,370
This is a real game of wit.

493
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,970
Let's begin Round Two.

494
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,210
(Who will succeed this time?)

495
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,480
(DONGHAE dashes out right away
just like Round One.)

496
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,150
(Will he succeed?)

497
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,090
(No one else came out.)

498
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,920
(I'm going out of here.)

499
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,390
(He earned one point.)

500
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,060
(Too late)

501
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,230
(Swearing because he lost)

502
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,870
I'll just ring the bell.

503
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,730
What happened?

504
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,740
(DONGHAE and RYEOWOOK
have one point each.)

505
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,170
Coming out first might be better.

506
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,970
You never know with this game.

507
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,710
(Already exhausted)

508
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,280
Let's keep going.

509
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,680
(Okay, bye)

510
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,080
What do I do?

511
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,350
(Worried he might never make it out)

512
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,550
I'm so tired.

513
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,860
(Who will win this round?)

514
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,870
(What's this?)

515
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,340
(He's out
when the game hasn't even started.)

516
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,140
What?

517
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,780
(Who's there?)

518
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,410
What are you guys doing? Get back inside.

519
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,650
- What are you doing?
- What?

520
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,850
- What was that?
- I thought I heard the whistle.

521
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,520
I think I'm hearing tinnitus.

522
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,190
(Grab hold of reality and go back inside.)

523
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,390
Wait a second.

524
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,190
Are you going to run out right away?

525
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,000
I have an impulse to run out.

526
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,900
I have to run out right away.

527
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,000
One of us has to come out to block him.

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,370
You should come out.
If you don't, he'll get two points.

529
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,000
So you have to come out no matter what.

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,570
LEETEUK, then you should block DONGHAE.

531
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,040
Then you'll get one point, so no.
RYEOWOOK has to do it.

532
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,240
(Dumbfounded)

533
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,180
(It's a plan to steal the point.)

534
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,050
Then I'll skip this round.

535
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,580
- Are you going to stay in?
- No, but I'll come out later.

536
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,620
I'm sorry, but this is a solo game anyway.

537
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,220
Why are we even planning together?
This isn't a team game.

538
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I'll come out after ten seconds.

539
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,960
- Okay.
- You're not going to keep your promise.

540
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,590
- I promise. Ten seconds.
- I'm going to run out right away.

541
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,530
Then I'll come out after 15 seconds.

542
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,100
Fifteen, okay. YESUNG...

543
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,370
(YESUNG got tired and left.)

544
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,200
Then you can come out first.

545
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
- You can go first this time.
- Okay.

546
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,540
(Planning to tease YESUNG)

547
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,480
(I'm watching.)

548
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,940
What? Don't come out.

549
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,880
Was he there the whole time?

550
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,880
(Unintentionally transparent)

551
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,980
Go with that plan.

552
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,990
I thought you were in your room.

553
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,650
You can go with that plan.

554
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,320
YESUNG,
are you going to come out right away?

555
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,830
- I don't know.
- You have to tell me.

556
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,890
- I'm not sure.
- You have to say it.

557
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,600
I'll just go with the flow.

558
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,800
(Let me live my life, don't stop me.)

559
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,970
(He never listens.)

560
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,470
LEETEUK, let's try it.

561
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,770
Let's do it.

562
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,310
Help me win this round.

563
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,540
(Trust us.)

564
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,640
(I'll trust you guys.)

565
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,580
(Game of Wit Round Three)

566
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
I'll come out after ten seconds.

567
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,220
Then I'll come out after 15 seconds.

568
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,920
(If YESUNG stays inside,
LEETEUK is expected to win this round.)

569
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,560
(What will happen in this round?)

570
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,060
(Sorry, LEETEUK. DONGHAE can never stop.)

571
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,530
(Success?)

572
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,940
(Rings the bell)

573
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,410
(LEETEUK is too slow again.)

574
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,770
What was that?

575
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,880
(Is it over?)

576
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Why didn't you keep your promise?

577
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,480
You promised not to come out.

578
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,820
When I hear a whistle, I have to dash out.

579
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,620
(I just want to go home.)

580
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,850
YESUNG, come here.

581
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,760
(Current score DONGHAE 2, RYEOWOOK 1)

582
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,230
(Just one more point
for DONGHAE to escape)

583
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,060
You were running like a stork.

584
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,830
LEETEUK.

585
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,200
I'll come out first this time.

586
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,500
You come after me.

587
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,870
If I don't come out, he gets the point.

588
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,640
He'll definitely come out.

589
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,770
Yes, he will.

590
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,370
- I will definitely stay inside this time.
- No, you should come out.

591
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,940
I'm definitely not coming out this time.

592
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,740
- Come out no matter what.
- I'll stay in no matter what.

593
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,580
(When will this end?)

594
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,110
(Checking again)

595
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,180
Can you bet everything?

596
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm sincerely not coming out this time.

597
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,390
- Sincerely?
- Sincerely.

598
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,620
(Going back to their rooms)

599
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,720
(It's finally over.)

600
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,630
Should I come out or not?

601
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,430
(Back to their rooms with worries)

602
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,530
(Game of Wit Round Four)

603
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,400
(What will happen this time?)

604
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,840
(LEETEUK and DONGHAE are out.)

605
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,410
(I knew it.)

606
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,680
I'll block you.

607
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,580
I'll block you.

608
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,920
(YESUNG and RYEOWOOK are out.)

609
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,380
(All four are out.)

610
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,620
You two are out.

611
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,350
Us too? Really?

612
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,990
I knew it. I know DONGHAE.

613
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,690
(Pavlov's DONGHAE)

614
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,560
I knew he'd come out,
so I came out as well.

615
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,100
If I hadn't come out,
the game would be over.

616
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
No.

617
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,200
- You guys have to trust me.
- He may not have come out,

618
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,470
- so you came to earn a point.
- No, I knew he'd definitely come out.

619
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,900
He always comes out.
He'll come out in the next round again.

620
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,800
You're right.

621
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm coming out in the next round, too.

622
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,470
I don't have to go home.

623
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,970
(One goal)

624
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,980
I'll target only one person.

625
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,480
Call me "Mad Dog" today.

626
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,350
(Scared)

627
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,310
The camera director told me to go out.

628
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,580
(Puzzled camera director)

629
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,650
Even the directors can't go home.

630
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,350
- I'll stay in.
- Even the directors can't go home.

631
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,590
- I'll stay in this time.
- I know you won't.

632
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,590
I'll let you earn a point this time.

633
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,690
Okay. Are you going to come out?

634
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
I don't know. I'm just playing this game.

635
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,690
I'm targeting only him.

636
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,200
(Who will win this time?)

637
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,100
(Thinking)

638
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,040
I'll stay in this time.

639
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,040
I'm going out this time, too.

640
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,710
(Game of Wit Round Five)

641
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,280
(Quiet)

642
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,290
(LEETEUK and YESUNG are out.)

643
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,560
(Disappointed)

644
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,230
(Is everyone out?)

645
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,990
(Will he succeed?)

646
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,860
What happened?

647
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,160
Ring the bell. You won.

648
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Really?

649
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,670
He didn't come out for real.

650
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,640
(DONGHAE kept his word.)

651
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Who won?

652
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,040
- You?
- RYEOWOOK, you can go home.

653
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,210
You can go home.

654
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,510
You can go home.

655
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,680
I told you I'd stay in this time.

656
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,910
But YESUNG came out.

657
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,480
- Did he ring the bell?
- So both of them were out.

658
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,350
I rang the bell.

659
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,520
(Regretful)

660
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,680
Are you coming out this time?

661
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,250
LEETEUK, I'll stay in this time.

662
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,550
You're staying in? I'm coming out.

663
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,920
- You're coming out, right?
- I'm not.

664
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,490
- I know you are.
- I promise.

665
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm definitely staying in.

666
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,230
Please prepare a pillow and blanket
for me.

667
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,530
LEETEUK, I'll stay in this time.

668
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,600
- I'm definitely coming out.
- Okay, you come out.

669
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,570
Okay. Let's go.
RYEOWOOK, are you coming out right away?

670
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,370
- After five seconds.
- Five seconds?

671
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
One of you should definitely come out.

672
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,910
(You two should leave, at least.)

673
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,010
Okay.

674
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,750
(DONGHAE and RYEOWOOK are
currently tied with two points.)

675
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,650
(Will one of them get to escape
this time?)

676
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,660
(Game of Wit Round Six)

677
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,160
(LEETEUK, YESUNG, and DONGHAE are out.)

678
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,600
(Then what about RYEOWOOK?)

679
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,170
(RYEOWOOK waited five seconds as he said.)

680
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,700
Wait, what?

681
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,670
(RYEOWOOK succeeded by keeping his word.)

682
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,610
What happened?

683
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,040
All of us are out.

684
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,710
You three were already out.

685
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,380
(RYEOWOOK was naturally left alone,
so he succeeded.)

686
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,750
(The first escapee)

687
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,990
But this rule is a bit weird.

688
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,020
- We should go again.
- We should do it again.

689
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,820
We should do it again.

690
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,160
(Trying to argue)

691
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,430
(No exceptions, Round Seven)

692
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,560
YESUNG.

693
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,030
Stay in. I'll definitely come out.

694
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,530
I'm blocking him no matter what.

695
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,560
LEETEUK, do you hate me?

696
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,700
No.

697
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,030
You have two points.
Let's give YESUNG one point.

698
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,940
But that strategy is...

699
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,770
actually a plan to climb up himself.

700
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,940
(The strategy king of this area)

701
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,110
(Now only three people are left.)

702
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,020
(Will they block DONGHAE
who is close to escaping...)

703
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,650
(and create a new atmosphere?)

704
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,490
(Someone ran out.)

705
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,000
(LEETEUK out to catch DONGHAE)

706
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,370
(Is DONGHAE out? Or did LEETEUK score?)

707
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,480
(Why are you here?)

708
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,110
(If this happens...)

709
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,290
(Leisurely)

710
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,990
(DONGHAE succeeds in the Game of Wit.)

711
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,160
Let's go.

712
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,630
YESUNG, you should've listened to me.

713
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,300
(It's a beautiful night.)

714
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,500
We have the next escapees now.

715
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,570
(Second escapees, DONGHAE and RYEOWOOK)

716
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,470
Thank you.

717
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,940
I'll see you at the next shoot.

718
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,310
Thank you.

719
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,080
Only two of you are left.

720
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,750
One of you can't go home...

721
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,550
until the production team leaves.

722
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,050
A very tough going-home mission awaits.

723
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
The final game is Sticky Coin Fishing.

724
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,760
(Toss the sticky pad
to get the coin on the table.)

725
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,500
(The one who brings it faster wins.)

726
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,300
Let's each say a word of determination.

727
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,670
I really hope YESUNG wins.

728
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,870
I hope you win.

729
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,800
Okay, then I'll win.

730
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,070
Then don't do anything. I'll play.

731
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,910
(Nobody can stop him.)

732
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,110
Let's do it.

733
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,410
Then let's start the final game
that will decide the fate.

734
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,410
Ready...

735
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:55,350
(Will you stay, or will you leave?)

736
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,360
Ready...

737
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,520
(What's the result?)

738
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,420
You can go first.

739
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,360
(LEETEUK's sticky pad slightly missed.)

740
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,300
(YESUNG's sticky pad touched the coin.)

741
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,370
(Will he go home now?)

742
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,940
(But the sticky pad falls off.)

743
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,670
(That was close.)

744
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,110
(It stuck!)

745
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,610
(LEETEUK's sticky pad lands on the coin.)

746
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,520
(Will he end the game in one go?)

747
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,950
(That actually happened.)

748
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,690
(Is this...)

749
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,430
(real?)

750
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,630
(YESUNG protests after hearing
he has to do the going-home mission.)

751
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,930
It's over.

752
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,830
(This can't be real.)

753
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,570
Thank you, everyone.

754
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,470
Good job.

755
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
It's over.

756
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,110
YESUNG,
you have to do the closing comment.

757
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,580
You didn't get enough screen time.
Do it again.

758
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,550
It's just a game.
Don't take it personally.

759
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,050
- LEETEUK.
- I'll clap the slate.

760
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,120
- LEETEUK.
- One, two, three.

761
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,380
- LEETEUK.
- One, two, three.

762
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,390
(The end)

763
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,160
What's the tough penalty?

764
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,390
You have to sort the recycling.

765
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,760
(Spots it)

766
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,360
They left a mess.

767
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,460
(The trash left behind by SUPER JUNIOR)

768
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,570
(So much of it)

769
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,910
I want to go home, too.

770
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,850
I hope the next life
lets me go home early.

771
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,660
(SHINDONG enjoying a nap
after a long time)

772
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,160
This is...

773
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,930
my room.

774
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
Who is it?

775
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,740
SHINDONG.

776
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,010
(Open the door.)

777
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,280
(Deep sigh)

778
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,110
It'd be fun
if we all visited each other's homes.

779
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,950
Of all places, my house?

780
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,990
They knew I moved somehow and came.

781
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,790
I hope they brought housewarming gifts.

782
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,960
- We have to knock.
- Open the door.

783
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,260
<i>Open the door</i>

784
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,500
- Isn't it broken?
- SHINDONG.

785
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm coming.

786
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,340
(Woke up to SHINDONG's housewarming)

787
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,310
(Now that 20 years have passed,
we can finally talk.)

788
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,210
(From the Incheon Battle Fight backstory)

789
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,440
I have nothing to say to you.

790
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,410
(Unfinished fight?)

791
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,250
That's why I left.

792
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,150
(Housewarming storytelling time begins.)

793
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,120
(It's never a normal gathering
when SUPER JUNIOR meets.)

794
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
He's crazy. What is he doing?

795
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,090
Two, three.

796
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,250
Wrong.

797
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,790
- Wrong.
- Elon Musk.

798
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,990
Hey!

799
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,490
(Chaos)

800
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,330
(Why are they going this far?)

801
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,270
(Welcome to SHINDONG's house.)

802
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,370
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

803
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,870
(SUPER JUNIOR arrived
at SHINDONG's housewarming.)

804
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,070
You came empty-handed?

805
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,610
I knew you'd bring something.

806
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,010
Good job.
You bought it on behalf of everyone.

807
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,480
This is expensive.

808
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,280
- What's this?
- DONGHAE didn't come empty-handed.

809
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I brought coffee.

810
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,380
SHINDONG likes coffee.

811
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,120
SHINDONG, here is coffee for you.

812
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,420
This bell is different.

813
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,720
- We have to knock.
- Open the door.

814
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,950
<i>Open the door</i>

815
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,360
- Isn't it broken?
- SHINDONG.

816
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,190
They're ringing too many times.

817
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,860
Stop ringing the bell.

818
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,030
(I'm coming, you guys.)

819
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,200
You guys rang the bell too many times.

820
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,470
You guys rang the bell too many times.

821
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,800
Stop ringing it.

822
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,440
We couldn't hear the ring.

823
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,970
It rings on my phone.

824
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,610
(They couldn't hear the bell outside.)

825
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,570
Stop ringing it.

826
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,410
Welcome to my house.

827
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,410
What's that?

828
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,380
(A cool artwork right at the entrance)

829
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,720
- Take a look at the painting first.
- Someone scribbled on that painting.

830
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,820
It's a painting by artist Vivora.

831
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,720
- Who?
- Vivora.

832
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,350
Vora.

833
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,120
- Is that a Korean artist?
- Yes.

834
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,490
(Already noisy at the entrance)

835
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,630
Pick slippers in the color you like.

836
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,830
- Is this a model house?
- Your house is amazing.

837
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,400
It looks like a studio.

838
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,570
(Past the clean white-toned hallway)

839
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,140
I went for a mid-century modern feel
this time.

840
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,180
(Mid-century modern-styled living room)

841
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:18,450
(Stylish and modern new house
showing SHINDONG's taste)

842
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,120
Isn't this our old dorm building?

843
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,520
(SHINDONG remodeled his house that has
the same layout as their former dorm.)

844
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,920
- Is where the computer was, right?
- Yes.

845
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,160
(A space that brings back old memories...)

846
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:40,739
(filled with joy and laughter)

847
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,110
I'll show you my dressing room first.

848
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,270
Dressing room.

849
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,240
(What does
SHINDONG's dressing room look like?)

850
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,420
(Immediately visible
when you open the door)

851
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,720
(Display cases of various accessories)

852
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,420
What's that?

853
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,260
- Shoe care machine.
- The dressing room is huge.

854
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,290
Do you wear these or not?

855
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,230
I do. It moves when it spots a person.

856
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,260
What's this?

857
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,400
(When everyone is focused
on the shoe care machine...)

858
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,230
You have to open it the other way.

859
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,230
What's this?

860
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,240
(Falling)

861
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,940
(LEETEUK made SHINDONG's hat fall.)

862
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,470
That fell.

863
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,280
(SHINDONG notices immediately.)

864
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,610
- LEETEUK.
- Sorry.

865
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,580
(Asking a question
right after he hung it again)

866
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,710
Do you not use those stickers?

867
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,650
Where? I use them all.

868
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,690
(So chaotic)

869
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,820
Take a look inside as well.

870
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,090
You have more hats, don't you?

871
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,420
I do.

872
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,890
Behind here.

873
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,460
(Hat lover SHINDONG)

874
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,900
But do all these fit you?

875
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,800
Only the ones that fit.

876
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,170
(He only wears those that fit?)

877
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,710
You'll be surprised when you try them on.
They're big sizes.

878
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,370
They're huge.

879
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,480
Don't you have anything to throw away?
I'll use it as pajamas.

880
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,240
SHINDONG's house is nice.

881
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,410
(Housewarming is fun.)

882
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,380
(Neatly hung clothes)

883
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
Let's move to the next room.

884
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,450
SHINDONG is really tidy.

885
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,490
Next is the computer room.

886
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,620
(Revealing SHINDONG's studio)

887
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,430
It's your studio.

888
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,090
My room used to be here.

889
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,430
(A place where SHINDONG
creates various content)

890
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,230
This is just like the room
you and I used to share.

891
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,230
Yes.

892
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,270
My bed was here,
and your bed was over there.

893
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,270
It's so nice.

894
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,070
What's this?

895
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,170
SHINDONG, what is this?

896
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,210
Are these all monitors?

897
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,510
I use them for video editing.

898
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,340
(SHINDONG's studio equipped
with cutting-edge equipment)

899
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,250
This seems to be a desk lamp.

900
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,150
What's that red light in the back?
Ambient lighting?

901
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,250
It's a lamp.

902
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,120
You can use it with your phone, too.

903
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,190
Or with a remote control.

904
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,420
What's over there?

905
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,390
I just put some stuff inside.

906
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,130
Is SHINDONG's girlfriend in there?

907
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,360
- Who's there?
- Nobody.

908
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,490
Wait, there's something in there.

909
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,800
Let me show you
something really important.

910
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,200
I have this.

911
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,900
(What is SHINDONG's hidden treasure?)

912
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,970
Pacquiao's autograph.

913
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,400
(Gloves signed personally by Pacquiao)

914
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,310
- Can you give me just one? I'm a big fan.
- We need both gloves for boxing.

915
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,510
(You need both hands for boxing.)

916
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,740
(Kind of jealous)

917
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,210
You should display this outside.

918
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,580
(You don't know how to decorate a house.)

919
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,320
No, I have other plans for this.

920
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,920
(Respectfully stored
and move on to the next room)

921
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,820
(Revealing SHINDONG's master bedroom)

922
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,890
From the bathroom...

923
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,630
It's rare to see a painting
in SHINDONG's room.

924
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,760
I like playing golf,

925
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
so the artist drew this for me.

926
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,930
- Who?
- FatDoo.

927
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,200
(A cozy master bedroom
decorated with cute props)

928
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,940
(Welcome to the master bedroom.)

929
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,970
Do you want to check out the bedroom?

930
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,410
It's nicely done in an antique style.

931
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,910
Nice, right?

932
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,480
Is this a bed or a playground?

933
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Wait a minute.

934
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,820
That catches the eye.

935
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,820
Look at that. Can I sit on it?

936
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,220
It's a massage chair.

937
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,050
The design is so pretty.

938
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,120
Other massage chairs are...

939
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,060
Is this a massage chair?

940
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,460
You have to lean back.

941
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,560
(Massage chair test zone)

942
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,430
There are way more features than expected.

943
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,900
It's nice that it reclines.

944
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,300
It has various intensities and speeds.

945
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,770
It has heating, and Bluetooth
to connect to the speaker.

946
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,310
(A massage chair
packed with diverse features)

947
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,410
(So good)

948
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,340
(So good)

949
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,540
When I sit here, the curtains close...

950
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,280
and the TV turns on.

951
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,750
- It can do all that.
- How long are you going to use this?

952
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,750
For life.

953
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,990
What are you even talking about?

954
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,390
I just bought it.

955
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,820
I just moved in recently.

956
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,190
You guys should've brought
a housewarming gift.

957
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,030
LEETEUK is really enjoying himself.

958
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,290
- Isn't it nice?
- It feels like a person is massaging me.

959
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,830
- It's better than expected, right?
- Absolutely.

960
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,070
(DONGHAE gives it a try, too.)

961
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,030
Let me just feel the seat.

962
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,030
I'll see how comfortable it is.

963
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,270
It's comfortable.
Just lie all the way back.

964
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,170
(A perfect blend of massage function
and stylish interior design)

965
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,440
Let's move out.

966
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,040
This blanket...

967
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,110
- Isn't it great?
- It's so good.

968
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,280
This blanket is amazing. I only use this.

969
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
This is really good.

970
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,920
- It's so soft.
- Who's that?

971
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,350
Who is it?

972
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,750
(HEECHUL is here.)

973
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,120
HEECHUL.

974
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,790
Open the door, please.

975
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,860
Welcome. Why are you so late?

976
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,990
I had to work.

977
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,460
Do you remember our old dorm?

978
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,430
Yes. This house is amazing.

979
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,670
It's totally different from our old dorm.

980
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,800
Back then, we didn't live like this.

981
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,270
- Take a seat.
- But SHINDONG,

982
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,310
did you order food?

983
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,670
- Yes.
- I'm hungry.

984
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,080
Take a seat. I ordered food.

985
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,740
Sit down now. Let's eat.

986
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,350
- Sit.
- What did you order?

987
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,350
The food is here.

988
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,750
Housewarming picture. One, two.

989
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,550
(You can't resist taking a picture
at a housewarming.)

990
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,620
(Cheese)

991
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,460
(Guys, the food is here.)

992
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,300
SHINDONG, the interior design is insane.

993
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,270
LEETEUK, DONGHAE, RYEOWOOK,
and I lived on the 12th floor.

994
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,140
It's so different from back then.

995
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,270
The bed is huge.

996
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,440
He combined two.

997
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,780
I have to take a picture of this.

998
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,380
(Good things should be shared.)

999
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,920
(Continually impressed
by the stylish interior design)

1000
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Amazing.

1001
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,430
(The highlight of a housewarming,
delivery food)

1002
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,360
Should I serve you some over there?

1003
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,400
Have some.

1004
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,630
I ordered a bunch of things
I thought you guys would like.

1005
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,500
It's delicious.

1006
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,640
This is exactly the kind of taste
LEETEUK would love.

1007
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,840
(Tasty)

1008
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,680
(Big bite)

1009
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,350
SHINDONG, is that a single portion?

1010
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,350
Yes.

1011
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,150
I ordered it for myself.

1012
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,050
Really? I thought we were sharing.

1013
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,050
It's one per person.

1014
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,360
This place is totally different
from the place we used to live in.

1015
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,917
Exactly.

1016
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:34,390
It's the same as the dorm
we used to live in.

1017
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,830
It feels totally different.

1018
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,960
Back when we lived together,

1019
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,200
I used to wonder how life would turn out.

1020
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,400
Now, seeing how everyone bought...

1021
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,030
their own homes...

1022
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,640
- It's cool.
- Honestly,

1023
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,470
do any of you miss
living together sometimes?

1024
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,480
Nope.

1025
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,340
You're cold.
I asked because I kind of miss it.

1026
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,780
Sometimes I miss the days
when we lived together.

1027
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,180
When I first lived alone,
I used to hear things.

1028
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,850
I missed those old days before.

1029
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,090
- The vibe when we were young back then.
- It was so much fun.

1030
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,160
All the memories we had back then...

1031
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,060
I'm sorry,

1032
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,890
but we five lived together for real.

1033
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,030
RYEOWOOK and I shared a room.

1034
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,030
The member you lived with isn't here.

1035
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,260
Didn't you live with EUNHYUK?

1036
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,170
I lived on both floors.

1037
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,170
I'd go upstairs and downstairs.

1038
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,800
(RYEOWOOK lived on both floors?)

1039
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,880
(The dorm on the 11th floor,
and the 12th floor)

1040
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,080
Because you two fought,

1041
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,380
I remember I went to live on both floors.

1042
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,750
We shared a room.

1043
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,750
- Or maybe not?
- I shared a room with him.

1044
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,150
HEECHUL and I always shared a room.

1045
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,550
Anyway, someone fought.

1046
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,450
- In the beginning, no.
- Rather than a fight,

1047
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,990
they just assigned people
who seemed like they'd get along.

1048
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,690
Because I...

1049
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,360
just said, "Don't make me share a room..."

1050
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,690
"with YESUNG."

1051
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,960
- Why?
- That's why I had to live with him.

1052
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,830
(RYEOWOOK suffered
because of the older members.)

1053
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,640
(RYEOWOOK went through a lot.)

1054
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,370
When HEECHUL and I shared a room,

1055
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,510
there was a bathroom over there.

1056
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,010
Whether I was on the phone or HEECHUL was,

1057
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,850
you could hear the entire phone call
from inside the room.

1058
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,250
Whenever LEETEUK had an argument,
we could hear it all the way downstairs.

1059
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,220
There was a small wooden door
between the bedroom and the bathroom.

1060
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,320
After going to the bathroom,

1061
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,660
when I tried to go back in the room,

1062
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,330
when I heard "So what?"
and LEETEUK arguing,

1063
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:18,100
I'd be standing in front of the door
like this.

1064
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,830
- Checking when to go back in.
- "When's this call going to end?"

1065
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,370
"When's this call going to end?"

1066
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,730
(Nostalgia hitting hard)

1067
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:24,770
It was fun back then.

1068
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,970
I can't tell stories here.

1069
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,970
My seat...

1070
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,110
You have a bad habit.

1071
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,710
Why do you get up when you're talking?

1072
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,310
- You should talk sitting down.
- It's a habit.

1073
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,880
I'm used to always facing the public,
the viewers.

1074
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,120
This was after the Incheon Battle
with LEETEUK.

1075
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,860
After the fight,
it was awkward living together.

1076
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,490
We even shared the same room.

1077
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,960
After washing up,

1078
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,200
I said "LEETEUK, we need to talk."

1079
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,700
"I have nothing to say to you."

1080
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,900
He was cold.

1081
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,070
- That's how he is.
- I was going to make up right away.

1082
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,740
(Don't you know LEETEUK by now?)

1083
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,900
Stand up and talk here.

1084
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,840
(DONGHAE wants to talk.)

1085
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,280
No.

1086
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,550
(He just said one thing...)

1087
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,620
(and ended up in the talking spot.)

1088
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,520
What about LEETEUK?

1089
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,990
- What about him?
- When LEETEUK...

1090
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,260
gets sulky...

1091
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,190
(What was scary about LEETEUK back then?)

1092
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,290
This was the scariest part.

1093
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,730
He said "Whatever."

1094
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,460
- Right.
- He doesn't talk much?

1095
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,500
"Do whatever you want."

1096
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,430
That's the worst.

1097
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,870
Why were you like that?

1098
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,440
That's exactly the kind
of attitude women hate these days.

1099
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,470
YESUNG, what did you say? Stand up.

1100
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,240
(Hyenas have found their prey.)

1101
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,540
- Talk standing up.
- It was nothing.

1102
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,610
Stand up and say it.

1103
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,510
(Kicked to the talking spot)

1104
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,420
What were you saying, YESUNG?

1105
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,390
He's not like this anymore
because he's mature now.

1106
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,190
- So he's changed.
- When we give him the stage...

1107
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,960
(Kicking him)

1108
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,360
(I said I wasn't going to do this.)

1109
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,060
So many celebrities live here.

1110
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,360
Choi Hong Man also lives
in this neighborhood.

1111
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,270
I'm close with him.

1112
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,970
It was when I used to drive.

1113
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,000
When I drove my sedan,

1114
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,940
I'd be in the driver's seat...

1115
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,040
and let him sit in the passenger seat
reclined all the way back.

1116
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,310
Choi Hong Man would sit like this.

1117
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,910
So I asked him "Isn't it uncomfortable?"

1118
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,280
"Don't worry about me. Just drive."

1119
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,420
- Impression.
- That was an impression session.

1120
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,480
(Showing off impression)

1121
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,690
- You get 100 points.
- That was good, right?

1122
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,790
I have so many memories of our old dorm.

1123
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,430
It's too bad SIWON didn't live
in the dorm much.

1124
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,400
I remember when SIWON moved in
with just a blanket and a pillow.

1125
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,830
I remember when SIWON first came
into the dorm,

1126
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,070
we said "This is our dorm."

1127
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,300
And he said
"So one member lives in each house?"

1128
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,870
Yes, he really said that.

1129
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:41,840
For real.

1130
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,210
Stop lying.

1131
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,610
That makes no sense.

1132
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,840
He actually said that.

1133
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,550
- No way.
- "But HEECHUL..."

1134
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,220
I said "LEETEUK, DONGHAE,
RYEOWOOK, and I live here."

1135
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,120
He actually said that.

1136
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,480
"Four people live here?"

1137
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,950
- Here.
- It's true.

1138
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,490
He thought it was one person per house?

1139
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,460
He's spicing up the story.

1140
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,160
No, he actually said that.

1141
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,230
When we were getting into the van,
SIWON said,

1142
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
"Isn't it one person per van?"

1143
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,300
(Young and rich SIWON's joke)

1144
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,270
Don't twist the story.

1145
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,010
(This is hilarious.)

1146
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,610
SIWON barely lived in the dorm back then.

1147
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,240
So the manager said,

1148
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,150
"Just live here for a month."

1149
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,320
So SIWON came.

1150
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,690
Back then, we didn't even know
what exfoliating cream was.

1151
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,490
We had no clue
what moisturizing cream was.

1152
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,960
But the bathroom was
suddenly filled up with skincare products.

1153
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,930
SIWON basically did
living in the jungle for a month...

1154
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,330
at the dorm.

1155
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,860
But those products lasted barely a week.

1156
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,670
A week? It didn't even last three days.

1157
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,730
When SIWON was sleeping,
we'd apply his nice stuff.

1158
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,410
No, I'd go out for a shoot
and come back to find it empty.

1159
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,810
I remember that.

1160
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,810
When I woke up in the morning,
it'd be empty.

1161
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,340
The main culprit was probably DONGHAE.

1162
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,010
To DONGHAE, everything was ours.

1163
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,720
No, it started with LEETEUK.

1164
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,050
No.

1165
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,580
I don't use other people's stuff.

1166
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,620
LEETEUK...

1167
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,790
- YESUNG.
- I don't use other people's stuff.

1168
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,990
You two sure know
how to package yourselves.

1169
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,090
You used too much of it.

1170
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,460
(Sniper RYEOWOOK targeting LEETEUK is
on the hunt today.)

1171
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,400
I just got swept up in the moment.

1172
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,830
I was manipulated.

1173
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,930
(I'll just eat some pizza.)

1174
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,830
SIWON thinks the pizza crust is a handle.

1175
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,840
(Is pizza dough just a handle for him?)

1176
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,440
- The crust is the best part.
- Same with fried chicken.

1177
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,340
When we ate all the meat,

1178
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,840
he'd be like
"Isn't the skin the only edible part?"

1179
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,110
(Young and rich)

1180
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,780
SIWON, HEECHUL,
and I shared the master bedroom.

1181
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,890
I remember...

1182
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,060
how HEECHUL kicked you
when you crossed his sleeping line.

1183
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,960
So one time,

1184
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,590
I was moving around while sleeping,

1185
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,960
and HEECHUL kicked me and I fell off.

1186
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,130
SIWON was affectionate
with the older members.

1187
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,600
When you're sleeping like this...

1188
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,740
I used to sleep on the side near the wall.

1189
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,570
Let's say you're me.

1190
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,970
When I was sleeping,
SIWON would show affection...

1191
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,710
and sleep like this.

1192
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,840
Yes, he did that.

1193
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,380
This is how SIWON slept.

1194
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,780
Then you'd have to punch him like this.

1195
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:03,753
Among us,

1196
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,723
let's say you have to share a room.

1197
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:10,763
(Among these members?)

1198
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,303
I think it'd be okay to share
with LEETEUK.

1199
00:48:13,303 --> 00:48:15,903
- I'm pretty easy to live with.
- You two are a combo these days.

1200
00:48:15,903 --> 00:48:18,033
All of us are neat.

1201
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:19,773
But we all have different styles.

1202
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:21,543
- LEETEUK is...
- Messy?

1203
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:24,043
He's neat because he has nothing.

1204
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:25,343
Nice.

1205
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,713
And you have nothing at all, HEECHUL.

1206
00:48:26,713 --> 00:48:28,343
- I literally have nothing.
- He has nothing.

1207
00:48:28,343 --> 00:48:30,783
But I think LEETEUK would have
just the essentials.

1208
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,523
RYEOWOOK is a maximalist.

1209
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:36,153
There were a fridge for skincare products
and a mirror in your room.

1210
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:38,793
He brings a bunch of stuff
even when he goes overseas.

1211
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:39,793
Exactly.

1212
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:41,523
We used to have so much fun back then.

1213
00:48:42,663 --> 00:48:45,293
To those of you who shamelessly came
empty-handed to this housewarming,

1214
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:47,233
I will give you a special opportunity.

1215
00:48:47,233 --> 00:48:49,203
Would you like to play a game with me?

1216
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:51,603
(Chaos from the very beginning)

1217
00:48:53,673 --> 00:48:55,343
(I'm taking it.)

1218
00:48:55,343 --> 00:48:57,313
(No way)

1219
00:48:57,313 --> 00:48:59,413
(Rapping like crazy)

1220
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:03,383
This is the most fun game
I've played this year.

1221
00:49:03,953 --> 00:49:05,083
One, two, three.

1222
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,253
Who is it?

1223
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:08,053
(But winning a gift is not easy.)

1224
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:09,693
(How could you get this wrong?)

1225
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:11,753
(The talented cutie
shows off again today.)

1226
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:13,063
(Give me the gift.)

1227
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:14,723
YESUNG, why are you sweating so much?

1228
00:49:14,723 --> 00:49:16,433
(Why are you sweating so much?)

1229
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:17,780
What are you doing, HEECHUL?

1230
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:19,763
(And now, even stealing gifts)

1231
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:21,945
(Who will end up
with the housewarming gift?)
