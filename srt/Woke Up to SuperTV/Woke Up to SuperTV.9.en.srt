1
00:00:00,221 --> 00:00:02,961
(SUPER JUNIOR goes
on their 20th anniversary MT.)

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,561
(The members make a few promises.)

3
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,091
There's a 20-dollar penalty.

4
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,461
I don't think this is great.

5
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:09,131
(But you just made that promise.)

6
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:10,461
(No way)

7
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:12,401
(And so begins
the 20th anniversary MT.)

8
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,771
(Let's go.)

9
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,971
(The first event is a game
with a lunch benefit.)

10
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:17,501
(Me!)

11
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,271
(While everyone shows off
their personal talents,)

12
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:20,111
Doing an impression of Kim Byeong Ok.

13
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,271
Correct. You look just like him.

14
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,311
I haven't even done it yet.

15
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:23,741
(So funny)

16
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,111
- KYUHYUN.
- KYUHYUN.

17
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,481
(Talented KYUHYUN takes the lead.)

18
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,811
MAMAMOO's "Decalcomanie."

19
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:28,951
Correct.

20
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,021
Correct.

21
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,451
(So excited)

22
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:35,061
(KYUHYUN wins 1st place in the bus game.)

23
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:37,261
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

24
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,131
(They arrive at Munmak rest area.)

25
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,761
My Gangwon-do.

26
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:44,061
Rest areas are the highlight of MTs.

27
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,901
(Rest stops,
the essential course of travel.)

28
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,371
Yes.

29
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:49,571
(Excited)

30
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,201
Let's go.

31
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,911
There's a ramen vending machine.

32
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,141
Let's go.

33
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,181
(Starting with the classic walnut snacks)

34
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,681
(Spicy and sweet tteokbokki)

35
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,681
(Sausage-rice cake skewers)

36
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:04,791
(Filled with all sorts of snacks)

37
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,951
(Impromptu MT itinerary)

38
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:07,991
(Lunch)

39
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,621
You guys are hungry, right?

40
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:10,421
Yes.

41
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,231
Now we'll have lunch.

42
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,461
The production team is buying.

43
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,561
(The staff treats the members.)

44
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:18,131
Please hand over the lunch money.

45
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,071
(What is this?)

46
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,871
(Something is handed to SUPER JUNIOR.)

47
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,581
(Curious)

48
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,981
There's no money inside.

49
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,181
It says "Loyalty Lunch."

50
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,281
Loyalty?

51
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,381
If someone paid 50 cents,
do they only get 50 cents worth of food?

52
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,121
Today's lunch is...

53
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,351
to celebrate
SUPER JUNIOR's 20th anniversary,

54
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,291
and to test how united they are...

55
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,291
Loyalty and unity...

56
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,531
It's a meal to measure
how big your hearts are for one another.

57
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,331
Honestly, when it comes to unity,

58
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,471
we're probably the worst
among all idol groups.

59
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,631
- Not the best?
- Based on loyalty?

60
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,171
The worst of the worst.

61
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,071
(20 years of loyalty,
the worst at being united)

62
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,641
We won't be able to eat.

63
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:01,581
The person who won first place
in the bus game...

64
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,811
(I was in first place!)

65
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,281
will now decide
on the lunch payment order.

66
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:09,381
(This is the benefit
for winning first place.)

67
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:13,851
(KYUHYUN, the 1st-place winner gets
to decide the lunch payment order.)

68
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,791
The winner gets to decide everything?

69
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,161
KYUHYUN's making all the decisions.

70
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,391
You'll pay with this card.

71
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:22,561
If you use up all the money
on the debit card...

72
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:25,201
and the payment fails,

73
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,871
you'll have to cover...

74
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,741
everyone's meal costs.

75
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:32,771
(The total balance is unknown.)

76
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:35,641
So there's a set limit.

77
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,251
What if there's only ten dollars?

78
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,111
Someone might not get to eat.

79
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:41,881
It's random.

80
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:45,591
If the person before you
spends too much...

81
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,421
Let's each just order one thing.

82
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:48,821
You can order a lot.

83
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:50,361
Being last isn't necessarily bad.

84
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:52,461
Somewhere in the middle
might be the worst.

85
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:53,691
Like fourth place might be unlucky.

86
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,901
It's like a game of wit.

87
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,201
Is being fifth bad?

88
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,761
We don't even know
how much is on the card.

89
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,571
(Understood)

90
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,971
So I'm the one deciding the order now.

91
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:35,071
(Group 1 KYUHYUN, RYEOWOOK, HEECHUL)

92
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,411
(Group 2 LEETEUK, EUNHYUK, SIWON)

93
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:39,941
(Group 3 SHINDONG, DONGHAE, YESUNG)

94
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,211
Maybe there's 50 dollars on the card.

95
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:43,981
You and I will be fine.

96
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:45,521
You might not be fine.

97
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,121
It'll be fine up until me.

98
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:50,021
(Debating the card balance passionately)

99
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,791
(While they argue,
they arrive at the food court.)

100
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:56,531
I think they budgeted
around six to seven dollars per person.

101
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,661
But every menu here is over ten dollars.

102
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:03,671
(Average rest area food prices are
over 10 dollars.)

103
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,701
Maybe they gave us 100 dollars.

104
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:06,201
(RYEOWOOK guesses
the card balance is 100 dollars.)

105
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:09,111
Then everyone can eat,
so maybe it's 50 dollars.

106
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,211
(That makes sense.)

107
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,841
You go first. What are you getting?

108
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:16,681
(There are so many options.)

109
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,351
Can I get two dishes?

110
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:20,251
You can. Let's all order two.

111
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,521
Even three is fine.

112
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,191
(That sounds like the devil whispering.)

113
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:26,321
I'll first go with
bean sprout hangover ramen.

114
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,221
Bean sprouts are good for your body.

115
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,231
That was my dish.

116
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:31,901
I'll get something we can share.

117
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,961
A pork cutlet.

118
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,231
Get the expensive one with mozzarella.

119
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,831
I like old-school pork cutlet.

120
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,701
(Old-style pork cutlet 10.50 dollars)

121
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,371
Honestly, they must have put
at least 20 dollars on it.

122
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:41,401
They must've put in at least 20 dollars.

123
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,071
But this might be where it cuts off.

124
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,041
You can get one more.

125
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:49,211
(He immediately taps the payment button.)

126
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,351
- 16.50 dollars.
- He picked the most expensive dish.

127
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,221
(What is this?)

128
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,021
(What on earth did he buy?)

129
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,891
There's no single menu
that costs 16.50 dollars.

130
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,961
He probably got two dishes.

131
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:03,031
One for 10.50 and one for six dollars.

132
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:05,231
(That makes sense.)

133
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,631
One person spent 16.50 dollars.

134
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:09,401
Then if the card has 100 dollars...

135
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,141
(Doing the math)

136
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:15,111
If he ate 16.50 dollars worth, it's risky.

137
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,871
(Bean sprout ramen 6 dollars,
old-style pork cutlet 10.50 dollars)

138
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,441
(Total amount spent: 16.50 dollars)

139
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,481
(Now it's RYEOWOOK's turn.)

140
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:22,711
(What should I get?)

141
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:25,581
You can get two dishes too,
since you're second.

142
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,451
The menu I'm picking is...

143
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:31,221
(Ox knee soup 16 dollars)

144
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,561
Sixteen dollars?

145
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:34,561
Are you crazy?

146
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,631
(I have to eat healthy.)

147
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:38,831
Didn't your dish cost 16 dollars?

148
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,201
I got 16.50 dollars worth.

149
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,701
(Health food is always that expensive.)

150
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,501
- I also want...
- You're ordering one more?

151
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,271
I want spicy braised short ribs too.

152
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:48,741
(Another health food choice)

153
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:50,911
That comes out to 32 dollars.

154
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,541
(Is this amount for real?)

155
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,311
(Now he's worried after ordering.)

156
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,651
What if I don't get to eat?

157
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,181
Seriously?

158
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,091
Still, I don't think it'll cut off here.

159
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,091
(Please go through.)

160
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:08,361
(Will RYEOWOOK's payment be approved?)

161
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,931
(RYEOWOOK's payment is approved.)

162
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,401
(I survived.)

163
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,331
(As soon as RYEOWOOK succeeds,
the 2nd payment alert arrives.)

164
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:18,571
Thirty-two dollars.

165
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,041
Is he insane?

166
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,171
(Cold silence)

167
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,871
(What just happened?)

168
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:27,211
Who went second?

169
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:28,281
RYEOWOOK went second.

170
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:31,611
If it's 32 dollars,
he ordered two dishes that cost 16.

171
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,321
He should've just gotten one.

172
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,091
No loyalty at all.

173
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,021
They have no loyalty at all.

174
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,361
We'll be okay.

175
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:42,161
Those guys are in danger.

176
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,791
No, if it's 100 dollars, it ends here.

177
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,861
(Ox knee soup 16 dollars,
spicy braised short ribs 16 dollars)

178
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,131
(Total 32 dollars,
total so far 48.50 dollars)

179
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:50,331
(If this is the case...)

180
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:53,101
(KYUHYUN spent 16.50 dollars.)

181
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,041
If there's only 50 dollars on the card,

182
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,981
Then you're the one in trouble, HEECHUL.

183
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,851
(At a loss for words at the amount left)

184
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:03,751
(Nervous)

185
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,451
(Let's see, where's the rice bowl?)

186
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,721
Rice bowl, one dollar.

187
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:08,721
Get two bowls of rice.

188
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,591
Let's share it
with the spicy ribs I ordered.

189
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:15,161
I think there's 100 dollars.

190
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,861
You said you wanted ramen.

191
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,561
I do want ramen.

192
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,561
(But there are more kinds than expected.)

193
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,571
Just get something cheap.

194
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,901
This is nerve-wracking.

195
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,871
I think there's 100 dollars.

196
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,271
(This scaredy-cat still wants
a bowl of rice.)

197
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:34,211
(Lol)

198
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:37,411
- Rice bowl.
- They probably didn't leave that little.

199
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:38,881
Then I'll add...

200
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:40,951
a rice bowl.

201
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,621
Go ahead.

202
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,251
I hope there are five dollars left,
at least.

203
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,321
Is that it? Get one more dish.

204
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,431
(Even with RYEOWOOK's tempting whisper,
he proceeds.)

205
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:53,601
Why are you nervous already?

206
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:56,431
(Please don't let me get cut off.)

207
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:59,441
(Will HEECHUL's order be paid?)

208
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,641
Please.

209
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,711
(HEECHUL's payment is approved.)

210
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:07,981
(So excited)

211
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:11,181
(KYUHYUN, RYEOWOOK,
and HEECHUL all succeeded.)

212
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:14,521
(Total cost 53.50 dollars)

213
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:18,391
So with this, we've spent over 50 dollars.

214
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,321
I only ordered five dollars worth.

215
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,821
We've spent 53 dollars now.

216
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:23,831
(I spent it.)

217
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:27,501
Honestly, I kind of hope LEETEUK
or YESUNG gets hit with it.

218
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,701
Let them spend some money.

219
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:32,241
(What did we do wrong?)

220
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,371
Who was the second one?

221
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:36,811
Why did you order so much?

222
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,511
RYEOWOOK was second.

223
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:40,841
Why did you order so much?

224
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,981
HEECHUL was trembling
while swiping the card.

225
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,451
I thought the card had 50 dollars.

226
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,481
So I thought there were two dollars left.

227
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,981
- He was asking if he could order rice.
- I thought that was all I could get.

228
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,451
(What if the card's almost out?)

229
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:53,291
I think it'll be fine up to me.

230
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,331
(Convincing himself he'll be safe)

231
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,061
Next group of three, you may go.

232
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,831
Let's go.

233
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,261
It's okay to spend more.

234
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,101
Don't lie.

235
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,631
I think the card has 200 dollars.

236
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:06,671
If it's 200, then we're good.

237
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:08,541
They say we can spend more.

238
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,271
(Should I believe that?)

239
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:12,881
If we get hit, we just pay.

240
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,711
So let's eat what we want.

241
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:16,811
I think we're safe.

242
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,581
(Filled with hope)

243
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:23,621
(Heading into the food court
with excitement)

244
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,021
I want several dishes.

245
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:28,661
(The food court has more options
than expected.)

246
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,061
(Arriving at the kiosk)

247
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,161
I'll go first.

248
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,671
(Let's see.)

249
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,601
(All the menus look delicious.)

250
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,741
(His mouth is watering.)

251
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:44,471
Where's the short rib soup?

252
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,811
(Short rib soup 16 dollars)

253
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:51,211
I feel like this might be
the cut-off point.

254
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,021
Just order one.

255
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,651
Old-style pork cutlet.

256
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,221
That's too expensive.

257
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,721
If you're going to get something,
get this.

258
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,361
No, I want old-style pork cutlet.

259
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:01,421
(EUNHYUK, keep chatting.)

260
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:03,031
(I'm getting my pork cutlet.)

261
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,931
(Surprised)

262
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,201
(Boldly selects 2 dishes)

263
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,871
But you didn't even pay.

264
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,331
You go first, LEETEUK.

265
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:12,941
(I'll try paying.)

266
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,071
(Immediately attempts
to pay 26.50 dollars)

267
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:18,241
(This amount is wild.)

268
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,911
(Will LEETEUK's payment go through?)

269
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:23,881
(LEETEUK's payment is approved.)

270
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,581
(It worked.)

271
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,581
(Excited)

272
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,851
Someone just swiped 26.50 dollars.

273
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,321
Who was that?

274
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,861
LEETEUK.

275
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:38,531
LEETEUK splurges when he's out
so he doesn't have to eat at home.

276
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,961
I feel most wronged.
I only spent five dollars.

277
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:42,771
(You should've been bold.)

278
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:45,171
Let's see
how much has been spent until now.

279
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,441
First, 16.50 dollars.

280
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,541
Second, 32 dollars.

281
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,541
Third, five dollars.

282
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,711
Fourth, 26.50 dollars.

283
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,371
So far, we've spent 80 dollars.

284
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,511
I thought the card had only 50 dollars.

285
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,881
Maybe it's 100 dollars.

286
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,911
Could it be 130 dollars for a reason?

287
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,221
(Because they're 13 members?)

288
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,551
(Really?)

289
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,291
(Short rib soup 16 dollars,
old-style pork cutlet 10.50 dollars)

290
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,891
(Total 26.50 dollars,
total so far 80 dollars)

291
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:08,091
(Now it's EUNHYUK's turn.)

292
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:10,691
I definitely want ramen first.

293
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,891
First of all, ramen.

294
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,661
And a rice bowl?

295
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,371
Ramen and pork bulgogi set?

296
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,331
That sounds good.

297
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:19,701
My mouth's watering.

298
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,971
- Pork bulgogi sounds good.
- Pork bulgogi and ramen?

299
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:22,771
That sounds great.

300
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:24,471
(I'll start filling my tray.)

301
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,911
(Pork bulgogi set 11 dollars)

302
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,481
I'm really getting ramen too.

303
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:31,711
Ramen with rice cake and dumplings.

304
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,181
No.

305
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,551
I'm getting bean sprout hangover ramen.

306
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,721
(Get what you want.)

307
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:40,621
(Immediately taps to pay)

308
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:45,731
(Will EUNHYUK's payment go through?)

309
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:47,131
It went through.

310
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,801
(EUNHYUK succeeds too.)

311
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,971
(Congratulations)

312
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:53,871
(Pork bulgogi set 11 dollars,
bean sprout hangover ramen 6 dollars)

313
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,301
(Total 17 dollars,
total cost so far 97 dollars)

314
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:57,011
I hope I'm not cut off.

315
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,011
(Even SIWON feels the fear
of paying it all.)

316
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:02,381
Don't worry and just order what you want.

317
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,981
(Deeply anxious)

318
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,551
(Chooses a menu after much thought)

319
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,221
(Affordable perilla seaweed soup)

320
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,761
(Just ordering one cheap dish?)

321
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:14,321
Just that?

322
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:15,391
Just one.

323
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,891
(Don't)

324
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,031
Don't ask to share our food.

325
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,361
(What if I'm cut off?)

326
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:23,831
Order what you want.

327
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,401
(This one?)

328
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:27,171
(He wants it but can't add it.)

329
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,371
(Inner conflict)

330
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:31,641
(Contemplating)

331
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:32,741
(Slowly)

332
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,481
(Finally adds one more dish)

333
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,451
(And immediately goes to pay.)

334
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:42,751
(SIWON's total order amount 21.50 dollars)

335
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:43,851
(One predicted amount was 100 dollars.)

336
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,521
Nine people, 100 dollars.

337
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:48,861
(But they've already spent 97 dollars.)

338
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,461
(With SIWON's dishes,
it exceeds 100 dollars.)

339
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,901
(Will SIWON's payment be approved?)

340
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:57,201
(SIWON's payment is approved.)

341
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,771
(It went through again?)

342
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,141
How much is on this card?

343
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:05,311
I should've ordered more.

344
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,641
- Like braised short ribs.
- Exactly.

345
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,781
(Feeling amazing)

346
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:13,551
- How much did they spend?
- 21.50 dollars.

347
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:14,981
Did it pass 100 dollars?

348
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,121
It did.

349
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,021
They've spent 118.50 dollars now.

350
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,221
(Then that means...)

351
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,821
There must be 130 dollars.

352
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,761
(So what happens to me, 9th in line?)

353
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,661
(Meanwhile,
SIWON's buying isn't over yet.)

354
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,501
Look, there are Deli Manjoo. Snacks.

355
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,501
So many snacks.

356
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:34,101
(Excited to see all kinds of snacks)

357
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:34,901
Let's buy these.

358
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:37,341
- Sausage.
- Sausage-rice cake skewers.

359
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:39,141
Buy those and Kennedys sausages too.

360
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,111
I'm nervous. I think I'll get cut off.

361
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,681
I won't pay.

362
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:45,881
But only you can pay. We're done.

363
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,281
I'm not doing it.

364
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,581
SIWON.

365
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:49,521
I feel like I'll get cut off.

366
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,461
(LEETEUK and EUNHYUK, you can stay.)

367
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,391
(But Dad's going home.)

368
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:56,561
(Buy them for us.)

369
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:59,931
(He doesn't even look back.)

370
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,901
(Perilla seaweed soup 7 dollars,
mozzarella pork cutlet: 14.50 dollars)

371
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:03,271
(Total 21.50 dollars,
total cost so far 118.50 dollars)

372
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,271
He's back.

373
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:09,071
(SIWON quickly returned
to avoid LEETEUK and EUNHYUK.)

374
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,841
So they're all safe.

375
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:14,111
All our payments went through.

376
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:15,811
(At this point, it feels like
there's quite a lot of money on the card.)

377
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,311
I was considerate of the other members.

378
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:19,681
No, you were too scared.

379
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:22,081
There's more money than we thought.

380
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:23,221
Let's go.

381
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:24,691
Maybe there's 150 dollars.

382
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,091
I don't think so.

383
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:28,891
No, I think it's 200 dollars,
since it's our 20th anniversary.

384
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,331
(Wait, now that I think about it…)

385
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:32,961
What if they put in a lot
so we could eat freely?

386
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:36,471
We could've ordered more,
but we were too careful.

387
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:37,601
Exactly.

388
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,671
Should I go back?
I only spent five dollars.

389
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:41,741
(Unfair)

390
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,841
If it's 118.50 dollars so far,

391
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,711
then if someone
just swipes 30 dollars confidently...

392
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:48,411
We'll find out.

393
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:52,051
There are two traps. 130 and 200 dollars.

394
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,251
One of those two.

395
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:55,281
I'll just eat what I want and go big.

396
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,691
If I get stuck with the bill, so be it.

397
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,721
Let's make an order.

398
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:05,091
(What should I eat?)

399
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:07,601
(SHINDONG is the first to order
among this group.)

400
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,531
Spicy cockle bibimbap.

401
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,031
(He picks his menu right away.)

402
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:15,001
(Pork bulgogi set 11 dollars)

403
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:17,671
(But of course, it's not SHINDONG
if he only orders one dish.)

404
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,611
(What's his additional dish?)

405
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,681
(Spicy braised short ribs 16 dollars)

406
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:24,081
(My goodness)

407
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:25,211
That's about right.

408
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,551
(What do you think of my dishes?)

409
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,181
Let's swipe it.

410
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:29,421
It's 27 dollars.

411
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:36,031
(He attempts payment immediately.)

412
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:41,431
(Will SHINDONG's payment go through?)

413
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:48,001
(Payment declined
due to insufficient funds)

414
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:51,311
(SHINDONG is the unlucky one
who gets stuck with the entire bill.)

415
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:52,711
I guess it was 130 dollars.

416
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:53,641
(What a shame.)

417
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,611
(It's becoming more likely
that the card limit was 130 dollars.)

418
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:59,481
(The other members find out
about SHINDONG's fate.)

419
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,751
Did SHINDONG get cut off?

420
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:01,821
Did he get stuck with the bill?

421
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:04,691
Okay.

422
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:06,791
This is so fun.

423
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:08,891
If I ordered more, it would've been me.

424
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:11,291
One sausage-rice cake skewer
would've been fine.

425
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,531
That would've been okay.

426
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,871
Pick what you want to eat.

427
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,071
I want the pork loin cutlet.

428
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:19,271
Press there. I'll pay with my own card.

429
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,171
- Pick what you want.
- Short rib soup.

430
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,241
Pick as much as you want.

431
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:30,381
(This opportunity doesn't come every day.)

432
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,981
Did you order a pork cutlet already?

433
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:33,951
I ordered one.
Should I get one more for you?

434
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,581
How about the one with cheese?

435
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,521
(DONGHAE adds a cheese cutlet
without hesitation.)

436
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:41,291
(SHINDONG feels bad as he swipes.)

437
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:46,131
(SHINDONG finishes payment
with his personal credit card.)

438
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:49,331
(So how much was really on that card?)

439
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:52,671
(Total cost 118.50 dollars)

440
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,601
(We heard you were cut off.)

441
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:56,411
So it ended with you.

442
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,211
It really ended with me.

443
00:24:58,211 --> 00:24:59,241
(Talking about
how his payment was declined)

444
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:03,111
I got cut off
and had to pay for three people.

445
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,751
And that cost 58 dollars.

446
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,181
(That's a lot.)

447
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,551
Was it really 130 dollars?

448
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:09,991
(Curious)

449
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:11,391
The total amount was...

450
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:12,591
(So how much was the card limit?)

451
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,691
It was 144 dollars.

452
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:18,491
If I hadn't been greedy
and just picked one, I would've made it.

453
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:21,401
Why'd you set it so randomly
at 144 dollars?

454
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:24,101
They say average rest area spending is...

455
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:25,431
sixteen dollars per person.

456
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:27,071
(I see.)

457
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:30,671
If each of us had spent 16 dollars,
we all could've eaten.

458
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:33,441
(Too bad)

459
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,641
I'm hungry.

460
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,611
(Now that the game's over,
it's time to eat.)

461
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:39,451
(The dishes are ready
at the perfect timing.)

462
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:41,821
(Just the looks are appetizing.)

463
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,121
Ramen looks amazing.

464
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,491
Thank you for the meal.

465
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:50,861
(A bite of ramen)

466
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:54,061
(A bite of crispy-outside,
juicy-inside cheese pork cutlet)

467
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:57,331
(Big bite)

468
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,871
(Slurp of hot soup)

469
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:00,701
(So delicious)

470
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:02,471
Rest area food is seriously delicious.

471
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,811
Rest areas are insane.

472
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:06,081
These days, rest areas are better
than most restaurants.

473
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,881
I want to live in a rest area.

474
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,081
This trip is really well organized.

475
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:12,581
I just love that they give us food.

476
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:14,521
We're so happy over one meal.

477
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:17,151
(With a delicious lunch,
the members are full of energy.)

478
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:20,321
(Now time to move to the next location)

479
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:22,891
Where we're going now is...

480
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:24,431
to a supermarket for groceries.

481
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:27,461
<i>At the supermarket</i>

482
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,571
(Impromptu MT itinerary)

483
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:30,971
(Grocery shopping)

484
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:35,441
Let's hear the chef's briefing
on tonight's dinner menu.

485
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:38,771
Since this MT is to celebrate
SUPER JUNIOR's anniversary,

486
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:42,441
I'll prepare a meaningful dish.

487
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,651
It's something we've eaten a lot.

488
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:45,681
We've eaten it a lot?

489
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,481
At the dorm.

490
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,751
- Spicy stir-fried pork.
- Something like that.

491
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:51,721
(Could it be?)

492
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,461
- Korean beef.
- Stir-fried sausage and vegetables.

493
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,821
(Stir-fried sausage and vegetables)

494
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,131
Correct!

495
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,531
You collected 1,000 dollars
just to make that dish?

496
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,761
Sausages are expensive.

497
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:03,701
(First menu,
stir-fried sausage and vegetables)

498
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:07,671
Also, let's get a lot of meat
for a barbecue.

499
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:10,611
- You lead the shopping.
- Okay.

500
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:12,171
Can we buy whatever we want
at the supermarket?

501
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:13,641
No.

502
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:16,311
When you pay at the supermarket,

503
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:18,581
you're spending from the shared fund.

504
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,451
(All expenses are managed by Manager KYU.)

505
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,581
Let's get some ice cream.

506
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:22,821
Ice cream is okay.

507
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:23,751
Can I get a protein shake?

508
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:25,051
No protein.

509
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,191
(DONGHAE is speechless
from the protein ban.)

510
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:28,221
(But I paid my dues.)

511
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:29,531
So what?

512
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,231
(This shopping trip is going to be rough.)

513
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,031
Now that he's holding the money,
he's changed.

514
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:37,371
(While chatting,
they arrive at downtown Munmak.)

515
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:38,871
Everyone, let's go shopping.

516
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:41,901
(Born-to-be Gangwon-do guy HEECHUL)

517
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:43,811
Come on, guys.

518
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:45,241
Let's go shopping.

519
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:47,941
Munmak is so nice.

520
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:51,681
- Hello!
- You're handsome.

521
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:55,121
Who?

522
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:58,721
She was definitely talking about me.

523
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:00,561
Definitely about me.

524
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:01,921
Let's get strawberries.

525
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:03,991
(Strawberries caught LEETEUK's eye.)

526
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:06,531
(So tasty-looking)

527
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,901
No strawberries.

528
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:12,071
(Manager KYU immediately blocks him.)

529
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:14,141
(YESUNG picks white strawberries.)

530
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:16,071
Aren't red ones better? Just buy one.

531
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,711
But we're all going to eat them.

532
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:21,141
(Overseeing the strawberry count)

533
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:23,211
We've got a lot of people.

534
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,051
I won't eat any.

535
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:26,651
(Still debating the strawberries)

536
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,751
Then you should eat
only strawberries, YESUNG.

537
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:32,051
(Thanks to YESUNG's sacrifice,
they get strawberries.)

538
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:34,461
(Main chef RYEOWOOK goes off alone.)

539
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:37,961
(With the guide's signal,
the rest also move.)

540
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:39,961
We're on snack duty.

541
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:41,631
(Everyone except RYEOWOOK
and SIWON is in charge of snacks.)

542
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,601
It's been so long
since I've been to a supermarket.

543
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,871
These days, I order everything online.

544
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,471
Bananas?

545
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:48,841
Nope.

546
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:50,271
(Manager KYU resumes his control.)

547
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,741
How flat.

548
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:54,581
I want some hijiki.

549
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:58,011
(SHINDONG likes hijiki.)

550
00:28:58,011 --> 00:28:59,321
(+1 hijiki, SHINDONG's pick)

551
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,451
- It's really good with meat.
- What's that?

552
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:01,751
Hijiki.

553
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:04,021
(Manager KYU appears.)

554
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:05,551
Hijiki is delicious.

555
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,961
- You don't even like hijiki.
- I do. It's tasty with meat.

556
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,261
What do you know?

557
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,801
(Hijiki survived KYU's judgment.)

558
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,731
(Arriving at the seafood section)

559
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,131
(Salmon lover LEETEUK)

560
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,741
(Flatfish lover HEECHUL)

561
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,441
(Manager KYU begins inspection.)

562
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,471
Flatfish is famous in Munmak.

563
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,741
- Let's get salmon.
- Stay still.

564
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:29,181
I need flatfish.

565
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,811
I already talked to the seller.

566
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,821
(Listen to me.)

567
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,681
(You don't even know anything.)

568
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,651
(This manager is so stingy.)

569
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:37,891
I'm just spending the dues I paid.

570
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:38,991
There's no money left right now.

571
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:40,361
Why not?

572
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,421
We have to buy meat.

573
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:43,461
Are we buying meat?

574
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:45,161
(Public anger redirected
to meat discussion)

575
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:48,201
(Diversion successful)

576
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,371
Let's buy three.

577
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,371
(+3 packs of tenderloin)

578
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:55,371
(KYU the manager appears again.)

579
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:58,271
(Please)

580
00:29:58,271 --> 00:29:59,511
I need to eat tenderloin.

581
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,111
Let's take one pack out.

582
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:05,951
(The other cart is also loaded with meat.)

583
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:09,151
KYUHYUN, can we get flatfish?

584
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:11,951
(Manager KYU gives permission.)

585
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:13,661
Sir, please wrap one pack
of flatfish for us.

586
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:16,161
Thank you.

587
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:20,501
Everyone, we bought just one pack
of flatfish.

588
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,701
(HEECHUL sneakily added salmon
underneath.)

589
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:24,971
KYUHYUN, we bought one pack of flatfish.

590
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:26,601
- Just one?
- Yes, just one.

591
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:27,941
But it looks like something's under it.

592
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:28,771
Let him be.

593
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:32,111
(Caught red-handed with hidden salmon)

594
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:32,981
How much is it?

595
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,941
(Hey Manager)

596
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:36,651
The economy is bad these days, so...

597
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:37,851
we've got to buy it.

598
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:40,051
(We have reasons too, right?)

599
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:42,381
(DONGHAE goes off somewhere.)

600
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:45,251
Do you have protein drinks?

601
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,521
Protein drinks.

602
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:50,661
(Search mission for protein)

603
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:52,391
Do they not have any protein drinks here?

604
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:56,371
(I'll lose my gains!)

605
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:59,601
(RYEOWOOK and SIWON shop
for dinner ingredients.)

606
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,971
Since I'm the assistant,
I'll push the cart.

607
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:03,811
(The assistant chef
keeps things disciplined.)

608
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:07,011
(Buying seasonings needed for cooking)

609
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:08,511
Can we take home the leftovers?

610
00:31:08,511 --> 00:31:10,111
Take them home.

611
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,651
Then can we get some pepper too?

612
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,681
Get the pepper.

613
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:14,851
(+ pepper)

614
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:19,091
We'll probably need Ssamjang too, Chef.

615
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:20,661
Is this too much?

616
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,561
(If there's extra, I'll take it home.)

617
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:25,391
What's this? Soup soy sauce?

618
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:27,301
Can I take the leftovers of this too?

619
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,661
Take it all.

620
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:29,571
(The assistant chef plans
to stock up at home.)

621
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:35,671
(Buying ingredients for seaweed soup)

622
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:38,071
I'll get one of these organic ones.

623
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:40,941
Sashimi?

624
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:42,951
Do you sell skate here?

625
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,881
(We must buy this.)

626
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:46,221
Can I buy skate?

627
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:47,051
Buy it.

628
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,551
(SIWON is a skate lover.)

629
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:52,021
I like skate.

630
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,821
Just get one pack.

631
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,991
But you said you like it.

632
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,561
(Who is this tiny pack going to feed?)

633
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,571
Which one do you recommend among these?

634
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,631
- I think this one's good.
- Yes, that one's good.

635
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:09,201
(The chef's team finishes their shopping.)

636
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,711
(Meanwhile,
the snack team is still shopping.)

637
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,641
You guys won't eat snacks.

638
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,081
(His arms are full of snacks.)

639
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:20,221
(A snack cart crash unfolds.)

640
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:22,481
Are you really going to eat all of that?

641
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:23,751
That's all just SHINDONG's portion.

642
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:25,251
I only picked for myself.

643
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:30,431
(DONGHAE and SHINDONG
sneakily tasting bread)

644
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:33,031
(Good)

645
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:34,331
Thank you.

646
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:38,031
(They've already grabbed
two bags of bread.)

647
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:39,541
(Adding)

648
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,641
(Safely placed in the cart
without the manager noticing)

649
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,081
What's with this bread?

650
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:51,281
It's just one meal, everyone.

651
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:52,481
(Awkward)

652
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:54,451
Stop picking stuff already.

653
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:58,621
(Just how much will this cost?)

654
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:00,891
Sorry, but can I pick
just one thing I want to eat?

655
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:02,961
You picked strawberries earlier.

656
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,561
(I can't even see
my strawberries anymore.)

657
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:07,861
Are we done? Let's go.

658
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:10,871
- Let's go, everyone.
- Let's really go now.

659
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,331
Where's RYEOWOOK?

660
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,741
Can I eat one now?

661
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:17,271
Eat it.

662
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:20,641
(No, DONGHAE. Wait.)

663
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,811
For our Finnish fans...

664
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:27,551
(Manager KYU snatches it immediately.)

665
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:30,351
(Meanwhile, the chef's team joins them.)

666
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:33,691
(Manager KYU launches into action.)

667
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:36,661
(SIWON's confused
by this first-time inspection.)

668
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:38,891
We even bought sashimi.

669
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,761
This is skate.

670
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,461
(Skate?)

671
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:45,601
(Feeling down)

672
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:47,971
(Should we take out the skate?)

673
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:48,841
(Taking it)

674
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,141
(Good idea)

675
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,711
HEECHUL bought two packs of sashimi.

676
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:56,311
(My skate)

677
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,751
(Cash register heating up)

678
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:01,051
- What's this butter for?
- For grilling meat.

679
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:05,891
(HEECHUL tries sneaking in some gum.)

680
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:09,291
(Approaching)

681
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,961
(Successfully paid
without Manager KYU noticing)

682
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:16,771
(He even smuggled gum
larger than his bag.)

683
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:17,771
KYUHYUN.

684
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:18,631
No.

685
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:22,641
(KYUHYUN steps away
to return the skate.)

686
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:26,211
- Don't we need more strawberries?
- I need another bag.

687
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:27,781
(With the manager gone,
everyone's shopping instincts awaken.)

688
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:29,611
Why do you all like strawberries so much?

689
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,411
One pack isn't enough.

690
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:32,851
(They'll be running a strawberry farm
at this rate.)

691
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,721
They're just putting everything in.

692
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:38,351
Should we load this into the car first?

693
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:39,351
After adding one more?

694
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:41,691
You all know this is
for just one meal, right?

695
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:44,691
- With this much money...
- Wouldn't it be better to eat out?

696
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,131
it's better to eat out.

697
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:47,961
But...

698
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,331
there's no romance in that.

699
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:51,901
We're buying romance now.

700
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,271
Let's take whatever's left with us.

701
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:57,011
(My skate)

702
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,081
(His mind is blank
after losing his skate.)

703
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:03,951
SIWON bought skate but KYUHYUN took it,
and now he's out of it.

704
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:05,381
I really don't eat skate.

705
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:07,651
(But they bought things
they wanted to eat too.)

706
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,721
I never complain, but skate is a no.

707
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:13,091
(What's wrong with skate?)

708
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:16,361
(How much did they spend?)

709
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,831
You guys bought more
than 100 dollars per person.

710
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:22,231
It's 570.94 dollars.

711
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,271
We bought a lot.

712
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:29,341
Even if we start eating now,
we can't finish it all.

713
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:32,011
Seriously.

714
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:35,011
(And you knew that but still packed it?)

715
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:38,581
(Payment complete)

716
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,451
You're the ones who bought it.

717
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,421
(Receipt fluttering in the wind)

718
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:45,791
Seriously?

719
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:49,521
So this is what a receipt
for one meal looks like?

720
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:50,891
This is insane.

721
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:52,231
(And this is after he tried to stop them.)

722
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:53,201
Let's go.

723
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:56,571
(Thanks to manager KYUHYUN,
we got through it.)

724
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:59,671
(Receipt given to the manager)

725
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,201
(Grocery shopping complete)

726
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:07,481
(Loaded with bags,
they drive along the big river...)

727
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:12,681
(head up the forest path...)

728
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,551
(to finally arrive
at today's MT location.)

729
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:19,321
We've arrived. Please get out.

730
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:22,491
It's been a while since I came here.

731
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:25,791
(SUPER JUNIOR stayed
at this same place last year.)

732
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,361
It's been a while since we've been here.

733
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:29,901
Was it last year we came here?

734
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:35,171
(A wide-open natural view
with mountains and river)

735
00:36:35,171 --> 00:36:36,371
- We should jump in the water.
- Let's do that.

736
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,871
Let's make that a punishment.

737
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:39,841
These days, variety shows are too easy.

738
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:41,811
It feels so good to be back.

739
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:44,481
I don't remember being here.

740
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:45,481
This is the place.

741
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:48,051
(They plan to hold the MT here.)

742
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:49,481
Nice.

743
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:53,791
(A spacious living room
big enough for nine people to play in.)

744
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,861
(A piano that adds emotional vibes)

745
00:36:57,391 --> 00:37:01,061
(A perfect place even with a kitchen
for group cooking)

746
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:05,131
(Entering the living room)

747
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,541
Back then, it was set up like this.

748
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,271
It was all spread out.

749
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:09,541
Now it's coming back to me.

750
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:12,471
(DONGHAE taking scenic photos)

751
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:13,641
This place is really nice.

752
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:17,481
(The view keeps drawing their attention.)

753
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,121
(So, what will they do now?)

754
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,721
Now that we've arrived,

755
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:24,991
shall we have some fun?

756
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:27,121
(Fun time?)

757
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,491
This is the flower of MTs.

758
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:30,191
We've prepared a recreation game.

759
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,231
(Impromptu MT itinerary)

760
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:34,431
(Recreation)

761
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:37,631
(Entertainment head SHINDONG on the move)

762
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,431
This game is called "Shouting in..."

763
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:40,741
"Silence."

764
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:41,841
You all know it.

765
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:43,471
It's played in pairs.

766
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,171
Split into teams,
and the winning pair gets...

767
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:48,081
- a big prize.
- What is it?

768
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:49,511
Korean beef?

769
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:52,081
Rice wine made...

770
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,081
from Wonju rice.

771
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:55,381
Wine.

772
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:56,381
That one.

773
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,821
(Becoming competitive)

774
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:01,591
Everyone except me will pair up. RYEOWOOK.

775
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:03,391
Why aren't you playing, SHINDONG?

776
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:04,661
Because he's bad at games.

777
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:07,461
I'm bad at games.

778
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:10,831
I'm good at hosting,
but not good at playing.

779
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,071
Team 1 will go first.

780
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:15,241
Team 1, raise your hands. One, two, three!

781
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:17,971
Team 1, raise your hands. One, two, three!

782
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:19,941
(Is YESUNG Team 1?)

783
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:21,941
(Turning, suddenly smiling)

784
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:24,611
(Mutual dislike)

785
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:26,481
Team 2, one, two, three.

786
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:27,351
Team 2.

787
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:30,121
(A game of wit suddenly starts.)

788
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:32,251
(I'm Team 2.)

789
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:33,491
Who is it? HEECHUL!

790
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:34,621
- Not me.
- No?

791
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,021
- RYEOWOOK?
- It's me.

792
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,031
Okay.

793
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:38,731
Team 3, one, two, three.

794
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:39,931
(SIWON picked Team 3)

795
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:41,201
(Someone's looking at me.)

796
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:42,831
(Team 3, SIWON and KYUHYUN)

797
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:44,301
Team 4.

798
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:45,401
(Team 4, HEECHUL and EUNHYUK)

799
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,571
Team 1 starts first. Please come out.

800
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:49,101
But SIWON is a bit...

801
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:50,971
like Sha Wujing who mishears things.

802
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:51,871
Sha Wujing is hilarious.

803
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,241
Like when I told him
to review the dance moves, and he said...

804
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,311
"You want me to rev what?"

805
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,651
He's not like Sha Wujing,
but Sha Wujing himself.

806
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:04,491
(While everyone teases SIWON,
they're enjoying the music.)

807
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:06,491
(LEETEUK and YESUNG are ready.)

808
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:07,861
YESUNG.

809
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:10,031
YESUNG, can you hear me?

810
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,031
- YESUNG.
- <i>Baby</i>

811
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:13,331
YESUNG, you idiot.

812
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,161
Hey, what are you looking at!

813
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:17,571
(Unified when teasing)

814
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:18,601
It's too loud.

815
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:19,941
Sensitive YESUNG.

816
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:20,601
(LEETEUK will be the one to explain.)

817
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:22,771
Ready, start.

818
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,741
(Let's begin with something easy.)

819
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:27,081
- Cleaning...
- No hands.

820
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:30,381
(Hands behind your back, please.)

821
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,481
(Eagle-eyed observation)

822
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:35,951
I don't clean.
This thing cleans automatically with AI.

823
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:38,451
If he says too much, YESUNG won't get it.

824
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:39,721
They're going to lose.

825
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:43,691
(What is he even talking about?)

826
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:45,531
It's an AI vacuum cleaner.

827
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,961
I can just use the app on my phone and...

828
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:48,661
Automatic cleaner?

829
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,201
LEETEUK should not mention
"vacuum cleaner."

830
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,131
Yes, something like that.

831
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:52,471
You mentioned "vacuum."

832
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:53,741
- Pass.
- Not allowed?

833
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,771
(Incheon Battle, this word?)

834
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,071
HEECHUL...

835
00:39:58,071 --> 00:39:59,711
and I...

836
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:00,741
AI vacuum cleaner.

837
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:02,181
fought here.

838
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:05,151
(Front row, best seat for the drama)

839
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:06,311
It's four syllables.

840
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:07,921
HEECHUL and I...

841
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,281
- Incheon Battle.
- here...

842
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,321
Correct.

843
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,721
- Incheon Battle.
- Here...

844
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,361
(LEETEUK just mentioned names
and YESUNG got it right.)

845
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,661
(Diet)

846
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:16,161
You do this all the time.

847
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:18,891
The thing you've been doing for 30 years.

848
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:20,361
Why is his voice so powerful?

849
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:21,461
You need to eat something.

850
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,501
(LEETEUK's booming MC voice)

851
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,671
For 30 years...

852
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:26,841
You need to eat something.

853
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,001
- The thing you do all the time.
- Singer.

854
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,641
The thing you do every day.

855
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:30,511
NBA basketball.

856
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,871
You're still doing it now.

857
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:33,041
- Music.
- He's so loud.

858
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,481
- You're still doing it.
- My ears hurt.

859
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:35,481
He's so loud.

860
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,251
(Sorry, but MC LEETEUK's talk show is
painful to hear.)

861
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:38,911
You may die if this becomes extreme.

862
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:41,281
- Listening to music.
- If you go extreme, you may die.

863
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:43,321
- What you're doing right now.
- Diet.

864
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,421
Diet. Correct.

865
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:46,391
Diet. Correct.

866
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:51,761
This was HEECHUL's nickname
when he was a trainee.

867
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:55,031
(Let me introduce HEECHUL at length.)

868
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,071
(What is he saying?)

869
00:40:58,071 --> 00:41:00,171
When it strikes 12, he has to go home.

870
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,271
Speak slowly.

871
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:02,641
He's bad at games.

872
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:05,171
I mean, why is he explaining like that?

873
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,781
Why say so much?

874
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,081
Pass.

875
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:09,081
Pass.

876
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:10,251
(Cuttlefish)

877
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,451
It lives in the ocean.

878
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:14,421
(Is this "A Story About The Day?")

879
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:15,981
You shouldn't explain like him.
That's wrong.

880
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,921
(MC LEETEUK's habits go lifelong.)

881
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,391
It lives in the ocean.

882
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,161
It ropes in the what?

883
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,861
It has ten legs.

884
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:25,791
- It has a shell inside.
- Ten legs. Squid.

885
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,431
(Finally)

886
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:28,401
It has ten legs,

887
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:30,631
but it's not just a squid.

888
00:41:30,631 --> 00:41:32,431
It's not just a squid.

889
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:34,301
- It's not what?
- Pass.

890
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:35,371
Pass.

891
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,211
(Not even close)

892
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:39,241
(Tug of war)

893
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:40,541
When we were kids,

894
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,181
we did this on field days.

895
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:43,181
When we were kids.

896
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:46,251
Heave-ho.

897
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:47,281
When we were kids.

898
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:50,291
Heave-ho.

899
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,291
Heave-ho. Tug of war.

900
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,191
- That's it.
- Correct.

901
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:55,591
That's how you're supposed to do it.

902
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:56,731
Like that.

903
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,591
(Bong Joon Ho)

904
00:41:58,591 --> 00:41:59,831
He's a director.

905
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,031
A famous Korean film director.

906
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,071

00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:20,281
(He's a director, too.)

913
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,921
(Not that director)

914
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:24,921

Listen properly.

918
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:30,331
You and I...

919
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:31,491
are called this.

920
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:32,531
- What?
- You and I?

921
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:33,931
You and I are called this.

922
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,001
- What?
- You and I?

923
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:36,401
You and I are called this.

924
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:38,271
- What?
- Old man.

925
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:39,371
- We're called this.
- Old man.

926
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:42,171
You and I are called this.

927
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:43,771
You and I. F4.

928
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:45,041
- F4.
- F4.

929
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,171
F4.

- That's it.

931
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:49,581
- He got it.

932
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,681
(Now they're in sync.)

933
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,211
It's something I like.

934
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:54,321
You go into the water and do this.

935
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,221
- I probably like it?
- Go in the water...

936
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:57,521
Go into the water.

937
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:58,551
Army stew.

938
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:00,421
What's with army stew?

939
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:02,321
- It's warm. It feels good.
- That's it, army stew!

940

Go into the water.

- Gymnastics.
- That's it.

944
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:11,731
- Yoga.
- Go into the water.

945
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:12,931
It feels good.

946
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:15,901
(Something refreshing in the bath)

947
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:18,571
It feels refreshing.

948
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:20,381
- Your body feels loose.
- Nap.

949
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:21,611
- That's right.
- It feels good.

950
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:24,811
(How do you explain something this good?)

951
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,681
What's that? What is he doing?

952
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,251
What is he doing?

953
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:29,551
Pass.

954
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:30,951
(He always understands "pass.")

955
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:32,751
(Blender)

956
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,161
Put in fruit...

957
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:37,061
Put in fruit and mix it in here.

958
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,691
Put in fruit and mix it in here.

959
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:40,801
Put food in here and mix it in here.

960
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,301
Whir.

961
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:43,531
Whir.

962
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:45,031
Whir.

963
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,031
Whir.

964
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:50,711
(Blender, bravo)

965
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,071
(What is that?)

966
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:54,511
- Fly.
- You put it in and mix it.

967
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:56,711
(Flies buzz.)

968
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:59,911
(Human blender)

969
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,551
Grind.

970
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:02,651
- Go.
- Grind.

971
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:04,091
Grind food.

972
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:05,691
What's with his vocal cords?

973
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:07,191
His vocal cords are strong.

974
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:08,261
Grind.

975
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,061
(Indestructible vocal cords)

976
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:12,431
(All he can hear is whir.)

977
00:44:12,431 --> 00:44:13,601
(What is that?)

978
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:14,601
Grind food.

979
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,861
Pass.

980
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,431
Time is up.

981
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:19,801
(How many did they get right?)

982
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:21,671
If you explain that much...

983
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:23,341
But they did well. They got five correct.

984
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:25,741
- We got them right?
- That's a lot.

985
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:26,611
We got them right?

986
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:28,281
(They got more than expected.)

987
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:29,441
This is hard.

988
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:30,581
You couldn't hear at all?

989
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:32,051
- You could hear a bit, right?
- Not at all.

990
00:44:32,051 --> 00:44:33,251
Not even a little.

991
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:36,621
If you can't hear,
I don't even need to make noise.

992
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:38,221
- That's right.
- No need to speak loudly.

993
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:39,691
Lip reading is what matters.

994
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:41,691
They're rehearsing in the back right now.

995
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,331
Taste good?

996
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:46,731
(Already not in sync)

997
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:50,031
(Next is RYEOWOOK and DONGHAE.)

998
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:51,301
Did you wear earplugs?

999
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:52,731
The song's good.

1000
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,841
Right? It's nice.

1001
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:55,271
(Excited)

1002
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:56,541
Good song.

1003
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,341
Okay, let's go. Ready.

1004
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:01,481
- Hands behind your back.
- Ready, start.

1005
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,381
(Carbonara)

1006
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,751
It's pasta.

1007
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:06,251
- Paste.
- It's pasta.

1008
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:07,521
- Past?
- It's a white pasta.

1009
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:09,181
- Hermes?
- White.

1010
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,951
(Nice going)

1011
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,391
That's it.

1012
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:14,361
- White.
- While.

1013
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:16,561
- It's white.
- It's right.

1014
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:17,461
What?

1015
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:20,131
(My goodness)

1016
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:22,631
They're not getting even one.

1017
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:24,931
Egg-based pasta.

1018
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,731
- Past.
- Yes, it's past.

1019
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:28,341
- Why past?
- We all have a past.

1020
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:29,441
Five syllables.

1021
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:30,471
Fine celeb?

1022
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:31,641
(No way)

1023
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:32,611
Yes, you're a fine celeb.

1024
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:35,011
(Fine celeb?)

1025
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:35,981
Five syllables.

1026
00:45:35,981 --> 00:45:37,011
Fine celeb.

1027
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:39,711
You two are fine celebs.

1028
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,321
- Pasta.
- Past.

1029
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,081
(Let's stop.)

1030
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:44,751
(All he knows is "past.")

1031
00:45:45,591 --> 00:45:47,691
But his lips show three syllables.

1032
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:48,721
Really skinny...

1033
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,031
influencer from the past.

1034
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:53,191
(He was an influencer, yes.)

1035
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,961
- Influencer.
- Back then, an influencer?

1036
00:45:55,661 --> 00:45:57,631
He goes inside that tennis thing.

1037
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,471
- What?
- He goes inside.

1038
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:01,701
He fits.

1039
00:46:01,701 --> 00:46:02,841
You fit?

1040
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:04,141
Yes, his body fits.

1041
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,741
Body fits.

1042
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:06,811
His body goes through.

1043
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:08,541
(Finally catching a clue)

1044
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,311
It's four syllables.

1045
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:11,311
What?

1046
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,711
(Angry glare)

1047
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:13,681
Body goes in.

1048
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:14,821
He's angry.

1049
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:16,851
- He's angry.
- Four syllables.

1050
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:17,951
Four syllables.

1051
00:46:17,951 --> 00:46:19,191
Body goes in.

1052
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:24,331
(Yes, someone whose body fits inside.)

1053
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:26,261
Whirlpool.

1054
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:27,261
It's a guy.

1055
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:30,331
- What is he saying?
- A guy.

1056
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:31,331
A guy.

1057
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:33,101
- Ugly?
- A guy.

1058
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:35,971
<i>You don't know men</i>

1059
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:37,171
It's a guy.

1060
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:38,941
(Losing it)

1061
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:41,011
(Eventually, pass)

1062
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:43,081
("Squid Game")

1063
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:44,981
- Netflix.
- Producer Na Yeong Seok.

1064
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:46,911
- Yes, number one on Netflix.
- Producer Na Yeong Seok.

1065
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:49,081
(A familiar name appears.)

1066
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:51,721
(I'm not really laughing inside.)

1067
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:52,991
Producer Na Yeong Seok.

1068
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:54,321
(Focusing up)

1069
00:46:54,321 --> 00:46:55,591

1070
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:57,031
- Lee.
- Lee Jung Jae.

1071
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,031

Lee Hyuk Jae.

1073
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,001
Lee Hyuk Jae.

1074
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:03,401
- What?
- Drama.

1075
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:05,101
- Drama.
- Yes.

1076
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,401
- Lee Jung Jae.
- Lee Hyuk Jae.

1077
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:07,241
- Lee Sung Jae.
- That's it.

1078
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,241
- Lee Jung Jae.
- Lee Hyuk Jae.

1079
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:10,441
(No, I mean me.)

1080
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,771
- Lee Hyuk Jae.
- Lee Sung Jae.

1081
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:13,571
Stop.

1082
00:47:13,571 --> 00:47:14,681
Stop!

1083
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:16,441
Stop!

1084
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:17,551
Stop!

1085
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:18,751
No, it's "Freeze."

1086
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,581
Isn't it "stop?"

1087
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:21,051
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

1088
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,281
Stop?

1089
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:23,581
"Peppermint Candy."

1090
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:24,551
Seol Kyung Gu.

1091
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,651
(Already communicated perfectly)

1092
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:28,521
- Why "Peppermint Candy?"
- "Peppermint Candy."

1093
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:29,821
Five syllables.

1094
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:30,831
Five syllables.

1095
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:32,691
- Ye...
- Five syllables.

1096
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:34,231
YESUNG.

1097
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:36,231
- YESUNG.
- Why mention YESUNG?

1098
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,201
(Given up)

1099
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,001
(Clear-eyed psycho)

1100
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:44,641
(This is easy.)

1101
00:47:44,641 --> 00:47:46,671
It's a trendy Millennials and Gen Z word.

1102
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:48,081
This?

1103
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:49,881
This is an Millennials and Gen Z word?

1104
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:51,211
It's a popular Millennials
and Gen Z word these days.

1105
00:47:51,211 --> 00:47:52,411
- Military discharge.
- Yes.

1106
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,321
- Military discharge.
- It's a shortened version.

1107
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:56,351
(Look into my eyes.)

1108
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:57,751
Eyes.

1109
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,851
- Your eyes are red.
- Eyes.

1110
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,391
Eyes.

1111
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:04,031
Your eyes look super clear like this.

1112
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:05,191
But you're crazy.

1113
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:06,731
- Your eyes are crazy.
- Crazy.

1114
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:07,901
- Now shorten that.
- Crazy.

1115
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:12,171
(When your eyes are crazy, trendy slang)

1116
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:14,741
Kill someone?

1117
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:16,101
- Who?
- DONGHAE...

1118
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,841
He doesn't know this word.

1119
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:19,841
- He doesn't know this expression.
- He doesn't know this expression.

1120
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:22,841
(Looking for someone to kill)

1121
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,651
- Shorten it.
- Who?

1122
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:26,711
(Frustrated with each other)

1123
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:28,681
Who are you trying to kill?

1124
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:32,221
(Just don't shorten it.)

1125
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:34,561
This round is doomed.

1126
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:35,791
But RYEOWOOK explains really well.

1127
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,491
He's explaining great,
but DONGHAE can't get it.

1128
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:39,861
(Enjoying the show with popcorn)

1129
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,561
(Tadpole)

1130
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:42,331
This one's easy.

1131
00:48:42,331 --> 00:48:43,601
A frog...

1132
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,831
- What?
- Frog.

1133
00:48:44,831 --> 00:48:45,831
Frog.

1134
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:48,071
When a frog is a baby.

1135
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,371
- What?
- A frog.

1136
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:50,371
A frog.

1137
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:51,741
When it's a baby.

1138
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:53,771
- Haeng-daeng.
- Yes. What's that?

1139
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:56,111
(What's wrong with him?)

1140
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:58,851
DONGHAE doesn't speak Korean well.

1141
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:01,681
Even without the headset,
he wouldn't get it.

1142
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:02,721
Haeng-daeng.

1143
00:49:02,721 --> 00:49:04,491
(Miscommunication)

1144
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:07,891
(What does "haeng-daeng" mean?)

1145
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:10,361
What becomes a frog later?

1146
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,261
Frog haeng-daeng?

1147
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:13,491
A frog turns from what?

1148
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:14,801
He's only good-looking.

1149
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,161
Let's take off his headset.

1150
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,431
Hey, you should be thankful
to SUPER JUNIOR.

1151
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:20,941
I have no idea what you're saying.

1152
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,271
(RYEOWOOK and DONGHAE end here.)

1153
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:24,141
- They got one point, right?
- Sorry.

1154
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:27,681
(Zero points)

1155
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:31,281
You explained well,
but DONGHAE knew nothing.

1156
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,721
DONGHAE, do you know
what "clear-eyed psycho" means?

1157
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:36,181
No.

1158
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,451
- He doesn't know the word.
- He doesn't know.

1159
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:39,251
(Told you so)

1160
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:40,091
He doesn't know
what "clear-eyed psycho" means.

1161
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:41,961
- Next team, go.
- But seriously,

1162
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:44,291
- you really can't hear a thing.
- I told you.

1163
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,261
- When you try it, you hear nothing.
- You can't hear at all.

1164
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:46,361
You can hear nothing.

1165
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,761
(SIWON and KYUHYUN are ready.)

1166
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:50,701
(Can he redeem his Sha Wujing reputation?)

1167
00:49:51,171 --> 00:49:52,201
Hands behind back.

1168
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,031
(He's sensitive about that.)

1169
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,571
Start.

1170
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:55,541
(Sesame oil)

1171
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,741
When cooking,

1172
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:58,841
Doinada.

1173
00:49:58,841 --> 00:49:59,811
Cooking.

1174
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:02,981
(Being Sha Wujing from the start)

1175
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:04,211
What's with him?

1176
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:05,981
- Doi?
- He has no idea.

1177
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:07,351
This team's doomed too.

1178
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:10,151
- Yoi?
- Cooking.

1179
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:12,021
- Cooking.
- Yes, when cooking...

1180
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,191
(This won't be easy.)

1181
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:16,121
KYUHYUN already looks like he gave up.

1182
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:17,361
Three syllables.

1183
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:19,061
(KYUHYUN exaggerates
the mouth movements for clarity.)

1184
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,461
(Analyzing)

1185
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:21,461
Sweet.

1186
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:23,061
Sweet.

1187
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:26,071
Three syllables.

1188
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,141
(Delayed output from SIWON)

1189
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:31,471
(This needs to be recorded.)

1190
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:33,811
- Like for fried rice...
- Chicken?

1191
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:34,941
The explanations shouldn't be long.

1192
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:36,181
- You add it at the end for fried rice.
- No.

1193
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:37,581
- Too fast.
- Fried rice.

1194
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:38,951
When you go to a BBQ place,

1195
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:40,921
- Cucumber.
- BBQ place.

1196
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:42,051
Five times two?

1197
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:43,221
(Why the multiplication table?)

1198
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:45,091
- Times table.
- BBQ place.

1199
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:46,391
(Trying hard to interpret)

1200
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:49,161
In the end, you mix it with this.

1201
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:51,191
(Blank stare)

1202
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:52,261
In the end,

1203
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,231
(Processing overload)

1204
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:56,531
(Eventually, pass)

1205
00:50:58,001 --> 00:50:59,231
Explaining is hard.

1206
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:00,741
Right? This is hard.

1207
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:02,401
When we went to Busan,

1208
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:03,441
Busan International Film Festival.

1209
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:04,711
When we went to Busan,

1210
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:06,441
He only hears what he wants to.

1211
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:09,781
What do you pass by in a car?

1212
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:11,211
Rice soup.

1213
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:12,411
- No.
- Cow head soup.

1214
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:13,611
- Cow head soup?
- Out of nowhere?

1215
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,481
- In a car.
- What's with him?

1216
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:16,581
Soju?

1217
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:18,121
(What is that?)

1218
00:51:18,121 --> 00:51:19,421
That was so random.

1219
00:51:19,421 --> 00:51:21,291
All he knows is Busan.

1220
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,131
He's a fool who only knows Busan.

1221
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:25,791
In a car.

1222
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,061
- Haeundae?
- Car.

1223
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:28,201
(He's not even trying to listen
to KYUHYUN.)

1224
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:29,431
They're totally not communicating.

1225
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:31,431
(A true icon of miscommunication)

1226
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:32,631
You go by car.

1227
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,631
What?

1228
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:35,101
(How does he not get this?)

1229
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:36,301
Four syllables.

1230
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:39,311
(Guessing from reading his lips)

1231
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:40,311
Sweet?

1232
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:41,781
Four syllables.

1233
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,611
(Frustrated and even stomping)

1234
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:46,311
KYUHYUN is struggling.

1235
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,151
- Skip to the next one.
- No, by car...

1236
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,381
(So funny)

1237
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:51,551
By car.

1238
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:53,321
(He said "car" 8,823 times.)

1239
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:54,821
Don't you know "car?"

1240
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:58,091
(Super angry)

1241
00:51:58,091 --> 00:51:59,591
Car.

1242
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:00,931
- Car.
- Sleep tight.

1243
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:04,001
(ELFs, sleep tight.)

1244
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:07,231
Zaza?

1245
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:08,571
"Inside the Bus?"

1246
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,571
(This isn't a music quiz.)

1247
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:13,011
You go to Busan and Daegu, right?

1248
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,481
Not being able to use your hands
makes it harder.

1249
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,511
What do you take to go there?

1250
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,081
What do you take?

1251
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:18,081
Train.

1252
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,511
- Plane.
- Car.

1253
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,121
- Bus.
- I said car.

1254
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:24,191
- I said it's a car.
- Just pass it.

1255
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,351
Move on. He doesn't know.

1256
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,651
This is frustrating.

1257
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:27,621
(KARINA)

1258
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:28,661
(This person?)

1259
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:33,731
(The leader of the globally popular aespa)

1260
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:35,461
aespa.

1261
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:37,231
(He should know this one.)

1262
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,501
(Can SIWON understand "aespa?")

1263
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:40,501
Spa?

1264
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:42,541
(Don't say that.)

1265
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,271
(A true icon of miscommunication)

1266
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:45,971
- Spa what?
- aespa.

1267
00:52:45,971 --> 00:52:46,871
A spa.

1268
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:48,941
(aespa should last forever.)

1269
00:52:48,941 --> 00:52:51,281
SIWON is hilarious.

1270
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:53,051
I can't read your lips at all.

1271
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:55,851
<i>I'm on the next level</i>

1272
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:58,951
(Warning, body hint)

1273
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:00,651
"Amor Fati?" What?

1274
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:02,861
(Dance hints don't help.)

1275
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:04,961
- <i>Su-su-su Supernova</i>
- "Supernova?"

1276
00:53:04,961 --> 00:53:05,961
aespa.

1277
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,401
(Is he finally getting it?)

1278
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:10,871
WINTER, KARINA, GISELLE, NINGNING.

1279
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:12,301
(He finally got one right.)

1280
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:13,901
(Soy sauce crab)

1281
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,501
(Sigh)

1282
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:17,041
This one's hard.

1283
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,211
(How will KYUHYUN explain this?)

1284
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:19,171
Rice thief.

1285
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:20,911
(Simple explanation
as expected of the expert game player)

1286
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,581
Rice thief. Soy sauce crab.

1287
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:24,251
- Yes.
- Soy sauce crab.

1288
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:25,811
(SIWON and KYUHYUN score two in a row.)

1289
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:27,181
Well done.

1290
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:28,781
(Indonesia)

1291
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:30,851
That country.

1292
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:32,151
- What?
- Country.

1293
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:33,621
- Love?
- Country.

1294
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:36,021
The country you did lots of ads in.

1295
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:37,121
In the past.

1296
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:38,191
You.

1297
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:40,091
- There.
- What you loved in the past.

1298
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,531
America.

1299
00:53:41,531 --> 00:53:42,861
- Ads.
- Ads?

1300
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:44,331
- Yes.
- Ads? Love?

1301
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:46,371
(This content is advertiser-friendly.)

1302
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:47,971
He loves ads so much.

1303
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:49,171
Just say everything.

1304
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:51,241
- Thailand?
- Not Thailand, another country.

1305
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,441
Not Thailand. Indonesia.

1306
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:53,571
- That's right.
- Okay.

1307
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:56,111
(A surprising streak,
three correct so far)

1308
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:58,251
(Password)

1309
00:53:58,251 --> 00:53:59,581
When you go home...

1310
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:02,351
Two days ago. A few days ago.

1311
00:54:02,351 --> 00:54:04,121
(He never gets it right at first.)

1312
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:06,221
No, when going into the house.

1313
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:07,561
What?

1314
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,061
(Sorry, could you repeat that?)

1315
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,831
You're supposed to not hear it.

1316
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,491
Try saying it slowly.

1317
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:13,631
At home.

1318
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:15,061
- Home.
- When you go home.

1319
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:16,231
When you go home.

1320
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:18,101
(Successful interpretation)

1321
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:19,201
What do you press?

1322
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,301
What do I press? Bell.

1323
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:21,271
Doorbell.

1324
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:23,401
(He's naming every pressable thing.)

1325
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:24,741
(SIWON's brain is working overtime today.)

1326
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,211
- Door lock.
- You press it.

1327
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:27,441
Gate. Password.

1328
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:29,211
- There it is. Yes.
- Password. Okay.

1329
00:54:29,211 --> 00:54:31,351
(Full moon)

1330
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:33,211
- Moon.
- Good.

1331
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:35,321
(Lip shape is perfect.)

1332
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:36,521
(If it's not the moon...)

1333
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:37,321
Food?

1334
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:38,951
(Why that face?)

1335
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,361
- Moon.
- Soon.

1336
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,021
- Moon.
- Boon.

1337
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,631
(SIWON is unbeatable.)

1338
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:47,901
(I'm frustrated too. What is it?)

1339
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:50,801
- Moon.
- Soon. Loon. Boon.

1340
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:51,671
(He's saying everything but moon.)

1341
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:54,801
(Speaking with facial expressions)

1342
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:57,711
(Facial muscles working hard today)

1343
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,841
(So funny they can't breathe)

1344
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,211
- Moon.
- Moon.

1345
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:03,481
Moonwalk? What is it?

1346
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:05,081
Moon, the round thing.

1347
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:07,011
(Time's up.
SIWON and KYUHYUN scored four points)

1348
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:08,151
What was it?

1349
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:09,221
(Speechless)

1350
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:11,751
(SIWON and KYUHYUN win in laughs.)

1351
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:14,021
Okay, we got the funniest part.

1352
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:16,821
(A round of applause
for the two who suffered)

1353
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:18,461
You guys must be under pressure now.

1354
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:23,061
That's why we'll ditch the humor
and just go for it.

1355
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:24,101
No, it still needs to be funny.

1356
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:25,101
Let's just get the answers.

1357
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:27,331
(Ace mode ON.
Last team HEECHUL and EUNHYUK)

1358
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:29,641
(Can they live up to their confidence?)

1359
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:31,471
(Epilation.
A hard one right from the start)

1360
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:34,041
(How will he explain this?)

1361
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,581
- Hair.
- Hair.

1362
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:37,211
- Remove it.
- Reduce it?

1363
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:39,581
(Showing off his hair)

1364
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:41,081
- Hair.
- Hair.

1365
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:42,751
- Remove.
- Remove?

1366
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:43,521
Yes.

1367
00:55:43,521 --> 00:55:45,521
(They said they'd skip the jokes,
but this is hilarious too.)

1368
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:47,521
Yes. Two syllables.

1369
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:52,191
- Waxing?
- Yes, but say it differently.

1370
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:53,291
Brazilian?

1371
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,531
No.

1372
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:55,201
Not that.

1373
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:57,601
No. Hair.

1374
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,871
- Not waxing.
- Waxing.

1375
00:55:59,871 --> 00:56:01,371
- Not waxing.
- Not that.

1376
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:02,471
What's the word?

1377
00:56:02,471 --> 00:56:03,871
- What is it?
- Two syllables.

1378
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:04,871
Epilation.

1379
00:56:04,871 --> 00:56:05,911
Okay.

1380
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:08,541
(Ace mode kicking in?)

1381
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:10,041
Solid.

1382
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,381
Sound.

1383
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:12,781
Solid.

1384
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:13,951
Sounding?

1385
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:15,251
Solid.

1386
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:16,421
Solid.

1387
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:17,481
Song.

1388
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:21,361
<i>You trust me</i>

1389
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:24,121
(He's almost there.)

1390
00:56:24,121 --> 00:56:25,331
Song.

1391
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:26,361
- Song.
- Four syllables.

1392
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:27,961
"Holding The End Of This Night."

1393
00:56:27,961 --> 00:56:29,801
- "Meant To Be."
- Correct.

1394
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:31,471
I wouldn't have gotten that.

1395
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:35,101
(Facial expression acting.
What's the word?)

1396
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,741
(Guess who this is.)

1397
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:37,771
Kim Byung Ok.

1398
00:56:37,771 --> 00:56:38,811
- That's right.
- Correct.

1399
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:39,911
Kim Byung Ok.

1400
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:41,311
(Guessed in a flash by the face)

1401
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:43,911
You copied his expression.

1402
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:45,311
He didn't explain anything in words.

1403
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:48,851
(The looks are a talent too.)

1404
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:51,291
- Became rich.
- Went to Busan.

1405
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:52,621
Suddenly rich.

1406
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:53,951
A man in Busan.

1407
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:54,991
Four syllables.

1408
00:56:56,091 --> 00:56:57,321
Expressway.

1409
00:56:57,321 --> 00:56:59,061
That's right.

1410
00:56:59,061 --> 00:56:59,991
To Busan.

1411
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:01,931
Why couldn't you guess "expressway?"

1412
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:04,671
- Suddenly got rich.
- Suddenly in Busan.

1413
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,001
(Cry)

1414
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,001
Seagull?

1415
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:09,271
Lotto.

1416
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:10,741
- Allowance.
- Lotto.

1417
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:13,141
(Fell into the pit of "allowance")

1418
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,611
(Nouveau rich)

1419
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:15,741
Four syllables.

1420
00:57:15,741 --> 00:57:16,911
Four syllables.

1421
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:18,181
Pass.

1422
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:19,181
Too hard.

1423
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,751
(Presbyopia)

1424
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:22,621
You can't see well.

1425
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:23,621
You can't see well.

1426
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:25,121
Because of age.

1427
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:26,121
Presbyopia.

1428
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,321
(Ace mode, already four questions right
for HEECHUL and EUNHYUK)

1429
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,231
(Pumpkin sweet potato)

1430
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:32,561
(Pumpkin potato?)

1431
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:34,131
Pumpkin sweet potato.

1432
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:35,961
(Pumpkin sweet potato. Happy now?)

1433
00:57:35,961 --> 00:57:39,031
(He said the answer, so he failed.)

1434
00:57:39,031 --> 00:57:41,101
- Anus.
- Ay.

1435
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:43,301
- Anus.
- Ache.

1436
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:45,841
When your anus is sticking out a little.

1437
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,741
(He loves this explanation.)

1438
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,041
- The anus.
- The ache.

1439
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,751
- It's a little out.
- A little out.

1440
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:54,481
- Anus.
- An.

1441
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:55,451
Anus.

1442
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:57,381
- Anus?
- Anus.

1443
00:57:57,381 --> 00:57:59,791
Why are these words so nasty?

1444
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,161
- Anus.
- Anus.

1445
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:03,291
(He can't believe the word he just said.)

1446
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,361
Is "anus" right?

1447
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:07,231
- It's a bit out.
- It's a bit out?

1448
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,561
You can't sit down.

1449
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:10,801
- You can't sit down.
- You can't sit down.

1450
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:12,531
You can't sit?

1451
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,541
- Hemorrhoids?
- Correct.

1452
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,541
Correct.

1453
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:17,371
EUNHYUK guesses well.

1454
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:18,541
(MBTI)

1455
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,641
Hemorrhoids?

1456
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:21,281
He's still talking about that.

1457
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,641
- I.
- I.

1458
00:58:22,641 --> 00:58:24,081
- S.
- S.

1459
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:25,711
- N.
- N.

1460
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,381
- P.
- P.

1461
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:29,481
What's that?

1462
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:30,921
- MBTI.
- That's right.

1463
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:32,621
That's right.

1464
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:33,791
(Dry sauna)

1465
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,321
Super TV.

1466
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,891
- Super.
- TV.

1467
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:38,961
- Super TV.
- We went there.

1468
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:40,091
A celebrity went?

1469
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,431
(Yes, we're celebrities.)

1470
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:43,701
- Here.
- Here.

1471
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:45,101
"It's hot."

1472
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:47,031
(Cry)

1473
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:47,901
Sauna.

1474
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:49,741
- Not that one.
- Kiln sauna.

1475
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:50,671
Not that.

1476
00:58:50,671 --> 00:58:52,171
(EUNHYUK buffering)

1477
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:53,211
Sauna. Kiln sauna.

1478
00:58:53,211 --> 00:58:54,271
Three syllables.

1479
00:58:54,271 --> 00:58:55,141
What do you call it?

1480
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:56,381
Sauna. Kiln sauna.

1481
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:57,641
Bathhouse.

1482
00:58:57,641 --> 00:58:58,951
- Dry sauna.
- That's it.

1483
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:02,381
(With seven questions right, HEECHUL and
EUNHYUK are definitely in first place.)

1484
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:04,991
(No trespassing)

1485
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:06,321
You can't come in.

1486
00:59:06,321 --> 00:59:07,221
You can't come in.

1487
00:59:07,221 --> 00:59:08,821
Do not enter.

1488
00:59:09,891 --> 00:59:12,761
- Is it dirty?
- A four-character idiom.

1489
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:13,791
Is that an idiom?

1490
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,601
Four syllables.

1491
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:16,731
- That's an idiom?
- Yes, it is.

1492
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:17,971
Do not enter.

1493
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,071
Do not enter.

1494
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:20,401
Four syllables.

1495
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:22,301
- No trespassing.
- That's it.

1496
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:23,041
They're good.

1497
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,971
(The true ace team, HEECHUL and EUNHYUK)

1498
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,611
My wife.

1499
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:30,181
- My wife's dad.
- My wife had.

1500
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:34,111
(My wife had what?)

1501
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:35,651
- Ex-wife?
- That's it.

1502
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:37,851
(The wife he had, so ex-wife)

1503
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:38,951
Four syllables.

1504
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,251
(Why are they laughing?)

1505
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,621
My wife.

1506
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,721
(They're aces,
but still love being funny.)

1507
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:45,061
- My wife.
- Her dad.

1508
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:47,061
- Had.
- Ex-wife. That's it.

1509
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:49,461
(Isn't that an ex-wife?)

1510
00:59:50,231 --> 00:59:52,131
- Wife you had?
- Yes.

1511
00:59:52,471 --> 00:59:53,431
(Completely different responses)

1512
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:55,701
(No matter how I think about it,
only one answer fits.)

1513
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:57,241
My wife's dad.

1514
00:59:57,241 --> 00:59:58,471
Ex-boyfriend?

1515
00:59:58,471 --> 00:59:59,671
Ex-boyfriend?

1516
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:01,741
(Frustrated)

1517
01:00:01,741 --> 01:00:03,511
- Dad.
- Had.

1518
01:00:03,511 --> 01:00:04,511
Dad.

1519
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:06,681
(He finally gets "dad.")

1520
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:08,051
(My wife's dad)

1521
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:09,181
Husband's father.

1522
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:13,921
(He's still the only one
who doesn't get what's funny.)

1523
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:15,061
Father-in-law.

1524
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:17,831
(He guessed father-in-law right
at the buzzer.)

1525
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:20,591
- They got nine correct?
- We got a lot.

1526
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:24,901
Shouting in Silence,
HEECHUL and EUNHYUK win first place.

1527
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:27,871
(The undeniable ace team,
HEECHUL and EUNHYUK)

1528
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:29,471
But EUNHYUK really guessed well.

1529
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:33,411
(The winners get
a special product from Wonju.)

1530
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:34,471
From Wonju.

1531
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:37,211
And because I hosted so well,
I'll take one too.

1532
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:39,051
(SHINDONG worked hard too.)

1533
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:40,811
We love you, Wonju.

1534
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:43,181
(Celebrating winning the first game)

1535
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,751
Everyone,
you're starting to feel hungry, right?

1536
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:47,151
(Chefs RYEOWOOK and SIWON
will take charge of dinner.)

1537
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:48,391
(Appetizing)

1538
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,321
(Is it okay to be this good?)

1539
01:00:50,321 --> 01:00:52,361
RYEOWOOK cooked a lot
back when we lived in the dorm.

1540
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,301
(The cooking brings back memories
of dorm life.)

1541
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:55,431
Let's go back to dorm life.

1542
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:58,631
(And the highlight of the MT)

1543
01:00:58,631 --> 01:01:00,671
(A moment to express feelings
to each other)

1544
01:01:00,671 --> 01:01:02,101
Can't we wash somewhere else?

1545
01:01:02,101 --> 01:01:03,241
(Why not?)

1546
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:04,641
(Embarrassment)

1547
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:05,971
(Crying)

1548
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,981
Don't ever do something like this again.

1549
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:10,081
We failed to accept differences.

1550
01:01:10,081 --> 01:01:13,681
(But now,
sincerely opening up to each other)

1551
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:17,351
(The time they shared together
can't be measured in numbers.)

1552
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:19,721
I hope you guys remain my forever friends.

1553
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:22,693

shining with SUPER JUNIOR's friendship)
