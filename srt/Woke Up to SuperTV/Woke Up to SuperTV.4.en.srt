1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
(The search for a partner continues.)

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,370
(The flirting is even more upgraded.)

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,640
(Heart fluttering)

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,080
(Flirting everywhere)

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,840
(HEECHUL, who didn't receive any flirting,
explodes with jealousy.)

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,010
(It's finally time
to choose a meal partner.)

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,350
(Who wants to eat with me?)

8
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,650
(EUNHYUK, SHINDONG)

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,880
(RYEOWOOK, LEETEUK)

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,450
(DONGHAE, KYUHYUN successfully matched)

11
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,490
(And HEECHUL is left alone.)

12
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,150
(Matched couples enjoy
a cozy meal together.)

13
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,390
Couldn't you feel my gaze?

14
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,320
(Shy)

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,460
One, two, three.

16
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,290
- Ho Chi Minh.
- Ho Chi Minh.

17
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,430
(Full of excitement)

18
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,090
(Someone is completely forgotten
in this romantic atmosphere.)

19
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,600
(I can't just stand by.)

20
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,730
(Attempting to sabotage)

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,370
(Rice grain attack)

22
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,600
(Water attack)

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,440
(HEECHUL disturbs them only .)

24
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,540
It feels like a huge conspiracy.

25
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,840
My pride is hurt.

26
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,710
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

27
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,780
Did you all enjoy your meal?

28
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,380
- Yes.
- Of course.

29
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,680
Actually...

30
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,720
(Interested)

31
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,590
There were several people
I wanted to talk to.

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,290
(Who? Me?)

33
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,030
I feel like I haven't yet.

34
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,160
Should we proceed physically?

35
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,530
How about we do something like that?

36
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,870
A game.

37
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,970
You seem to like games.

38
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,240
I love games.

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,310
What game are we playing?

40
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,310
What's that?

41
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,880
The first game is...

42
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,510
Paper flowers.

43
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,510
What's that game?

44
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,950
Dried persimmons.

45
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,820
(A hat with dried persimmon?)

46
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,150
- I see.
- We have to open it.

47
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,300
(Eat the dried persimmon
hanging from the hat first to win.)

48
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,630
I like people who are competitive.

49
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,600
I do agree.

50
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,640
Being good at games can also be charming.

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,940
(But...)

52
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,210
I don't like dried persimmons.

53
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,110
But you have to eat it to win.

54
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,940
EUNHYUK, don't you like dried persimmons?

55
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,980
No.

56
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,620
Since I won't eat it,
I can give it to someone else.

57
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,350
- I don't like it, either.
- Really?

58
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,750
Aren't we a good match, then?

59
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,820
(You two had matching snack preferences.
How was it?)

60
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,660
I like him.

61
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,690
That man really...

62
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,390
has no flaws, so far.

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,460
Very charming.

64
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,900
(They discover another thing in common.)

65
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,300
I like dried persimmons.

66
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,340
- Really?
- You like them?

67
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,470
I love them.

68
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,110
(He likes dried persimmons?)

69
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,310
This game seems
like it will show some sexiness.

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,710
What kind of sexiness?

71
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,920
Are you going to use your tongue?

72
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,120
The tongue needs to reach
where your lips can't.

73
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,720
EUNHYUK, you have a long tongue,
don't you? I saw earlier.

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,820
My special talent is having a long tongue.

75
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,360
- Show us.
- I can touch my nose with my tongue.

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,460
(Checking, interested)

77
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,730
(EUNHYUK suddenly shows off
probably wanting to show RYEOWOOK.)

78
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,730
(Will they find this charming?)

79
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,470
(What do you think?)

80
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,570
(Disgusted)

81
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,880
What's wrong with you?

82
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,280
You ate with that tongue, didn't you?

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,650
That's gross.

84
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,550
It's touching my nose, not yours.

85
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,020
(My goodness)

86
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,350
You're the worst.

87
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,290
(Is this bad?)

88
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,490
Actually, I can't forget
my first love easily.

89
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,130
So I was considering EUNHYUK until then,

90
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,160
but somehow,

91
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,600
my feelings were fading.

92
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,630
I've started losing interest.

93
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,400
Then at night, if your nose itches,

94
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
do you scratch it with your tongue?

95
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,210
How rude.

96
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,080
You may get lazy.

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
Do you pick your nose with your tongue?

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,480
- What are you saying?
- Like an elephant.

99
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,720
(EUNHYUK gets teased after showing off.)

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,850
We need to divide
into a team of four and three.

101
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,350
(Will they be able
to show off their charms?)

102
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,220
(Group 1 preliminaries
transformed into flower boys.)

103
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,860
This looks too easy.

104
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,890
It's right in front of my nose.

105
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,660
(KYUHYUN and EUNHYUK are confident
for some reason.)

106
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,960
It looks hard now that I'm standing.

107
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

108
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,530
Are you all four ready?

109
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,170
(Who will be the two
to make it to the finals?)

110
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,210
(Start)

111
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,710
(Almost there)

112
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,240
(Almost)

113
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,580
It's hard.

114
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,850
(Then...)

115
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,050
(The giraffe tongue appears.)

116
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,120
(It's actually useful.)

117
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,960
(Persistently appealing
with the long giraffe tongue)

118
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,260
(That tongue is useful.)

119
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,800
(Meanwhile, someone can't even reach
the persimmon.)

120
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,760
This is hard.

121
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,160
(This guy is even headbanging.)

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,370
(Where is it?)

123
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,070
(Just then)

124
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,170
(Straight to the eye)

125
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,210
Was that on purpose?

126
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,110
(His eye is swollen.)

127
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,010
Are you okay?

128
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,080
- Such bad manners.
- I was just trying hard, sorry.

129
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,190
(He's laughing too hard.)

130
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,750
(Focusing again with a swollen eye)

131
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,060
My eye still hurts.

132
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,760
I got hit by KYUHYUN's persimmon
and my eye still hurts.

133
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,560
Meanwhile,

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
LEETEUK and EUNHYUK...

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,270
(The two rush toward the persimmon.)

136
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,000
(I will eat it no matter what.)

137
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,810
(Suddenly frozen?)

138
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,410
(A beast knows to wait for its prey.)

139
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,910
(Now's the time.)

140
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,780
(Will the beast catch its prey?)

141
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,350
(Failed to hunt)

142
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,220
(He can't even play games.)

143
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,220
(Focusing with a swollen eye)

144
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,720
(Got it)

145
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,560
(Successful like a fish caught by a hook)

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,860
(Amazed)

147
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,700
- Did you eat it?
- It's all inside my mouth.

148
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,600
(I'm so hilarious.)

149
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,670
That's hilarious.

150
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,680
(Your Highness,
I'm overwhelmed with your grace.)

151
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,340
That's so funny.

152
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,280
(HEECHUL advances to the finals first.)

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,050
One more person can enter the finals.

154
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,020
(Now, it's a three-way battle.)

155
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,650
(EUNHYUK resets with the giraffe tongue.)

156
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,920
(Did it go in?)

157
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,020
(Bounced off the teeth)

158
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,260
What are you doing?

159
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,530
(Hitting someone's eye again)

160
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,270
(KYUHYUN teases EUNHYUK lightly.)

161
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,640
(Meanwhile,
the beast only targets the prey.)

162
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,140
(Focused)

163
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,340
(This is the chance.)

164
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,380
(Will he snatch it?)

165
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,780
(Successful hunt)

166
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,420
LEETEUK made it.

167
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,220
- It's hard.
- Yes.

168
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,860
(He's reluctant to take off his hat.)

169
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,630
(HEECHUL and LEETEUK advance
to the finals.)

170
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,800
(Group 2 preliminaries
transformed into flower boys, too.)

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,430
(Who will be the one
to make it to the finals?)

172
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,040
Start.

173
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,840
(Gathering energy)

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,670
(Will he succeed in one go?)

175
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,240
(Hitting his own eye)

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,680
(That hurts, right?)

177
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,580
(Feeling dizzy)

178
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,120
This isn't working.

179
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,480
(He's also hitting his own eye.)

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,390
What are you doing, SHINDONG?

181
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,560
(Licking it)

182
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,260
(Anteater strategy)

183
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,230
SHINDONG, you're not eating it
like that, are you?

184
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,000
(Got caught?)

185
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
(Don't cheat.)

186
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,670
That's a foul.

187
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,070
(Struggling while the other cheats)

188
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,080
(Just then...)

189
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,940
Bounce.

190
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,110
(The persimmon has been tossed.)

191
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,320
(Will the anteater catch its prey?)

192
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,390
(Soft landing)

193
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,790
(Looks delicious, right?)

194
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,930
(The two are surprised
by SHINDONG's agility.)

195
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,390
SHINDONG advances.

196
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,700
Okay.

197
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,730
It's me, LEETEUK, and SHINDONG.

198
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,370
(Go, SHINDONG!)

199
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,540
Say "Ready, go."

200
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,640
Move a little to the side.

201
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,940
(Fierce battle for positions)

202
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,740
(Finals start)

203
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,810
Start.

204
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,540
(Will he succeed right away?)

205
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,080
(Cleanly in a single bite?)

206
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,550
(Bounces off the teeth)

207
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,490
(Desperate for first place)

208
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,760
(SHINDONG focuses on the persimmon.)

209
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,890
The finals are really different.

210
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,290
It's intense.

211
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,830
(Another eye attack)

212
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,000
(Do you want to fight?)

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,200
(Full-on eye attack starts.)

214
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,370
(Focused on hunting alone
regardless of the others)

215
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,680
(Miss)

216
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,780
(I should change my plan.)

217
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,080
(Charing with his mouth open)

218
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,420
(Biting anything)

219
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,490
(Terrifying)

220
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,950
(Is he a zombie?)

221
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,490
He's good.

222
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,390
(Changing the target)

223
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,460
Is eating someone else's allowed?

224
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,630
Isn't it okay as long as you eat it?

225
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,730
I've seen this scene in old variety shows.

226
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,200
(Total chaos)

227
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,210
(Overflowing charm)

228
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,810
They all look like fools.

229
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,410
Let's each take turns.

230
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,750
Okay, one by one.

231
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,720
Let's be fair.

232
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,420
You go first.

233
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,090
5 seconds, each time.

234
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,990
- One.
- Five.

235
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,360
- Two.
- Four.

236
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,820
Three, two.

237
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,460
(Among many instructors,)

238
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,830
(the lone fighter fails.)

239
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,330
(HEECHUL's turn
who's desperate for first place)

240
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,030
(Fixes his posture)

241
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,600
Five, four, three.

242
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
(Visually, he's number one.)

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,410
(Right up his alley)

244
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,740
HEECHUL, you're so funny.

245
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,580
- I'll go now.
- LEETEUK.

246
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,410
(Unique posture)

247
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,150
(Did he bite it?)

248
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,320
(The persimmon bounced off unfortunately.)

249
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,590
(This time, all together)

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,690
(Fail)

251
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,160
(Another fail)

252
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
He ate it.

253
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,130
(Gently in his mouth)

254
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,500
(Roar)

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,370
(If you give me the persimmon,
I won't eat you.)

256
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,610
(Dazed)

257
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,780
My heart fluttered
when he ate the persimmon.

258
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,520
I had the dried persimmon in my mouth,

259
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,990
and SHINDONG took another bite of it.

260
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,790
"What was that?"

261
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,660
My heart was almost pounding.

262
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,930
(LEETEUK saw a new side of SHINDONG.)

263
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,600
LEETEUK.

264
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
(LEETEUK is the sexiest person.)

265
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,400
LEETEUK is good.

266
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,530
He's so good.

267
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,710
I thought SHINDONG was strong at games,

268
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,980
but LEETEUK pulled it off.

269
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,580
The second game to show off charm is...

270
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,880
the Step by Step Body Battle.

271
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,480
Body battle.

272
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
Okay. I'm good with steps.

273
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,120
- Are you good at dancing?
- I'm good with steps.

274
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,790
(Checking)

275
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,160
What's this?

276
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,430
(The stage is here.)

277
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,600
Who hid this?

278
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,130
When did they hide this?

279
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,470
What's this?

280
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,470
One, two, three.

281
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,840
(Let's have fun.)

282
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,080
(Follow the randomly chosen color
and designated body part.)

283
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,310
(The one who holds the pose
the longest wins.)

284
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,450
Shall we have three people go first?

285
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,380
- Should we go first?
- You three can go first.

286
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,520
HEECHUL, you do it.

287
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,390
Should I draw?

288
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,490
Let's decide the order
with rock, paper, scissors.

289
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,090
Rock, paper, scissors.

290
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,230
(Last place)

291
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,330
Rock, paper, scissors.

292
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,630
(SHINDONG goes first.)

293
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,730
I'm first.

294
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,100
SHINDONG.

295
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,030
Here we go. Blue.

296
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,200
(SHINDONG, right hand on blue)

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,700
I'll do it comfortably.

298
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,070
For now, comfortably.

299
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,510
(Safely chooses the outer circle)

300
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,110
(RYEOWOOK, right hand on blue)

301
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,010
Next, DONGHAE.

302
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,050
You're so close.

303
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,880
He's so close to him.

304
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,750
RYEOWOOK is bold.

305
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,880
He's bold.

306
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,990
RYEOWOOK is daring.

307
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,820
Next, DONGHAE.

308
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,290
(DONGHAE, right hand)

309
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,230
Blue.

310
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,560
What? Is everything blue?

311
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,760
Next, SHINDONG.

312
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,700
(SHINDONG, left foot)

313
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,870
Green.

314
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,900
(Green is a little far.)

315
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,040
(Perfect finish with flair)

316
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,640
(What do you think?)

317
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,880
RYEOWOOK, yellow.

318
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,180
Yellow, left foot.

319
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,920
(Color power)

320
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,050
Wait a minute.

321
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,590
(Proud)

322
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,720
Wait a minute.

323
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,920
RYEOWOOK doesn't seem
to have much of a plan.

324
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,990
Are you already being punished?

325
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,930
(Self-torture)

326
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,660
DONGHAE, green.

327
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,430
Green, left foot.

328
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,370
(Gently)

329
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,240
He's playing it safe.

330
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,740
(He's smart.)

331
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,480
No.

332
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,780
We should slow down a bit.

333
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,910
Look at RYEOWOOK.

334
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,710
(Shaking)

335
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,550
He's the type who buys trouble.

336
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,220
(He's funny.)

337
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,320
Let's go. SHINDONG, left hand on blue.

338
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,620
Blue?

339
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,330
(Right hand already used)

340
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,930
Blue? Wait a second.

341
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,300
(The closest blue is quite far.)

342
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
There.

343
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,900
(As expected of SHINDONG)

344
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,870
RYEOWOOK.

345
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,940
Yes, hurry.

346
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,640
Hurry.

347
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,370
(Adjusting)

348
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,570
Hurry.

349
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,210
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

350
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,540
(RYEOWOOK, left foot)

351
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,050
Green.

352
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,610
Left hand?

353
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,150
(I'm saved.)

354
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,690
Hold on. I'm tired. I'll lean a bit.

355
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,020
Wait.

356
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,720
(Being crushed)

357
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,590
DONGHAE, yellow.

358
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,630
Left hand on yellow.

359
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,260
(Easy)

360
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,830
DONGHAE is smart.

361
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,470
Right foot.

362
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,240
SHINDONG, blue.

363
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
Blue?

364
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,940
(The remaining blue is under RYEOWOOK.)

365
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,940
(His foot searches for blue like a loach.)

366
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,980
(Let's go.)

367
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,450
(Lands smoothly)

368
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,480
- He did it?
- SHINDONG is flexible.

369
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,550
SHINDONG is really flexible.

370
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,850
He's working hard.

371
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,890
(Proud)

372
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,090
Don't touch me.

373
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,390
(Looking pleased from behind)

374
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,290
RYEOWOOK, right foot...

375
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,560
on green.

376
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,460
(Hold on, everyone.)

377
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,630
He's good.

378
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,300
I mean...

379
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,330
His posture...

380
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,270
(Look at those muscles.)

381
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,300
He's solid.

382
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,540
Right foot on green.

383
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,540
Everyone, SHINDONG is muscular here.

384
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,010
Hold on.

385
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,380
(RYEOWOOK's turn to place his right foot
on green)

386
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,180
(Move)

387
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,320
(Plop)

388
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,580
(Pushed without resistance)

389
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,790
(This is fun.)

390
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,990
DONGHAE wins.

391
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,060
(DONGHAE advances to the finals.)

392
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,430
RYEOWOOK.

393
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,090
- Sorry.
- RYEOWOOK.

394
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,260
You went too aggressive at first.

395
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,060
RYEOWOOK.

396
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,700
He started with an attack.

397
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,170
(Sorry)

398
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,900
Who goes first?

399
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,670
Here we go.

400
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,740
KYUHYUN, place your right hand...

401
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,010
on blue.

402
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,510
(Let's see.)

403
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,410
Changing seats.

404
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,680
(Staring)

405
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,380
Finally, you took off your coat.

406
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm ready to get serious.

407
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,690
Okay.

408
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,920
(Kyu-sama will dominate the game board.)

409
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,360
SHINDONG started from there
and looked foolish.

410
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,430
(What will KYUHYUN's choice be?)

411
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,430
- Why would you pick that spot?
- Why there?

412
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,200
(Winning is all that matters.)

413
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,900
- Who's next?
- Me.

414
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,440
Let's go.

415
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,970
Right hand...

416
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,970
on yellow.

417
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,180
You and I, yellow.

418
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,080
Yes, that's a good spot.

419
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,510
- Who's next?
- Me.

420
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,950
(How will EUNHYUK,
who's good with steps, do?)

421
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,850
EUNHYUK.

422
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,050
Red.

423
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,690
(Gently)

424
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,090
He's weird. He's sly.

425
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,820
No, absolutely not. I have a strategy.

426
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,290
Isn't that spot a bit odd?

427
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,860
I'm aiming for the center.

428
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,430
HEECHUL.

429
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,600
Yellow.

430
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,360
HEECHUL, yellow.

431
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,230
Is that possible with four people?

432
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,070
(He chooses the outer yellow.)

433
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,140
You need to aim for the center
for a better position.

434
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,210
(Will EUNHYUK's strategy work?)

435
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,710
(KYUHYUN, left foot)

436
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,480
- Blue.
- Blue.

437
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,510
Left foot on blue.

438
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,880
It's hard already.

439
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,250
Push him away.

440
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,950
Turn your body.

441
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,160
(Where will KYUHYUN's left foot go?)

442
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,260
(Close contact with the butt)

443
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,830
Hey.

444
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,630
(It's just a game.)

445
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,530
LEETEUK.

446
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,200
Left foot on yellow.

447
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,440
Easy.

448
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,300
Why are you coming here?

449
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,170
(Showing charm)

450
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,040
- Why come here?
- That was unexpected.

451
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,580
(I know you like it.)

452
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,410
Next.

453
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,080
(HEECHUL doesn't seem
to fully hate LEETEUK's joke.)

454
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,750
Left foot on red.

455
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,550
Easy.

456
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,390
- My turn.
- HEECHUL.

457
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,920
HEECHUL.

458
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,530
Left foot on green.

459
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,530
(Let me show off, too.)

460
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,800
Hold on.

461
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,530
Hold on.

462
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,870
You have to lift the other foot.

463
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,100
(Unused foot must stay outside.)

464
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,910
Then can I redo it with this foot?

465
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,210
No, you can't.

466
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,440
But this posture...

467
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,210
HEECHUL, are you in a toilet?

468
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,880
(Open toilet)

469
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,920
Next is KYUHYUN, right?

470
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,590
KYUHYUN, left hand on yellow.

471
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,720
That's too easy.

472
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,990
Take it easy.

473
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,160
(Presses with his butt)

474
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,500
KYUHYUN.

475
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,400
(Let's get close now.)

476
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
LEETEUK.

477
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,470
LEETEUK, left hand on red.

478
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,170
(Two people are flocked
in front of EUNHYUK.)

479
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,840
- Wait a minute.
- Good.

480
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,270
Where should I go then?

481
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,610
RYEOWOOK, please draw. Who's next?

482
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,080
EUNHYUK.

483
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,410
It's green this time.

484
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,680
What?

485
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,220
Green. Here we go.

486
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,190
(LEETEUK has fully occupied the green.)

487
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,850
Push him over.

488
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,960
Please move out of the way.

489
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,760
(Fierce battle)

490
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm sorry, but what's happening behind?

491
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,730
I can't see anything.

492
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,900
(He is still using the toilet)

493
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,500
(Barely succeeds with his left hand)

494
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,670
I don't know what these three are doing.

495
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,040
I can't even see it.

496
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,110
Who's next?

497
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,340
HEECHUL, left hand...

498
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,810
on green.

499
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,010
Easy.

500
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,980
Green.

501
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,850
- SHINDONG.
- Yes?

502
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,480
EUNHYUK is dying.

503
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,550
Am I on camera?

504
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,850
Yes, you're showing up well.

505
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,890
Am I on? I'm right here.

506
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,120
Who's next?

507
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,820
Use your right foot.

508
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,360
Place it on blue.

509
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,530
That's too easy.

510
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,630
He looks like a frog.

511
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,330
- Who's next?
- Me.

512
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,760
LEETEUK.

513
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,400
LEETEUK, right foot on red.

514
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,930
- What?
- Red.

515
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,170
I can't see the red.

516
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,510
(Going crazy)

517
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,710
LEETEUK, red.

518
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,880
Here I go.

519
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,380
Don't come here.

520
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,310
(Attacking EUNHYUK)

521
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,610
(LEETEUK is out.)

522
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,580
(Good, good)

523
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,520
Do they continue?

524
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,850
I mean...

525
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,920
Look at him.

526
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,260
Look at his hair.

527
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,520
Are you okay?

528
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,560
(Dedicating with tangled hair)

529
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,527
(EUNHYUK's right foot...)

530
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,528
On green.

531
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,863
- What?
- On green.

532
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,299
- Right foot.
- Right foot on green?

533
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,102
Ah, green... Hold on a second.

534
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,704
(Struggling to stretch out his legs)

535
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,209
(Really flexible)

536
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,346
- Okay, he made it.
- Back in the day, I was the step master.

537
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,783
(How did he do this?)

538
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,985
Can I lean on your arm here?

539
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,453
I’ll lean on you.

540
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,691
(Shy)

541
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,926
Next, HEECHUL's right foot...

542
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,461
- on blue.
- It's easy.

543
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,430
Can we do it a bit faster?

544
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,731
Okay.

545
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,367
When can I face these guys?

546
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,571
I even ate the dinner alone.

547
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,242
Are you guys playing this game
just to leave me all alone on purpose?

548
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,278
HEECHUL really got what he deserved.

549
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:17,016
That's the consequence of his actions...

550
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,217
so nothing I can do about it.

551
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,620
Next, KYUHYUN's left foot...

552
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,855
on green.

553
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,190
It's left foot.

554
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,526
He really found a good spot.

555
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,061
I guess the center is the best spot.

556
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,329
(So easy)
(He is really good at it.)

557
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,831
And next.

558
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,532
Everyone...

559
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,567
freeze!

560
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,735
It's green.

561
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,472
- What?
- Left foot on green.

562
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,507
- Left foot on green.
- It's easy.

563
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,509
(Is this even possible?)

564
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,077
You got this, there’s space over there.

565
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,079
What happened? I want to laugh too.

566
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,714
You need to turn around, turn.

567
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,250
(He made his move.)

568
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,421
(Will his step skills come into play?)

569
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,856
Here?

570
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,459
(Dance machine)

571
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,962
- I made it.
- He did it.

572
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,363
And next.

573
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,899
(HEECHUL's left foot on yellow)

574
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,100
Left foot on yellow.

575
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,703
(Checking the target point)

576
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,738
Hey.

577
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,540
He is so scary.

578
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,075
(Why can't my feet move...)

579
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:19,411
If he steps with his left foot,
it’s basically the toilet pose.

580
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,379
He is about to fall.

581
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,249
Wait, when can I turn my head?

582
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,850
Okay, he did it.

583
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,752
(Still just staring at the wall)

584
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,953
Hey!

585
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,288
Is there something interesting?

586
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,990
No, it's just that...

587
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,826
(Eye contact with the viewers
in the toilet.)

588
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,063
Actually I was...

589
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,166
surprised by HEECHUL.

590
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,803
When we play the game,
a competitive spirit usually kicks in.

591
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,239
So, things become tangled and chaotic.

592
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,043
But he doesn’t care about
any of that at all.

593
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,746
"There's a camera."

594
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,482
He just goes his own way.

595
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,417
I think he might've been

596
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,520
a scholar from a long, long time ago.

597
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,255
He was so sophisticated.

598
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,093
(All LEETEUK sees now are
HEECHUL's strengths.)

599
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,262
KYUHYUN's left hand... on red.

600
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,130
Red?

601
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,066
(This one is easy too.)

602
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,969
It's my turn to attack.

603
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,371
EUNHYUK's left hand on yellow.

604
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,107
This is the only place.

605
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,910
(It's hard to time the attack.)

606
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,245
I'll stay like this.

607
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,513
It's comfortable.

608
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,449
(Two of them are relying on each other.)

609
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,252
(In a dizzying game world,
a moment frozen just for the two of them.)

610
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,088
EUNHYUK definitely has great agility.

611
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:40,025
That's why he’s loved by so many people.

612
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,294
After all, EUNHYUK is my partner...

613
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,964
one of the final candidates,

614
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,233
so it was inevitable that
we’d be all sweet.

615
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,102
- Next, HEECHUL's left hand.
- Yes!

616
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,136
On green.

617
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,907
(A fairly good position)

618
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,475
But I can't still turn my head.

619
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,745
I have a camera here,
in front of me.

620
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,946
Is it a one-shot?

621
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,416
Here we go, KYUHYUN.
Yellow, right foot!

622
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,384
Right foot on yellow.

623
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,418
(A quick glance)

624
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,120
- Yellow?
- It's a little difficult.

625
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,960
(The spectators gather
to witness the first elimination.)

626
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,862
Why? Is there
an interesting situation happening?

627
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,430
No, no.

628
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,966
- I want to know too.
- Next right foot, EUNHYUK.

629
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,334
Right foot on red.

630
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,636
This is hard.

631
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,274
(The shortest paths to red
are these spots.)

632
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:32,144
(Can the dance machine make his steps?)

633
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,179
If you fall, you're out.

634
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,881
Yes, that's it.

635
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,416
Just a bit more.

636
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,984
If you fall, you're out.

637
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,853
(A foot that's slightly off..!)

638
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,788
(KYUHYUN is now supporting.)

639
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,725
(He made it!)

640
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,994
(Almost lost face)

641
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,062
Right foot on green.

642
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,430
Right foot on green.

643
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,132
Is this right?

644
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,233
Right foot on green.

645
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,434
(Where is it?)

646
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,569
(Complete, checking the target point.)

647
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,039
What's that?

648
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,208
(You were there?)

649
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,580
(Pressing)

650
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,820
(The butt finally finds someone.)

651
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,050
Move.

652
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,390
(Blowing)

653
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,550
(Seduction)

654
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,530
(Butt on the left, breeze on the right)

655
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,030
What just happened?

656
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,400
KYUHYUN started blowing
into EUNHYUK's ear.

657
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,930
(Plop)

658
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,770
EUNHYUK is out.

659
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,070
Two people have advanced.

660
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,270
Two people advanced.

661
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,810
(That was fun.)

662
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,910
He...

663
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,380
kept blowing in my ear.

664
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,740
You just spoke in dialect.

665
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,510
(Everyone teases him.)

666
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,610
Aren't you from Seoul?

667
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,080
Are you from Gangwon-do?

668
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,920
He kept blowing.

669
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,450
Have you ever tried blowing?

670
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,750
Finals.

671
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,520
HEECHUL, KYUHYUN, and DONGHAE advance
to the finals.

672
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,990
This looks fun. It'll be neck and neck.

673
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,090
Going last isn't always good.

674
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,590
I think going first is better.

675
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,030
Because you can take the center spot.

676
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,170
(Says the eliminated one)

677
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,370
What will you guys do?

678
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,430
You can go first.

679
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,400
I'll go last.

680
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,270
- Then HEECHUL goes first?
- Me first? Okay.

681
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,540
Right. The second one should choose.

682
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,440
I don't really care.

683
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,580
Do as you like.

684
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,780
Then I'll go first.

685
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,550
(HEECHUL gets to start.)

686
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,950
Everyone seems to like HEECHUL.

687
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,680
My popularity just skyrocketed.

688
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,850
(Delusional)

689
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,650
Right hand first.

690
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,120
- Blue.
- Blue.

691
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,630
This time, I'll spread out.

692
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,930
I didn't earlier so I played alone.

693
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,960
That's not the spot.

694
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,400
Why not?

695
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,700
That's not it.

696
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,900
Why not?

697
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,470
I think he went the wrong way.

698
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,940
- He should've gone to the center.
- It's going to look just like before.

699
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,580
(Humans repeat the same mistakes.)

700
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,880
KYUHYUN, right hand...

701
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,350
on green.

702
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,080
I think I'll have to turn my back.

703
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,680
Yes, take the center.

704
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,420
He's so camera-greedy.

705
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,650
(Winning matters more than broadcast.)

706
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,220
When will he take off his scarf?

707
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,860
(Never gives up looking frail)

708
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,560
(Chooses after thinking)

709
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
DONGHAE.

710
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,400
Yellow.

711
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,730
Take the center.

712
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,370
(He chooses the outer yellow
instead of the center.)

713
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,510
He still can't give up on safety.

714
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,910
HEECHUL, left foot on red.

715
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,080
Easy.

716
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
It's so easy.

717
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,550
(Is he really doing that again?)

718
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,020
(He's probably out.)

719
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,020
Is that really the right move?

720
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,820
- That feels ominous.
- I was looking the other way before.

721
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,260
Now, I'll face all of you.

722
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,160
(HEECHUL is funny.)

723
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
I don't think it'll go that way.

724
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,690
KYUHYUN.

725
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,760
Left foot on red.

726
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Red?

727
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,070
Will he attack or play it safe?

728
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,240
Is there an attack feature?

729
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,300
Will he attack?

730
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,240
Will he?

731
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,210
(He chooses the red one space away
from HEECHUL.)

732
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,340
(Finishes with flair)

733
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,980
(Swish)

734
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,880
(Perfect pose, 100 points)

735
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Isn't that like the Creation of Adam?

736
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,520
It's the Creation of Adam.

737
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,520
(We hope he connects like this
with his partner, too.)

738
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,090
DONGHAE, left foot on red.

739
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,360
Left foot.

740
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,700
(My goodness)

741
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,970
(He gets a face full of butt.)

742
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,840
How rude.

743
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,070
Why are you acting so vulgar?

744
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,180
Who's next?

745
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,780
(A series of collision accidents)

746
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,980
Left hand...

747
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,410
on green.

748
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,350
(Crumpled)

749
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,290
(Crumpled but successful)

750
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,360
(Surprisingly calm)

751
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,390
(KYUHYUN, left hand)

752
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,690
- Green.
- Left hand on green.

753
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,690
Nice.

754
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
(Stable)

755
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,470
I'll admit it.

756
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,070
(Risking the frail concept)

757
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,240
(DONGHAE, left hand...)

758
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,170
(on yellow)

759
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,910
(Easily succeeds)

760
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,980
Wait, I need to pull back.

761
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,210
Wait.

762
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,410
HEECHUL, are you okay?

763
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,610
Yes.

764
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,380
(The top of your head is showing
on camera.)

765
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,480
HEECHUL, right foot on red.

766
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,390
(Shortest red spot for HEECHUL)

767
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,490
There's one here.

768
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,830
- Where?
- On the fourth spot.

769
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,260
(Struggling)

770
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,770
(Everyone helps him do the talent show.)

771
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,730
- You have to push in.
- Come in so I can lean on you.

772
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,570
If you go in there, you can make it.

773
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,070
(Right foot)

774
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,770
- More.
- There.

775
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,240
(He actually made it.)

776
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,380
This is hard.

777
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,480
- Who's next?
- KYUHYUN.

778
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,250
KYUHYUN, right foot...

779
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,750
on green.

780
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,090
- Good.
- KYUHYUN, right foot on green.

781
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,960
(Pressing down)

782
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,790
Wait a minute.

783
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,760
(Let me sit down.)

784
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,130
Wait a minute.

785
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,530
- My head.
- Wait a minute.

786
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,730
I think I saw that
on "The Human Centipede."

787
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,570
Docking complete.

788
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,370
They're docked.

789
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,840
He took off his scarf.

790
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,740
(Forget the concept. I have to win.)

791
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,210
(He's serious.)

792
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,140
- DONGHAE, right foot.
- On blue.

793
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,310
(Target spot)

794
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,210
There's one.

795
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,850
(Cry)

796
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,820
(Endures countless hardships today)

797
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,790
(Easily succeeds)

798
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,360
HEECHUL, right hand...

799
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
on green.

800
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,000
(Easily succeeds)

801
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,060
Who's next?

802
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,530
KYUHYUN, right hand.

803
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,370
- Right hand.
- On blue.

804
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,340
(Blue spots are gathered further in.)

805
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,770
(His body will get twisted.)

806
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,870
I have to prepare for the next move.

807
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,080
(Successful)

808
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,780
(Wait)

809
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,280
HEECHUL, are you okay?

810
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,650
Yes.

811
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,420
(HEECHUL is classy.)

812
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,950
DONGHAE, right hand on red.

813
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,760
KYUHYUN has taken over this side.

814
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,490
(The remaining red spots are
beyond KYUHYUN.)

815
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,090
DONGHAE can't reach that red spot
with his right hand.

816
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,230
But DONGHAE is strong,
since he owns a gym.

817
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,460
Will he push through with power?

818
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,360
He's crawling under me.

819
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,570
Here he comes.

820
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,240
Here he comes.

821
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,640
Just a little more.

822
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,940
That's it. Good.

823
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,310
(More than half the palm is in.)

824
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,310
I'm super comfortable now.

825
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,340
(Comfortable)

826
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,110
RYEOWOOK, draw for HEECHUL.

827
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,710
- Green.
- Left foot.

828
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,820
(The closest green)

829
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,220
Left foot on green. This is not good.

830
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,820
(Struggling)

831
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,490
Put your foot here.

832
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,120
(Did he make it?)

833
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,190
HEECHUL.

834
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,590
You're out.

835
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,860
Isn't my left foot on green?

836
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,230
You're lying down too much.

837
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,900
You should just go home
if you lie down like that.

838
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,630
- Hold on.
- Drag him out.

839
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,970
(HEECHUL used a foul, so he's out.)

840
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,300
It's a battle between the two now.

841
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,710
For now, KYUHYUN is at an advantage.

842
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,010
- Left foot.
- KYUHYUN, left foot.

843
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,140
Left foot.

844
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,680
What color?

845
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,350
Blue.

846
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,510
Blue?

847
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,280
- This is so easy.
- Nice one.

848
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,820
(Is he really going there?)

849
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,750
There.

850
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,950
That way?

851
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,920
(Going deep inside)

852
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,620
He's defending perfectly.

853
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,430
(DONGHAE, left foot)

854
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,160
- DONGHAE.
- DONGHAE, left foot.

855
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,530
On yellow.

856
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,970
(Yellow spot is located behind him.)

857
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,930
You have to flip your body.

858
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,340
(Successful)

859
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,640
(He uses power proportional
to what he ate.)

860
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,670
He got it.

861
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,680
(Secretly proud)

862
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,880
It's KYUHYUN's turn now.

863
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,240
Left hand.

864
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,610
Left hand on blue.

865
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,750
- Blue?
- This is okay.

866
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,750
This is fine.

867
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,080
(Wobbling)

868
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,980
(DONGHAE's hands and feet slip
due to the push.)

869
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,320
Pushing him out?

870
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,350
(He has to return to position
in 3 seconds to continue.)

871
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,590
- One, two...
- Keep going.

872
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,530
He's safe.

873
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,630
DONGHAE.

874
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,530
Left hand.

875
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,300
On green.

876
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,670
On green.

877
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,670
Darn it.

878
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,900
Did you just swear?

879
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,340
Did you just swear?

880
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,310
(That was fun.)

881
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,110
The winner is...

882
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,580
(KYUHYUN wins the charm appeal match.)

883
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,450
He's good.

884
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,050
Look at the prize.

885
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,780
(Everyone is shocked by the prize.)

886
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,050
You should've told us there was a prize.

887
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,060
(Emos Wine produced by SM Entertainment)

888
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,790
(Cabernet Franc 2013)

889
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,300
(Rich tannins and powerful body
are the highlights.)

890
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
(KYUHYUN wins the delicious wine.)

891
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,800
I'm exhausted and sweating.

892
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,640
(Has KYUHYUN's charm been appealed?)

893
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,440
He was grumbling all the time,

894
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,240
but he even took off his coat
and played the game hard.

895
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,050
That kind of effort
makes my heart flutter.

896
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,750
He was playing the game really hard.

897
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,590
He doesn't do much,
but it seems like he's playing hard.

898
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,790
I think he's smart.

899
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,760
I like smart people.

900
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,090
(The temperature of feelings fluctuates.)

901
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,570
(Now it's time to decide
how hit it will boil.)

902
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,940
(What is the temperature
of the Super Solos' hearts?)

903
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,540
(Time to make the final choice)

904
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,610
Go to the partner you like...

905
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,480
and hand him the SUPERBONG.

906
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,220
(Where will their SUPERBONGs go?)

907
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,360
(Charming confidence / HEECHUL)

908
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,730
I want to hear something sincere
for the last part.

909
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,900
HEECHUL.

910
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,060
First of all,

911
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm so happy to be here in Daebudo
with fresh air.

912
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,870
There's a lot of fine dust today.

913
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,300
The fine dust level is bad.

914
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,210
He's lying already.

915
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,710
(Unbothered)

916
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,710
Actually,

917
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,880
you might be surprised,

918
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,950
but I'm not an ethics teacher
from Jingwang Middle School.

919
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,650
Isn't that obvious?

920
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,620
Then who are you?

921
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,690
I'm actually a police officer.

922
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,820
(Laughing)

923
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,230
He's the mafia.

924
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,230
That person.

925
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,560
Shouldn't we report this guy?

926
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,600
Isn't he a scammer?

927
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,200
He's impersonating someone.

928
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,430
I will definitely...

929
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,430
make my choice.

930
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,800
make my choice.

931
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
(No)

932
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,910
Really?

933
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,040
(Who is in his heart now?)

934
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,210
(After the self introduction,
HEECHUL chose DONGHAE.)

935
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,410
I'll guide this person on the right path.

936
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,450
(During the game,
he sees EUNHYUK's armpit.)

937
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,020
He's hairy.

938
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,060
(EUNHYUK's unexpected hairiness
was charming.)

939
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,630
(But HEECHUL didn't want
this kind of charm.)

940
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,930
I think KYUHYUN is okay.

941
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,800
(At first, he didn't take off his coat,
but he did later.)

942
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
(KYUHYUN gets serious when it matters.)

943
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,170
(HEECHUL's heart shakes.
Who will he choose?)

944
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,910
- Does he really have to?
- He has no sense at all.

945
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,210
Someone was wearing the mask of pretense.

946
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,880
And...

947
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,620
someone neglected the outcasts.

948
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,920
It was like a big "The Truman Show."

949
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,090
What if he comes to me?

950
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,320
I have zero expectations.

951
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,960
- I'll find him.
- I don't even want to hear his voice now.

952
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,130
I think I saw someone like him
on Subway Line one.

953
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,000
(Classic troublemaker on Subway Line one)

954
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,530
- He is...
- The old man with a danso.

955
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,330
The person HEECHUL chooses is...

956
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,500
(Terrified)

957
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,700
(Please pass by.)

958
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,770
This person's...

959
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,810
He should hurry up.

960
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,970
HEECHUL, we don't have time.

961
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,080
I was moved by this person's passion.

962
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,180
Should we push him into the pond?

963
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,210
Will you...

964
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,280
come with me?

965
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,120
(Which of the three men will he choose?)

966
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,250
Isn't there a time limit?

967
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,720
(He chooses the man who laughs, KYUHYUN.)

968
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,930
The man who laughs.

969
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,630
That's a relief.

970
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,560
That's a relief.

971
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,930
Does this look weird?

972
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,930
He's the SUPERBONG Killer.

973
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,270
- The SUPERBONG Killer.
- The SUPERBONG Killer.

974
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,470
Please accept...

975
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,170
my SUPERBONG.

976
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,170
He's even down on his knee.

977
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,740
(Will KYUHYUN accept?)

978
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,750
- I...
- Please accept my SUPERBONG.

979
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,980
- With you, HEECHUL...
- Yes, take my SUPERBONG.

980
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,920
- With you...
- Yes, accept my SUPERBONG.

981
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,120
I will not go.

982
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Super bad.

983
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,830
(It's a SUPERBONG, not super bad.)

984
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,990
It's a SUPERBONG.

985
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,560
- Not super bad.
- Stand here again.

986
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
But...

987
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,400
(Pretends not to see)

988
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,630
Then he failed to become a couple.

989
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,630
How sad.

990
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,900
I'll pick again.

991
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,070
- No. It's over.
- Is it?

992
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,370
I'll pick again.

993
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,040
- No. It's over.
- Is it?

994
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,340
- Get out.
- It's cold, HEECHUL.

995
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,910
(Is there only one chance?)

996
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,080
What's wrong with him?
Aren't you going home?

997
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,380
Is there only one chance?

998
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,950
But picking someone is fun.

999
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,520
(Stop picking)

1000
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
Okay, next.

1001
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,560
Next is...

1002
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
(The man who laughs / KYUHYUN)

1003
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,360
(After the self introduction,
he chose the wealthy LEETEUK.)

1004
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,760
(But after seeing
LEETEUK's careless playing...)

1005
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,860
Harder.

1006
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,330
What was that?

1007
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,170
(KYUHYUN was greatly disappointed.)

1008
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,570
That's a typical loser mentality.

1009
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,810
(Afterward, DONGHAE who struggled
with games caught his eye.)

1010
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,010
I think DONGHAW was kind of cute.

1011
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,480
(He began showing bold flirting.)

1012
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,780
(EUNHYUK also entered his heart.)

1013
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,620
My favorite color is blue.

1014
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,890
(KYUHYUN was unknowingly getting closer
to EUNHYUK.)

1015
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,820
He keeps catching my eye...

1016
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,090
and getting on my mind.

1017
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,030
I'll go with one of these two.

1018
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,160
(Where will KYUHYUN's heart go?)

1019
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,730
I've thought about it a lot.

1020
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,840
Should I choose a stable relationship...

1021
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
or pleasure?

1022
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,070
- What?
- Pleasure is obviously me.

1023
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,940
But among them,

1024
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,550
- It's me.
- I chose pleasure.

1025
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,880
- Pleasure?
- Pleasure.

1026
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
(Curious)

1027
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,980
I will...

1028
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,620
make my choice.

1029
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,650
- What's wrong with him?
- Everyone's picking someone.

1030
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,130
(Firm steps as if he's decided)

1031
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,490
(Where will his heart lean?)

1032
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,660
My name is...

1033
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,640
(He chooses EUNHYUK.)

1034
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
He blew air into my ear.

1035
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,140
His name must be Wind.

1036
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,010
(A wind blew into my heart, too.)

1037
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:04,220
(Will EUNHYUK accept KYUHYUN?)

1038
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,250
EUNHYUK.

1039
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,190
You...

1040
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,790
(Can't I be enough?)

1041
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,260
(No way)

1042
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,630
He's so mean.

1043
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,130
(Time for the real EUNHYUK to choose)

1044
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,630
I cannot be with you, KYUHYUN.

1045
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,770
(How does EUNHYUK feel?)

1046
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,210
(KYUHYUN got closer one day.)

1047
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,180
(KYUHYUN's actions somehow bothered him.)

1048
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,150
KYUHYUN is a player.

1049
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,250
I think I've mostly decided,

1050
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,050
but I keep changing my mind.

1051
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,320
I...

1052
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
I...

1053
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,930
The man who laughs,

1054
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,730
KYUHYUN.

1055
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,070
(Let's laugh together.)

1056
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,900
I cannot make you laugh.

1057
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,510
(The man who cries)

1058
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,640
Nice.

1059
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,410
I don't want to mix
with these guys even a little.

1060
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,780
All of them.

1061
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,710
I don't want to mix
with these guys even a little.

1062
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,080
All of them.

1063
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,480
I'll reject them all.

1064
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,850
- It's a number.
- Number five.

1065
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,850
A number.

1066
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,920
(Whatever, I'll just promote now.)

1067
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,360
So go and tell them.

1068
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,090
- That guy is crazy.
- Take all these ridiculous titles.

1069
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,700
And you can marry them, too.

1070
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,330
(Acting passionately)

1071
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,070
You two are a perfect match.

1072
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,330
I don't care.

1073
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,770
This musical is fun.

1074
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,770
What's this?

1075
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,770
He's actually funny.

1076
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,740
He's not the man who laughs,
but the man who's funny.

1077
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,110
(Successful
"The Man Who Laughs" promotion)

1078
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,810
He's a funny man.

1079
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,950
(It's DONGHAE's turn now.)

1080
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,920
(Between suspicious and romance / DONGHAE)

1081
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
He didn't change those shoes
until the end.

1082
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,460
(A symbol of persistence)

1083
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,030
SHINDONG, I really love these shoes.

1084
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,600
Don't insult my shoes.

1085
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,530
Okay.

1086
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,800
(Who's deep inside DONGHAE's heart?)

1087
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,700
(DONGHAE chose SHINDONG
during the first impression selection.)

1088
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,070
(After the self introduction,
he liked SHINDONG even more.)

1089
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,840
- SHINDONG.
- These people.

1090
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,740
(DONGHAE ended up having a meal
with KYUHYUN who chose him.)

1091
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,810
(They found many unexpected things
in common.)

1092
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,520
(But some words bothered DONGHAE.)

1093
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,380
He does this to everyone.

1094
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,990
(Who will DONGHAE choose?)

1095
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,260
I was truly happy here.

1096
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,560
- Thank you.
- It was fun.

1097
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,300
So at first,

1098
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,840
I thought there were so many good people.

1099
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,670
"If I became a couple with this person,"

1100
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,540
"it'd be so nice."
This is what I thought.

1101
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,440
But after spending a day here,

1102
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,950
I realized crazy people...

1103
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,980
had gathered here.

1104
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,950
(Is he saying we're crazy?)

1105
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,850
His outfit looks the craziest.

1106
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,150
(Somewhere between a grandfather
and a hip-hop artist)

1107
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,160
I will...

1108
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,690
not make a choice.

1109
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,160
- Then why did you even come here?
- Why is he here?

1110
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,930
You're here to promote your gym,
aren't you?

1111
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,900
We were all sincere.

1112
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,940
I will leave with good memories with you.

1113
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,510
- Coward.
- I will wish you all happiness.

1114
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,440
- Coward.
- Let me say goodbye.

1115
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,240
- Coward.
- Thank you, everyone.

1116
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,310
Get lost.

1117
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,650
Get lost.

1118
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,250
He speaks so harshly.

1119
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,620
That's too much.

1120
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,890
(That was satisfying.)

1121
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,290
(He's twisted, too.)

1122
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,250
Next.

1123
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,360
(Attractive wealth / LEETEUK)

1124
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,190
I really enjoyed myself today.

1125
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,890
- Yes.
- Today,

1126
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,130
I came to find someone
with a strong,

1127
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,460
I mean, strong mind.

1128
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,830
(But he's strange.)

1129
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,870
- He's stuttering.
- I will...

1130
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,140
make my choice.

1131
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,370
Do you have to?

1132
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,810
(Who has LEETEUK's heart?)

1133
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,750
(After the self introduction,)

1134
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,880
(LEETEUK found
HEECHUL's scholarly charm attractive.)

1135
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,850
He seemed like a Confucian scholar
from the Joseon Dynasty.

1136
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,720
(But SHINDONG's boldness
also attracted him.)

1137
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,220
His charm level rose.

1138
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,130
I think I need to think a little more.

1139
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,830
(Who will LEETEUK walk toward?)

1140
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,400
I thought about it a lot. Today,

1141
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,270
this person's purity,

1142
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,640
- passion,
- Purity?

1143
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,770
and untaintedness.

1144
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,810
I'm untainted.

1145
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,810
That's who I choose.

1146
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,850
(Will it be HEECHUL
who was his first choice?)

1147
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,880
(Or SHINDONG who made his heart flutter?)

1148
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,020
That's who I choose.

1149
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,050
Hello, I'm Pengsoo.

1150
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,090
I'm Pengsoo.

1151
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,960
- Me?
- Really?

1152
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,660
- Yes.
- Is this allowed?

1153
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,360
Impersonate Pengsoo.

1154
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,490
(Automatic)

1155
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,330
Hello, I'm Pengnose.

1156
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,530
His nose looks bigger today.

1157
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,900
Your nose looks even bigger today.

1158
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,870
- It's swollen.
- Both of you have big noses.

1159
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,970
(A perfect match)

1160
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,070
Then are we not becoming a couple?

1161
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,110
- No.
- Sadly.

1162
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,580
(HEECHUL had already chosen KYUHYUN.)

1163
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,510
Next.

1164
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:15,520
(Charming guy / EUNHYUK)

1165
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,020
Today,

1166
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,750
spending time with you all,

1167
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,920
I made good memories.

1168
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,320
He looks like he has no neck.

1169
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,360
Isn't he Pengsoo?

1170
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,290
(Automatic reflex)

1171
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,000
(Right up his alley)

1172
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,100
(Let me talk.)

1173
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,900
- Everyone...
- Let's get this done quickly.

1174
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,300
(EUNHYUK had a hard time
getting words in all day.)

1175
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,710
Today,

1176
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,580
spending time with you all,

1177
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,210
I finally found someone...

1178
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,220
who fits me very well.

1179
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,820
I will...

1180
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,920
make my choice.

1181
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,730
(He chose SHINDONG
after the self introduction.)

1182
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,560
Really?

1183
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,270
(To win popular SHINDONG's heart,)

1184
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,400
(EUNHYUK was consistent
with his feelings.)

1185
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,810
(They even got to go on a date together.)

1186
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,180
(EUNHYUK approaches his fated partner.)

1187
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:20,810
This is uncomfortable.

1188
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,520
(He walks past Pengsoo.)

1189
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,550
(Tense moment)

1190
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,760
Is it me?

1191
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,090
(Of course not.)

1192
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,960
- Is it me?
- I thought it was me.

1193
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,360
Will you come with me?

1194
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,730
Will you be my partner?

1195
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:39,770
(No wonder they were eating without me.)

1196
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,800
(Who is really in SHINDONG's heart?)

1197
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,710
(SHINDONG chose LEETEUK
after the self introduction.)

1198
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,540
(But EUNHYUK kept coming closer
and SHINDONG noticed him.)

1199
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,350
(They matched surprisingly well,
from tastes to appetites.)

1200
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,210
I eat chocolate with whiskey.

1201
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,920
(But doubt started to grow.)

1202
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,950
(Meanwhile,
RYEOWOOK directly approached SHINDONG.)

1203
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,590
(SHINDONG starts to waver
at RYEOWOOK's delicate approach.)

1204
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,730
It's definitely one of the two.

1205
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,870
- Can I ask you one more question?
- Yes.

1206
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,000
Which country would you like
to travel to together?

1207
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,130
One, two, three.

1208
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,140
- Vietnam.
- Vietnam.

1209
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,670
What's your favorite chocolate brand
you enjoy when drinking whiskey?

1210
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,540
One, two, three.

1211
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,910
(English chocolate)

1212
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,280
(What a mess.)

1213
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
I...

1214
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,950
choose...

1215
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,680
Reject him. Kick him.

1216
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,120
(What will SHINDONG's choice be?)

1217
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,520
No way.

1218
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,490
Seriously?

1219
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:40,160
(Let's be partners.)

1220
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,530
I'll accept.

1221
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,900
(Moved)

1222
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,630
(The first Super Solo couple)

1223
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,570
(Excited)

1224
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

1225
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,210
(Who's next?)

1226
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,410
Next.

1227
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,780
(Pocket boy / RYEOWOOK)

1228
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,550
I'm not sure who he'll choose.

1229
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,380
Today,

1230
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,680
I have no regrets.

1231
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,980
No regrets even if you die?

1232
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,020
- Yes.
- That's scary.

1233
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,990
But...

1234
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,990
I...

1235
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,490
will not make a choice.

1236
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,520
(Empty)

1237
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,030
You just ruined the mood.

1238
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,930
(Who do you want to become partners with
at the end?)

1239
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:16,930
SHINDONG.

1240
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,230
(He chose SHINDONG
after the self introduction.)

1241
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,800
(He played around with him...)

1242
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,670
(and tried to get closer during games.)

1243
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,410
(But SHINDONG is already partnered
with EUNHYUK.)

1244
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,750
Didn't you have anyone on your mind?

1245
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,280
- Excuse me?
- Really? No one?

1246
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,980
- Yes.
- From the beginning?

1247
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,220
Then you should've left earlier.

1248
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,590
(Everyone boos.)

1249
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,760
- What a scammer.
- He just came to mess around.

1250
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,730
Exactly.

1251
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,490
(SHINDONG keeps talking
not knowing RYEOWOOK's feelings.)

1252
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:50,930
(RYEOWOOK shrinks in disappointment.)

1253
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,270
He's an influencer.

1254
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,300
And with that,

1255
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,600
the best couple has been selected.

1256
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,040
<i>In the gone time</i>

1257
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,110
(Perfect chemistry)

1258
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,580
Both of them sing terribly.

1259
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,050
(We wish SHINDONG and EUNHYUK
a new start.)

1260
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,080
Don't let each other go.

1261
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,750
We're a couple.

1262
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,250
These two found their perfect match
in the Super Solo World.

1263
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,690
They say you only need one true friend
to succeed in life.

1264
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,060
Will I find one someday, too?

1265
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,800
I'm jealous.

1266
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,400
Why is it so hot?

1267
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,410
This is a dry sauna.

1268
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,110
(Woke up to a dry sauna escape)

1269
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,680
(Only the winners can escape.)

1270
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,950
(Starting off
by boldly revealing his skin?)

1271
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,480
(Of course, cheating from the start...)

1272
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,750
(and betrayal.)

1273
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,150
(The members lose their minds
at the prospect of escape.)

1274
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,150
(Someone help the zombie)

1275

(Biting)

1276
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,720
(Chewing)

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,130
(Shocked)

1278
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,730
(And even drooling in the fierce battle?)

1279
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,460

(Fuming)

1282
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,500

(Who will escape first?)
