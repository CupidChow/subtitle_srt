1
00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:03,424
Let's begin
SHINDONG's Frugal Housewarming Game.

2
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:05,960
(Starting off
with out-of-this-world energy)

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,495
(I can't lose this.)

4
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:09,364
(The members don't spare their bodies
for the prize.)

5
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,099
(This time, I'm definitely taking it.)

6
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,769
He pretended to have fun,
but he's going all in.

7
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,371
(Look who's talking.)

8
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:19,774
(They succeeded
in winning the household goods.)

9
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,076
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

10
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:24,012
Everyone, it's the final game.

11
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:26,214
The ultimate prize is...

12
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:29,517
what will keep your environment
clean and pleasant,

13
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:31,686
a robot vacuum cleaner.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,489
This one's really nice.

15
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,690
This is exactly what I don't have at home.

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,493
The prize will be delivered directly
to the winner's house...

17
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:40,929
by a professional technician.

18
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,331
They will handle everything
from installation to mapping.

19
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:47,135
Once it's mapped, you can specify
only the parts you want cleaned.

20
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,570
(I guess I won't have to do anything.)

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,905
Eventually,
the robot will probably cook, too.

22
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:52,440
That wouldn't be a vacuum cleaner.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,276
- Right.
- That's a rice cooker.

24
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,212
The game for the robot vacuum cleaner is…

25
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,781
Kung Kung Tta!

26
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:03,384
The last one standing gets the prize.

27
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:06,054
Let's start with EUNHYUK and go this way,

28
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:07,455
to the right.

29
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:08,856
Okay.

30
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:10,258
Five, six, seven, eight.

31
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:11,626
<i>Kung Kung Ttari Kung Kung Tta</i>

32
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,429
(They're excited by the old-school vibe.)

33
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,863
(This brings back memories.)

34
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:17,131
(EUNHYUK starts the attack.)

35
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,133
Vacuum cleaner.

36
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,135
Wild goose.

37
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:23,037
Wild goose.

38
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:24,973
Wild goose.

39
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:26,908
Can we repeat words?

40
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:29,010
Yes, you can.

41
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,546
(Group protest)

42
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:32,947
It's allowed originally.

43
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:34,983
Then everyone will just say
"wild goose" repeatedly.

44
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:37,185
You never said that rule.

45
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,252
How many wild geese are there?

46
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:40,455
No, someone will eventually mess up.

47
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,557
If we keep going with "wild goose",

48
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:44,359
someone might suddenly say
"crane" or something.

49
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,326
Okay.

50
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:47,428
(What?)

51
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,097
That also ends with "e."

52
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:53,134
(Dazed)

53
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,502
Accepted.

54
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:55,770
Wild goose.

55
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,738
Let's start over...

56
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,306
from the start.

57
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,641
Five, six, seven, eight.

58
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,343
<i>Kkungse Kkungse Kkungse Kkungse</i>

59
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,745

60
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:04,979

61
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,080
<i>Kung Kung Ttari Kung Kung Tta</i>

62
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,448
<i>Kung Kung Kung Kung</i>

63
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:09,417
Camera.

64
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,319
Radio.

65
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,154
(Here it comes.)

66
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:15,023
Audio.

67
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,858
(Then...)

68
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,593
Audio.

69
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:21,929
(Continuing the audio streak)

70
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:24,666
(You too, audio?)

71
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,235
Squid.

72
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,138
(Can he handle this sudden attack?)

73
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,339
Wild squid.

74
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:33,741
Wild squid.

75
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:36,044
(What?)

76
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:38,813
(What's a wild squid?)

77
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:40,982
You just wanted to say wild goose...

78
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:41,916
so you kept repeating it in your head...

79
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,085
but heard "squid"
and just said "wild squid," didn't you?

80
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,087
(That's right.)

81
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,722
DONGHAE is out.

82
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,425
Wild squid.

83
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,127
Let's start from here again.

84
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:53,928
Let's go.

85
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,531
(Six members left)

86
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,900
(Who will be eliminated this round?)

87
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,035
Housewarming.

88
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,171
Barbershop.

89
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,372
Sho...

90
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,076
(No way)

91
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:10,044
Shop.

92
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:14,015
(RYEOWOOK failed.)

93
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:17,151
(He failed on an easy word.)

94
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,754
(Mocking RYEOWOOK)

95
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:21,856
(The game starts.)

96
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,225
(Starting with HEECHUL)

97
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,663
(Five members left, who's next?)

98
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,065
Squid.

99
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:34,802
(A word that starts with "e?")

100
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:36,537
Eo*****jae.

101
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:37,638
Who said that?

102
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:39,574
(Eo*****jae?)

103
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:42,076
(What even is that?)

104
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:44,112
It's the name of an apartment
in Seongbuk-dong.

105
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,682
(Come on.)

106
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,817
If it shows up in search results,
it counts.

107
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,919
- It exists.
- It exists.

108
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,821
An apartment?

109
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:55,056
It's a villa.

110
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,591
Is that true?

111
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,359
(That actually exists?)

112
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,294
- Yes.
- The next word starts with "s."

113
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:02,296
(I told you, it exists.)

114
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:04,232
It's a villa?

115
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,934
Yes, I know it.

116
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:07,802
It's real.

117
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,505
(Starting again from Eo*****jae)

118
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,540
Sneezing.

119
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,509
Crane.

120
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,544
Wild goose.

121
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:18,446
Wild goose.

122
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,348
Wild goose.

123
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,083
Parasite.

124
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,117
Parasite.

125
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:26,454
(SIWON's ambitious attack,
will they avoid it?)

126
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,823
Chung***go.

127
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,758
Chung***go.

128
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:32,860
Bracken.

129
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,762
Pushcart.

130
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:36,898
Camera.

131
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,566
Leica.

132
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:43,738
(Another start of the loop?)

133
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,439
Radio.

134
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,843
(Will he pass?)

135
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,611
Audio.

136
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,380
Audio.

137
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,382
Squid.

138
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:57,151
(Squid appeared last round.
And this time?)

139
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:59,053
Eo*****jae.

140
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:05,159
(EUNHYUK uses what he learned.)

141
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,195
- You.
- What?

142
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:09,330
(Bickering)

143
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,532
You doubted me earlier.

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,036
(So entertaining)

145
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:18,239
The Seongbuk-dong villa, Eo*****jae.

146
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,241
(HEECHUL restarts in the chaos.)

147
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,110
Sneezing.

148
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,345
Wild goose.

149
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,279
(Brain running at full speed)

150
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,348
Lubrication.

151
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:29,517
Chilgok Station.

152
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:32,320
Is Chilgok Station real?

153
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,688
(For now, keep going.)

154
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,089
Yeoksambbal.

155
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,224
Wrong.

156
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,158
Yeoksam-dong.

157
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,993
What was that you said?

158
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:40,328
It's famous.

159
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:41,729
There's a subway station called that?

160
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,298
Let's check if Chilgok Station exists.

161
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:46,200
I've been there.

162
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,135
I went there recently.

163
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:50,571
(Is YESUNG right?)

164
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,940
(If it exists, EUNHYUK is out.)

165
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,443
(If not, YESUNG is out.)

166
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,511
There's Chilgok-Unam Station.

167
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:02,483
(Chilgok Station doesn't exist.)

168
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:05,586
YESUNG is out.

169
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:08,422
Chilgok Station only exists
in campaign promises.

170
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:10,458
Okay, you're out.

171
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,793
(YESUNG moves to the loser's seat.)

172
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,095
Do you know what he said?

173
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,898
When they said it was in a campaign
promise, he said, "Does it have to run?"

174
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:19,166
Do you know what he said
right before that?

175
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,635
He said, "I've been there."

176
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:24,105
(Where exactly did I go?)

177
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:24,972
LEETEUK.

178
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:27,642
(Starting from LEETEUK)

179
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:30,244
(Happily doing
Kung Kung Ttari Kung Kung Tta)

180
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:32,947
(Thrilled to have survived)

181
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:35,583
Wild goose.

182
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,418
(LEETEUK starts strong.)

183
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:38,753
(Wild goose)

184
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:41,088
Lubrication.

185
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:42,123
Lubrication.

186
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:44,759
(The attack
that eliminated YESUNG earlier)

187
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,228
(You have to think.)

188
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:49,664
(Will he survive this time?)

189
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:51,265
Chilgok Station.

190
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,570
(My Chilgok Station crumbled today.)

191
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,072
Chilgok Station.

192
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:04,979
(Speechless)

193
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,814
It's not running.

194
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:07,748
Is it really not running?

195
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:09,350
Look it up.

196
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,886
(This is hilarious.)

197
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:14,188
By the time this airs,
it might be running.

198
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:18,092
(Successful attack)

199
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:22,129
Now I can't think of anything else.

200
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,432
The carpet is really messy right now.

201
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:27,435
Sorry, but this is my house.

202
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,904
Isn't this the show's studio?

203
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,639
Three people remain.

204
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,008
(Only 3 members left)

205
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:36,811
(The robot vacuum is close.)

206
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:39,580
(That vacuum is mine.)

207
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:42,783
Wild goose.

208
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,318
(Again, déjà vu)

209
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:46,053
Lubrication.

210
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,422
(Will EUNHYUK be eliminated like this?)

211
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,257
Turkey.

212
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:51,859
Cho Yong Pil.

213
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,394
Pilsajo.

214
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:54,996
Cho Yong Pil.

215
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,731
Pilsajo.

216
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:58,632
(Something feels off.)

217
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:00,534
Wait, Pilsajo?

218
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,371
(What is Pilsajo?)

219
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:06,407
(Angry reactions)

220
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,976
Pilsajo exists.

221
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:11,545
I've never heard of it
more than Chilgok Station.

222
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:12,880
Isn't that supposed to be "special skill?"

223
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,016
(Searching furiously)

224
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,517
You better know the real meaning.

225
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,719
There's "Bulsajo", but no "Pilsajo."

226
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,489
- It doesn't exist.
- LEETEUK is out.

227
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:24,325
He acted like it existed, repeating it.

228
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:27,628
He was so shameless.

229
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:28,662
You know what's funnier?

230
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:30,664
When you say Cho Yong Pil,
SIWON will say Pilsajo right after.

231
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:32,333
(Can't argue with that)

232
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,970
Only SIWON and EUNHYUK remain.

233
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,638
EUNHYUK,
do you have a robot vacuum at home?

234
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:38,572
Coincidentally, I don't.

235
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,974
SIWON, do you have one at home?

236
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:42,843
I do, but I don't use it.

237
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,812
If you have everything, why are you here?

238
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:48,449
Sorry, but there's a robot vacuum
and everything.

239
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,284
But why is there no Chilgok Station?

240
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,787
(Exactly)

241
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:55,089
It's not running.

242
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,724
(Too bad)

243
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,092
This is the final showdown.

244
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:03,164
The winner takes the robot vacuum.

245
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,332
Starting from SIWON.

246
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:06,333
Hold on.

247
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,903
Why ask to hold on?
You don't know what SIWON will say anyway.

248
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,739
(To prepare for possible words)

249
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:14,175
You showed up late today, EUNHYUK.
Why are you so determined?

250
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,276
Let me at least win this one thing.

251
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,677
If I win, I'll give it to you.

252
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,613
If I win, I'll give it to you.
Don't worry.

253
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:24,218
(Heart fluttering)

254
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,986
(Enough talk, start the game.)

255
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:29,090
(Sentimental moments are a luxury.)

256
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,093
(Who will win?)

257
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,663
Cho Yong Pil.

258
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:38,365
(Starting off with a direct attack)

259
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:39,934
That's no fun if you start like that.

260
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:42,603
You said you'd give it to him,
but you still want to win.

261
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,472
(Can't resist competition)

262
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,707
He started the game saying Cho Yong Pil.

263
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:50,077
Let me say the first word, then you go.

264
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:53,114
Start with "Shin."

265
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,382
Okay.

266
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:58,352
(SIWON's second try)

267
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:01,689
(Will he do it right this time?)

268
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:05,159
Shin Dong Yeob.

269
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,994
Shin Dong Yeob.

270
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,129
Yeob.

271
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,897
Person.

272
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:10,698
Hey.

273
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:13,934
You gave me something too difficult
from the start.

274
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,703
What is he doing?

275
00:10:15,703 --> 00:10:17,505
That's not fun at all.

276
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,974
SIWON pretends
he doesn't care about stuff.

277
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,909
But he's competitive.

278
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:23,511
(Absolutely true)

279
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,547
EUNHYUK goes first.

280
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:29,016
- I'll start with "dong."
- Okay, "dong."

281
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:31,619
(Man of competition SIWON vs.)

282
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:33,521
(Vacuum-obsessed man EUNHYUK)

283
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:37,057
(Who will win the final match?)

284
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:39,994
Dongchimi.

285
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,462
Mi...

286
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:43,697
(Will he be eliminated from Round 1?)

287
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:46,867
Minari.

288
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,903
Pushcart.

289
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:50,871
Car center.

290
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,773
Tire.

291
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,742
Eo*****jae.

292
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,944
(The Seongbuk-dong villa appears again.)

293
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,979
Balance sheet.

294
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:00,881
Pyo In Bong.

295
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:02,683
Garden balsam.

296
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,387
(A rally continues after a while.)

297
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:07,988
Tuesday.

298
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,723
Sunday.

299
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,091
Sunday.

300
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,260
Sunday.

301
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,562
(The Sunday loop begins.)

302
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,897
Sunday.

303
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:18,599
Tattletale.

304
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:22,937
(Can he block this attack?)

305
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,471
Full moon.

306
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,106
Moon land.

307
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,608
Leica.

308
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,043
Leica.

309
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:30,844
Car center.

310
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,112
Tire.

311
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,914
Eo*****jae.

312
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:35,616
Balance sheet.

313
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:37,318
Pyo In Bong.

314
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:38,385
(Back to Pyo In Bong again)

315
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:40,788
You have to keep going.

316
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,123
Garden balsam.

317
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:44,892
Restroom.

318
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,460
Working office.

319
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,229
Indoor shoes.

320
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,830
Tuesday.

321
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,398
Sunday.

322
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,768
(Stuck in the Sunday swamp)

323
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,104
Japanese restaurant.

324
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:58,739
Housewarming.

325
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:01,375
Yi Seong Gye.

326
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,577
(Yi Seong Gye?)

327
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,313
(A difficult word out of nowhere)

328
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:09,049
(Can EUNHYUK survive this?)

329
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,951
Yi Seong Gye.

330
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,253
Gye…

331
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,887
No.

332
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:15,289
Who's Gye?

333
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:19,994
(EUNHYUK suddenly becomes a nobleman.)

334
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:23,697
(The dream of taking the vacuum
shattered before Gye.)

335
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,833
And with that,

336
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:30,471
SIWON gets the robot vacuum.

337
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:31,805
(Jealous)

338
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:34,942
(SIWON promised to give it
to EUNHYUK if he won.)

339
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:37,378
(Hopeful)

340
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,580
To EUNHYUK...

341
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,815
Donate it
when Chilgok Station starts running.

342
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:44,018
I heard EUNHYUK moved recently.

343
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,320
Handsome guy.

344
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,522
- I'll transfer it to him.
- EUNHYUK, will you...

345
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:52,226
donate this prize to SHINDONG?

346
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,527
Donate it.

347
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,396
Why are there so many hurdles?

348
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:57,097
Donate it.

349
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:58,699
(United in teasing the members)

350
00:12:58,699 --> 00:12:59,667
You know what's amazing?

351
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,068
That's the only thing I didn't buy.

352
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:02,336
Really?

353
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,705
<i>Donate it, Kung Kung Tta</i>

354
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,373
For reference, I heard everything here...

355
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:09,343
was picked by SHINDONG himself
because he wanted it.

356
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,478
The world of competition is cold.

357
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:15,949
EUNHYUK, will you donate this to SHINDONG?

358
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:19,086
Then this prize...

359
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,321
(What's EUNHYUK's decision?)

360
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:23,457
(Donating to vacuum-less SHINDONG?)

361
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,827
I'll keep it.

362
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:27,961
(Not giving up)

363
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:32,399
(SIWON's whisper wins.)

364
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,968
(I knew it.)

365
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,338
(So excited)

366
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:38,439
You're such a punk.

367
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,574
You didn't even win and you came late.

368
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:45,145
(The ultimate vacuum owner is EUNHYUK.)

369
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:50,417
(And the robot vacuum was installed
at EUNHYUK's house.)

370
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,020
(It recognizes
and avoids obstacles using a camera.)

371
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,091
(Images are used only for
obstacle recognition and classification.)

372
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:01,328
(Strict data security maintained)

373
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:10,504
(The technician completes the installation
and mapping.)

374
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:12,005
So we played all the games today.

375
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,375
It was super fun for a housewarming.

376
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,677
(The guests are 100 percent satisfied.)

377
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:18,712
You purposely lost...

378
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:21,849
so you could give me prizes.

379
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,251
I'm happy but I got too many.

380
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:27,821
Since someone tried really hard,
I thought I'd give him something.

381
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:30,324
Today's MVP, the one who worked hardest,

382
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,825
HEECHUL.

383
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,827
I'll give this gaming monitor as a gift.

384
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,496
Chilgok Station.

385
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,030
Shin Dong Yeob.

386
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:39,967
Thank you for the monitor.

387
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,735
Can I pick one member?

388
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,570
This is the first time
I saw this person sweat.

389
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,738
- Really.
- YESUNG.

390
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,840
To YESUNG...

391
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,343
(Another MVP, YESUNG)

392
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,346
(YESUNG receives a beam projector.)

393
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,815
I hope Chilgok Station runs soon.

394
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,383
If it does,

395
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,619
it's thanks to YESUNG.

396
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:01,088
You must visit there.

397
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:03,023
(Future ambassador of Chilgok Station)

398
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:05,025
Good job today. It was fun.

399
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:06,260
It was so much fun.

400
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:10,531
Go home safely. Hurry and leave now.

401
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:12,199
Go now. Thank you.

402
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,534
That was fun.

403
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:15,068
(Goodbye)

404
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,271
Good job. Go.

405
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:21,208
(SHINDONG finally alone)

406
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,510
I'll never say things like that again.

407
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,947
Still, thanks to this,
my household goods improved.

408
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:30,384
Take care and don't come again.

409
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:31,452
Bye.

410
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:35,422
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

411
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,760
(EUNHYUK fast asleep)

412
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,962
EUNHYUK, wake up.

413
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,865
I was finally sleeping well.

414
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:46,700
Who woke me up?

415
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:50,637
Wait.

416
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:51,705
Producer.

417
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:54,675
(Acting it off with laughter)

418
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:56,109
Producer.

419
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,212
What are you doing in my house?

420
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:00,247
EUNHYUK, from now on,

421
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,851
you've been appointed as the guide for
SUPER JUNIOR's 20th anniversary retreat.

422
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:05,085
Me?

423
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,988
Why?

424
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,458
(YESUNG was chosen as the one
who took the worst photo.)

425
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,528
(And EUNHYUK appeared
in both worst photo candidates.)

426
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,397
If EUNHYUK isn't getting a penalty
with me, then I'm not accepting it.

427
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:18,999
(So both receive the penalty together.)

428
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:21,902
(The penalty mission given to them)

429
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:24,338
Main guide EUNHYUK,
assistant guide YESUNG.

430
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:26,673
No.

431
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:30,377
I have to control
the disobedient SUPER JUNIOR members?

432
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:32,746
Me, a guide?

433
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,014
No way.

434
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,452
I'm good at planning trips,

435
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:41,722
but with the members…

436
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,991
(Already worried before even starting)

437
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:46,493
First...

438
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:49,363
(Calling someone)

439
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,899
- EUNHYUK.
- YESUNG.

440
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:58,572
We're going
on our 20th anniversary retreat together.

441
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:01,775
I'm the guide,
and you're the assistant guide.

442
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,510
We need to plan this retreat.

443
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,012
We're class president and vice president?

444
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,713
Class president, vice president.

445
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,382
So the dues...

446
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,683
(Should we set the dues?)

447
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:14,187
Should do it by playing a game
and whoever loses pays...

448
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:16,523
or just collect money from everyone?

449
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:18,292
I'm good with anything.

450
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,294
We can play a game,

451
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:22,529
or the rich one, you, can pay.

452
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,298
Or the rich one, you, can pay.

453
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,867
(Look at him.)

454
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,469
(New singer EUNHYUK, idol for life
who got 1st place 12 days after debut)

455
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,171
Doing that doesn't make money.

456
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,807
(Money and fame aren't the same.)

457
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:34,908
Then how about…

458
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,043
Then how about…

459
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,778
the eldest pays?

460
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:38,979
Yes.

461
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:41,715
Let's get LEETEUK to treat us.

462
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:45,919
Forget about being stingy or Scrooge.

463
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:48,722
Isn't it time he treated us?

464
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,324
It's the 20th anniversary.

465
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:51,425
Okay.

466
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:54,261
We need to assign roles.

467
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:55,629
Like how we're president
and vice president.

468
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:56,797
Right, let's assign them.

469
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:59,032
If we go with a school theme,

470
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,301
RYEOWOOK suits being the chef.

471
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,971
Chef RYEOWOOK.

472
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,639
What should we have SIWON do?

473
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,041
Should we just have him swimming?

474
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:12,212
(SIWON's visuals are perfect
even when he's just swimming.)

475
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:15,415
Let's put SIWON as assistant chef.

476
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,284
Pair him with RYEOWOOK.

477
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:20,053
Assistant chef SIWON.

478
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:21,922
(Starting with RYEOWOOK and SIWON,)

479
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:28,929
(roles are assigned to all the members.)

480
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:31,431
(Class president EUNHYUK,
vice president YESUNG)

481
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:32,432
(Manager KYUHYUN,
entertainment head SHINDONG)

482
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:33,433
(Cleaning heads LEETEUK and HEECHUL,
chef RYEOWOOK, assistant chef SIWON)

483
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,334
(Photography head DONGHAE)

484
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:37,104
(Now calling other members to inform them)

485
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,674
(EUNHYUK makes a video call to LEETEUK.)

486
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:43,677
(I hope he answers.)

487
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:46,380
(No response from LEETEUK)

488
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,982
He's not usually this busy.

489
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,451
(I'm busy.)

490
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:55,222
(There are too many members to call,
so next.)

491
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:59,860
(Will SHINDONG answer?)

492
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,194
(He picked up.)

493
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,630
What?

494
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,798
Why are you answering?

495
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,836
(HEECHUL picked up SHINDONG's phone.)

496
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,607
You're together. That's great.

497
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,442
I was going to call you both anyway.

498
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,146
LEETEUK is here, too.

499
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:20,147
(The one who didn't answer is also there.)

500
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:21,715
Why are you there?

501
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:24,284
The three of us are secretly meeting.

502
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:27,487
I just called LEETEUK,
but he didn't answer.

503
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,356
Why did you call?

504
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:31,458
- I'm busy.
- He's caught.

505
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,759
Okay, then.

506
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,265
Everyone, we're going
on our 20th anniversary retreat.

507
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,867
He's wearing makeup.

508
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,303
(They're not listening.)

509
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:44,838
Hear me out.

510
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,807
I lost weight.

511
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,309
- I don't think so.
- Guys.

512
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,978
Nobody can control them.

513
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,280
Hurry and talk.

514
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,083
Let me tell you your roles.

515
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,751
We have roles?

516
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,821
LEETEUK and HEECHUL.

517
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:03,523
You two are cleaning men.

518
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,926
- What about SHINDONG?
- SHINDONG is...

519
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,194
the entertainment head.

520
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:10,397
(But we're cleaning staff.)

521
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:14,301
(As expected of EUNHYUK)

522
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:17,838
I wanted to do a quick survey...

523
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,507
of what we should do during the retreat.

524
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:22,409
Let's decide on this.

525
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:23,410
Late fee.

526
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:25,746
Ten dollars per minute.

527
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,614
Twenty dollars per minute.

528
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:29,216
Twenty dollars per minute?

529
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:30,650
That's a good idea.

530
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,452
(That should motivate them to come early.)

531
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,187
Dues.

532
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:37,090
The class president should handle that.

533
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:39,726
(Sorry, our food just arrived.)

534
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:41,595
(To feed the cold and hungry members,
the call ends.)

535
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,830
I'll consider this and finalize things.

536
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,066
- I'm hanging up.
- And I'll let you know.

537
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,435
(Call ended)

538
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,238
I didn't gain much from this call.

539
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,742
(Who is he calling next?)

540
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:56,643
What is it?

541
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:58,745
(Prince RYEOWOOK)

542
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:00,447
Is there any role you want?

543
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:02,582
Mood setter?

544
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:06,186
(SUPER JUNIOR's official energizer
RYEOWOOK)

545
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:07,721
That's a role?

546
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:09,389
Mood setter?

547
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,324
I'll mediate if anyone fights.

548
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:13,860
Okay, I'll note that.

549
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,329
- Okay.
- But you're the chef.

550
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:18,865
That's boring.

551
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,802
Your assistant will be...

552
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,837
SIWON.

553
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,074
(Just laughing)

554
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:29,342
Good, right?

555
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:32,012
Then we'll go with premium ingredients.

556
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:34,114
Gourmet meals.

557
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:35,282
SIWON.

558
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:38,752
Your role is...

559
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:40,220
assistant chef.

560
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,455
The main chef is...

561
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:43,757
RYEOWOOK.

562
00:21:43,757 --> 00:21:45,525
(Not a freeze frame)

563
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:46,693
I'll hang up now.

564
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:51,131
Just do whatever RYEOWOOK tells you to.

565
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:53,366
That's how it always is.

566
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,535
We'll count on you again this time.

567
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,705
(YESUNG calling DONGHAE)

568
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:01,074
You'll be in charge of photos this time.

569
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:02,676
- Me?
- Yes.

570
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,377
I'm so excited.

571
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:05,745
We're counting on you.

572
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,182
You'll be the manager this time.

573
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:11,585
Manager, that's not bad.

574
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:12,686
It's good, right?

575
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,222
I'll be managing the money.

576
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:18,291
Make sure no one gets left out.

577
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:22,562
(All members have been assigned roles.)

578
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,465
(The day before the retreat)

579
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:26,633
(This is advance notice for SUPER JUNIOR's
20th anniversary unplanned retreat.)

580
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:27,801
(Please gather at Ttukseom Hangang Park
by 11 AM tomorrow.)

581
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:28,969
(There will be a late fee if you're late.)

582
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,136
(The dress code is green.)

583
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,271
(The participation fee is up
to how much you love SUPER JUNIOR.)

584
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,839
(Do your best in your roles.)

585
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,077
(Yes, Guide. I'm looking forward to it.)

586
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:41,615
(Day of the unplanned retreat
at Ttukseom Hangang Park)

587
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:44,651
(Meeting time is 11 AM)

588
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,320
(There's a 20-dollar late fee
per minute today.)

589
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,856
(Will everyone arrive on time?)

590
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,894
(A car pulls up.)

591
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:58,899
(Who is the first to arrive?)

592
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,570
(Guide EUNHYUK arrives first.)

593
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,939
(EUNHYUK arrives 19 minutes early.)

594
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:09,976
Isn't this setup too early?

595
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:12,312
The members probably aren't ready yet.

596
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:14,514
(Another two cars arrive.)

597
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:16,249
(Who arrived
against EUNHYUK's expectations?)

598
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:17,450
That can't be.

599
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,620
(HEECHUL arrives.)

600
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,723
(Who is the other member?)

601
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,259
(Prince RYEOWOOK)

602
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:29,129
(HEECHUL and RYEOWOOK arrived
17 minutes early.)

603
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,698
I can't believe you're here now.

604
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:32,966
What the...

605
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,634
I can't believe you're here early.

606
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,503
I didn't even do my makeup.

607
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:37,304
I'm so sleepy.

608
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:41,308
If you're filming,
you should come with makeup.

609
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,477
This look is not polite.

610
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:47,681
I didn't expect these two.

611
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,183
(There's still plenty of time.)

612
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:54,354
(Pretty natural appearance)

613
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,890
You're not HEECHUL yet,
so you don't count.

614
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,358
I get 300 dollars, right?

615
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:00,994
You're Kim Heebong right now, so no.

616
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:02,395
Why didn't you do your makeup?

617
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:03,730
Is this starting already?

618
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,701
(Exchanging morning compliments)

619
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:10,236
Who is that?

620
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:13,373
(A car enters the meeting area.)

621
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:15,942
Who is that?

622
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:18,378
(Man like the ocean, DONGHAE)

623
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:19,779
What is this?

624
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,515
Wait, this can't be.

625
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:25,118
SUPER JUNIOR is always early.

626
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:26,319
Because money's involved.

627
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,787
(The scary power of late fees)

628
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:29,356
Let's change our name...

629
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,524
- to Capitalist Junior.
- Trust me. If there wasn't a late fee,

630
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:33,360
nobody would show up early like this.

631
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,731
Do they just not sleep in anymore?

632
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:40,066
Everyone's early.

633
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,035
Why are you here early?

634
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,170
I guess I'm old now. I can't sleep.

635
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,638
Why are you early?

636
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:48,308
I wake up in the morning.

637
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:50,744
(10:47 AM, DONGHAE arrives.)

638
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:53,513
(Military wake-up time is 6:30 AM.)

639
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:54,381
We're way too early.

640
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,216
Since we're filming, get out.

641
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:58,918
Wait on the bus.

642
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:01,154
We always need a late fee.

643
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:04,257
(Slips in)

644
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,393
Please go inside.

645
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:07,594
Why do you keep coming out?

646
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:11,064
Just in case I get accused of being late,

647
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:13,533
I should take a selfie with the clock.

648
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,268
Let's do the briefing first.

649
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,970
You haven't even done the briefing?

650
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,874
You all came earlier than I expected.

651
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:22,175
So everything's out of order now.

652
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,443
Do we need proof?

653
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:26,613
(Proof photo)

654
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:29,783
(10 minutes before meeting time)

655
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:32,385
(Another car enters the meeting area.)

656
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:34,120
What you will all do today...

657
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,122
Whose car is this?

658
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:39,292
(Camera-hungry)

659
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:41,594
(Hello, it's me.)

660
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:44,497
(SHINDONG's dramatic entrance)

661
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:46,766
Move the car.

662
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,803
(10:50 AM, SHINDONG arrives.)

663
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:51,871
SHINDONG, you're here.

664
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:53,673
Go inside.

665
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:54,674
Go inside. Why do you keep coming out?

666
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,309
(DONGHAE is excited to see SHINDONG.)

667
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,811
Why are you so early today?

668
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,979
You can't be late for filming.

669
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:02,415
Don't block my camera. Go inside.

670
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,752
Is there any food inside?

671
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,153
Is there food?

672
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:08,455
Quiet.

673
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:11,057
We'll feed you later.

674
00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:13,026
Stay inside.

675
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:15,995
He's early and causing a mess.

676
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:19,232
I shouldn't have mentioned a late fee.

677
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:20,800
Why decide on a late fee?

678
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,669
Nobody's late these days.

679
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:25,905
We're supposed to meet at 11 AM.

680
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:27,540
It's seven minutes to 11 AM.

681
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:32,312
(Another car enters.)

682
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:33,880
(Who will it be this time?)

683
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,348
I think it's YESUNG.

684
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:37,784
(Is it YESUNG or someone else?)

685
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:39,819
(EUNHYUK guesses right.)

686
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,789
It's 10:53 AM.

687
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:44,891
(YESUNG arrives at 10:53 AM.)

688
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:48,595
Assistant guide, how could you come late?

689
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:49,629
Sorry.

690
00:26:51,197 --> 00:26:52,699
What, again?

691
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:55,168
(Who's arriving now?)

692
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:57,403
(SIWON)

693
00:26:57,403 --> 00:27:00,140
(At this rate,
everyone might arrive before 11 AM.)

694
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:02,575
(SIWON's arrival shakes up Ttukseom.)

695
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,010
This is SIWON, ma'am.

696
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:08,081
(Assemblyman SIWON is here to win hearts.)

697
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:10,783
He's very busy.

698
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:14,621
He's loved by many elders.

699
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:16,856
Let's take a photo together.

700
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:18,358
Here's LEETEUK.

701
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:21,995
- LEETEUK, I see.
- Yes, I'm LEETEUK.

702
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:23,062
You're not LEETEUK.

703
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:24,130
(Smiling)

704
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:27,467
(EUNHYUK still got it.)

705
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,436
(Spontaneous fan meeting at Ttukseom)

706
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:33,506
(The fan meeting ends successfully.)

707
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:34,974
These guys are afraid of the late fee.

708
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:36,109
SIWON, you're here.

709
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:40,113
(DONGHAE excited to see someone new)

710
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:41,481
Don't come out yet.

711
00:27:41,481 --> 00:27:43,983
(I want to play.)

712
00:27:43,983 --> 00:27:45,151
(Obedient)

713
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:46,052
I'm not late, right?

714
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:46,920
You're not late.

715
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,788
(10:57 AM, SIWON arrives.)

716
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:50,723
The richer they are,
the more effort they put in...

717
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,659
to avoid the late fee.

718
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:55,995
(Will everyone make it on time?)

719
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,431
(KYUHYUN arrives naturally.)

720
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,867
You're acting like it's nothing,
but hold on.

721
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,869
You're totally unprepared.

722
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:04,404
(Playing dumb)

723
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:07,845
(Obviously someone who just woke up
and came out with a cap on)

724
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:09,648
(Just then...)

725
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:12,384
(YESUNG brought welcome drinks.)

726
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:15,087
(It's YESUNG.)

727
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:18,224
(They just need LEETEUK to arrive
for full attendance.)

728
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,659
(A car arrives with 1 minute left.)

729
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,595
This is really insane, seriously.

730
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:23,662
I'm here.

731
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,800
(Everyone successfully arrived on time.)

732
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,869
Shouldn't we ban individual filming?

733
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:34,139
Personal cameras will be confiscated.

734
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:35,241
This isn't allowed.

735
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:38,510
(Hearing LEETEUK is here,
DONGHAE runs out.)

736
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,412
LEETEUK, you're here.

737
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:41,880
Everyone get inside.

738
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,382
We can't proceed.

739
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:45,117
Who was late?

740
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:48,187
(Getting intense)

741
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:51,156
Nobody's listening,
so I'll just let everyone come out.

742
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,124
Everyone.

743
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:54,627
(Filming the opening together)

744
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,630
The assistant guide prepared something.

745
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,366
I brought coffee
in case your throats were dry...

746
00:29:00,366 --> 00:29:02,868
from early morning.

747
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,270
Please hand them out one by one.

748
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,938
(Hurry, please.)

749
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:08,741
(Okay, have a cup each.)

750
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:10,242
Why is the amount so big?

751
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:13,779
(Mega-size, fitting for SUPER JUNIOR)

752
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:16,282
Mega Coffee comes in mega sizes.

753
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,051
Don't you have something more energizing?

754
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,419
Zero**?

755
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:21,287
Try this one.

756
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:24,957
(DONGHAE takes a sip.)

757
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,595
It's good.

758
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:31,430
Where's our destination today?

759
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,965
I feel so energized I could walk there.

760
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:33,766
Wait a minute.

761
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,067
Wait a minute.

762
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:37,369
(What suddenly?)

763
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,338
I think I'm falling into the coffee.

764
00:29:39,338 --> 00:29:41,106
(They can't believe their ears.)

765
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,875
(Flustered by the nonsense)

766
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,109
Just get out.

767
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:47,012
(Reflecting)

768
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:51,583
Now officially starting
SUPER JUNIOR's 20th anniversary retreat...

769
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,885
Is this caffeine?

770
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:56,121
(Ignoring with clenched teeth)

771
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:56,955
Guys.

772
00:29:56,955 --> 00:29:59,291
Drinking coffee makes me excited.

773
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,227
- As you all know,
- Sir, please be quiet.

774
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:03,896
we set a dress code.

775
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:05,364
Who chose green?

776
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:07,533
Who is it?

777
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,368
It should've been blue or something.

778
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:11,203
Whoever chose green, raise your hand.

779
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,906
(Seriously, who did that?)

780
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:15,307
Who is it?

781
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:16,875
Raise your hand, RYEOWOOK.

782
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:18,777
(The one behind the dress code)

783
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,846
Let's check one by one.

784
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,181
- SHINDONG.
- Let's see.

785
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:24,750
First, green shoes.

786
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,552
(Green-striped shoes)

787
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,721
I prepared this. It's green.

788
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,723
You should've worn that outside.

789
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:31,890
Wear it outside.

790
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,092
Wear this outside?

791
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:35,694
Did SHINDONG pass or fail?

792
00:30:35,694 --> 00:30:38,197
- Fail.
- Fail.

793
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:40,366
Then everyone fails.

794
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:43,001
Wait, do we go home if we fail?

795
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,403
There's a 20-dollar penalty.

796
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,573
You're just trying
to collect money, right?

797
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:48,874
SHINDONG, 20 dollars.

798
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:51,310
This kind of thing
must be paid immediately.

799
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,112
- There's green here.
- That's green.

800
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,313
There's green.

801
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,849
(Spotted green)

802
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:00,552
Fine, but first pay 20 dollars.

803
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:02,755
(No mercy from the guide)

804
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:03,756
But I'm wearing green shoes.

805
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,225
RYEOWOOK.

806
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:07,192
RYEOWOOK.

807
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,795
(Confident)

808
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,231
He should pay 200 dollars for that.

809
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:13,365
Please lend me 20 dollars.

810
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,836
(Voluntarily paying fine)

811
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,038
Isn't he the organizer?

812
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,874
That's disrespectful,
so pay 20 dollars more.

813
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,809
They said 20 dollars more.

814
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:26,345
Why do you keep asking me?

815
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,346
Am I an ATM?

816
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:30,416
Thirty dollars.

817
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,651
(RYEOWOOK is fined 30 dollars.)

818
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,986
- DONGHAE.
- I have green here.

819
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,187
DONGHAE, fail.

820
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,221
That's not green.

821
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,257
- Lime green is okay.
- That's mint.

822
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,959
(It's lime green.)

823
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,930
Did DONGHAE succeed or fail?

824
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,632
- I succeeded.
- No, he totally failed.

825
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,734
- Why?
- One, two, three.

826
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,269
Fail, pay 20 dollars.

827
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:51,136
One, two, three.

828
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,204
- Success.
- Fail.

829
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,105
(The only one who said "success")

830
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:55,474
- Pay 20 dollars.
- SHINDONG, lend me 20 dollars.

831
00:31:55,474 --> 00:31:57,376
(Again?)

832
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,977
(DONGHAE is fined 20 dollars.)

833
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:00,012
I'll pay you later.

834
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:01,280
(Be sure to pay back.)

835
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,382
I'm clearly wearing green.

836
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,050
That's not green.

837
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,718
- That's...
- That's grass green.

838
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:07,853
That's mugwort green.

839
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:09,755
(Dumbfounded)

840
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:11,723
But we meant green only.

841
00:32:12,324 --> 00:32:15,127
(Let's vote.)

842
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:16,829
(Fail)

843
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:20,499
(Naturally looking for ATM SHINDONG)

844
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,001
You guys didn't bring money?

845
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,303
Where's my wallet?

846
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:26,438
SIWON, pay 20 dollars.

847
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:27,639
Yes, I'll bring it.

848
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:29,842
(Taking out cash from wallet)

849
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,910
(SIWON paid the fine.)

850
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,545
HEECHUL.

851
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:34,546
Totally green.

852
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:36,448
(Totally green)

853
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:38,083
That's an accessory.

854
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,351
An accessory?

855
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,786
That's just an accessory.

856
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:42,521
I'll allow accessories.

857
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:43,655
But what's with YESUNG's outfit?

858
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,358
(We can't find green anywhere.)

859
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:47,326
Look.

860
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:49,294
Totally green.

861
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:50,262
Totally lime green.

862
00:32:51,497 --> 00:32:54,867
If you're going to do this,
don't set dress codes from now on.

863
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,602
This is the worst.

864
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,070
Everyone is the worst, except me.

865
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,538
This is green.

866
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:00,639
Can you wear it?

867
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:04,810
(Only wearable items are valid.)

868
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:06,712
- I can't wait for the next one.
- HEECHUL.

869
00:33:06,712 --> 00:33:08,280
One, two, three.

870
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,249
(Dead)

871
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,416
Do you accept Samsung Pay?

872
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:14,186
- No.
- SHINDONG, lend me 20 dollars.

873
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:18,490
(Only ATM SHINDONG can be trusted.)

874
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,892
You have a lot of cash.

875
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:24,496
(Thanks to the cash-rich SHINDONG,
fine collection proceeds smoothly.)

876
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:26,098
Next.

877
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:29,001
(Today's highlight, YESUNG)

878
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,869
Let me say something.

879
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:33,438
- You have to pay 2,000 dollars.
- So disappointing.

880
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,040
(What is YESUNG's green item?)

881
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,441
I have green on my necklace.

882
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:38,343
(What even...)

883
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:39,311
One, two, three.

884
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,013
(Fail without question)

885
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:43,348
This is the worst.

886
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,684
- He should be out of the shoot.
- He's today's worst.

887
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,621
(I'm here to borrow cash.)

888
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:51,189
What is with these people?

889
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,824
Nobody has money.

890
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,959
Give him 50 dollars.

891
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,227
Give change, please.

892
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:56,929
(Change available)

893
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,630
Isn't that all my money?

894
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,399
I paid.

895
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,600
(Innocent SIWON)

896
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,269
- Look at me.
- I think his outfit is fine.

897
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:06,838
This is green, guys.

898
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,407
This is green for sure.

899
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:09,908
(Everyone seems to agree.)

900
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:12,077
That seems acceptable,
but let's still vote.

901
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:13,512
(Wait a second.)

902
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:14,580
If it's acceptable, why vote?

903
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:16,248
If it's acceptable, why vote?

904
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:18,216
(United only in moments like this)

905
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:20,686
Majority rules.

906
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,689
We shouldn't do it this way.

907
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:25,357
Those who did it well should be praised.

908
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:26,525
Then what about me?

909
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,393
You failed.

910
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:30,662
You should've worn a green outer.

911
00:34:30,662 --> 00:34:33,131
Who wears dress codes on the outside?

912
00:34:33,131 --> 00:34:35,534
Let those two slide. It's LEETEUK's turn.

913
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:37,035
I have green.

914
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,137
(Proper green)

915
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:40,639
What's that?

916
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,007
Pay 20 dollars now.

917
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:44,443
That was even boring, so pay 40.

918
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:46,111
There's no green at all.

919
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:47,346
No green, just mint.

920
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,614
You guys don't understand fashion.

921
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:50,716
LEETEUK,
you're wearing the same color as me.

922
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:51,783
So you have to pay.

923
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:54,686
My bag is in the car. There.

924
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,688
Is LEETEUK paying money?

925
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:57,823
LEETEUK doesn't carry credit cards.

926
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:00,392
LEETEUK has money?

927
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:04,262
I'm global, so I brought foreign money.

928
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:06,431
(Come on.)

929
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:07,599
Seriously?

930
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,234
A lucky two-dollar bill.

931
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:13,705
Not even 20, but two dollars?

932
00:35:13,705 --> 00:35:14,506
There's a lot.

933
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:15,907
Take one each.

934
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,142
I brought them to share.

935
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,311
(DONGHAE is moved.)

936
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:21,947
(Fine payment dismissed with dollars)

937
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,216
If we're letting this go,
give me my money back.

938
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,418
There's a lot to do.

939
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,786
There's no time to waste.

940
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:30,589
We assigned roles to you all.

941
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,190
You remember that, right?

942
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,825
Just in case you forgot,

943
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:35,260
I brought something.

944
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:38,764
(YESUNG prepared role necklaces.)

945
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:39,998
(LEETEUK, HEECHUL/Cleaning Managers
YESUNG/Assistant Guide)

946
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:40,999
(SHINDONG/Entertainment Head,
EUNHYUK/Main Guide, SIWON/Assistant Cook)

947
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:41,800
(DONGHAE/Photography Head,
RYEOWOOK/Main Chef, KYUHYUN/Manager)

948
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,635
(Everyone has nametags.)

949
00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:45,537
The guide...

950
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:48,640
must be tired carrying this.

951
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,676
Hold on.

952
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:52,611
I'm not okay
with him being the assistant guide.

953
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,046
He's going to just stand around.

954
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,781
(Satisfied)

955
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,649
I'm working hard.

956
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,117
I even prepared your bag.

957
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,752
It should've been green.

958
00:36:00,752 --> 00:36:01,887
Sorry.

959
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:04,856
Guys, it's our 20th anniversary.

960
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:07,959
For our retreat,

961
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,729
we're going to Munmak.

962
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,564
My hometown, Wonju, Gangwon-do.

963
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:14,533
To go to Munmak,

964
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:17,269
everyone needs to write a pledge.

965
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:19,104
Marriage vows? I've never done that.

966
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:20,972
One by one, starting with LEETEUK.

967
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,507
Read it aloud.

968
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:24,843
Pledge, I will actively participate...

969
00:36:24,843 --> 00:36:26,111
in all activities today.

970
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:27,813
I will not complain or grumble...

971
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,382
about the activities during the retreat.

972
00:36:30,382 --> 00:36:33,351
That means "shut your mouth."

973
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:36,188
I will not show irritation...

974
00:36:36,188 --> 00:36:37,556
- and will keep smiling no matter what.
- Excuse me,

975
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:40,092
but is this all aimed at me?

976
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:42,294
It's for everyone. Keep smiling.

977
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:44,763
I will not speak negatively
during the retreat.

978
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:47,099
Why does it feel like I'm being targeted?

979
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,303
If you think that way,
you'd better watch out.

980
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:52,404
I will not skip any part
of today's schedule...

981
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:55,974
and participate 100 percent.

982
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:58,577
- That's aimed at me.
- You must attend 100 percent.

983
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:01,379
Also, if you witness anyone violating,

984
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:03,448
you can report it.

985
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:04,616
you can report it.

986
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:06,017
(Cheers of excitement)

987
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,085
We have a reporting system.

988
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:09,154
This is a bit too much.

989
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:11,323
Negative comment.

990
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:12,591
I haven't signed yet.

991
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:15,227
(Real-time camera activated)

992
00:37:15,227 --> 00:37:16,862
(He removed negative vibes.)

993
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:19,297
I signed.

994
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:22,768
(All signatures completed)

995
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:25,904
Once you're ready,
let's take a group photo and go.

996
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:27,839
Some sit, and some stand behind.

997
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,876
(SUPER JUNIOR gathered in full
for the first time in a while)

998
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:33,578
(Even more excited together)

999
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:36,214
We are SUPER JUNIOR.

1000
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:40,218
(What memories await?)

1001
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:44,956
(The real retreat starts now.)

1002
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:46,925
Is everyone ready to go?

1003
00:37:46,925 --> 00:37:48,527
(All ready)

1004
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:50,128
When do we eat?

1005
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:53,832
I thought you might be hungry,

1006
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:55,867
so we'll stop at a rest area for a meal.

1007
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,836
(Love it)

1008
00:37:57,836 --> 00:37:59,171
I'm sorry,

1009
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,006
but why'd you put me in the front seat
when I'm too big already?

1010
00:38:01,006 --> 00:38:02,407
There's a reason.

1011
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:07,078
We're playing a fun game on the way.

1012
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,281
You can win points in this game,

1013
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:11,817
and there's a benefit during lunch
based on those points.

1014
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:13,418
Nice.

1015
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:19,291
SHINDONG, the Entertainment Head,
will host the game.

1016
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,493
That's why he's sitting at the front.

1017
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:24,196
SHINDONG's Recreation Time.

1018
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:25,230
(Let's go.)

1019
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,498
Let's start right away.

1020
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:30,335
First game, Four Minds as One.

1021
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:32,037
For minds?

1022
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:33,438
Four.

1023
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:35,006
(Blocking bad jokes)

1024
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:37,375
(Answer in the order you're sitting,
get it right going back and forth.)

1025
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,611
(The members of the team
with the most correct get 1 point each.)

1026
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:44,382
The first question is an easy one.

1027
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:48,520
Say a word that ends in "eo."

1028
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,955
- Words that end in "eo?"
- Super.

1029
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,756
(But I'm not ready.)

1030
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,258
(Team Super's turn)

1031
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:55,093
Eo...

1032
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:56,862
(What's with the whining?)

1033
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,296
- Wrong.
- What was that?

1034
00:38:58,296 --> 00:38:59,464
What are you doing?

1035
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,932
- I was acting cute.
- Fish.

1036
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,101
(Okay, got it.)

1037
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:05,670
(Team TV's turn)

1038
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,671
Start.

1039
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:08,540
- What's that word?
- Wrong.

1040
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,908
Super.

1041
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:10,909
Butterfish.

1042
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:11,776
Salmon.

1043
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:13,478
- Mackerel.
- Mackerel.

1044
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,980
Wrong.

1045
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,115
I was going to say mackerel.

1046
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:18,149
TV.

1047
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,351
Salmon.

1048
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:20,218
Mackerel.

1049
00:39:20,218 --> 00:39:22,320
- Fresh fish.
- In-word.

1050
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,322
(Cry)

1051
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,491
(They must return to the start
to succeed.)

1052
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,960
You have to go back and forth.

1053
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,061
You didn't say that.

1054
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:31,830
I did earlier.

1055
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,864
(Team Super's chance again)

1056
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,832
Start.

1057
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:35,500
- Butterfish.
- Yes.

1058
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,902
Salmon.

1059
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:38,436
Squid.

1060
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:39,871
Mermaid.

1061
00:39:39,871 --> 00:39:41,206
Mackerel.

1062
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:42,674
- Flatfish.
- Next.

1063
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:43,708
Shark.

1064
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:47,879
(Team Super succeeds.)

1065
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,348
That was cheap
because they all said types of fish.

1066
00:39:57,348 --> 00:39:58,949
- Why is that cheap?
- Team Super...

1067
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:01,552
gets one point.

1068
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:04,922
There's a 250-point round later anyway.

1069
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:06,157
Next question.

1070
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:11,362
Say a famous line we all know
from a well-known movie or drama.

1071
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:13,330
- Super.
- But...

1072
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,632
you must do an impression as well.

1073
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:15,399
- Super.
- TV.

1074
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:17,601
Super was faster. Go.

1075
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,170
"Ma'am, you love him, right?"

1076
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:21,071
From "Parasite."

1077
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:25,443
"Stop it. I've had enough."

1078
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,410
From "Friend."

1079
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,379
- That was different.
- He sounded just like Jang Dong Gun.

1080
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:29,513
It was a bit off. Fail.

1081
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:31,315
(Unfair)

1082
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:32,516
He doesn't enunciate like that.

1083
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:35,519
(Here comes the real one.)

1084
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:38,622
Is that how we have to do it?

1085
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:41,158
(Okay, approved)

1086
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:42,226
TV.

1087
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:44,595
(Actor DONGHAE steps up.)

1088
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:46,130
(Expecting)

1089
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:47,298
"Why did you do that to me?"

1090
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:48,165
(Holding back laughter)

1091
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,467
"Why did you do that to me?"

1092
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,434
(What was that?)

1093
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,102
(What the…)

1094
00:40:52,603 --> 00:40:53,604
Fail.

1095
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,140
"A Bittersweet Life."

1096
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,374
I know that one.

1097
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,376
- It didn't sound like him.
- Super.

1098
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,978
"You insulted me."

1099
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:02,613
Okay, next.

1100
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:06,784
"Stop it. I've had enough."

1101
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:09,620
(Director SHINDONG likes it.)

1102
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,490
(Is this the umbrella scene
from "Temptation of Wolves?")

1103
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,524
- Fail.
- Why?

1104
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:15,559
- Fail.
- There's no line.

1105
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,927
If there were lines, it would've worked.

1106
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:18,562
TV.

1107
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:20,130
(Getting into character)

1108
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,131
"Tell me."

1109
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:23,133
I pass, right?

1110
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,602
(Approved)

1111
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:26,570
Didn't he used to do that
since debut days?

1112
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,438
LEETEUK.

1113
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:29,340
"You go to Hawaii."

1114
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:32,576
That's a different scene.

1115
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,978
Why grab here and say it?

1116
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:35,779
(He definitely didn't watch
the movie "Friend.")

1117
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,681
"You go to Hawaii."

1118
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,617
That line is said
with arms on the table like this.

1119
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:41,418
But LEETEUK is always awkward.

1120
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,520
Fail.

1121
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,054
Super.

1122
00:41:44,555 --> 00:41:47,525
When Lee Young Ae appeared
on "Lady Vengeance,"

1123
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:48,592
Kim Byung Ok...

1124
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:49,793
Correct, you look just like him.

1125
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,630
(He always passes with Kim Byung Ok.)

1126
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,631
Next.

1127
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,499
(That worked.)

1128
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:57,067
SIWON's next.

1129
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:59,103
"You've still got it."

1130
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,705
(Actor SIWON nailed it.)

1131
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,208
"Hey, I'm the one..."

1132
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,979
(EUNHYUK swallowed Choi Min Sik.)

1133
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:09,880
He's good.

1134
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,848
(Why so good though?)

1135
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:12,116
He did great.

1136
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:13,183
Next, RYEOWOOK.

1137
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,853
"Mind your own business."

1138
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,288
(He whispered it
just like in the actual scene.)

1139
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:18,556
That was too small.

1140
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:21,592
"Mind your own business." Okay, approved.

1141
00:42:21,592 --> 00:42:23,494
(Team Super made it halfway around.)

1142
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:25,229
- Is it me again?
- One,

1143
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:26,630
- two, three.
- What are you thinking?

1144
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,631
Fail.

1145
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:31,168
(Disqualified for no line)

1146
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:33,604
(Starting again from YESUNG)

1147
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:34,805
YESUNG.

1148
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,874
- Action.
- Focus, everyone.

1149
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:37,875
"Come back."

1150
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,744
- "Come back."
- Approved.

1151
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:43,147
(Perfect reenactment of Kate Winslet)

1152
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:44,214
Well done.

1153
00:42:44,214 --> 00:42:45,449
(Even the rival team agrees.)

1154
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:46,250
KYUHYUN.

1155
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:48,852
"Jack."

1156
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:49,987
That's the same as YESUNG.

1157
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:51,522
You can't do the same scene.

1158
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:52,590
It's a different scene.

1159
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,024
Different situation.

1160
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:56,894
(Obviously the same scene)

1161
00:42:56,894 --> 00:42:58,495
That's the same scene.

1162
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,997
Super.

1163
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:02,666
Now it's from the movie "Sunflower."

1164
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,734
Kim Byung Ok in "Sunflower."

1165
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:05,302
You look just like him. Okay.

1166
00:43:05,302 --> 00:43:06,537
Approved.

1167
00:43:06,537 --> 00:43:08,339
Let's see what he prepared.

1168
00:43:08,706 --> 00:43:11,008
(His face is a cheat code.)

1169
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:12,676
Passed, now SIWON.

1170
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:15,946
"You go to Hawaii."

1171
00:43:15,946 --> 00:43:17,448
He acted too cool.

1172
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:18,983
Okay, approved.

1173
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:21,452
(EUNHYUK showing a new act)

1174
00:43:21,452 --> 00:43:23,087
Approved.

1175
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:24,054
That's Yoo Hai Jin.

1176
00:43:24,054 --> 00:43:25,556
(Perfect)

1177
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:26,724
"Tazza: The High Rollers."

1178
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:27,691
RYEOWOOK.

1179
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:29,927
(RYEOWOOK tries Gang Dong Won's scene.)

1180
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,128
Success.

1181
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:33,197
Success, really?

1182
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:34,098
Three.

1183
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:35,899
(Then I'm Choi Min Sik.)

1184
00:43:35,899 --> 00:43:37,001
You did that earlier.

1185
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:39,503
(In a new round,
you can do the same scene from before.)

1186
00:43:39,803 --> 00:43:41,205
(Next up is SIWON.)

1187
00:43:43,407 --> 00:43:45,009
"Carry on."

1188
00:43:45,009 --> 00:43:46,276
He looks like him.

1189
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:47,177
HEECHUL.

1190
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,880
- Song Kang Ho from "No.3."
- Success.

1191
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:53,584
(How did he succeed without acting?)

1192
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:54,551
Show us.

1193
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,590
(His impression of Song Kang Ho is
exceptionally good.)

1194
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,825
(Satisfied audience)

1195
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:03,427
Give us a chance, too.

1196
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:06,964
(HEECHUL's one-man show)

1197
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:09,466
Success.

1198
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:11,035
Sir.

1199
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:12,169
Let YESUNG do one.

1200
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:13,837
- Let's do one more round.
- Let's go one more time.

1201
00:44:13,837 --> 00:44:15,239
One more time? Another round?

1202
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,174
(Same theme, another round)

1203
00:44:17,174 --> 00:44:19,810
We'll do it again.
The current score is two-to-zero.

1204
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,945
Team TV starts.

1205
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:22,980
YESUNG.

1206
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,314
(What will YESUNG perform?)

1207
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:27,051
"You want to go against me?"

1208
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:28,552
- Fail.
- What was that?

1209
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:29,553
I don't know.

1210
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:33,590
(What was that?)

1211
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,159
(What scene was that?)

1212
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,128
If you're going to suddenly act like that,
tell us beforehand.

1213
00:44:38,128 --> 00:44:39,997
"I Saw the Devil."

1214
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:41,965
I know who that is. YESUNG.

1215
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:43,600
Let's play a different game.

1216
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:45,903
(YESUNG made everyone laugh.)

1217
00:44:45,903 --> 00:44:46,870
Next.

1218
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,938
Let's go with an easy one.

1219
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:52,810
Say the name of a historical figure with 4
or more syllables, like King Sejong.

1220
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,312
- Super.
- Super.

1221
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,681
(You got this, right?)

1222
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,216
Yeon Gaesomun.

1223
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:00,684
Good.

1224
00:45:00,684 --> 00:45:01,819
Bak Hyeokgeose.

1225
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:03,087
Next.

1226
00:45:03,087 --> 00:45:04,021
Wonhyo Daesa.

1227
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:04,855
Next.

1228
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:07,991
That's a title, not a name.

1229
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,026
The full name...

1230
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:11,795
Then King Sejong shouldn't count either.

1231
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,964
(That's not their real name anyway.)

1232
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,667
King Sejong is too famous,
so we'll allow it.

1233
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,968
And Wonhyo's not famous?

1234
00:45:18,335 --> 00:45:20,471
(Let me try.)

1235
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:22,206
Shin Saimdang.

1236
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:23,207
Is it me again?

1237
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:24,775
Fail.

1238
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:25,609
Seriously?

1239
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,411
TV. Shin Saimdang.

1240
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:28,278
Shin Saimdang.

1241
00:45:28,278 --> 00:45:29,413
U-Know Yunho.

1242
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:31,248
- What?
- U-Know Yunho.

1243
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:33,217
(Did we hear that right?)

1244
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:35,719
Stop trying to be funny.

1245
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:38,122
- The K-pop legend U-Know Yunho.
- Super.

1246
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:39,757
Yeon Gaesomun.

1247
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:41,759
- Napoleon.
- Napoleon.

1248
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,993
- Bak Hyeokgeose.
- Good.

1249
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,828
- Shin Saimdang.
- Next.

1250
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,063
- Helen Keller.
- Next.

1251
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:47,397
(Ominous feeling)

1252
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:48,465
Wonhyo Daesa.

1253
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:49,600
Joan of Arc.

1254
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,502
(Team Super wins 3 questions in a row.)

1255
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:52,703
That was sexy, guys.

1256
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:54,037
- Nice.
- So...

1257
00:45:54,037 --> 00:45:56,907
Team Super wins.

1258
00:45:58,408 --> 00:45:59,610
We're so good.

1259
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,644
Is everyone having fun?

1260
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:01,812
Yes.

1261
00:46:02,112 --> 00:46:03,814
(Yes, no)

1262
00:46:03,814 --> 00:46:06,216
It's okay. There will be a question later
with 250 points.

1263
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,120
(Just then,
the bus makes a stop at a rest area.)

1264
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:11,822
We're already here?

1265
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:13,457
No, we're just taking down the banner.

1266
00:46:15,392 --> 00:46:20,397
(Just removing the banner
and heading to Munmak Service Area again)

1267
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:22,566
What? The rest area...

1268
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:24,001
Why didn't we use the bathroom?

1269
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:26,303
You should've asked earlier.
We were only removing the banner.

1270
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,772
I had to go to the bathroom.

1271
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,442
(HEECHUL missed his bathroom chance.)

1272
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:34,011
I should've gone.

1273
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:38,182
(He's feeling worse.)

1274
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:40,918
So with that, Team Super of four...

1275
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:42,519
HEECHUL's expression suddenly changed.

1276
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,855
His bladder hurts.

1277
00:46:44,855 --> 00:46:45,956
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

1278
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:47,758
I'm really uncomfortable.

1279
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:50,093
I'll drink this fast.

1280
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:51,161
They say it's only ten minutes away.

1281
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:52,596
Ten minutes.

1282
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:54,464
(Empty-minded)

1283
00:46:54,464 --> 00:46:56,767
Let's continue the game for ten minutes.

1284
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,604
How can his energy drop like that?

1285
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:05,475
Our team's game performance is dropping...

1286
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:07,611
due to bladder issues.

1287
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:09,313
You're being negative?

1288
00:47:09,313 --> 00:47:10,981
(Doesn't even have the energy to react)

1289
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,583
It's a chance for us, let's go.

1290
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,550
I drank almost all of it.

1291
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,819
This time it's an individual round.

1292
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:17,988
- An individual game.
- If it's individual, it's fine.

1293
00:47:17,988 --> 00:47:19,456
This game is...

1294
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:20,390
you're going to like this.

1295
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,728
That member will have a tough time
due to his condition.

1296
00:47:24,728 --> 00:47:27,164
It's the One-Second Music Quiz.

1297
00:47:27,164 --> 00:47:29,666
It's the One-Second Music Quiz.

1298
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:30,467
(Bad condition)

1299
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:31,602
It's our chance.

1300
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:34,471
I'll play one second of a K-pop intro.

1301
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:37,274
We don't know K-pop.

1302
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:40,944
Each person who gets it right
earns one point.

1303
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,779
- Great. That's a lot.
- Right now,

1304
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,315
- the members at the back have one point.
- One point per round?

1305
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:46,483
That's big.

1306
00:47:46,483 --> 00:47:48,352
I'm nervous so my stomach hurts.

1307
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:49,519
You know what I mean?

1308
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:50,621
Your sphincter?

1309
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,622
You're holding it in right now?

1310
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:52,789
I'm totally holding it.

1311
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:53,724
He must really need to go.

1312
00:47:53,724 --> 00:47:55,525
First question.

1313
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:57,561
Please be quiet. Here's the question.

1314
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:21,064
- I know.
- I know.

1315
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,132
"Inside the Bus" by ZaZa.

1316
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,566
Correct.

1317
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:25,702
(HEECHUL gets the first question
despite his bathroom issue.)

1318
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:57,105
HEECHUL is in bad condition,
so why is he doing well?

1319
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:32,390
"Armageddon" by aespa.

1320
00:50:53,452 --> 00:50:55,254
You guys wait.
I'll recharge and come back.

1321
00:50:55,254 --> 00:50:56,255
Go to the bathroom.

1322
00:50:56,255 --> 00:50:59,291
(They stopped for the emergency patient
at the rest area.)

1323
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:12,062
(He feels peace again.)

1324
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:36,742
"Monkey Magic" by Epaksa.

1325
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:38,043
Correct.

1326
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:35,333
"Not Ready to Say Goodbye"
by The Green Zone.

1327
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,502
I was about to say that.

1328
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:24,447
By BSS(SEVENTEEN)...

1329
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:25,448
"Fighting."

1330
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:27,249
Correct.

1331
00:55:43,749 --> 00:55:46,452
(Hyped up)

1332
01:00:37,002 --> 01:00:39,271
Now let's check current scores.

1333
01:00:39,271 --> 01:00:42,374
(HEECHUL 1st with 4 points)

1334
01:00:42,374 --> 01:00:44,376
KYUHYUN's doing terribly.

1335
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:46,211
You guys are too good.

1336
01:00:46,211 --> 01:00:48,580
If this was "New Journey to the West,"
no one would've guessed.

1337
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,951
Now only the final game remains.

1338
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:57,122
It's the Mission Call-In Game
of hearing the keyword through a call.

1339
01:00:57,122 --> 01:00:59,691
You'll each pick a slip
with a secret mission phrase.

1340
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:01,826
You must hear the phrase on the phone
to win.

1341
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:03,161
Easy, right?

1342
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,163
The first-place winner gets ten points.

1343
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:06,331
The second-place winner gets...

1344
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:08,300
The first-place winner gets ten points.

1345
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,668
Then what did I do all this for?

1346
01:01:09,668 --> 01:01:11,269
The second-place winner gets five.

1347
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:13,271
The third-place winner gets one.

1348
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:14,105
Got it?

1349
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:16,541
(I knew it'd be like this.)

1350
01:01:16,975 --> 01:01:19,477
(What kind of missions await?)

1351
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:23,582
(Please)

1352
01:01:25,584 --> 01:01:27,385
This is too hard.

1353
01:01:27,385 --> 01:01:29,754
Mine is so hard.
"You're like the Generation MZ."

1354
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:33,325
How do I make someone say
"You're so sexy" on the phone?

1355
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:36,428
("You're the best looking." "Give me
your bank info." "You're cute today.")

1356
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:39,364
("Are you crazy?"
"Should I come now?" "What a joke.")

1357
01:01:40,098 --> 01:01:41,566
I'll go first.

1358
01:01:41,566 --> 01:01:43,001
I'll get it over with.

1359
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:45,003
This is so easy.

1360
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:46,471
What was your phrase, KYUHYUN?

1361
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:48,673
"What a joke."

1362
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:50,575
I'll call one of our staff.

1363
01:01:51,242 --> 01:01:54,713
(Who should I call?)

1364
01:01:56,514 --> 01:01:58,650
(Connected)

1365
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,851
<i>That's funny</i>

1366
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:03,788
(Using song lyrics as a strategy)

1367
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:04,956
<i>That's funny</i>

1368
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:08,226
(Will it work?)

1369
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:09,294
In the song...

1370
01:02:09,294 --> 01:02:11,529
<i>That's funny</i>

1371
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:12,998
<i>What a joke</i>

1372
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:15,700
<i>What a joke</i>

1373
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,768
(Instant success)

1374
01:02:16,768 --> 01:02:17,702
Fourteen seconds.

1375
01:02:17,702 --> 01:02:19,237
Bye, see you later.

1376
01:02:19,237 --> 01:02:22,140
- That counts?
- Is that allowed?

1377
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,808
(Complaining after perfect success)

1378
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:24,909
I just said "That's funny."

1379
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,311
That was clever.

1380
01:02:26,311 --> 01:02:27,245
Fourteen seconds.

1381
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:29,648
(Success in just 14 seconds)

1382
01:02:29,648 --> 01:02:31,116
I don't know who to call.

1383
01:02:31,116 --> 01:02:33,852
(Second challenger LEETEUK)

1384
01:02:33,852 --> 01:02:35,654
(Mission phrase "Give me your bank info.")

1385
01:02:35,654 --> 01:02:36,755
Hello?

1386
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:39,591
(Connected with a friend)

1387
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:41,426
What are you doing?

1388
01:02:41,426 --> 01:02:42,560
Working, as usual.

1389
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,063
Actually,

1390
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:48,800
I don't think I can pay my loan right now.

1391
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,636
Can you lend me some money?

1392
01:02:51,636 --> 01:02:54,205
(Straight into the money talk)

1393
01:02:54,806 --> 01:02:56,508
How much?

1394
01:02:56,508 --> 01:02:58,143
About 20,000 dollars.

1395
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:04,082
(Will it work?)

1396
01:03:06,551 --> 01:03:08,286
Give me your bank info.

1397
01:03:08,286 --> 01:03:09,888
Success.

1398
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,556
Give me your bank info.

1399
01:03:11,556 --> 01:03:12,924
Success.

1400
01:03:12,924 --> 01:03:14,059
Thanks, I'll call you later.

1401
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:15,694
- Twenty-five seconds.
- Wait, did you text him first?

1402
01:03:15,694 --> 01:03:17,429
Wait, did you text him first?

1403
01:03:17,429 --> 01:03:18,463
I didn't.

1404
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:19,898
(Success raises suspicion.)

1405
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,499
He'd totally say that anyway.

1406
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:22,500
I didn't do anything.

1407
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:24,969
(SHINDONG's questioning)

1408
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,571
But you don't even have 20,000 dollars.

1409
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:31,443
I'd borrow to lend to LEETEUK.

1410
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:33,478
Thanks. I'll call you.

1411
01:03:34,512 --> 01:03:38,516
(1st KYUHYUN with 14 seconds
2nd LEETEUK with 25 seconds)

1412
01:03:38,516 --> 01:03:40,118
I'll try.

1413
01:03:40,118 --> 01:03:42,187
Let me try. I didn't text first.

1414
01:03:42,187 --> 01:03:43,822
Call Kang Ho Dong.

1415
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:46,591
(HEECHUL's phrase
"You're like the Generation MZ."

1416
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:48,026
Hello?

1417
01:03:48,026 --> 01:03:50,028
- Hey.
- Jang Hoon.

1418
01:03:50,028 --> 01:03:51,096
Where are you?

1419
01:03:51,096 --> 01:03:52,564
- He's Jang Hoon.
- Jang Hoon.

1420
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:57,302
I'm totally next-gen, right?
What do you think I'm like?

1421
01:03:57,302 --> 01:04:01,306
I know all the modern slang,
like "tbh" and so on.

1422
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:02,807
What's "tbh?"

1423
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:04,175
(Goodness)

1424
01:04:06,177 --> 01:04:08,246
I know what tba is. Did you say tba?

1425
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:10,648
- Tba.
- What's that?

1426
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:13,084
You're Gen X, Jang Hoon.

1427
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:14,486
Then what am I?

1428
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:16,087
I'm not Gen X.

1429
01:04:16,087 --> 01:04:17,722
I'm a Boomer.

1430
01:04:19,424 --> 01:04:21,993
(Hilarious)

1431
01:04:21,993 --> 01:04:24,462
Then what generation am I like?

1432
01:04:25,897 --> 01:04:27,565
You're multi-gen.

1433
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,335
Multi-gen.

1434
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:32,804
Multi-gen.

1435
01:04:32,804 --> 01:04:34,639
I called the wrong person.

1436
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:37,308
Jang Hoon will never say what I want.

1437
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:40,445
Thank you, everyone,
we're with Kim Jang Hoon.

1438
01:04:40,445 --> 01:04:41,813
(HEECHUL failed.)

1439
01:04:41,813 --> 01:04:44,149
- HEECHUL failed.
- Okay.

1440
01:04:44,149 --> 01:04:45,350
That was cool.

1441
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,384
Who's next?

1442
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:48,787
Wait a second.

1443
01:04:49,187 --> 01:04:50,622
(Who should I call?)

1444
01:04:50,622 --> 01:04:52,090
YESUNG is really looking.

1445
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,893
- If they don't pick up, you fail.
- I've got no one to call.

1446
01:04:54,893 --> 01:04:58,029
My makeup artist...

1447
01:04:58,029 --> 01:05:01,499
- No answer.
- EUNHYUK failed because nobody picked up.

1448
01:05:01,499 --> 01:05:04,068
RYEOWOOK failed.

1449
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:07,138
YESUNG failed.

1450
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:08,239
I'll try.

1451
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:09,908
DONGHAE, who will you call?

1452
01:05:09,908 --> 01:05:10,909
I'll call U-Know Yunho.

1453
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:13,511
(He needs to hear
"You're the best-looking.")

1454
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:15,480
I think Yunho might say that.

1455
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:19,584
(Will DONGHAE succeed?)

1456
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:20,585
Hello?

1457
01:05:21,085 --> 01:05:22,487
- Hey.
- Yunho.

1458
01:05:22,887 --> 01:05:24,222
Hey.

1459
01:05:24,222 --> 01:05:26,424
He just woke up
and it's 1:30 PM right now.

1460
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:28,927
Yunho, who's the most handsome
in our company?

1461
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:33,264
(Who will Yunho choose as best looking?)

1462
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:36,334
(1st and 2nd place winners are nervous.)

1463
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:38,603
(Please)

1464
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:39,604
Chang Min.

1465
01:05:40,939 --> 01:05:41,973
Chang Min.

1466
01:05:42,841 --> 01:05:44,909
(Chang Min, I see.)

1467
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,082
You failed, too.

1468
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:53,151
Yunho, who's the best-looking
in SUPER JUNIOR?

1469
01:05:54,385 --> 01:05:55,386
In SUPER JUNIOR?

1470
01:05:56,721 --> 01:05:58,423
None of them are my type.

1471
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:01,526
- Yunho.
- None of them are his type.

1472
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:04,662
Yunho, go back to sleep.

1473
01:06:05,697 --> 01:06:06,731
Good night.

1474
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:11,102
DONGHAE failed.

1475
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:12,403
DONGHAE failed.

1476
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:14,305
- That was hilarious.
- He loves Chang Min.

1477
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:18,243
KYUHYUN finished in 14 seconds,

1478
01:06:18,243 --> 01:06:19,711
and LEETEUK in 25 seconds.

1479
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:22,680
So KYUHYUN wins 1st place
and earns ten points.

1480
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,082
What's with him?

1481
01:06:24,082 --> 01:06:25,316
I'm so upset.

1482
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:27,352
- Why?
- I got all the songs right.

1483
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:29,153
- But it was fun.
- But with the phone call...

1484
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:32,357
So KYUHYUN gets the benefit
for winning first place.

1485
01:06:32,357 --> 01:06:34,025
It will be revealed shortly.

1486
01:06:34,025 --> 01:06:37,228
Let's head to Munmak Service Area.

1487
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:40,265
(With excitement in their hearts)

1488
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:41,900
(Driving and driving)

1489
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,534
(SUPER JUNIOR is on board.)

1490
01:06:43,868 --> 01:06:46,905
(They'll be dining at the rest area.)

1491
01:06:46,905 --> 01:06:51,309
We've arrived at Munmak Service Area.

1492
01:06:52,744 --> 01:06:54,379
Before eating,

1493
01:06:54,379 --> 01:06:55,847
- today,
- Ballad game.

1494
01:06:55,847 --> 01:06:57,916
we have to collect dues.

1495
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,852
- Again?
- I already lent all my cash.

1496
01:07:00,852 --> 01:07:02,186
- I don't have money.
- So,

1497
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,289
pay as much as you love SUPER JUNIOR.

1498
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:05,290
Let's just pay up, guys.

1499
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,425
What's the cash for? I'm curious.

1500
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:08,660
The expenses for having fun today.

1501
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,929
Curious?
I'll pay five cents for curiosity.

1502
01:07:12,931 --> 01:07:13,932
Where did you get that?

1503
01:07:13,932 --> 01:07:16,668
Getting five cents in change was so hard.

1504
01:07:16,668 --> 01:07:19,170
You're paying five cents
to show love for SUPER JUNIOR?

1505
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,438
It was hard to get that.

1506
01:07:20,438 --> 01:07:23,808
I'll go big. 50 dollars.

1507
01:07:23,808 --> 01:07:26,010
I'll go big and pay 50 dollars.

1508
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,912
Then I'll also pay 50 dollars
for SUPER JUNIOR.

1509
01:07:27,912 --> 01:07:29,647
Okay.

1510
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:31,783
Is that all the love you have
for SUPER JUNIOR?

1511
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:33,051
Wait. Did you pay?

1512
01:07:33,051 --> 01:07:35,320
I'm paying now.

1513
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,355
I brought this.

1514
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:41,859
(Let's see how much you brought.)

1515
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:45,530
(It looks like a big wad of cash.)

1516
01:07:46,431 --> 01:07:48,166
This is 300 dollars.

1517
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,902
He's paying 300 dollars.

1518
01:07:50,902 --> 01:07:52,036
I'll pay 300 dollars.

1519
01:07:52,036 --> 01:07:54,038
- SHINDONG.
- Wait.

1520
01:07:54,038 --> 01:07:55,039
What?

1521
01:07:55,406 --> 01:07:56,541
- I really...
- What are you doing?

1522
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:57,942
love SUPER JUNIOR.

1523
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:58,943
What are you doing?

1524
01:07:58,943 --> 01:07:59,777
Is that 500 dollars?

1525
01:07:59,777 --> 01:08:02,747
I thought everyone would bring
at least this much.

1526
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:04,582
- That's crazy.
- How much is that?

1527
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:07,719
(Count it for me.)

1528
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:09,187
Isn't that like 1,000 dollars?

1529
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:11,456
RYEOWOOK, seriously?

1530
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:12,390
Wait. RYEOWOOK...

1531
01:08:13,124 --> 01:08:15,860
Everyone. RYEOWOOK brought...

1532
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,595
- How much did he give?
- 1,000 dollars.

1533
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:20,598
- One thousand?
- RYEOWOOK paid 1,000 dollars?

1534
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:22,433
RYEOWOOK is amazing.

1535
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:24,369
If you paid, you can leave.

1536
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:25,436
DONGHAE brought 200 dollars.

1537
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:28,272
Let's go eat now.

1538
01:08:28,806 --> 01:08:31,275
Seriously, you should pay now.

1539
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,044
- He's getting mad.
- Seriously, LEETEUK.

1540
01:08:33,044 --> 01:08:34,379
You didn't pay at all.

1541
01:08:34,379 --> 01:08:36,681
(He gave a two-dollar bill earlier
instead of 20 dollars.)

1542
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:38,182
You're the leader.

1543
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:40,218
Pay and claim reimbursement from me.

1544
01:08:40,218 --> 01:08:41,486
What about YESUNG?

1545
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:42,954
I don't have any cash.

1546
01:08:42,954 --> 01:08:46,791
- What's wrong with you guys?
- Seriously, why are you guys like this?

1547
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:47,859
HEECHUL paid five cents.

1548
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:49,627
What are the older members doing?

1549
01:08:49,627 --> 01:08:50,428
(I paid two dollars.)

1550
01:08:50,428 --> 01:08:52,663
This 20th anniversary retreat
is going great.

1551
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:58,469
(What awaits at the rest area?)

1552
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:00,138
Loyalty-based lunch.

1553
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:02,240
If your card is declined,

1554
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,375
you'll have to pay the full amount.

1555
01:09:04,742 --> 01:09:06,611
(They have no clue
how much is on the cards.)

1556
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:07,578
Thirty-two dollars.

1557
01:09:08,012 --> 01:09:09,680
Can I order two menu items?

1558
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,049
(He obviously ordered two dishes.)

1559
01:09:11,049 --> 01:09:13,084
(He might end up paying for all.)

1560
01:09:13,084 --> 01:09:14,485
Just get one.

1561
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:16,120
(Afraid of paying alone,
HEECHUL only orders rice.)

1562
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,588
I won't do it.

1563
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:21,426
(Who will end up paying for everything?)

1564
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:23,394
(Recreation time at the lodging)

1565
01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:25,663
Shouting in Silence.

1566
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,964
(You can already feel the big laughs.)

1567
01:09:27,598 --> 01:09:29,367
(Tension pumped up for fun)

1568
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:33,104
(This is not Shout With Your Face.)

1569
01:09:33,104 --> 01:09:34,939
Before my wife?

1570
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:35,940
Ex-wife?

1571
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,513
(Do you want to laugh together?
Don't miss the main broadcast.)
