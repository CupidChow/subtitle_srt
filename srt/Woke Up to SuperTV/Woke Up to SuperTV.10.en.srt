1
00:00:00,021 --> 00:00:02,991
(The members are excited
thinking about raiding the mart.)

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:04,191
I want to eat tenderloin.

3
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:05,231
(They first shout out
what they want to eat.)

4
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:06,531
(Then they put the item
right in the cart.)

5
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:08,731
(Happily putting
everything they want to eat into the cart)

6
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,931
Let's get strawberries.

7
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,761
(Manager KYUHYUN immediately steps in
to stop them.)

8
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,231
(Meanwhile, due to a snack accident,
the cart is full of snacks.)

9
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,101
We're having just one meal.

10
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,271
(Grocery costs are rising rapidly.)

11
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:19,811
(And it's this much
even after KYUHYUN stopped them.)

12
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,711
(Grocery shopping is finally done
after many ups and downs.)

13
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,911
(Recreation time begins at the lodging.)

14
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,181
(SUPER JUNIOR's version
of Shouting in Silence)

15
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,921
(Too much excitement from the start)

16
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,921
(This is not Speak With Your Face.)

17
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,691
- Moon.
- Soon.

18
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,161
(This is definitely not Charades.)

19
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,921
My wife had?

20
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:37,991
Ex-wife?

21
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,461
(The members are really enjoying the MT.)

22
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,731
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

23
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:45,851
(After all the fun,)

24
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,861
(the sky has already darkened.)

25
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:50,321
You guys are hungry now, right?

26
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,631
- Yes.
- Who was in charge of cooking again?

27
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:55,301
You two should cook for us now.

28
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:58,071
Let's change into something comfortable
and eat.

29
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:59,301
Good.

30
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:01,071
(Impromptu MT itinerary)

31
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,971
(Dinner)

32
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,811
(They changed into pajamas.)

33
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,211
SIWON, is that what you wear at home?

34
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:08,341
(Nod)

35
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:12,651
(SIWON in white silk pajamas)

36
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,051
What?

37
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,151
Put your pajamas on.

38
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:20,121
(Black bear appears.)

39
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,321
(It's my favorite pajamas.)

40
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,491
They're pajamas.

41
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,091
Your body is so big.

42
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,631
(Bulked up in pajamas)

43
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:30,431
(Meanwhile, the chefs enter the kitchen.)

44
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:34,271
(Let's check the ingredients.)

45
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,571
We bought a lot.

46
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:36,971
SIWON, cut the sausages for me.

47
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,611
(SIWON starts prepping
stir-fried sausage and vegetables.)

48
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:44,951
It's okay to cross-cut these, right?

49
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,711
Do it however you want.

50
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:50,781
(RYEOWOOK is in charge of seaweed soup.)

51
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:54,621
(Pre-soaking seaweed professionally)

52
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,491
(I'll stir-fry beef.)

53
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:01,801
(He adds oil,)

54
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:05,101
(and cuts beef with scissors.)

55
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,471
This brings back memories.

56
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:08,901
You're right.

57
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,241
I already did this much.

58
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:14,881
How did I cut it so evenly
with three cuts?

59
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,011
(One big spoon of minced garlic)

60
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:21,681
(Stir-frying)

61
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:26,051
(Adding soaked seaweed
and boiling thoroughly)

62
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,721
(Become tasty.)

63
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,361
- RYEOWOOK.
- Yes?

64
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,861
Do you need help?

65
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,061
What should I do?

66
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,631
Either heat instant rice...

67
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,331
or grill some meat.

68
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,731
I can do it all.

69
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:43,701
(I'll heat the rice.)

70
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,011
Give me the meat, I'll grill it.

71
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:47,171
Let's eat meat.

72
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:50,181
(Hunger brings everyone to the kitchen.)

73
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:54,821
(Everyone enters the kitchen
following the good smell.)

74
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,951
- Is it stir-fried sausage and vegetables?
- What are you making?

75
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:58,521
RYEOWOOK, do I add it all?

76
00:02:58,521 --> 00:02:59,521
It smells good.

77
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,191
Is this seaweed soup?

78
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:04,461
(It looks like it'll be
a rich and savory soup.)

79
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:06,791
It smells delicious.

80
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,231
(Stir-fried sausages and vegetables
will be cooked.)

81
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,501
I'm so hungry.

82
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:14,101
(The main dish is also prepared.)

83
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:17,441
(Practically the mountain lodge owner)

84
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:22,311
(Kimchi added to match the pork belly)

85
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,511
What is this?

86
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:28,281
Is this hijiki? Who bought hijiki?

87
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,921
Who bought hijiki?

88
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:35,491
- Who bought it?
- SHINDONG did.

89
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,661
Why did you buy hijiki?

90
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,291
It tastes amazing with pork belly.

91
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,331
- Should I wash it?
- Yes, wash it.

92
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,931
If SHINDONG says it's tasty, it really is.

93
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,801
Is it blanched already?

94
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,031
Should I blanch it?

95
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:46,201
Yes, blanch it.

96
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:48,071
(Hijiki, pork belly's secret partner,
is also added.)

97
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,001
(The main dishes are almost ready.)

98
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:55,281
The sausages look pretty.
I cut them and they turned out nice.

99
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:57,341
So this is how you eat it.

100
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,881
(Stimulating all five senses)

101
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:03,751
How cute.

102
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:07,651
Since the guys have lived alone
for a long time, they're all good at it.

103
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,061
Old men.

104
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,121
(Twenty years of teamwork in action)

105
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,491
They've all served in the military...

106
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:15,101
and lived alone for over ten years.

107
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,361
I'm starving.

108
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:21,331
(Sizzle)

109
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,741
Stir-fried sausages and vegetables
are insane.

110
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:25,941
(Stir-fried sausages and vegetables
made with SIWON's might are here.)

111
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,411
This one...

112
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:30,241
(So happy to serve it, he's stammering)

113
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,851
(Absolute perfection)

114
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:37,251
(How will it taste?)

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,521
(Hurry up and try it.)

116
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,721
(He tries a sausage
shaped like octopus legs.)

117
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,461
How's Stir-fried sausages and vegetables?

118
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,931
It's really good.

119
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,731
(The Lodge Master SHINDONG
also takes a bite.)

120
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,671
(The taste jolts his eyes open.)

121
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,771
(Stir-fried sausages and vegetables
full of the two chefs' care)

122
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,841
Stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

123
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,581
(The heavenly taste of
Stir-fried sausages and vegetables.)

124
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,551
RYEOWOOK used to make this all the time
for us at the dorm.

125
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,751
(Chef's cooking brings back
dorm life memories.)

126
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:11,381
(Pork belly also grilling deliciously)

127
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:14,391
(Suddenly HEECHUL comes to sit
next to SHINDONG.)

128
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,921
It's best to sit next to SHINDONG
when eating.

129
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,161
Delicious stuff always shows up.

130
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:21,061
(Sit right next to me.)

131
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,461
Shall I try one?

132
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,701
The meat's already ready?

133
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,101
Eat it.

134
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:29,941
(Grilled kimchi and pork belly together)

135
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:32,411
(A big bite)

136
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:34,811
The pork belly is crazy good.

137
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,951
(Eyes widening)

138
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:45,191
(I grilled it perfectly.)

139
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,991
But you know it tastes even better
sitting next to you, right?

140
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:49,291
Because you eat with such zest.

141
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,391
Look at this.

142
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,631
Everyone's gathered next to SHINDONG,

143
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,061
and no one's next to YESUNG.

144
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,501
This is the delicious zone.

145
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,301
You need to sit next
to the one who eats with relish.

146
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:58,231
You know what's important?

147
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:00,431
Because SHINDONG is in front of me,
I want to eat meat too.

148
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:02,601
That's why people eat
while watching food shows.

149
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,211
(Eating alone while watching food shows)

150
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,441
(YESUNG got up.)

151
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:11,011
Look, you even made YESUNG pick up meat.

152
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,421
(Can't resist SHINDONG's food show)

153
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,351
(Please like and subscribe.)

154
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,091
Seaweed soup is ready.

155
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:24,221
It's SUPER JUNIOR's 20th birthday.

156
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:27,391
(Seaweed soup to celebrate
SUPER JUNIOR's 20th anniversary)

157
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,631
I'll try the seaweed soup.

158
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,101
(Tearing up)

159
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,171
The seaweed soup is so good.

160
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,001
There's so much to eat.

161
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,271
(Wide-eyed)

162
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,111
Is the seaweed soup okay?

163
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:41,541
It's so good, but it's really hot.

164
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,341
Is it good?

165
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:43,941
Hey.

166
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,251
- I mean SIWON, it's really good.
- Is it? You like it?

167
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,081
Yes.

168
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,881
(Feeling proud)

169
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,721
Was SIWON always good at cooking?

170
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,451
Lately, I've been cooking at home.

171
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,791
SIWON makes ramen at home.

172
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,061
SIWON is more domestic than expected.

173
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:59,631
(He wants to be the sexy man who cooks.)

174
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,701
(Hooked on the seaweed soup)

175
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:04,631
(The tapping feet of truth)

176
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,101
Seaweed soup.

177
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,431
Happy birthday to us.

178
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,241
Our 20th anniversary.

179
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,241
Just watching the members eat fills me up.

180
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,011
But you've already eaten a lot.

181
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,941
(You caught me.)

182
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:18,581
I'm happy because the members are good
at cooking.

183
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,181
Let's live together again.

184
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,321
(I can't help it. Let's reunite.)

185
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,951
This is the dorm now.

186
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,291
Do we have to go to schedules
from Gangwon-do?

187
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,191
- From here?
- Leave 3 hours early to go to the salon.

188
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:31,191
I love it.

189
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,191
As Gangwon-do's PR ambassador, I love it.

190
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:37,061
If we take turns cooking
and live together,

191
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:39,671
we'd eat so well.

192
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:41,271
I sometimes miss dorm life.

193
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,771
- Right?
- Let's live in Jeju-do for a week.

194
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,241
I'll really live there.

195
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,741
Let's not say too much.

196
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,881
(Covers his mouth)

197
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:53,111
Isn't that how we ended up here anyway?

198
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:55,751
(They're keeping promises made
without thinking.)

199
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,981
Is someone writing all this down?

200
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,221
It's all being filmed.

201
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,921
(Filming closely and thoroughly)

202
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,421
(They almost said something reckless
because they felt good.)

203
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:05,691
You all know...

204
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:07,931
we still have one final event left, right?

205
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,561
The thing I mentioned hasn't happened yet.

206
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:14,901
(What was it?)

207
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,771
Group colonoscopy.

208
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,101
That event is still left.

209
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,541
(Do it alone.)

210
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:25,211
(The boldly declared colonoscopy idea)

211
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,081
I heard it hurts a lot.

212
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:29,121
If you get sedation,
you start talking nonsense.

213
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,451
(And how funny would that be?)

214
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:34,221
(It's the 20th anniversary. Let's toast!)

215
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,891
No one bought alcohol.

216
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,631
We're all old now, no one even drinks.

217
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,731
(Getting ready for a non-alcoholic toast)

218
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,701
Thanks for the hard work over 20 years,
and let's keep working more.

219
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,371
Great job.

220
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:52,041
(SUPER JUNIOR,
thank you for 20 years of hard work.)

221
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,871
Happy 20th birthday, SUPER JUNIOR.

222
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,511
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

223
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:01,921
(A meal 20 times more joyful
because of 20 years of time together)

224
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,921
(Impromptu MT itinerary)

225
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,921
(Pajama party)

226
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:10,561
(A pajama party isn't complete...)

227
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:14,231
(without a full spread
of drinks and dessert.)

228
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:17,101
(They're refreshing after the meal.)

229
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,001
I want a big one.

230
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,801
I'll take chocolate.

231
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,701
It's super good.

232
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,971
Didn't you guys say
you were full after the meal?

233
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:25,971
And you can still drink this?

234
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,611
Of course, we can.

235
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,341
Even the size is mega like SUPER JUNIOR.

236
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:32,451
Then let's change our name...

237
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:33,511
to MEGA JUNIOR.

238
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:37,851
(Upgrade from Super to Mega)

239
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,651
(Let's eat dessert too.)

240
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:41,221
The look is fancy
and the taste is fancy too.

241
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,921
The important thing is,
the dessert is delicious.

242
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,831
(Pretty dessert is delicious too.)

243
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,031
(No way.)

244
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,201
It's huge.

245
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,131
(A size that naturally
brings out amazement)

246
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:38,531
Did everyone have fun?

247
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,671
- Yes.
- Yes.

248
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,941
Today's MT highlight.

249
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,511
- One last event remains.
- Campfire?

250
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,441
Bonfire?

251
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:47,041
Making a wish.

252
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,881
We've prepared a ceremony.

253
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,241
A ceremony?

254
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:51,811
Let's go, then.

255
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,111
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

256
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:57,991
(What event will glamorously end the MT?)

257
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,951
(Impromptu MT itinerary)

258
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:01,991
(Final event)

259
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,231
(The moon hangs low now.)

260
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,861
- What is this?
- Everyone.

261
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,231
This is the final highlight of today's MT.

262
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,731
(What's EUNHYUK the guide's final item?)

263
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:15,641
Today, we will perform a sacred ritual.

264
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,001
The Truth Game?

265
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:18,571
Not that. That's too old.

266
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:19,611
So what is it?

267
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,681
You will express how thankful you are...

268
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,111
to the other members...

269
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:28,381
and wash each other's hands.

270
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,651
We'll have a hand-washing ceremony.

271
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,191
(A hand-washing ceremony
blooming with emotion)

272
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,991
Can we wash other parts instead of hands?

273
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,791
Like, if I want to wash someone's face?

274
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,461
Then it's a face-washing ceremony.

275
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:40,531
What if I want to wash their feet?

276
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,331
- That's a foot-washing ceremony.
- Nice one.

277
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:43,831
What if I want to wash their hair?

278
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:44,831
A head-washing ceremony.

279
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:47,131
This guy really knows
his Chinese characters.

280
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,871
(Guide EUNHYUK is skilled
in Chinese characters.)

281
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,971
- Who's going first?
- I'll go first.

282
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:54,411
(The host starts confession time.)

283
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,451
(Who will EUNHYUK express gratitude to?)

284
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,351
I've been thankful
to this member recently.

285
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,621
(Shall I stand?)

286
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,791
It's not you, SHINDONG.

287
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:07,451
(HEECHUL eagerly stands up too.)

288
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:11,031
Though I'm always thankful to him,

289
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:15,961
the member I want to express thanks to is…

290
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,101
our...

291
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,331
SHINDONG.

292
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,701
(Me?)

293
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:25,271
(Jealous)

294
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:26,671
The sacred ceremony.

295
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,951
(A feeling they've never felt before)

296
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,521
(Even watching makes him squirm.)

297
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,321
(Slide)

298
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:40,691
(Goosebumps)

299
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:42,391
(The one who touched also shudders.)

300
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:44,591
(Commotion)

301
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:46,731
Why touch his hand like that?

302
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,201
Just touch it roughly.

303
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,031
I have to be gentle.

304
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,031
You were overly gentle.

305
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:52,171
He's someone I'm thankful for,
I want to treat him gently.

306
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,171
(How precious)

307
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:55,741
- It's like a massage shop.
- The water's warm.

308
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:57,271
It's warm.

309
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:00,311
This year, for the first time in 20 years,

310
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,211
I released a solo album.

311
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:03,211
That's right.

312
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:08,251
There was a really important part
in the title track.

313
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:11,621
I wanted to show real dance.

314
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:15,621
So I invited top dancers to the stage.

315
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:21,131
(SHINDONG and J BLACK
lit up EUNHYUK's stage.)

316
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,601
Is J BLACK the top dancer,
or is it SHINDONG?

317
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:28,401
(Who's EUNHYUK's pick
for the number-one dancer?)

318
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:30,601
In my heart,

319
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:31,611
SHINDONG is.

320
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:34,741
(J BLACK)

321
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:39,581
(Unaware and touched)

322
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:44,521
SHINDONG lit up my stage.

323
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,951
I had fun being part of it too.

324
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:47,651
Thank you so much.

325
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,761
How does it feel to have your hand washed?

326
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,991
It felt weird at first, but...

327
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,591
Don't do that.

328
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:54,531
Don't interlock fingers.

329
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:56,801
(Slowly interlocks fingers)

330
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,671
Don't interlock fingers.

331
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,801
(You said you liked it.)

332
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:02,771
Don't interlock fingers.

333
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:07,571
When EUNHYUK asked me to join the stage,

334
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,311
I was honestly more grateful.

335
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:12,681
I haven't had a stage
to perform on recently.

336
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:13,681
That's true.

337
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,551
(What a beautiful scene)

338
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:20,451
(Now SHINDONG's turn to wash hands)

339
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,821
I'll choose someone I'm thankful for.

340
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:23,621
Okay.

341
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:27,431
He recently contacted me a lot.

342
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,731
Normally SUPER JUNIOR doesn't text much.

343
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:34,401
But he reached out first,
and it meant a lot.

344
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:36,171
I choose DONGHAE.

345
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,141
Really?

346
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,571
I choose DONGHAE.

347
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:40,241
(Me?)

348
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,081
- Is that okay?
- But you two were kind of awkward.

349
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,251
(Everyone's curious about their texts.)

350
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,551
(Curious and excited)

351
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:52,751
DONGHAE checks
my personal social media a lot.

352
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,661
I check the members' posts often.

353
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:59,661
Every time I posted something,
he'd message or call me.

354
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:02,501
He also told me he enjoyed my show.

355
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,101
I recently started going to the gym.

356
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:08,341
And he said let's work out together.

357
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,871
Really?

358
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:12,441
And here's the shocking part.

359
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:16,111
DONGHAE contacted me saying he'd make
a reservation to play golf with me.

360
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,211
I was really touched.

361
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:19,051
(That was nothing.)

362
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,211
Give me your hands.

363
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,221
Give me your hands.

364
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:24,281
(Laugh)

365
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,291
(SHINDONG is calm
because he's tried it once.)

366
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,761
Are you right-handed?
Then let's start with your right hand.

367
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,691
(Sliding gently)

368
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:33,031
(Applause-worthy touch)

369
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,831
They finally got close after 20 years.

370
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,501
- This feels weird.
- Why do you like it so much?

371
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,371
(Since they've grown close,
fingers interlock too.)

372
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,741
(Our lovely members)

373
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:45,271
(DONGHAE's hand is finally in the water.)

374
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:48,641
(Holding it with gratitude and care)

375
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,811
He definitely lifted a lot of weights.

376
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:52,251
He has a lot of calluses.

377
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,451
(Noticing the calluses anew)

378
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:56,451
The other hand too.

379
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:59,551
When DONGHAE contacted me first,

380
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:01,051
it made it easier for me to keep in touch.

381
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,321
Right?

382
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,931
So would you two be down
to eat together one day?

383
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,491
- Yes.
- You've never eaten together.

384
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,231
We have once.

385
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:09,461
- We had a meal once.
- When?

386
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:11,431
- When did we eat together?
- Maybe seven years ago.

387
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:17,141
We'll do it again
before it hits ten years.

388
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,411
Just tell us where you're eating...

389
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,811
so I can watch from afar
without bothering.

390
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:24,811
Okay.

391
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,211
(Can you get a shot of us?)

392
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:27,681
I'll secretly watch from far away.

393
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,181
LEETEUK's vlog will go.

394
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:31,691
Okay, then.

395
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:34,921
So I'm grateful to DONGHAE.

396
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:37,161
- Next is DONGHAE.
- Why is it suddenly not cold anymore?

397
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:42,501
(The warm mood raises the temperature.)

398
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:46,031
(It's DONGHAE's turn
to express his gratitude.)

399
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,271
I'm really thankful to this person.

400
00:31:48,901 --> 00:31:52,171
(Expectant)

401
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,971
I choose LEETEUK.

402
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:54,811
Of course.

403
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:59,011
(Thank you)

404
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:01,081
He does a live streaming...

405
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:03,521
for an hour and 40 minutes every night.

406
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,851
He talks about everything from A to Z.

407
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:09,361
He shares a lot of things
he didn't share in the company.

408
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,661
- Mostly spoilers.
- Are you sure you're thankful?

409
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,231
Is this a diss?

410
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:17,761
(No, hear me out.)

411
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:21,231
But even that is for the team.

412
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,771
He really cares about the team
more than anyone.

413
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,441
Because he's a leader
who always puts the team first.

414
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:32,151
I'm always thankful for that.

415
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,781
Honestly, I've known DONGHAE the longest.

416
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:38,991
I've been on the team with LEETEUK
since I was 15.

417
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:42,491
(15-year-old DONGHAE met
18-year-old LEETEUK.)

418
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:45,091
(And they became the DONGHAE
and LEETEUK of today.)

419
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:48,261
(Grabbing the leader's hand tightly)

420
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,231
I first saw DONGHAE
when he was in 8th grade.

421
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:55,371
(Old memories coming back vividly.)

422
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,871
It must feel emotional for you two.

423
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:01,411
He was in middle school and now he's 40?

424
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:04,681
(DONGHAE the middle schooler is now 40.)

425
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:08,581
(The other members also join
in reminiscing.)

426
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:11,651
Also, at our last team dinner,

427
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:15,461
he talked a lot about the team.

428
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,091
And he said he hopes
we'll keep doing more together.

429
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:20,461
That kind of thing is hard to say.

430
00:33:20,461 --> 00:33:24,201
When we're all together, LEETEUK says
he wants to stay with us long.

431
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,101
He hopes we'll be his lifelong friends.

432
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:31,671
(Hoping you'll be my lifelong friends)

433
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:34,311
- Thank you always, LEETEUK.
- Thank you.

434
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,611
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

435
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,311
Thank you for everything.

436
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:43,221
I've known DONGHAE for 26 years now,

437
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,721
but this is the first time
we've held hands.

438
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:45,891
Same.

439
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,991
There's no reason for members
to hold hands.

440
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,661
I almost cried.

441
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,731
I almost cried too.

442
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,491
I almost cried.

443
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,161
I'm tearing up. What do I do?

444
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,961
- I'm crying.
- He's crying.

445
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:59,671
I don't know, I just teared up suddenly.

446
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:00,671
What's going on?

447
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,201
(RYEOWOOK's eyes suddenly tear up.)

448
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:06,841
Honestly, I'm thankful to all the members.

449
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:10,911
But I want to hold
and wash this person's hands.

450
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,811
(Could it be...)

451
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:13,811
No way.

452
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:17,581
(Is it me?)

453
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,451
If it's HEECHUL, I'll cry for real.

454
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,921
I can't watch.

455
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:26,491
I met this friend in my teens...

456
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:27,661
I can't watch.

457
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:30,831
(I really can't watch.)

458
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:33,231
We were really close.

459
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,101
It's not me.

460
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:35,901
I guess not.

461
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:39,271
(If it's not HEECHUL, then who is it?)

462
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:40,471
We were really close,

463
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:43,541
then drifted apart,

464
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,551
then we grew close again.

465
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,551
Is it me?

466
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:50,051
At first,
we couldn't accept our differences.

467
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,091
But now we accept them.

468
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,491
RYEOWOOK is crying.

469
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,161
I'm seriously tearing up.

470
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:56,521
If it's HEECHUL, I'll cry for real.

471
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:03,961
Now we understand each other.

472
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:06,401
My friend HEECHUL.

473
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:08,171
My friend HEECHUL.

474
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,901
HEECHUL.

475
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:14,141
(Sobbing)

476
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:15,181
It's too sad.

477
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:25,521
Really.

478
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,361
Back then, we were too different
and couldn't understand each other.

479
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:33,991
It's impossible to grasp...

480
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,161
how hard it must've been being a leader.

481
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:38,061
(The burden of leadership
he had to silently bear)

482
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,941
(Everyone's eyes glisten with tears.)

483
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:45,041
Do you need a tissue?

484
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,481
RYEOWOOK is crying so much.

485
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:55,581
(And suddenly, a foot appears
in the emotional moment.)

486
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,681
(Spill)

487
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,551
(What is he doing?)

488
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:03,891
(Specialist in breaking emotional moments)

489
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:07,331
(He's uncontrollable.)

490
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,031
RYEOWOOK, are you okay?

491
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:12,071
(Thanks to that,
RYEOWOOK cried and laughed.)

492
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:13,301
I want you to wash my foot.

493
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,771
This too is part of accepting differences.

494
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,371
What I'm thankful to HEECHUL for is this.

495
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:24,881
As the leader,
I had to watch over the team.

496
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,851
But he saw the sides that I couldn't see.

497
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,951
At the time, I didn't understand that.

498
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:33,851
But now I get why he acted like that.

499
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:35,421
- I finally understand now.
- Really.

500
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:38,691
We spent so many years being awkward.

501
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:41,391
But now, more than anyone,
I'm on the side of LEETEUK,

502
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:42,661
Park Jung Soo.

503
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:49,371
(They met as same-age friends
25 years ago.)

504
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:52,211
(Everything about each other
was a first to each other.)

505
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:55,311
(So they didn't understand each other
and drifted apart.)

506
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:58,951
(But slowly they drew closer.)

507
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:06,851
(20 years together as members)

508
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:09,791
(LEETEUK and HEECHUL, now a true family)

509
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,631
How about an eye contact moment?

510
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,901
(Giggling)

511
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:21,601
(Our lovely older members)

512
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,741
(Officially starting the foot-washing)

513
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,941
(It's such a strange feeling
to have your friend wash your feet.)

514
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,211
This feels so weird.

515
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,681
(I have to capture this.)

516
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:36,281
(We're at the foot-washing level
of friendship.)

517
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:39,151
Are you flat-footed?

518
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,651
He's suddenly asking about flat feet.

519
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,491
There's a lot of tension in your feet.

520
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:44,861
Thank you so much.

521
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,761
Let's keep going strong in our 20th year.

522
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:48,131
Wait.

523
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:51,531
We've aged together for 24 years now.

524
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:55,671
I thought after the Incheon Battle,
they'd never see each other again.

525
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,641
It's been not ten years, but 20 now.

526
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:00,911
That was ten years ago.

527
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,741
Thank you so much.

528
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:04,581
Really.

529
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:12,551
(A hug sharing heartfelt friendship
of many years)

530
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:20,531
(Second round of sobbing)

531
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:24,401
I originally planned
to wash LEETEUK's hands,

532
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:26,171
but he picked me first.

533
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,501
I'm really thankful to this friend.

534
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,901
Because...

535
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:34,171
I'd never even contacted him before
when we were promoting together.

536
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:35,711
I'd never even contacted him before.

537
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,611
- Who is it?
- But this friend,

538
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,581
after going
through a serious car accident,

539
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,381
he almost died.

540
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:44,281
I visited him a lot in the hospital.

541
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,221
Our youngest, KYUHYUN.

542
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:47,321
Really?

543
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,461
KYUHYUN...

544
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,591
You're washing hands in that basin, right?

545
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:52,091
You're washing hands in that basin, right?

546
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,161
(The basin used for HEECHUL's foot wash)

547
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,461
(No)

548
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,731
I'm going to wash out his makeup.

549
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:00,601
- Change the water, please.
- But that water...

550
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:02,771
It seems like they're changing it
but they're just replacing the bowl.

551
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:06,511
(They were pretending it was fresh?)

552
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,741
So there were only two basins?

553
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:09,541
(Just two basins being reused?)

554
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,881
(KYUHYUN also gets a foot wash.)

555
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:18,951
(The youngest member's foot
is treated with care.)

556
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:21,191
Back then, so many things happened.

557
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,321
When we were young,
we really fought a lot.

558
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,291
We fought a ton.

559
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,991
All kinds of things happened.

560
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,091
Younger members would come to me and say,

561
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:30,001
"LEETEUK, please talk to HEECHUL."

562
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:33,771
Back then, I didn't know
how to approach the younger members.

563
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,801
It was awkward.

564
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:37,771
I'm just so thankful KYUHYUN survived
and is healthy.

565
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:40,411
Through that, we became much closer.

566
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:45,251
(The two grew closer
after going through the same experience.)

567
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:54,451
(That hurts.)

568
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:55,821
(Cry)

569
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:00,991
(Interlocking his fingers with his toes)

570
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:04,761
(Every time it gets touching,
he ruins it.)

571
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,271
(I'll scrub hard.)

572
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:14,541
That's how much
I have to love the youngest member.

573
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:15,741
This is embarrassing.

574
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,111
Wasn't this supposed to be emotional?

575
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:20,381
My tears went right back in.

576
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:23,651
(Somehow, the foot-washing ends.)

577
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:25,351
HEECHUL is good at this.

578
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:26,751
Now it's KYUHYUN's turn.

579
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,121
The members left are...

580
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,561
SIWON, YESUNG, and RYEOWOOK.

581
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:34,631
It's just the people I wanted to pick.

582
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:35,461
Really?

583
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:37,101
You speak so nicely.

584
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,231
You really speak nicely.

585
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:39,471
(The youngest who knows how to be loved.)

586
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:41,771
I'll do it for RYEOWOOK.

587
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:43,271
RYEOWOOK's crying. He's already crying.

588
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,111
RYEOWOOK is crying.

589
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:48,511
RYEOWOOK, don't cry.

590
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:50,481
Why do you cry so much these days?

591
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,411
Why is this tissue so soaked?

592
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,651
Did HEECHUL and I make you sad?

593
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:57,821
It was really touching.

594
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,191
We're all so moved.

595
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:01,721
With RYEOWOOK, I remember that moment.

596
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:03,761
When I first joined the team,

597
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,091
as someone who joined six months earlier,

598
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,731
he taught me many things.

599
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:11,061
- Was he territorial?
- No, it wasn't like that.

600
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,431
When I cooked ramen,

601
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,241
- someone said "Which bastard made this?"
- I know who!

602
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:16,501
- LEETEUK.
- Correct.

603
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:19,541
(Name-dropping on a mean episode)

604
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:24,011
(Let's keep it emotional.)

605
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:26,881
When I was wiping my tears alone
in the room,

606
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:29,581
RYEOWOOK patted me on the back.

607
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:30,921
KYUHYUN has tears?

608
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,091
- Yes, back then...
- It was his first and last time.

609
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,691
That's when he started
becoming utterly resolute.

610
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,391
(So that's what happened.)

611
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:39,161
RYEOWOOK told me this.

612
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,661
"KYUHYUN, just hang in there
for six months"

613
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:42,731
Yes, it was exactly six months.

614
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:46,201
"If you last six months,
your time will come."

615
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:48,031
I remember him saying that.

616
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:55,341
(Now the two are inseparable friends.)

617
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:56,781
I'll wash my friend's hands.

618
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,851
We've got to film this.

619
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:06,621
Earlier it was the eldest members,
and now it's the youngest.

620
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:10,161
RYEOWOOK comforted me a lot
during tough times.

621
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,761
(My friend
who helped me endure those days)

622
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:16,231
Even when we were promoting
as SUPER JUNIOR-M,

623
00:42:16,231 --> 00:42:19,531
he would ask, "KYUHYUN, what do you want
to eat?" and cook for me.

624
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:21,631
- RYEOWOOK really looks after the members.
- RYEOWOOK cooks well.

625
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,001
He made lots of stuff for me
including Korean pancakes.

626
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,641
Right, Korean pancakes.

627
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:27,971
RYEOWOOK always gives a lot of support.

628
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:29,341
Yes.

629
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:33,781
(A person who knows
how to care for others)

630
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:37,081
So I want to take this moment to say...

631
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:38,451
I'm always thankful to you, RYEOWOOK.

632
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:40,221
(Thank you, always, RYEOWOOK.)

633
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:41,591
That's beautiful.

634
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,221
(Pleased)

635
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:45,231
Look at our youngest members.

636
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:47,431
(The members who are one year older
are proud of the younger ones.)

637
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:50,201
- We need to hug.
- Our youngest members.

638
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:51,731
Our youngest members.

639
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:53,071
- So warm.
- They hugged.

640
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,101
So heartwarming.

641
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,111
So warm.

642
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,111
So heartwarming.

643
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,711
Our 39-year-old younger members.

644
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:02,811
The youngest is 39.

645
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:04,741
You're still in your 30s?

646
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:06,651
- Yes, 30s.
- Our last members in their 30s.

647
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:09,981
(Cute)

648
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:12,851
Actually, recently,

649
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:15,861
while preparing for our 12th album,

650
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:18,831
I listened to the first to the 11th album.

651
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:22,761
And hearing the members' voices...

652
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:24,161
reminded me of when we were in our teens.

653
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,301
Yes, we met in our teens.

654
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:27,501
In our 20s, we lived fiercely.

655
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:30,641
(We lived fiercely back then.)

656
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,611
We were jealous and competitive.

657
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,811
(We met young, so felt envy and rivalry.)

658
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:38,041
(But looking back,)

659
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,411
(they are memories we built together...)

660
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,651
(and footprints we'll never erase.)

661
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:48,521
(Tearing up)

662
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:54,861
- What?
- What?

663
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:56,531
- What?
- RYEOWOOK.

664
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:59,371
(Everyone's eyes getting misty)

665
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,071
DONGHAE's crying too.

666
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,301
Because of RYEOWOOK.

667
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:06,341
(Emotions overwhelm RYEOWOOK.)

668
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,681
RYEOWOOK seems to have so much love...

669
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:09,681
for the team these days.

670
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,681
Judging from the messages he writes
in the group chat,

671
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:13,051
he's become sensitive.

672
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:22,861
(We all feel it
even without spoken words.)

673
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,821
So I choose YESUNG.

674
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,961
As our main vocalist...

675
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:31,761
Why am I crying? This is crazy.

676
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,401
You should wash YESUNG's hair.

677
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:36,801
(The other members are trying
to lighten the mood for RYEOWOOK.)

678
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:39,371
YESUNG has worked so hard.

679
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:42,811
Thanks to you, SUPER JUNIOR's albums...

680
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:45,011
carry SUPER JUNIOR's color.

681
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:50,221
I hope you power
through the 12th album too.

682
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,451
Let's keep doing well together.

683
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,591
Thank you.

684
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:57,421
That was sincere.

685
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,491
RYEOWOOK's so sincere,
I can't even joke about it.

686
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,531
YESUNG too.

687
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,891
I almost choked up.

688
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:03,061
Seriously.

689
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,661
You almost choked up?
You should've actually choked up.

690
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,171
You should've cried.

691
00:45:06,701 --> 00:45:11,201
(YESUNG gets teased in place of RYEOWOOK.)

692
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,611
I choose SIWON.

693
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:17,041
(YESUNG's heartfelt words to SIWON)

694
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:18,851
They don't really have much interaction,
do they?

695
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:19,981
Exactly.

696
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:22,921
(Glance)

697
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,681
It's like SIWON is scolding him.

698
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,921
(It looks like YESUNG is being scolded.)

699
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:30,861
Why are you standing
with your hands back like that?

700
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,831
(At-ease pose)

701
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:33,991
Did you come here to be scolded?

702
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:35,801
Anyway,

703
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,601
thank you for being on this team.

704
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,431
Thank you.

705
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,071
(Quietly expressing gratitude)

706
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,871
Somehow, 20 years passed.

707
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:46,371
Thank you for forcing yourself
to be with us.

708
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:50,011
(Joking)

709
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,081
Wasn't this supposed to be a good moment?

710
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:56,781
(Are you sure you're thankful?)

711
00:45:56,781 --> 00:45:59,021
SIWON is unexpectedly affectionate.

712
00:45:59,021 --> 00:46:00,351
He really cares about the team.

713
00:46:00,351 --> 00:46:01,521
He's got massive love.

714
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:03,161
The way he celebrates holidays
by sending gifts is impressive too.

715
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,591
Yes.

716
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:05,731
Thank you.

717
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:11,101
(Holding hands warmly)

718
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,631
I've met SIWON a few times outside too.

719
00:46:13,631 --> 00:46:17,341
Every time, he says something kind.

720
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,471
Can you share one episode?

721
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:22,011
When did you meet?

722
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:24,211
We went to a café.

723
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:26,081
We had pasta too.

724
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:29,851
Wasn't that for a shoot?

725
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:31,281
No.

726
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:32,851
I think I'm right.

727
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,251
Wasn't it for a shoot?

728
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:35,691
(Be quiet.)

729
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:37,361
Let me stay in the mood.

730
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:41,591
Anyway, SIWON, let's keep doing our best
for the 20th anniversary.

731
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:42,561
Yes.

732
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:46,071
(Holding hands awkwardly but sweetly)

733
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,401
- I'm always grateful.
- Thank you.

734
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,541
(Kissing the back of his own hand)

735
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,741
He kissed his own hand.

736
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:56,281
That dulled the emotion a bit.

737
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,681
I want to stay in the mood.
Why are you guys so...

738
00:46:58,681 --> 00:46:59,951
He's wiping his own hands.

739
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,821
(My precious hand)

740
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:06,191
You should be wiping SIWON's hands.

741
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:07,391
Wipe his hands.

742
00:47:08,421 --> 00:47:10,691
Who wipes their own hand?

743
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,731
(With slight disappointment,
the final confession)

744
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,531
I ended up being the last one.

745
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:20,831
(The final member is preparing.)

746
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,831
(I'll get my foot washed.)

747
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:23,671
It smells awful.

748
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:27,071
(Deep sigh)

749
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:28,471
When I was sitting down earlier,

750
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,281
I just hoped it wouldn't be your feet.

751
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:32,281
(Somehow the hand-washing
became a foot-washing.)

752
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:34,681
(Wash my foot.)

753
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:41,591
EUNHYUK has a strong work drive...

754
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:46,131
but he knows
how to step back for the team.

755
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:49,061
He always thinks about the team.

756
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:50,861
(EUNHYUK who always puts the team first)

757
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,871
(Cry)

758
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:57,501
(How does it feel?)

759
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,911
(Foot stomping)

760
00:48:00,441 --> 00:48:03,311
(Expressing gratitude)

761
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:07,911
(Love massage time ends.)

762
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:12,291
(He almost revealed his secret base.)

763
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:17,091
Though we're friends,
I always learn a lot from you.

764
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:20,531
Your passion for the stage and the team...

765
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:24,801
is so professional.

766
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:28,471
(Respect conveyed to his friend)

767
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:30,201
That felt so refreshing.

768
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:31,441
- Shall I do more?
- No, that was enough.

769
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,041
- I'll do a bit more.
- No really, that was enough.

770
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,471
(Here comes the special service.)

771
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:36,781
(I said that was enough.)

772
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:41,151
(Head voice)

773
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:43,751
(I said that was enough.)

774
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:45,921
Hey, this is...

775
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:48,021
Isn't this supposed to be heartwarming?

776
00:48:48,021 --> 00:48:50,061
- Endure it.
- Never do this again.

777
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,321
Let's not do this ever again.

778
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:52,931
You're the one who started it.

779
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:54,931
You ruined all the feels.

780
00:48:55,761 --> 00:48:59,431
(A time filled with both emotion
and laughter)

781
00:48:59,431 --> 00:49:01,971
Doing this together was so fun for me.

782
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:02,871
It was seriously great.

783
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:06,511
Starting with Woke Up to SuperTV,
we have to end the 20th anniversary well.

784
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:10,781
Rather than focusing on the number 20
and its meaning...

785
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,581
What matters is not the number...

786
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:16,121
but continuing to live on as friends.

787
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,121
"It's been 20 years."

788
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:21,021
What HEECHUL and SHINDONG always say.

789
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:22,891
Don't get sick and stay healthy.

790
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:23,961
That way we can keep going
for a long time.

791
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,521
Let's really keep going for a long time.

792
00:49:25,521 --> 00:49:27,291
- Stay healthy.
- Stay healthy and happy.

793
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:28,831
Let's go for our 30th anniversary as well.

794
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,601
- Let's shout it.
- Let's shout it.

795
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,831
We are SUPER JUNIOR!

796
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:41,411
(SUPER JUNIOR,
now opening another new beginning)

797
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:46,451
(May you all shine forever
like sparkling stars.)

798
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:50,351
(And so, the day comes to an end.)

799
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:52,691
Wait, we didn't say anything dumb again,
did we?

800
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:53,651
We did.

801
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:55,551
You said something weird earlier.

802
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:57,161
- We let our guard down.
- Didn't someone mention a one-month stay?

803
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,161
Sorry.

804
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:00,731
(During mealtime just earlier)

805
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:01,861
Let's live together in a dorm again.

806
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:02,861
(What?)

807
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:05,101
(Eyes wide in shock)

808
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:07,971
Pick cooking shifts by day of the week.

809
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,441
I'm seriously down.

810
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:10,671
I sometimes miss dorm life.

811
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:13,241
Let's not just say things recklessly.

812
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:16,681
Is someone writing down everything we say?

813
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:17,941
Everything's being filmed.

814
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:21,181
(So we gathered up the things they said.)

815
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:24,381
(1. Going to Iceland)

816
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,791
(2. Seeing the aurora...)

817
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,351
(and eating grilled chicken neck)

818
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:30,661
(3. For the 20th anniversary,)

819
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,091
(meeting Super Friends of 20 years)

820
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,461
Running 2km together.

821
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:36,131
(4. Running 2km)

822
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:39,001
(5. Going on a 3-day, 0-sleep trip)

823
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:40,031
(6. Taking a boat)

824
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:42,171
(7. Staying up without sleep)

825
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,741
(8. Enlisting in special forces)

826
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:45,841
(9. Jumping into a river)

827
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:47,841
Variety shows have gotten too easy lately.

828
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,811
(10. Group lodging in Jeju-do)

829
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:51,811
Who said
"Let's live in Jeju-do for a month?"

830
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:54,081
The directors have to live there
with us too.

831
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:55,551
We all have to live together.

832
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:59,051
(This reckless mouth)

833
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:02,853
(Woke Up to SuperTV continues
until the day they fulfill all they said.)
