1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,640
Why is it so hot?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,610
(SHINDONG frowns from the heat.)

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,380
(He suddenly opens his eyes and sits up.)

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,980
What's this on my head?

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,550
(SHINDONG looks around.)

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,590
This is a dry sauna.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,920
- It's hot.
- This is great.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,220
Who mentioned this?

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,460
Who said he wanted to come here?

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,960
- Isn't it way too hot?
- Who suggested this?

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,460
(The members complain
and SHINDONG looks at them.)

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,960
It's way too hot.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,870
Wait, could this be...

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,440
I want to do this.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,510
I want to do the Great Escape
with all the members.

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,710
I really want to try that.

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,450
(Woke up...)

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,510
(to the Dry Sauna Escape)

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,180
(If you want to escape the dry sauna,
win the game.)

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,720
But the Great Escape I mentioned
wasn't a dry sauna.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,360
(SHINDONG spots something.)

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,460
(Bright background music)

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,270
There are many menu items.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,040
This Great Escape isn't bad after all.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,500
Shall I eat something first?

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,710
(Before the Great Escape,
time for a special meal for SUPER JUNIOR)

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,140
(A team match of four to four)

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,550
(The winning team gets three dishes.)

29
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,750
(The losing team gets only one dish.)

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,750
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,250
Rock, paper, scissors.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,390
Let's do this.
The winner picks team members.

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,290
Okay. Good.

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,260
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

35
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,190
Okay!

36
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,330
(Yes, I won.)

37
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,960
We don't even know what game this is.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,100
(Let's see.)

39
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,870
Isn't RYEOWOOK bad at games?

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,300
If we end up on his team, we're screwed.

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,840
(Who will RYEOWOOK pick first?)

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
I pick YESUNG.

43
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,240
I pick YESUNG.

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,270
(A surprisingly unexpected choice)

45
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,840
I was going to pick him.

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
This means he's giving up on food, right?

47
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,780
(A team with no chance at eating)

48
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,050
(KYUHYUN wins.)

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,970
I pick SHINDONG.

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,590
That's right.

52
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,120
KYUHYUN's so boring about this.

53
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,330
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

54
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,160
(RYEOWOOK's turn again)

55
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,060
(Urgent)

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Pick EUNHYUK.

57
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,470
(Me?)

58
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,470
We have to avoid RYEOWOOK.

59
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,500
Don't make eye contact.

60
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,760
I pick LEETEUK.

61
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,340
(And there it is, the death flag.)

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,810
(Eyes shut)

63
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,420
- Why'd you pick me?
- I have a good feeling.

64
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,750
I think RYEOWOOK is picking people
who won't eat...

65
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,050
to have it all to himself.

66
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,860
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

67
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,820
Okay.

68
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,920
I pick EUNHYUK.

69
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,390
- Of course.
- Then I pick DONGHAE.

70
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,400
Okay.

71
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,260
The team leaders move to the center.

72
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,970
(With SIWON, everyone's on a team.)

73
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,970
KYUHYUN goes to the middle.

74
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,040
We'll definitely win this.

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,410
(Team KYUHYUN, Team RYEOWOOK)

76
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,410
(Choose your top three food picks.)

77
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,310
That looks so good.

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,180
(The winning team gets all three picks.)

79
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,620
(The losing team gets
only their first pick.)

80
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,420
Ramen with rice cake and dumplings.

81
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,250
Our first choice is...

82
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,820
spicy pork over rice.

83
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,890
Second choice,
ramen with rice cake and dumplings.

84
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,990
- And third choice...
- Bulgogi stew in a stone pot.

85
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,060
Our third pick is...

86
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,460
spicy pork over rice.

87
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,330
Tteokbokki.

88
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,000
Ramen with rice cake and dumplings.

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,930
Ramen, of course.

90
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,000
This game is called You'll Get Hot.

91
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,010
(Raise your body temperature
by any means necessary.)

92
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,550
(The team with the highest increase wins.)

93
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,750
- Raise our body temperature?
- Then we need to cool off now.

94
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,050
Who has a cold body? I'm naturally hot.

95
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm usually hot.

96
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,750
Am I kind of cold?

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,790
(Team KYUHYUN compares body temperatures.)

98
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,760
He's the coldest.

99
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,030
Am I?

100
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,090
Hold on.

101
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,360
I'll go in. I like that.

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I'll lie on my back.

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,130
Not bad.

104
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,830
Or my calves or something.

105
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,840
Should I lie on my back?

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,370
Our team's representative is...

107
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,770
- LEETEUK.
- SIWON.

108
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,210
- It's neck and neck.
- Here are your clothes.

109
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,710
Go change in the ice room.

110
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,530
Change in there and come out.

111
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,520
(Changing while cooling down
in the ice room)

112
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,750
Stay there for a while.

113
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,690
It's cold.

114
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,890
You should visit the ice room, LEETEUK.

115
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,720
(Will the ice room work?)

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,990
Stay there for a while.

117
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,190
It's cold.

118
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,430
I think we can win.

119
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,530
Good. Let's go.

120
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's reveal the target body parts.

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,830
One, two, three.

122
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,500
- Good. Nice.
- Good, the stomach.

123
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,510
Cute.

124
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,440
(Checking the body temperature first
before the game starts)

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,810
Twenty-four degrees.

126
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,280
Isn't that risky?

127
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,250
For real.

128
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,910
You said no dirty tricks.

129
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,080
Twenty-five degrees.

130
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
I can raise it.

131
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,020
I can raise it.

132
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,990
You now have ten minutes...

133
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,520
to raise the temperature
of the target body part.

134
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,660
We're starting the ten minutes now.

135
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,100
- Ten minutes.
- Start.

136
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,630
(Heading off right away)

137
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,170
(Straight into the sauna)

138
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,270
Don't let SIWON in.

139
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,190
LEETEUK.

140
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
You don't have to start yet.

141
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,510
Take it slow.

142
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,580
Just enter for the last three minutes.

143
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,340
No need to push yourself for ten minutes.

144
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,810
Let's test with the thermometer.

145
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,880
Okay.

146
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,190
(Slapping for no reason)

147
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,590
(What was that?)

148
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,060
Let's see if the temperature rises.

149
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,290
(Smack again)

150
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,960
(From hitting to rubbing tactic)

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,700
- Did it rise?
- It's 29 degrees. It rose.

152
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,640
(They plan to use friction heat
to raise the temperature.)

153
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,340
This is it. No need for anything else.

154
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,610
Just enjoy a massage.

155
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,850
(Totally relaxed)

156
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,580
(Someone's really enjoying the sauna.)

157
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,520
(He's really enjoying it.)

158
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,550
This is nice.

159
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,320
(It's heaven in here.)

160
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,760
LEETEUK,
let's check your body temperature.

161
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:00,930
It's hot.

162
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,130
(What's his current back temperature?)

163
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,500
LEETEUK, it went up to 41 degrees.

164
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,000
I knew it.

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,940
Your whole body should
heat up gradually...

166
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,240
so that the temperature rises.

167
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,170
So staying here longer helps.

168
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,570
But LEETEUK.

169
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,980
I think you'll get burned.

170
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,110
I go to the sauna all the time.

171
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,480
That's different.

172
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,180
LEETEUK, the floor is 53 degrees.

173
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,420
It's not 100 degrees. It's fine.

174
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,490
I'll think of it as a healing retreat.

175
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,090
You look like you're enjoying this.

176
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,530
Check it.

177
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,660
It's hot. Wait a second.

178
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,760
Hold on.

179
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,000
(It's hot.)

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Wait, it's too hot.

181
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,070
LEETEUK.

182
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,870
Hold on.

183
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,740
It's 45 degrees.

184
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,910
It seems it won't go over 45 degrees.

185
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,410
I'll check the temperature.

186
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,440
LEETEUK is no joke.

187
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,280
He's really doing his best.

188
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
What makes the temperature rise fast?

189
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,650
Hot water.

190
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,350
A slight burn is fine, right?

191
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,890
A first-degree burn is okay.

192
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,230
Just a little bit is fine, right?

193
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,200
We'll cool you down fast
with a fire extinguisher.

194
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,330
Try putting your finger in here.

195
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,570
Hold this there.

196
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,000
(Second method, hot water hold)

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,770
You guys are only thinking of cheats.

198
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,610
Not even using the steam room.

199
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,840
We're just trying different tricks.

200
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,850
(Will it work?)

201
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,850
It's 39 degrees.

202
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,580
Nice. It's 40 degrees.

203
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,320
(As expected of my team)

204
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,050
(While they try different methods
to raise their body temperatures...)

205
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,620
The key is who can endure the heat longer.

206
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,590
How many minutes are left?

207
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,130
Two minutes.

208
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,500
(SIWON enters the steam room now.)

209
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Place your stomach on the floor.

210
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,040
(Lays down as soon as he enters)

211
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,440
SIWON, you and I both love saunas.

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,810
That's right. I love saunas.

213
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,450
(A battle of pride between sauna lovers)

214
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,620
I just need to be one degree hotter
than LEETEUK.

215
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,460
(There was
only a one-degree difference initially.)

216
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,790
If our body temperatures are the same,
you win.

217
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,160
- YESUNG.
- Twenty seconds left.

218
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,230
YESUNG.

219
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,190
Get ready.

220
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,230
(Even outside, it's hectic until the end.)

221
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,330
Pour it and I'll slap his stomach.

222
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,330
That's it.

223
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,040
You go out first.

224
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,770
You'll burn up. Go first.

225
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,140
You'll get hurt.

226
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,270
Go out now.

227
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,410
I'm fine.

228
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,740
- Get out now.
- I'm still fine.

229
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,780
Time's up.

230
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,520
(Time's up.)

231
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,020
Come out.

232
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,820
Measure quickly.

233
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,460
(As planned, he places the hot towel.)

234
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Measure quickly.

235
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,890
Measure.

236
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,500
At the same time.

237
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,600
(LEETEUK rushes out
to avoid cooling down.)

238
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
What's the temperature?

239
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,070
(How much did it rise?)

240
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,880
I didn't see the number.

241
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,510
Team KYUHYUN went from 24 degrees
to 49 degrees.

242
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,250
It's an increase of 25 degrees.

243
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,220
Team RYEOWOOK went from 25 degrees
to 52 degrees, so a 27-degree increase.

244
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,660
(Victory for Team RYEOWOOK)

245
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,030
That's not a big difference.

246
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,160
Just two degrees?

247
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,860
(So close)

248
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,370
Team RYEOWOOK gets three dishes.

249
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,070
The losing team gets only one dish.

250
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,340
Okay.

251
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,770
There's another game anyway.

252
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
So we might get four dishes next.

253
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,940
(Trying to stay calm)

254
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,250
Thank you.

255
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,680
Spicy pork is delicious.

256
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,920
(Team RYEOWOOK's meal is served first.)

257
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,620
(A steaming sauna meal)

258
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,290
Ramen is definitely the top choice.

259
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,590
That looks amazing.

260
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,730
Ramen is the best.

261
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,460
(Now comes Team KYUHYUN's meal.)

262
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,030
Just one plate?

263
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,170
Of course.

264
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,700
It'll be gone after we each take a bite.

265
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Exactly.

266
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,370
(Disappointed)

267
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,710
Enjoy your meal.

268
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,770
Thank you for the meal.

269
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,050
(Eating ramen first)

270
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
It's super spicy.

271
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
Is it?

272
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,020
(This is it.)

273
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,220
It's really good.

274
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,140
What's good?

275
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,930
- Ramen with rice cake?
- Yes.

276
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,930
(Slurp)

277
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,860
The smell of ramen is insane.

278
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,270
This doesn't taste like a meal kit.

279
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,630
(Also eating sweet and spicy tteokbokki)

280
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,600
(And a bite of spicy pork)

281
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,710
(Eating at the same time)

282
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,180
We're eating all thanks to LEETEUK.

283
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Right.

284
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,620
SIWON worked hard, too.

285
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,880
SIWON, you can eat.

286
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,250
(Their one bowl is even more precious.)

287
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,420
Can't we just pay for more food?

288
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,550
No.

289
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,290
We picked SIWON...

290
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,820
so we could just pay to eat.

291
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,500
(Team KYUHYUN finally takes a bite.)

292
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,540
(Squints from the amazing flavor)

293
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,270
(Every bite
of this spicy pork over rice is precious.)

294
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,810
Delicious.

295
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,080
This place makes great spicy pork.

296
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,180
I'd come back here just for this.

297
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,380
- Is it that good?
- Yes.

298
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,260
(Not a grain of rice left)

299
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,360
(Clean)

300
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,590
All clear.

301
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,500
(That was good.)

302
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,430
There are snacks this time.

303
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,140
(Round two for desserts)

304
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,500
We need to eat desserts.

305
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,170
(Full of delicious snacks)

306
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,770
- Sikhye?
- Nice.

307
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,110
- Churros.
- Fish cake bar?

308
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,280
Churros.

309
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,810
Don't you like eggs?

310
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,710
I like eggs. We should eat one.

311
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,180
In a dry sauna, we need eggs and sikhye.

312
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,820
- Right, eggs and sikhye.
- Then eggs, sikhye, and churros.

313
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,290
- Is this the third pick too? What else?
- Sikhye, for sure.

314
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,960
Let's add sikhye first.

315
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,790
Then churros?

316
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,190
- Churros?
- I'm kind of craving churros, too.

317
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,190
We'll go with sikhye, dumplings,
and churros.

318
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,760
Sikhye, dumplings, and churros.

319
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,600
(What's the Round two game for snacks?)

320
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,640
The next game is
Bodyguard Rock-Paper-Scissors.

321
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,770
Rock-paper-scissors.

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,940
(One of two players plays
rock-paper-scissors,)

323
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,680
(and the other player defends
as a bodyguard.)

324
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,850
(If the bodyguard blocks successfully,
the game continues.)

325
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,980
Rock.

326
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,820
(If the attacker wins, they get one point.
Get three points to win.)

327
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,190
(From Team KYUHYUN, SHINDONG and EUNHYUK)

328
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,690
(From Team RYEOWOOK, DONGHAE and RYEOWOOK)

329
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,390
(The member who plays rock-paper-scissors
sits in front of the table.)

330
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,490
Is it RYEOWOOK?

331
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,190
But RYEOWOOK is unpredictable.

332
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,700
I can't read him.

333
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,760
This is a practice round.

334
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,030
Rock, paper, scissors.

335
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,370
Paper.

336
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,370
Scissors, scissors, rock.

337
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,470
(RYEOWOOK successfully attacks.)

338
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,070
(Now DONGHAE has to hit SHINDONG.)

339
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,510
(What?)

340
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,680
Rock.

341
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,380
(He quickly hits EUNHYUK.)

342
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,450
It's not me.

343
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,450
(I didn't know that.)

344
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,890
You're doing great.

345
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,020
Do we start the actual game now?

346
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,060
Let's begin.

347
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,590
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

348
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

349
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,900
(RYEOWOOK attacks first.)

350
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,560
Paper.

351
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,570
Scissors.

352
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,930
- Rock.
- Paper.

353
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,470
(They're both yelling at each other.)

354
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,810
Rock.

355
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,140
(Successful attack)

356
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,390
Rock.

357
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,750
(Quick strike)

358
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,780
(This is it!)

359
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,450
(What was that?)

360
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,320
He pushed me while doing it.

361
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
(Move aside.)

362
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
(EUNHYUK is pushed away like an anchovy.)

363
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,730
Good job. DONGHAE, you're fast.

364
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,960
This game is all about vigor.

365
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,700
Round two. No play, no win.
Rock, paper, scissors.

366
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,200
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

367
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,370
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

368
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,470
(SHINDONG wins the turn.)

369
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,570
(Nervous)

370
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,440
(Anxious)

371
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Rock.

372
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,050
Rock.

373
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,150
(EUNHYUK quickly lands a hit.)

374
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,190
(Grits his teeth)

375
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,260
I hit him.

376
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,560
I hit him.

377
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,990
That was fast.

378
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,200
Nice.

379
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,130
Nice.

380
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,500
Current score, one-to-one.

381
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,140
Let's go.

382
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,570
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

383
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,370
(RYEOWOOK wins this turn.)

384
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,710
Rock.

385
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,980
(They keep moving.)

386
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,810
Rock.

387
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,750
(Shaking)

388
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,010
Paper.

389
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,750
Scissors.

390
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,150
Scissors.

391
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,450
(His weak attack surprises SHINDONG.)

392
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,760
(So he moves in slow motion.)

393
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,390
(Too slow)

394
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,830
(Sorry)

395
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,960
Now.

396
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Rock.

397
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Paper.

398
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,660
(Flying)

399
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,700
(He threw the pot.)

400
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,440
- Why?
- Why throw the pot?

401
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,700
Why throw the pot?

402
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,310
(No throwing pots)

403
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,440
(SHINDONG wins this turn.)

404
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,930
Scissors.

405
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Scissors.

406
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,780
(SHINDONG's successful attack)

407
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,150
Scissors.

408
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,220
(One hits with a pot,)

409
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,220
(and the other blocks with a toy hammer.)

410
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,220
(They play in an extraordinary way.)

411
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,930
Warning.

412
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,470
But he blocked with the wrong item, too.

413
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,770
He should block with this, at least,

414
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,170
when you're hitting with a pot.

415
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,200
I almost died.

416
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,240
This is confusing.

417
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,910
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

418
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,140
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

419
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,410
Rock.

420
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,910
Paper.

421
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,410
(The bodyguards still can't stop moving.)

422
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
Rock.

423
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,990
(Fighting)

424
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,990
What happened?

425
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,560
(He lost a point
because he blocked with a hammer.)

426
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,690
If RYEOWOOK wins this, game over.

427
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,390
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

428
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,660
Rock, paper, scissors. Paper.

429
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,360
(SHINDONG gets a chance to attack.)

430
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,000
(Will he successfully attack?)

431
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,970
(Nervous)

432
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,070
Paper.

433
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,010
Paper.

434
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,140
(Successful attack)

435
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,180
Paper.

436
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,250
(He grabs the hammer properly.)

437
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,450
(Let's go, EUNHYUK!)

438
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,450
Paper.

439
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,260
Paper.

440
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,930
(Hits DONGHAE)

441
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,760
(Game paused)

442
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,500
D&E will disband.

443
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,240
(That was hilarious.)

444
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,510
Let's switch.

445
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,970
(Team KYUHYUN swaps players
due to repeated mistakes.)

446
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,410
You really have a lot to think about
to play this game.

447
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,450
Do better.

448
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,520
You'll get a warning from now on
if you pick the wrong item.

449
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,850
Okay.

450
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,320
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

451
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,820
Rock, paper, scissors.

452
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,690
Rock.

453
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,360
(He blocks with lightning speed.)

454
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,420
Rock.

455
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,530
(Good job, DONGHAE.)

456
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,060
You hit really hard.

457
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
Good.

458
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,600
- That kind of hurt.
- But DONGHAE blocked it.

459
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,800
That's why it hurts more.

460
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,770
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

461
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,610
(Current score,
Team KYUHYUN one, Team RYEOWOOK two)

462
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,610
Rock, paper, scissors.

463
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,210
(EUNHYUK's turn)

464
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,440
Paper.

465
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,180
Sorry.

466
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,210
It's okay to flinch.

467
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,750
(That's not okay.)

468
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,750
Warning.

469
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,780
Rock.

470
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,490
(Sneak attack)

471
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,890
Warning. Rock.

472
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,420
That's shady.

473
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,960
That's shady.

474
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,660
It's two-to-two.

475
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,530
The team that wins this round wins.

476
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,970
(Nervous)

477
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,440
(Checking)

478
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,010
(Which team will win?)

479
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,010
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

480
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,950
Rock, paper, scissors.

481
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,210
(RYEOWOOK's turn)

482
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,720
(Great tension)

483
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,760
Scissors.

484
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,480
Paper.

485
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,730
(He was not that quick.)

486
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,570
Wait a second.

487
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,570
He was late.

488
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,000
He was late.

489
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,940
He changed.

490
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,310
I folded my fingers.

491
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,380
(Pleading)

492
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,880
(RYEOWOOK admits he'll let this go.)

493
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,550
(But that wasn't right.)

494
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,650
Rock.

495
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,550
Sorry.

496
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,450
(Okay, sorry)

497
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,190
Scissors.

498
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,260
(RYEOWOOK gets the turn.)

499
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,400
Look into his eyes.

500
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,500
Look at his eyes.

501
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,430
Scissors?

502
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,440
Scissors.

503
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,410
(Thumbs up that didn't become a fist)

504
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,210
That deserves a penalty.

505
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,180
But this is mostly a fist.

506
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,050
Warning.

507
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,920
I kept this finger straight for too long.

508
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,350
Rock.

509
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,520
(RYEOWOOK has the turn again.)

510
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,430
Shake your hands.

511
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,030
(Will he make a successful attack
this time?)

512
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,960
Here we go.

513
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,330
Scissors.

514
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,430
(Successful attack)

515
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,370
Scissors.

516
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,270
(He stretched his arm.)

517
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,340
(What's the result?)

518
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,910
(EUNHYUK flees in fear.)

519
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,150
He ran away.

520
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,210
You ran away, so Team RYEOWOOK wins.

521
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,350
(Team RYEOWOOK wins with three points.)

522
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,520
It's okay.

523
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,450
I ran away.

524
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,460
It's okay.

525
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,620
There's another round.

526
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,660
(Team RYEOWOOK even won the second game.)

527
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,130
Let's drink our sikhye.

528
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,360
We're idols,

529
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,660
so we shouldn't eat like that anyway.

530
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,830
(A full dry sauna snack set)

531
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,240
(Team KYUHYUN gets one precious cup
of sikhye.)

532
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,110
Take a sip.

533
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,780
This is so refreshing.

534
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,190
- Cheers.
- Good job, everyone.

535
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,550
All the aces are on this team.

536
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,030
(Team RYEOWOOK fully enjoys dessert.)

537
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,330
This egg is really good.

538
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,700
It's a perfect combination with eggs.

539
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,440
What's so great about an egg?

540
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,270
What do we get now?
A main dish or dessert?

541
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,580
This time, you can pick
any three menu items you want.

542
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,010
It doesn't matter if they're snacks
or mains. Pick any three.

543
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,920
Should we go with drinks?

544
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,280
Let's get iced tea.

545
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,550
Or Bacchus with Sprite.

546
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,920
I wonder what Bacchus with Sprite is.

547
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,860
What's Bacchus with Sprite?

548
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,290
Bacchus mixed with Sprite.

549
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,360
(What did Team RYEOWOOK
who's full now choose this time?)

550
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,600
YESUNG wants an americano.

551
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,930
Fish cake bar?

552
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,230
Fish cake bar.

553
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,270
Our first pick is americano,
second pick, fish cake bar,

554
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,270
and third pick, mocha latte.

555
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,400
Iced americano.

556
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,510
(Team KYUHYUN is still discussing.)

557
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,540
One iced tea.

558
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,880
(They're so serious.)

559
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,920
Our first pick is...

560
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
- Ramen with rice cake and dumplings.
- Ramen with rice cake and dumplings.

561
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,890
How unexpected.

562
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,820
But you said you were full.

563
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,420
Ramen is a snack.

564
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,620
It was listed under snacks.

565
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,230
(It's clearly a main dish.)

566
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,690
Ramen with rice cake and dumplings is
really good.

567
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,460
I guess they really wanted it earlier.

568
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,300
Our second pick is iced tea,

569
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,340
and our third pick is Bacchus with Sprite.

570
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
Thank you.

571
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,680
The final game is Mr. Zombie.

572
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
(Excited already)

573
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:01,320
(The zombie team that eliminates
the humans faster wins.)

574
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,720
(Team KYUHYUN will play
the zombie roles first.)

575
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,730
(The zombies are strategizing now.)

576
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,860
(A little nervous)

577
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,430
I seriously can't see anything in this.

578
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,140
You're lying.

579
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,540
I mean it. Try it later.

580
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,470
I can't see anything.

581
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,190
This.

582
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,080
Can I keep this?

583
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,050
Seriously.

584
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,780
(Take it.)

585
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,820
(Why are you like this, Actor Choi?)

586
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,620
Buy one yourself.

587
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,560
(Admiring it like ancient pottery)

588
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,090
It'll help me sleep.

589
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,760
They say rich people are greedier.

590
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,200
You're trying to take something
from the production staff.

591
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,870
(I'll apologize instead of him.)

592
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,770
Let's go. Hold hands.

593
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,440
Zombie Team.

594
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,780
(Zombies link hands.)

595
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,010
They're coming together holding hands?

596
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,250
(Everyone's nervous.)

597
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,680
Let's start with Team KYUHYUN's attack.

598
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,850
Ready.

599
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,120
(Team Zombie KYUHYUN starts hunting.)

600
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,790
(DONGHAE charges forward.)

601
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Ready.

602
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,800
(Sudden brake)

603
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,470
(You guys just wait.)

604
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,340
(What?)

605
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,340
(Manic energy)

606
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,210
What?

607
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,250
(Slipping through)

608
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,350
(The barrier is broken in seconds.)

609
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,750
(While humans scatter to escape...)

610
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Who is this?

611
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,290
Staff.

612
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,100
Did we come all the way to the end?

613
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,830
Turn back.

614
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,470
(Confused)

615
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,340
Let's go again.

616
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,640
Go slowly.

617
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,770
Crouch down.

618
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,540
Block the space between your arms.

619
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,580
(A zombie wiping his tongue)

620
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,950
(Zombies approach creepily.)

621
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,790
(Disturbing, frightening)

622
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,690
There's nobody here again?

623
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,620
(Zombies close in.)

624
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,960
(He spots an opening.)

625
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,890
(Zipping through)

626
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,400
(A sharp U-turn?)

627
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,900
(YESUNG flies.)

628
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,440
(Speedy YESUNG hits a zombie and flees.)

629
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,500
That was YESUNG, right?

630
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,410
(Dizzy)

631
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,610
(How did he know?)

632
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,940
I don't think this is working.

633
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,350
Should we split up?

634
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,720
You guys are all doomed.

635
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,980
(Passing through)

636
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,880
(Passing through)

637
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,950
(Passing through)

638
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,520
(A train of humans passing through)

639
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,760
Here you are! I heard something just now.

640
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,860
Who is this?

641
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,200
Staff.

642
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
I'm already where the staff is?

643
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,070
- Here you are.
- It's me.

644
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,370
(Full of bluff)

645
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,500
This is really scary.

646
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,900
(They'll never catch anyone.)

647
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,310
(Meanwhile,
Zombie EUNHYUK charges straight.)

648
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,450
(I caught you, air.)

649
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,850
It's me.

650
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,150
(He caught air again.)

651
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,620
(They're terrible at this.)

652
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,160
(Speedy)

653
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,700
(If you're clueless, you'll get kicked.)

654
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,200
(Stomping in frustration)

655
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,600
(Everyone's hitting him.)

656
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,670
(It's so fun.)

657
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,270
I think they're all grouped up.

658
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,670
Let's go back to that strategy.

659
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,380
Let's hold hands again.

660
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,780
(Zombies hold hands again
to corner humans.)

661
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,380
(They're driving humans
toward the lower area this time.)

662
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,560
(Chaos)

663
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,690
(Speedy YESUNG slips through an opening.)

664
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,860
(Charges with all his might)

665
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,830
(Headed straight for the staff again)

666
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,800
(Please just pass.)

667
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,570
(He touched RYEOWOOK.)

668
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,080
(Will RYEOWOOK be caught?)

669
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,710
He's here.

670
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,880
(I'm the crazy zombie of this place.)

671
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,720
(SHINDONG and EUNHYUK join in.)

672
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,850
We got him!

673
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,520
(Save RYEOWOOK)

674
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,220
(Biting)

675
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,720
(Help)

676
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,530
(Just watching from afar)

677
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,300
(RYEOWOOK is out.)

678
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,200
One down.

679
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,540
(Team Zombie KYUHYUN gains confidence.)

680
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,270
(They're not bad.)

681
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,140
Is SHINDONG here?

682
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,180
- All the way on the right?
- I'm on the right end.

683
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,340
(I won't play easy.)

684
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,450
(Let's do this.)

685
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,780
(LEETEUK moves forward already.)

686
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,090
I can see you, LEETEUK.

687
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
What are you doing?

688
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,590
(Awkward, embarrassed)

689
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,960
I wasn't even wearing the blindfold yet.

690
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,160
You should put the blindfold on.

691
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,470
Was he all the way there already?

692
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,470
He was crouched here like this.

693
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,070
You should wear your blindfold.

694
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,770
Let's lower our posture.

695
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,610
That was hilarious.

696
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,810
Let's go now.

697
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,110
(Time to hunt)

698
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,350
(Zombies push humans into a corner
from the start.)

699
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,690
(Humans get pushed back.)

700
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,220
(You go ahead.)

701
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,590
(What should we do?)

702
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,730
I'll sacrifice myself.

703
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,930
I'll sacrifice myself.

704
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,030
(Crying)

705
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,200
(Make sure to escape for me.)

706
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,070
(SHINDONG shreds the scapegoat.)

707
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,510
(Thank you, DONGHAE.)

708
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,980
(Horrible hunt)

709
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,220
(DONGHAE is out.)

710
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
(Bite)

711
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,190
It's me.

712
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,920
Who was that?

713
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,890
(Was it you?)

714
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,490
I surrender.

715
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,560
(EUNHYUK is already out to hunt again.)

716
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,370
(Round 3 with air)

717
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,440
(Total chaos)

718
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,910
(This is crazy.)

719
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,780
Where's my team?

720
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,180
Who's left?

721
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,480
LEETEUK and YESUNG.

722
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,410
LEETEUK.

723
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,650
(Let's hunt the remaining humans.)

724
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,650
YESUNG, you're dead.

725
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,420
(You can't catch me.)

726
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,730
(YESUNG approaches the zombies.)

727
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,960
Where are they?

728
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,700
(Something just passed.)

729
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,840
(YESUNG flies again.)

730
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,970
(So light on his feet)

731
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,140
What was that?

732
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,480
We're at the end.

733
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,810
(While the zombies are confused,
LEETEUK also escapes.)

734
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,780
Was that reaction fake?

735
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,780
(He's even questioning the reactions now.)

736
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,980
(While the zombies regroup...)

737
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,590
(Human 1)

738
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,690
(Human 2)

739
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,190
(They try the previously spotted tactic.)

740
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,390
I'm holding the line.

741
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,330
SIWON is next to the lind.

742
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,400
(Going under this time?)

743
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,170
Wait, what?

744
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,570
What's this?

745
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,870
(I'm scared.)

746
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,170
What's this?

747
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,380
(Will he escape?)

748
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,280
(Caught?)

749
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,180
(YESUNG, come here.)

750
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,250
(Is he a real zombie or what?)

751
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,090
(Biting)

752
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,860
(While YESUNG gets chewed on...)

753
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,430
It's me.

754
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,430
(No teams, just bite everyone.)

755
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,670
(So fragile)

756
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,270
(He's scared he might get hurt
in this fight.)

757
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,440
(Same room, different worlds)

758
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,610
He bit me.

759
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,410
(YESUNG is out.)

760
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,640
I caught YESUNG.

761
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,450
I caught YESUNG.

762
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,110
LEETEUK is the only one left, right?

763
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,350
Is it only LEETEUK?

764
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,580
LEETEUK, you're done for now.

765
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,820
LEETEUK.

766
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,360
(Sneaking)

767
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,390
- Where's the end?
- We're on the same team.

768
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,130
(Scanning for an opening like a hawk)

769
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,230
Is it here?

770
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,930
Come here, LEETEUK.

771
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,670
(Backstep)

772
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,030
(Zombies closing in)

773
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,570
(LEETEUK, you just wait.)

774
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,470
(He's getting cornered.)

775
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,410
(What should I do?)

776
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,780
(He found an exit!)

777
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,720
(Did he escape?)

778
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,190
(You have to survive.)

779
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,490
(Not so fast!)

780
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,360
(He's caught like a rat.)

781
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,230
I surrender.

782
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,430
(Poor guy)

783
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,240
(Zombies feast.)

784
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,840
(Someone help LEETEUK.)

785
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,310
(This is the taste.)

786
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,910
We won.

787
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,380
(Team Zombie KYUHYUN successfully captured
all humans.)

788
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,250
I ripped out LEETEUK's hair.

789
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,450
(My hair)

790
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,060
- SHINDONG.
- What?

791
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,360
Look at your spit here.

792
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,360
Zombies are supposed to drool.

793
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,130
- But this is too much spit.
- Zombies drool.

794
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,840
KYUHYUN left a mark here.

795
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,000
(Totally possessed by the zombie role)

796
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,610
If we manage to win like this,

797
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,240
all we get is Bacchus with Sprite?

798
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,710
(Exhausted)

799
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,480
All we get is Bacchus with Sprite.

800
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,180
(Team KYUHYUN bet everything
on Bacchus with Sprite.)

801
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,420
(How long did it take them
to catch the humans?)

802
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,920
Next is Team RYEOWOOK's turn to attack.

803
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,160
Do we just hand our blindfolds over?

804
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,890
But mine is sweaty.

805
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,290
Do you have new ones?

806
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,230
Is there a new one?

807
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,200
(No)

808
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,960
- No new ones?
- No?

809
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,870
Sorry.

810
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,830
(Which one do you want?)

811
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,070
This is the worst.

812
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,640
(Eyes trembling)

813
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
I want the one that's not sweaty.

814
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,740
SIWON, did you sweat?

815
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,640
I sweated just a little.

816
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,810
Yours is slightly better.

817
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,050
This one's soaked.

818
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,420
(Is it that bad?)

819
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,980
Where are DONGHAE and YESUNG?

820
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,920
The blindfolds are there.

821
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,490
No blindfolds?

822
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,820
They're there.

823
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,690
(Hesitating)

824
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,560
Which one is SHINDONG's?

825
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
You want mine?

826
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,500
It's the one that's soaked.

827
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,630
The soaked one is mine.

828
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,900
(Crouching down)

829
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,900
(Take the soaked one.)

830
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,570
(It's a lucky charm.)

831
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,340
They're all wet because they all sweated.

832
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,510
They're all wet.

833
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,680
This is too soaked.

834
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,650
Squeeze it out.

835
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,150
Let's shout "Let's go" together.

836
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,750
One, two, three. Let's go.

837
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,690
(Let's win this.)

838
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,720
Let's go.

839
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,090
LEETEUK, I know you can see right now.

840
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,430
(Somewhat awkward)

841
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,360
I can't see.

842
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,000
(Busted)

843
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,540
LEETEUK, are you kidding?

844
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,270
- Seriously.
- What?

845
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,840
You're wearing it too high.

846
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,880
What about it?

847
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,280
Wear it lower.

848
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,480
Pull it all the way down like this.

849
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,910
Even if you guys win,
you're only getting the drink.

850
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,080
Let's start with Team RYEOWOOK's attack.

851
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,750
(You really can't see, right?)

852
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,490
Ready.

853
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,090
(Team Zombie RYEOWOOK's hunting starts.)

854
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,760
Spread your legs and move forward quickly.

855
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,260
(Humans cornered)

856
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,470
(Sliding)

857
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,430
At the end.

858
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,800
(Did everyone escape?)

859
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,240
(They all ran
while the zombies tried to catch KYUHYUN.)

860
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,650
(They don't know I'm here.)

861
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,050
Let's start again from the far end.

862
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,480
Where's the end?

863
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,250
(The zombies go back.)

864
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,350
Hold the line.

865
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,390
Where's the end?

866
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,990
YESUNG, where are you?

867
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,360
I can't see anything. Hold on.

868
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,490
Why is YESUNG over there?

869
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,460
YESUNG.

870
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,130
(Who is he fighting?)

871
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,160
Grab the rope and come here.

872
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,400
I think I know where the humans are.

873
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Where?

874
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,130
(We're all over here.)

875
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,070
Who's this?

876
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,670
(Everyone loves this staff.)

877
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,240
Wait. This isn't SUPER JUNIOR's body.

878
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,580
Who's this?

879
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,380
(Why?)

880
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,650
Why is he so muscular?

881
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,980
(There's no way
this is someone from SUPER JUNIOR.)

882
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,990
(Confirming if they're all here
to make the crane wing formation)

883
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,120
Who's this?

884
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,820
I'm holding hands.

885
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,760
- I'm holding hands.
- Whose hand?

886
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,460
(I'm holding DONGHAE's hand.)

887
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,330
(Why isn't he moving?)

888
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,430
(Letting go)

889
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,500
Aren't you him?

890
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,830
(No, I'm not DONGHAE.)

891
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,470
Tell me or I won't know.

892
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,170
(He's been wandering for a while.)

893
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,640
Who are you?

894
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,910
(Wandering warrior in a lonely battle)

895
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,520
(He's only meeting staffs.)

896
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,220
(We'll easily get to eat
Bacchus with Sprite.)

897
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,890
There's nobody on my left.

898
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,460
(DONGHAE is circling the ring.)

899
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,860
I don't want to do this.

900
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,290
We lost.

901
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,430
(Like a grumpy kid playing tag too long)

902
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,100
We lost.

903
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,000
You guys win.

904
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,170
(They're just sulking
because they're bad at this.)

905
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,340
This is so hard.

906
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,700
(I'll let them have some fun.)

907
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,940
This is so frustrating.

908
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,240
(Isn't this fun?)

909
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,080
(Annoyed)

910
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,000
My foot touched someone.

911
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,450
(SHINDONG exploring everywhere)

912
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,950
(Suddenly a total chaos)

913
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,020
Here he is.

914
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,790
(A fireball attack)

915
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,300
(Now is our chance.)

916
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,800
(Is this right?)

917
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,040
(Everything reversed)

918
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,540
(What's going on?)

919
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,310
Wait a minute.

920
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,480
(Is this even a zombie game anymore?)

921
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,780
(Soaked in sweat)

922
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,710
Time out.

923
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,750
(Alone and confused)

924
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,150
Is hitting allowed?

925
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,360
I'm sorry,

926
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,420
but I'm done.

927
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,530
I'm too exhausted to keep going.

928
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,200
(SUPER JUNIOR having a blast
with kids' games)

929
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,300
Are we not moving enough?

930
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,800
No, you guys are doing fine.

931
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,540
But there are too many openings.

932
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,770
Is it because we're all skinny?

933
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,110
We should stick together.

934
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,840
(That's not the reason.)

935
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,740
Don't let go of hands.

936
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,210
(Will they be able
to catch the humans this time?)

937
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,120
Let's go. Start.

938
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,650
(Starts seriously)

939
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,550
(Wide openings)

940
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,690
I caught you.

941
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,590
(Escapes through the huge gate)

942
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,230
(EUNHYUK makes a U-turn, too.)

943
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,300
(Sudden kick)

944
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,070
(Excited like a little boy)

945
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,400
(Meanwhile, the other zombies
are grabbing each other.)

946
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,340
- Who's this?
- Me.

947
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,680
(Take this kick.)

948
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,050
(You zombies)

949
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,280
Time out.

950
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,380
(There's no time out.)

951
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,320
(Can't tell who's human or zombie anymore)

952
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,360
(Save the zombies.)

953
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,330
(Chaos)

954
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,430
(Super excited)

955
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,000
We're the famous...

956
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
Zombie Hunters.

957
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,770
(Feeling invincible)

958
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,570
(Dizzy)

959
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,040
- Hey.
- This doesn't feel right.

960
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,510
Don't just push with size.

961
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,180
(Humans winning in weight class)

962
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,380
We're supposed to catch you.

963
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,180
Why are you catching us?

964
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,950
There could be four Ma Dong Seoks, right?

965
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,290
No.

966
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,550
No hitting allowed.

967
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,460
(Zombie Hunters as tough as Ma Dong Seok)

968
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,890
Getting hits was frightening.

969
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,030
(Let's just catch one.)

970
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,730
No hitting.

971
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,170
My GoPro's just filming my belly.

972
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,140
(Close-up stomach coverage)

973
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,210
This is hilarious.

974
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,410
(Let's catch someone, please.)

975
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,980
(Zombies push toward the upper corner.)

976
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,150
(KYUHYUN escapes
through the opening again.)

977
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,520
(What should I do?)

978
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,490
(Did he escape?)

979
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,960
- I caught you.
- Did you catch someone?

980
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,630
(SIWON and EUNHYUK escaped.)

981
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,000
(Where's the rest?)

982
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,200
(I heard something from this side.)

983
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,440
(Something passes.)

984
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,110
(It's crawling SHINDONG.)

985
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,480
(Unbelievable speed)

986
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,480
(He definitely served in the military.)

987
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,750
Where is he?

988
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,980
(I have to survive in this war.)

989
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,050
(I survived.)

990
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,990
(Echoes of Sergeant SHINDONG)

991
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,760
(Make sure you watch this episode.)

992
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,030
Let's hold hands again.

993
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,070
Where are you?

994
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,200
Come here.

995
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm at the end.

996
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,170
(Team RYEOWOOK reorganizes.)

997
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,410
Hold the rope.

998
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,840
Go straight.

999
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,880
Just go straight.

1000
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,080
Just go straight.

1001
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,580
(Automatic door)

1002
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,650
(Escapes through the open door)

1003
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,950
(EUNHYUK also escapes
through the left door.)

1004
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,550
(Then where's Sergeant SHINDONG?)

1005
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,290
Go back straight.

1006
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,960
I got you.

1007
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,590
(Sergeant SHINDONG is deep
in enemy territory?)

1008
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,600
(What are you doing there?)

1009
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,930
(Is this over now?)

1010
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,000
Is this a staff member?

1011
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,500
This won't do. Let's hold hands.

1012
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,170
(Staff)

1013
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,810
(It's not him.)

1014
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,440
(Too bad)

1015
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,710
(They fell for that?)

1016
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,650
(Showing American-style reactions)

1017
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,750
(Keep going)

1018
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,720
(How long do I have to stay here?)

1019
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,320
Behind us.

1020
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,460
(Why is EUNHYUK there?)

1021
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,830
(He naturally held hands while the zombies
prepared the crane wing formation.)

1022
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,500
(He actually held my hand.)

1023
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,140
(Let's go.)

1024
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,570
(Cheery EUNHYUK is super excited.)

1025
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,780
Did anyone catch someone?

1026
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,150
(They're getting anxious.)

1027
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,220
(Clueless zombies)

1028
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,880
Five, six, seven, eight.

1029
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,490
(KYUHYUN tripped.)

1030
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,820
(Left behind alone)

1031
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,190
(Run away!)

1032
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,600
(Meanwhile, EUNHYUK escapes.)

1033
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,170
(Who's this?)

1034
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,570
(Is he human?)

1035
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,110
I surrender.

1036
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,210
(You're KYUHYUN, right?)

1037
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,210
(Finally, first successful hunt)

1038
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,980
(Revenge achieved)

1039
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,900
LEETEUK.

1040
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,050
Here you are.

1041
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,760
(Approaching)

1042
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,490
Go back.

1043
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,700
Here he is.

1044
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,000
Staff.

1045
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,540
(Will he fall for it again?)

1046
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,000
Did anyone catch someone?

1047
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,210
He's the staff.

1048
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,070
Time out.

1049
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,410
(What?)

1050
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,580
(Too frustrated, he calls time out.)

1051
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,620
(I'm tired.)

1052
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,050
What's he doing here?

1053
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,560
(Sergeant SHINDONG busted from hiding)

1054
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,560
(End of his stealth mission)

1055
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
(Bragging about his escapades)

1056
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,760
When he said "Staff" you just went away.

1057
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,870
- Even after touching my hand.
- That's cheating.

1058
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,230
You can't do that.

1059
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,270
Why not? I was just standing still.

1060
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,110
- That's cheating.
- I was just standing still.

1061
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,810
But I'm busted now.

1062
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,640
I thought it was SHINDONG earlier.

1063
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,480
(Zombies start cornering again.)

1064
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,380
(Everyone gets cornered.)

1065
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,420
I caught you.

1066
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
(Running)

1067
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,520
(Away)

1068
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I surrender.

1069
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,320
(SIWON is the decoy.)

1070
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,360
(The cry of the betrayed human)

1071
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
Bite him.

1072
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,900
(We have to survive.)

1073
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,070
(SIWON is out.)

1074
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,900
Who's left now?

1075
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,780
(These two are left.)

1076
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,250
(Don't use your strength like this.)

1077
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,320
(The zombies march on, clueless.)

1078
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,990
(EUNHYUK shield)

1079
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,160
(You're such a sneaky guy.)

1080
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,690
(Dragging him)

1081
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,200
(A new decoy)

1082
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,630
(Thrown in)

1083
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,000
Bite him.

1084
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,640
(Here's your anchovy.)

1085
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,910
(Biting)

1086
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,470
I surrender.

1087
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:33,010
(EUNHYUK is out.)

1088
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,380
(I'm just trying to survive.)

1089
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,850
Who's left?

1090
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,850
SHINDONG.

1091
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,550
SHINDONG is hard to catch.

1092
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,290
He might use stealth again.

1093
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,590
(We heard that.)

1094
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,830
(Immediate special move)

1095
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,190
(Panting)

1096
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:59,600
(He's exposed by heavy breathing.
What's next?)

1097
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,470
I surrender.

1098
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,050
(RYEOWOOK bit harder out of spite.)

1099
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,050
(We won't fall for it again.)

1100
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,020
(Team KYUHYUN is eliminated.)

1101
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,690
(Which team caught all humans faster?)

1102
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,090
(A zombie tearing humans...)

1103
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,000
(and an insane zombie was
on Team KYUHYUN.)

1104
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,870
(What's the record of Team KYUHYUN
who wants the Bacchus with Sprite?)

1105
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,270
Team KYUHYUN, five minutes and 20 seconds.

1106
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,740
(That's pretty good.)

1107
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,680
And Team RYEOWOOK...

1108
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,750
(What's Team RYEOWOOK's record?)

1109
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,680
(Did they take less time?)

1110
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,180
Ten minutes and 14 seconds.

1111
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,750
Team KYUHYUN wins.

1112
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,150
That was fun.

1113
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,990
(What will Team KYUHYUN eat?)

1114
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,400
(Ramen with rice cake and dumplings,
Bacchus with Sprite, and iced tea)

1115
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,900
Drink a cup of Bacchus with Sprite.

1116
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,670
- I'd like some, too.
- I'll give you.

1117
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,270
(Gulping down)

1118
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,840
Thank you.

1119
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,340
(This is refreshing.)

1120
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,510
(Let me have a cup, too.)

1121
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,780
This is a killer.

1122
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,880
(Team RYEOWOOK only gets iced americano.)

1123
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,380
(Just envious)

1124
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,880
Iced Bacchus mixed with Sprite.

1125
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,190
(It's now time for that amazing ramen.)

1126
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,790
That's really good.

1127
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,060
- The eggs.
- I agree.

1128
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,130
They cooked them perfectly.

1129
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,360
(Let me try this.)

1130
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,330
(How does the ramen taste?)

1131
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,270
Where's all the soup?

1132
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,360
Isn't it good?

1133
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,270
(Scarfing down)

1134
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,610
It's a perfect combination with the eggs.

1135
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,450
Isn't it amazing?

1136
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,550
This ramen is so good.

1137
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,890
(Big bite)

1138
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:02,290
(Team KYUHYUN savoring the sweet taste
of their first victory)

1139
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,930
I'm full and happy,

1140
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,570
but I want to escape now.

1141
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,110
When will we get out of here?

1142
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,240
Don't tell me...

1143
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,510
we're stuck here forever.

1144
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,440
I want to escape this dry sauna now.

1145
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:26,020
(Before escaping,
night falls while they eat.)

1146
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,590
(Will they be able to escape
before it's too late?)

1147
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,090
If we do this, we get to go home?

1148
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,090
(Gleaming eyes)

1149
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,290
(If you want to escape, memorize fast.)

1150
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,860
(The challenges continue for escape.)

1151
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,600
(But the results are "Wrong.")

1152
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,870
(How do we even escape?)

1153
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,330
(The members are growing desperate
to escape.)

1154
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,570
Move aside.

1155
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,170
How annoying.

1156
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,370
If we can't leave together,
how can this be an age of peace?

1157
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,680
Welcome to my house.

1158
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,680
(SUPER JUNIOR's old dorm is remodeled
and is SHINDONG's house now.)

1159
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,480
(Old dorm life memories flood back.)

1160
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,180
(How nostalgic.)

1161
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,850
(And of course, dorm life stories)

1162
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,250
(The famous Incheon showdown,
LEETEUK vs. HEECHUL)

1163
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,320
We live together...

1164
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,490
(Interested)

1165
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,120
I said "LEETEUK, we need to talk."

1166
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,360
(Chilly)

1167
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,890
(What was LEETEUK's reply?)

1168
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:08,890
(You're invited
to SHINDONG's housewarming.)

1169
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:09,973
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
