1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,200
(A car running on a quiet road)

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,410
Where am I?

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,050
Where am I headed?

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,390
We're here.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,830
Is nobody here?

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,530
"I'm Super Solo?"

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,570
Am I here to find a partner?

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,770
But I've never said something like this.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,540
A show of all of us going
on a trip together or anything.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,180
(Sigh)

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,480
I said "anything"...

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,850
so I'm really doing something random.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,050
Me and my mouth.

14
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,150
Darn it.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,420
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:07,500
(The first man to come
to Super Solo World)

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,000
Nobody's here.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,110
It's cold.

19
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,140
(Nobody's here so he feels more lonely.)

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,550
(He spots something.)

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,320
I'm LEETEUK.

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,360
(First solo, LEETEUK)

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,130
(LEETEUK takes the scroll first.)

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,260
I'll wrap up on my way home.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello. I'm LEETEUK.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,200
To find my partner today,

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,810
I've come here.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,010
(Well)

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,480
Actually, I'm not charming.

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,990
I have nothing.

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm going to find a partner...

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,560
who colors my charmless self...

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,490
into pretty colors.

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,460
(LEETEUK smiles thinking
about finding his partner.)

35
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,370
(Taking confident strides)

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,110
(His outfit shows how manly he is.)

37
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,610
Hello.

38
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,550
(The two met first.)

39
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,020
Do I sit here?

40
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,350
Take the scroll first.

41
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,950
- With my name?
- Yes.

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,020
- Are you LEETEUK?
- Please call me Mr. LEETEUK.

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,760
(LEETEUK is sensitive about appellations.)

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,830
(Second solo, SHINDONG)

45
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,670
- SHINDONG?
- Hello.

46
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,170
- Hello, SHINDONG.
- I'm SHINDONG.

47
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,140
It seems there are many contestants.

48
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,710
One, two, three, four,

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,580
five, six, seven. Seven people.

50
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,290
Those who come first are the gentle ones,

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,790
and those who come last are not.

52
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,590
What kind of person are you expecting?

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,890
I want to meet someone
who's in his right mind.

54
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,560
Among those who are here at this age,

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,260
I don't think anyone will be
in his right mind.

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,470
- Are they all nuts?
- Yes.

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,600
(This place will be full of nuts.)

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
What kind of person do you like, SHINDONG?

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,110
I like men of wealth.

60
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,410
I like people who live a stable life.

61
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,650
I don't consider looks important.

62
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,820
(Will he meet
a partner he can click with?)

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,680
(Effortlessly looking stylish)

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,720
(Wearing a leather jacket and jeans)

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,220
Hello.

66
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,360
(Bowing)

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,930
Does he easily get angry?
There's "wook" in his name.

68
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,070
I see "wook."

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,340
(Third solo, RYEOWOOK)

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,880
Hello, RYEOWOOK.

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,840
I'm SHINDONG.

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm LEETEUK.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,950
(Awkward)

74
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,420
He's good-looking.

75
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,020
Thank you.

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,220
- Please take a seat here.
- It's cold.

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,060
You're wearing a leather jacket
that's way out of style.

78
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,430
People don't wear leather jackets
that much now, do they?

79
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,160
They do.

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,430
- Do they?
- Yes.

81
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,130
My stylist told me to spiff up today,
that's why.

82
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,600
You have a stylist?

83
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,100
You have a stylist?

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,570
Doesn't everyone have a stylist?

85
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,340
- I don't.
- I don't.

86
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,310
What do you do?

87
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,540
Are you rich?

88
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,440
I just...

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,940
do business.

90
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,880
You don't manage a café, do you?

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,280
(How did you know?)

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,550
It's 132 square meters.

93
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,950
I smell burned coffee beans.

94
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,580
(SHINDONG can smell everything.)

95
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,550
(While the three chat...)

96
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,890
(A scarf around his neck
showing he's not good in the cold)

97
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,160
(Camouflage pants and boots)

98
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,270
(A man looking slightly pretentious
but easygoing)

99
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,170
(Interested)

100
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,370
Hello.

101
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,000
You have to bring your scroll from there.

102
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,740
(Fourth solo, EUNHYUK)

103
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,480
Is he a serviceman?

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,550
You're right.

105
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,220
He must be a serviceman.

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,920
A lifer.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,450
He must be on leave to come here.

108
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,450
- Are you a serviceman?
- Excuse me, sir?

109
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,460
Yes, he is.

110
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Your name is easy to remember.

111
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,890
You're EUNHYUK?

112
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,860
How did you know my name?

113
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,200
It's written right there.

114
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,100
(Clumsy)

115
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,470
He can't read.

116
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,830
(It seems he needs to adjust to society.)

117
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,840
I'll introduce myself. I'm SHINDONG.

118
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,870
- I'm LEETEUK.
- LEETEUK.

119
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,610
RYEOWOOK, do you get angry easily?

120
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,010
- Why?
- It seems you do.

121
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,310
We've said that already.

122
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,940
We've already said that.

123
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,950
(Teamwork like they've been together
for 20 years)

124
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,420
Is she a lady?

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,020
Is she a lady?

126
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,860
(Do they finally have a female cast?)

127
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,430
This fake energy for broadcast.

128
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,530
He's Nucksal.

129
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,960
(The fifth solo looks like Nucksal.)

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Are you a cast here?

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,000
- Yes.
- Your scroll is over there.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,840
(Staring)

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,940
He was the worst.

134
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,470
(Eyes shut tight)

135
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,880
I hope we never meet.

136
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,610
Who is he?

137
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,180
SHINDONG said earlier...

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,150
that those who come later are lunatics.

139
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,120
Lunatics start from there.

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,050
From here?

141
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,390
No, from you, EUNHYUK.

142
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,530
(Fifth solo, HEECHUL)

143
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,500
(The crazy man brought his scroll.)

144
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,470
(The next cast comes right after.)

145
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,070
(Faltering)

146
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,310
What is he doing?

147
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,510
He's an actor.

148
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,810
I know. Pantomime.

149
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,110
He must be a mime artist.

150
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,380
(This is heavy.)

151
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,750
(Nobody intends to help him.)

152
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,260
(Just then...)

153
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,990
I'll carry it for you.

154
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,060
Thank you.

155
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,930
(Thankful)

156
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,130
Hello.

157
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,700
(Shy)

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,800
How girly.

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,740
I should definitely help him with this.

160
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,410
Excuse me.

161
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,570
Yes?

162
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,410
(I can't reach it.)

163
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,480
He's putting on a show.

164
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,210
Just take that.

165
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,320
You watched "I'm Solo" too many times.

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,160
I'll help you out. Hold on.

167
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,320
Are you okay?

168
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,960
(EUNHYUK helps him again.)

169
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,100
You're a delicate man.

170
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,400
You should've told me.

171
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,070
(Unbelievable)

172
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,940
(Even helping him walk)

173
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,110
He seems kind of weak.

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,510
I'm conscious of KYUHYUN.

175
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,110
How did you come out of your house?

176
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,280
Isn't he a patient?

177
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,650
KYUHYUN, are you feeling okay?

178
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,620
He shouldn't be on "I'm Solo"...

179
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,250
but on "I'm Dead" or something.

180
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,860
I mean...

181
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,030
KYUHYUN, are you okay?
You might catch a cold.

182
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,190
I already have a cold, so I'm fine.

183
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,660
(Who will he worry with his weakness?)

184
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,100
There's one more empty seat.

185
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
Who is he?

186
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,530
He's here. He's so red.

187
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,400
What?

188
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,840
(Passionate red)

189
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,010
(The final cast
with a strong first impression)

190
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,550
(The final solo, DONGHAE)

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,190
Hello.

192
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,460
My grandpa has those pants and shoes.

193
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,660
My grandpa's favorite is corduroy pants.

194
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,160
(Corduroy pants showing his age)

195
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,000
Are those clothes your own clothes?

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,630
Yes, I wear...

197
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,600
I don't have anyone to choose my outfit.

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,230
Why? What about my clothes?

199
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,940
Do you also think my clothes suck?

200
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,100
No.

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,940
In the winter,
we should wear corduroy clothes.

202
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,110
They're really pretty.

203
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,580
(We hope he meets a warm partner
like corduroy clothes.)

204
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,150
Hello, everyone.

205
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,420
Hello.

206
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,590
You are all here...

207
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,020
to find someone you can click with.

208
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,220
Your "super partner."

209
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,290
Super partner.

210
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,760
(Welcome to "I'm Super Solo.")

211
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,770
We have to choose the person
with the best first impression now.

212
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,500
That's right.

213
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,070
Come to the front one by one and tell us.

214
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,370
Okay.

215
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,280
(Three seconds only)

216
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,250
(The time it takes for one to decide
on the image of the other)

217
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,390
(What is their first impression like
for each other?)

218
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,120
(Who makes the best first impression?)

219
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,620
Look at his face.

220
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,390
He looks so sneaky.

221
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,230
(Malicious comments from the start)

222
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,830
He's so full of himself.

223
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,870
His style is too old-fashioned.

224
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,800
Nobody compliments anyone here.

225
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
(Backbiting under the mask
of an interview)

226
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,110
I pick KYUHYUN.

227
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,510
He made an impactful appearance.

228
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,710
HEECHUL also made a good first impression.

229
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,950
LEETEUK looks
like he has a bunch of group chatrooms.

230
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,280
So he must be a tiresome type.

231
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,450
And LEETEUK looks like he says a bunch
of useless things in group chatrooms.

232
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,720
Let's not make a group chatroom.

233
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,490
(Who are you most awkward with?)

234
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,960
I think HEECHUL.

235
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,730
I'm interested,
but he feels uncomfortable.

236
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,730
Do you intend to approach him?

237
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,370
I'll watch him first.

238
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,570
He must be long-winded.

239
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,170
He talks a lot.

240
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,300
Thank you.

241
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,510
(Quickly ending it)

242
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,440
(Next is SHINDONG.)

243
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,910
(Wait)

244
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,350
The janitor in my apartment is...

245
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,520
He's very kind.

246
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,790
If we become partners,

247
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,660
I think we'll pay too much for meals.

248
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,890
He turned around.

249
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm scared to go there for an interview.

250
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,470
The person I talked with the most.

251
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,000
LEETEUK.

252
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,970
But his looks are not my style at all.

253
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,240
His looks are not.

254
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,140
But he looks like he saves a lot of money.

255
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,040
(Who makes the worst first impression?)

256
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,280
KYUHYUN.

257
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,450
I'm not sure.
I think he's putting on a show.

258
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,180
KYUHYUN?

259
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,850
What is he?

260
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,690
He looks like he'd leave the company
when we start business together.

261
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,960
(Who makes the best first impression?)

262
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,160
The man with a red jacket.

263
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,600
He speaks the least.

264
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,230
(Who looks popular?)

265
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,730
Me, of course.

266
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,230
Look at their faces.

267
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,640
Just because it's cold today,

268
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,170
those men have their hands
in their pockets. They have no manners.

269
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,140
He has an old-fashioned mind.

270
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,440
He's old-fashioned.

271
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,480
He's clearly old-fashioned.

272
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,120
KYUHYUN.

273
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,460
It seems he chose the right act.

274
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,620
I like honest people.

275
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,960
Truthful people.

276
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,330
Don't you think he spiffed up too much?

277
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,930
That's what was popular
in the 1980s, isn't it?

278
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,530
Who does he think he is
to call himself the Little Prince?

279
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,600
(Who do you think
you'll feel the most awkward with?)

280
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,740
DONGHAE.

281
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,940
He's no fun.

282
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,340
I don't think he's funny.

283
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,910
(Who looks the most fake?)

284
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,940
Look how he's glaring at us.
He's annoying.

285
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,850
Him.

286
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,550
Thank you.

287
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,150
That was great. Nice to meet you.

288
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,260
Welcome.

289
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,960
(Change in attitude)

290
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,390
(Just standing there)

291
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,790
Please don't be mean.

292
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,460
I came here feeling excited.

293
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,930
I thought I was going to meet good people.

294
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,430
I've been here for some time...

295
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,470
and they all seem crazy.

296
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,210
What's your ideal type?

297
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,640
I just want my partner
to be in his right mind.

298
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,910
But those men...

299
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,480
I think he's too skinny like an anchovy.

300
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,210
I get why he's called an anchovy.

301
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,920
Look how he's stopping down
like an anchovy.

302
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,220
(Dizzy)

303
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,150
What was the question?

304
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,720
(Who makes the best first impression?)

305
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,360
The man who made his appearance
looking weak.

306
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,400
But if I date him, I think I'll have
to pay too much on hospital bills.

307
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
That's what troubles my mind.

308
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,030
(Who do you think
you won't get along with?)

309
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,170
The man wearing a red jacket.

310
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,740
I think we won't click at all.

311
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,440
Our dispositions won't match at all.

312
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,780
I don't think I'll have anything
to do with him.

313
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,810
- You seem nice.
- You have a nice first impression.

314
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,080
(Time for KYUHYUN
who got three votes until now)

315
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,890
(Who will his Cupid's bow head to?)

316
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,060
My bag was heavy,

317
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,560
so the man who helped me then.

318
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,600
(To EUNHYUK who came running to him,)

319
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,670
(KYUHYUN opened up.)

320
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,370
I'm not that friendly.

321
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,970
So I like friendly people.

322
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,910
I was beside him earlier.

323
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,110
(Is he talking about me?)

324
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,440
And he smelled of alcohol.

325
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,250
And he smelled of alcohol.

326
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,650
Look how red his nose is.

327
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,720
Isn't there a dog that looks like him?

328
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,650
HEECHUL is so...

329
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,520
I don't like people who exaggerate.

330
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,390
And he exaggerates.

331
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,760
So I don't like him.

332
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,130
(KYUHYUN is hurt by HEECHUL's words.)

333
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,530
(After KYUHYUN's interview)

334
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,060
(Is it my turn now?)

335
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,330
Who is he? Since when was he here?

336
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,170
I know. He's gochujang.

337
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,470
He didn't say anything at all.

338
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,740
Is he actually a cast here?

339
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,940
Don't say anything.

340
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,110
That's hilarious.

341
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,410
Then he won't be on the show.

342
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,750
What if DONGHAE is edited out?

343
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,980
(Be quiet.)

344
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,020
I pick SHINDONG.

345
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,050
When I'm with him,

346
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,020
I think I'll be able to eat a lot.

347
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,990
I don't like it when I'm hungry.

348
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,790
(Who do you like the least?)

349
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,730
LEETEUK.

350
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,930
Why?

351
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,930
He looks ill.

352
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,930
He looks sick.

353
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,640
(As everyone expected,
the interview ended so fast.)

354
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,900
That was no fun.

355
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:12,110
(Result of the vote)

356
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,910
(The time it takes
to make your first impression, 3 seconds)

357
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,320
(To change their first impression,)

358
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,290
(a special self-introduction)

359
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,090
(To win each other's hearts,)

360
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,730
(fighting alone)

361
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,830
What is he doing?

362
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,000
He's my type.

363
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,170
(Who will win the hearts
of the Super Solos?)

364
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,930
You can go first, LEETEUK.

365
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,770
(Who SHINDONG said
made the best first impression, LEETEUK)

366
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,210
Hello.

367
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,340
I'm LEETEUK.

368
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,510
I was born in 1983.

369
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,510
You're too old.

370
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,220
(Flustered at the unexpected reaction)

371
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,020
When they talk about my age,
I have nothing to say.

372
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
But they're just a few years younger
than me.

373
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,660
"You're going to get old, too."
This is what I think.

374
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,160
(Upset)

375
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,530
But you look young.

376
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,500
- You look young.
- You do.

377
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm in a hurry. I have to go now.

378
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,970
Go where?

379
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,140
You're curious about my job, right?

380
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,870
I do a real estate rental business.

381
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,250
No wonder he looked rich.

382
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,180
In which neighborhood?

383
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,280
(Curious about the landlord)

384
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,350
It's a neighborhood full of gentlemen.

385
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,290
Where do you live?

386
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,090
I live in Seongsu-dong.

387
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,360
Do you own the house you live in?

388
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,230
I own the house.

389
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,560
Does the house own you?

390
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,600
Is the house small?

391
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,760
- Small?
- Small?

392
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,430
(Flustered at the groundless questions)

393
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,240
Did you finance the house?

394
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,040
I repaid the loan.

395
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,880
That appealed to me a lot.

396
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,710
My ideal type is...

397
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,650
wealthy people.

398
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,750
And he earns a lot of money.

399
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,350
So he clearly appealed to me.

400
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
What's your ideal type?

401
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,020
My ideal type?
People in their right minds.

402
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,660
There are so many crazy people these days.

403
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,530
What's your MBTI?

404
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,830
My MBTI is ENTJ.

405
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,730
Are you a cold-blooded T type?

406
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,570
(Stirred up)

407
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,470
He ruined the mood.

408
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,910
What's wrong with him?

409
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,410
Hey, are you an F type?

410
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,240
(Laughing too hard)

411
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,810
You ruined the mood.

412
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,950
Exactly.

413
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,980
That cute side of DONGHAE.

414
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,350
The others seemed to be on this show...

415
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,820
to become popular.

416
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,590
But DONGHAE was really pure.

417
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,730
He said those harsh words out of nowhere.

418
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,330
I want to fix him.

419
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,360
(I'll watch him.)

420
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,600
There are no more questions, right?

421
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,170
- Right.
- Thank you.

422
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,840
Aren't you showing us your party trick?

423
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,870
I have no party tricks.

424
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,040
Can you do a Shin Moon Sun impression?

425
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,840
He's also old-fashioned.

426
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,380
Okay. Shoot. Goal.

427
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,880
(Request for an old party trick)

428
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,820
Lee Min Sung, shoot, goal!

429
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,190
I didn't expect anyone
to do his impression in this day and age.

430
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,160
(He doesn't mind
and keeps showing party tricks.)

431
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,190
(Right up his alley)

432
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,930
- He's trying hard.
- This old vibe.

433
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,170
I have another one.

434
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,830
It's a trendy one.

435
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,130
Hello. I'm Pengsoo.

436
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,970
Thank you so much.

437
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,010
(Second time bursting into laughter)

438
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,280
He's loving it.

439
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,110
What's going on?

440
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,910
(Touched)

441
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,120
He laughed at my party trick and liked it.

442
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,490
That felt good.

443
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,360
My interest level in him increased a lot.

444
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
That Shin Moon Sun impression was
right up my alley.

445
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,230
In our days, impersonating
commentator Shin Moon Sun's was the best.

446
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,300
He had the courage
to show that impersonation again.

447
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,540
That.

448
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,970
(Will these two meet like fate?)

449
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,710
Hello.

450
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,980
(Next is SHINDONG's self-introduction.)

451
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,650
(Who DONGHAE said
made the best first impression, SHINDONG)

452
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,650
SHINDONG means "shining in the east."

453
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,620
Isn't it the north?

454
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,320
No, it's the east.

455
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,420
I thought it was the north.

456
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,460
I'm SHINDONG.

457
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,620
It means "shining in the east."

458
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,130
I was born in 1985.

459
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,800
You are curious about what I do.

460
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,670
I'm a music video director.

461
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,070
Which famous singer did you work with?

462
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,840
I worked with artists
from SM Entertainment.

463
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,370
SM?

464
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,440
(Unbelievable)

465
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,480
When he said
he was a music video director,

466
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,050
although I don't know
what kind of music videos he shot,

467
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,720
I wanted to know his thoughts...

468
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,550
and how he expresses them.

469
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,790
Where do you live?

470
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,320
I currently live in Gwangjin District.

471
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,220
Is it your own house?

472
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,860
Yes, it is.

473
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,990
- Is it small?
- Is it small?

474
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,160
Why is everyone's house small?

475
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,830
It's bigger than you think.

476
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,430
- You mean your house?
- Many think...

477
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,000
fat people have small houses.

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,040
But mine is bigger than you think.

479
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,110
It'll surprise you all.

480
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll tell you my ideal type.

481
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
I don't consider the looks important.

482
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,450
But I consider wealth important.

483
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,380
I want to stop working
for the rest of my life, that's why.

484
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,980
Do you have a party trick?

485
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,650
I can do the Leg Changing Magic.

486
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,050
What's that?

487
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,660
(All eyes on him)

488
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,340
He's a magician.

489
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,580
Doing this just once is no fun.

490
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,010
So I practiced,

491
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,440
and now, I can do it while walking.

492
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,610
What is he doing?

493
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,720
He was charming.

494
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,990
(Just my type)

495
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,030
In front of people you don't know,

496
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,060
doing something to make them laugh
is not easy.

497
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
"He's cool."

498
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,630
"Is he nice?"

499
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,140
That's what I wondered.

500
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,580
He created a fun atmosphere.

501
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,250
People who are the life of parties.

502
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,580
I'm drawn to people like that.

503
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,850
That was really funny.

504
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,450
He's just my type.

505
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,550
He's my type.

506
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,590
(SHINDONG lovers sitting next
to each other)

507
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,130
This was SHINDONG.

508
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,730
SHINDONG is good at this.

509
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,200
You're light on your feet.

510
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,630
I'm bigger than most expect.

511
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,970
You've prepared a lot, SHINDONG.

512
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,400
This is my everyday party trick.

513
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,110
(Third is RYEOWOOK.)

514
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,440
He must be pressured.

515
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,010
Hello.

516
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,750
Did you gain weight lately?

517
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,510
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

518
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,480
- Do you know him?
- No.

519
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,490
My twin brother is a celebrity.

520
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,750
RYEOWOOK.

521
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,190
You have a celebrity in your family?

522
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,060
Yes.

523
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:12,611
(Reality hit)

524
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,902
You should dance, too.

525
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,072
(Cute and adorable)

526
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:19,342
- How cute.
- He's like a celebrity.

527
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,542
(His dance is extraordinary, indeed.)

528
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,472
He's like a celebrity.

529
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:27,182
He's not my type.

530
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:29,652
But RYEOWOOK said he liked you the most.

531
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,152
- Did he?
- Yes.

532
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,512
I'll have to think about it.

533
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:35,461
I manage a café.

534
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,108
Where's your café?

535
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:40,008
It's a small café in Gimpo.

536
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:44,148
- That's far.
- Where he lives may be a problem.

537
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:46,318
Doesn't the sound of airplanes nearby
wake you up when you're home?

538
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,778
What's with him?
He keeps ruining the mood.

539
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,048
What a terrible question.

540
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,548
Your questions ruin the mood.

541
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:55,018
(DONGHAE is a noncelebrity
struggling on the show.)

542
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:55,888
Seriously.

543
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,888
How old are you?

544
00:22:57,888 --> 00:23:00,498
That's a secret.

545
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:01,458
What?

546
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,968
Are you allowed to keep your age a secret?

547
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:04,068
Don't we all have to reveal our age?

548
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,038
Aren't you introducing yourself?

549
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:07,998
(RYEOWOOK failed to pretend.)

550
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:09,708
I did feel I took the wrong path,

551
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:15,338
but I thought they'd become curious
if I seemed mysterious.

552
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,648
But nobody was curious.

553
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,278
(Surprisingly, nobody was interested.)

554
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:22,648
In here, I want to meet someone nice...

555
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:24,988
and sincere.

556
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,158
Everyone looks nice.

557
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:29,558
Who looks the meanest?

558
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,928
Who looks
like he has the worst personality?

559
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:33,358
(Who do you think?)

560
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:37,398
You caught my eye.

561
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:39,498
Okay. Thank you.

562
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:41,368
(Time for EUNHYUK to introduce himself)

563
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:42,768
The lifer.

564
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:45,308
I wonder how old he is.

565
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,078
It seems many of you want to know me.

566
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,008
I'll quickly introduce myself.

567
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,218
I was born in 1986.

568
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:55,348
He's old.

569
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:58,588
(Many are in their forties
in this season.)

570
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,258
You're curious about what I do, right?

571
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:01,888
Aren't you a serviceman?

572
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:06,558
I like camouflage clothes,
so I get why people get me wrong.

573
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,058
I'm not a serviceman,

574
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,098
but a chef.

575
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:12,168
You're lying.

576
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,838
I think he doesn't know what a chef is.

577
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:17,038
I was on "Culinary Class Wars" lately.

578
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,438
Were you the food ingredient?

579
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,738
(Former "Culinary Class Wars" ingredient?)

580
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:23,208
I wasn't the food ingredient.

581
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,678
"Seongsu-dong Food Bomber."

582
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,878
That's the restaurant I own.

583
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,518
How do you spell "chef?"

584
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:31,818
S.

585
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,558
What?

586
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,758
How could you be worse than RYEOWOOK?

587
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,722
I was really disappointed.

588
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:03,362
I don't remember anything about him.

589
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:10,824
Okay.

590
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:12,754
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

591
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,084
How old are you?

592
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:15,084
I was born...

593
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,324
in 2004.

594
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,054
In 2004.

595
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,324
You're lying.

596
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:23,054
Don't you mean
you have a son born in 2004?

597
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,084
How old are you
if you were born in 2004?

598
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,884
I'm...

599
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:28,124
- twenty...
- You don't even know your age?

600
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:30,284
Are those who were born in 2004
22 years old already?

601
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:32,654
He definitely doesn't look
like he was born in 2004.

602
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,554
If I have a chance,

603
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:39,254
I want to ask him
to show his identity card.

604
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,454
Do you want to know what I do?

605
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,884
I know it's obvious by my looks,

606
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:45,554
but I'm an Ethics teacher
in middle school.

607
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:47,784
(Second time bursting into laughter)

608
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:48,784
That was the funniest remark.

609
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:54,024
He looks like the most unethical person,

610
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,824
but he said he is an Ethics teacher.

611
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:58,184
I knew he didn't mean it.

612
00:25:58,184 --> 00:26:00,284
What do you think he does for real?

613
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:01,284
A swindler.

614
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:06,984
What middle school are you talking about?

615
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,554
Jinkwang Middle School
in Wonju-si, Gangwon-do.

616
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:11,254
(I don't believe you.)

617
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:15,384
Like an Ethics teacher,
tell us about Mencius and Confucius.

618
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:18,024
There's this famous story
about Mencius and his mother.

619
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,524
Mencius' mother.

620
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:24,484
At first, she raised him near the market.

621
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,684
(Young Mencius followed merchants.)

622
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,954
So she thought that won't do.

623
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:31,054
Then, she moved to a place
in the entertainment district.

624
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:34,554
(Entertainment district? Seriously?)

625
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:37,584
Next, she moved to a place near a school
and made Mencius study.

626
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:39,054
That's the famous story.

627
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:41,254
You do know something.

628
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:42,624
You know the rough story.

629
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:43,624
He really is an Ethics teacher.

630
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:44,624
Yes, he is.

631
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,554
Yes, I am.

632
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:48,724
I didn't trust him much, either.

633
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:53,384
But the more I see him,
the more he seems like an Ethics teacher.

634
00:26:53,384 --> 00:26:54,654
What makes you think that?

635
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,924
The story about Mencius and his mother.

636
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,984
(Sixth super solo, KYUHYUN)

637
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:03,184
(KYUHYUN made the best first impression
on LEETEUK.)

638
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:04,754
I'm pleased to meet you.

639
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,324
Look how he put his hands
in his pockets.

640
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,554
Are you sure you're pleased to meet us?

641
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:10,154
You don't seem pleased at all.

642
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,754
I'm pleased.
I was born early in the year 1988.

643
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:16,184
Being born early in the year
doesn't matter anymore.

644
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:18,084
How early in the year were you born?

645
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,624
Super early. Why?

646
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:22,154
You may be wondering what I do.

647
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:23,284
I'm a musical actor.

648
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:26,884
Please get me an autograph
of Lee Seok Hoon.

649
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:28,684
Isn't Cho Seung Woo
the best musical actor?

650
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,354
I'm close to Cho Seung Woo, too.

651
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,984
(Cool)

652
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,984
Why are you here today?

653
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,384
To become a star.

654
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:41,284
He's here to promote.

655
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,154
He's here to promote his musical.

656
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:45,754
What musical are you doing now?

657
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:47,184
"The Man Who Laughs."

658
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:48,224
Then why aren't you laughing?

659
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:49,124
I'm laughing.

660
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,384
(Smile)

661
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,684
(He's grinning.)

662
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:53,684
Happy now?

663
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,084
Are you angry?

664
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:58,384
You're scary.

665
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:00,724
The way he talked...

666
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:02,454
was rude.

667
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:07,284
KYUHYUN was quiet at first,

668
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:10,184
but he showed his real character.

669
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:12,884
I didn't like him.

670
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,024
Show us your party trick.

671
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:17,854
- Party trick.
- I'll sing a number from my musical.

672
00:28:17,854 --> 00:28:20,154
- I don't want that.
- No.

673
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,954
- I don't want to listen to you sing.
- I'm here to promote.

674
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:24,084
Dance for us.

675
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:26,084
- Yes, dance for us.
- Dance.

676
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,954
I actually like to dance.

677
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,054
May I show you my dance?

678
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:31,054
Sure.

679
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:34,054
(KYUHYUN comes down the platform.)

680
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:37,354
(Shoulders up)

681
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,384
(Excited)

682
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,384
What will he do?

683
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:41,484
What will he do?

684
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:42,784
What?

685
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:49,484
(Mysterious dance moves)

686
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:50,524
Is that a dance?

687
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:55,424
There's this group with many members...

688
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,354
that debuted in 2005
and got a new member in 2006.

689
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:02,824
I did the dance break
of their representative song "U."

690
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:12,084
(This part)

691
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:15,124
(Popping KYUHYUN)

692
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:16,524
Is that a dance?

693
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,654
(Restrained arm choreography)

694
00:29:21,654 --> 00:29:22,984
(Skillful tempo control)

695
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:25,054
(At a loss for words)

696
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:26,224
What do you think?

697
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,154
- I'm not sure.
- I don't get what that was.

698
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:50,989
We've all introduced ourselves now.
Let's go inside.

699
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:52,919
(Silly laugh)

700
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:54,219
It's cold.

701
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:55,319
Wait. I didn't know someone was here.

702
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,719
(Time for the nonperson DONGHAE)

703
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:03,149
(DONGHAE made the best first impression
on HEECHUL.)

704
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:04,919
(Staring)

705
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,349
Are those your own clothes?

706
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,619
Are they yours for real?

707
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,149
I bought these shoes
when I was young...

708
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:12,619
- and wore them for ten years.
- You paid for them?

709
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:13,649
Yes.

710
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:14,519
You paid for them?

711
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,589
We have to respect him.

712
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:23,689
He said that was his favorite style
so I respected that,

713
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:28,349
but I decided not to dress up like him.

714
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:30,989
I'm running a gym in Mokpo-si.

715
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:34,049
You're running a gym. No wonder.

716
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,389
What's your big three total?

717
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:37,419
I lift 100.

718
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,519
Seriously? Was that a joke?

719
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,589
What was that?

720
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:47,719
He's "The Man Who Laughs."

721
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,689
(But I'm "The Man Who Laughs.")

722
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,219
Do you have any questions?

723
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,519
Do you have a party trick?

724
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,549
I don't.

725
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,519
Then answer this.

726
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,749
When was your last kiss?

727
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:04,089
("The Man Who Laughs" is here again.)

728
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:08,249
He has to manage a gym
so he probably kisses barbells.

729
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:09,289
DONGHAE,

730
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,519
does he know what kind of show this is?

731
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,789
It seemed he didn't know who he was.

732
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,119
You said you were from Mokpo-si.

733
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,249
Can you do a Jeolla-do accent?

734
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,489
What do you want me to say?

735
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:25,949
Swear at us.

736
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:31,549
(A swear word spread
in the Super Solo World.)

737
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,519
(I can't do this show with him.)

738
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,849
He doesn't know the show business
so he swears for real.

739
00:31:37,949 --> 00:31:42,289
If that's bleeped,
nobody will hear the accent.

740
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:43,349
I have another one.

741
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,819
(That's all for my introduction.)

742
00:31:49,249 --> 00:31:50,389
But...

743
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:52,949
- He's good.
- He's bold.

744
00:31:52,949 --> 00:31:55,419
His swear words are cool.

745
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,289
(Embarrassed)

746
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,689
You've learned a bit
about each other, right?

747
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:01,689
Yes.

748
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:05,849
(How much did their hearts waver?)

749
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:10,049
To check your current interest level
after everyone's self-introduction,

750
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,449
we'll proceed with a Back Hug Choice.

751
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:13,619
What's that?

752
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:16,119
You will stand in the back one by one...

753
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,319
and hug the person you like the most...

754
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,649
from the back.

755
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:24,249
(Is there any change
in their first choice?)

756
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,389
You can go first, LEETEUK.

757
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,749
All of you are really charming.

758
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:31,919
(Thinking hard)

759
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,089
(LEETEUK picked KYUHYUN as the man
who made the best first impression.)

760
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:39,049
(The story about Mencius
that touched his heart)

761
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:43,319
(Who will LEETEUK choose?)

762
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:52,619
(LEETEUK chooses HEECHUL.)

763
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:53,619
HEECHUL.

764
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:57,549
This feels awkward already.

765
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:02,289
It was unexpected that LEETEUK chose me.

766
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,649
There was no interaction between us,

767
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,689
but it did seem I had that power...

768
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:10,419
of drawing people in.

769
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:13,649
So I'm going to watch LEETEUK carefully.

770
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:14,989
(Will HEECHUL open up to LEETEUK?)

771
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,419
(LEETEUK chose HEECHUL,
and it's HEECHUL's turn now.)

772
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:22,149
(Who is HEECHUL headed?)

773
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:25,249
(The cuteness of DONGHAE
that grabbed his heart at first sight.)

774
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,149
(Repaying LEETEUK for choosing him?)

775
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,349
(HEECHUL stops behind LEETEUK.)

776
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:38,049
(Are they looking in the same direction?)

777
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:43,089
(But HEECHUL steps away.)

778
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:48,019
As an Ethics teacher
who leads students the right way,

779
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,349
I will guide him the right way.

780
00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:00,789
(HEECHUL chooses DONGHAE.)

781
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:05,649
It felt good
that someone was interested in me.

782
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,489
His words made me lay eyes on him.

783
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,019
Okay, next.

784
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:15,419
Close your eyes.

785
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,549
(RYEOWOOK chose KYUHYUN as the man
who made the best first impression.)

786
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:25,049
(Will he push his opinion through?)

787
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,819
(He turns back...)

788
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,949
(to SHINDONG.)

789
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:35,249
Why me?

790
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:37,049
I liked...

791
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,719
your party trick.

792
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,689
I'll teach you.

793
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:44,419
- I wanted that.
- Let's do it together.

794
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,219
And we'll change our legs like this.

795
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:50,319
(He's hilarious.)

796
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,519
EUNHYUK.

797
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,519
Yes.

798
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,249
(EUNHYUK chose KYUHYUN as the man
who made the best first impression.)

799
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:04,019
(A man EUNHYUK liked at first sight)

800
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:09,219
(Will he choose KYUHYUN?)

801
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:18,689
(Where is he headed?)

802
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,489
(EUNHYUK chooses SHINDONG.)

803
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,719
Really?

804
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,619
(SHINDONG got votes
from RYEOWOOK and EUNHYUK.)

805
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,719
I'll make delicious stir-fried spicy pork
for you.

806
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,249
- Great.
- Then you two are rivals.

807
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,119
(Keeping in check)

808
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,119
Okay, next.

809
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,189
The Man Who Laughs.

810
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:35,719
What was your job again?

811
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,189
Landlord.

812
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:39,049
Music video director.

813
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,249
Café owner, chef.

814
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:42,789
Ethics teacher.

815
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:44,219
Gym owner.

816
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:48,119
(Checking everyone's jobs
before making up his mind)

817
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,789
Does this help you decide?

818
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:51,949
What difference does this make?

819
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,919
(A nice job is what KYUHYUN thinks
his partner should have.)

820
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,819
(KYUHYUN thinks hard
reviewing their jobs.)

821
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:00,319
Chef.

822
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,319
Ethics teacher.

823
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,419
(This is hard.)

824
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:11,019
(EUNHYUK who willingly helped him
when they first met)

825
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,649
(LEETEUK, the landlord,
who knocked on the door to his heart)

826
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:19,719
(He makes up his mind.)

827
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:24,419
(KYUHYUN chooses LEETEUK.)

828
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,449
When I look at KYUHYUN,

829
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,589
he seems like a rich young master.

830
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:32,019
He's warm but also like a baby.

831
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,889
I'm going to keep watching him.

832
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:36,749
(Sad)

833
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:40,089
I've tried your food, Chef.

834
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:41,889
- Have you been to his restaurant?
- I visited and tried his food.

835
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,189
You've been to my restaurant?

836
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:44,549
And I couldn't stand the food.

837
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:49,449
(Sad)

838
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:51,149
- DONGHAE.
- Yes.

839
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:01,319
(The Ethics teacher who chose me)

840
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:04,689
(Reliable SHINDONG I chose
who eats a lot)

841
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:18,389
(DONGHAE chooses SHINDONG.)

842
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:20,489
Everyone's choosing me.

843
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:22,989
- DONGHAE.
- Yes?

844
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:24,949
Why did you choose SHINDONG?

845
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:26,289
These days...

846
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:27,319
(Excited)

847
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:29,019
I want to lift weights.

848
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:36,019
(DONGHAE needed a gym partner.)

849
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:37,989
SHINDONG, it's your turn.

850
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:42,889
(Sighing like he has a lot on his mind)

851
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:45,349
(RYEOWOOK)

852
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,089
(EUNHYUK)

853
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,889
(DONGHAE)

854
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:53,919
(Three people chose SHINDONG.)

855
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,619
We have to be like-minded
and we have to click...

856
00:37:58,249 --> 00:37:59,519
to share a future.

857
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,989
That's how we can become true partners.

858
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,749
(He makes up his mind
and heads to the person.)

859
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:09,589
My heart almost stopped.

860
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:11,289
(These three are also nervous.)

861
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,349
SHINDONG.

862
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:18,449
(SHINDONG chooses LEETEUK.)

863
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:21,819
(Turning)

864
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,519
(The three weren't chosen.)

865
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,389
If I stay with him for just five years...

866
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:31,349
and get divorced,
I think I'll get a big amount of alimony.

867
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,289
So you plan to marry?

868
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,719
(SHINDONG still prefers money
over true love.)

869
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:42,289
(Result of the Back Hug Choice)

870
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:44,119
SHINDONG, take a seat here.

871
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,119
Where should I sit?

872
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:48,819
(Super Solos are in the Solo Cottage.)

873
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:53,189
(EUNHYUK quickly sits
next to SHINDONG.)

874
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:55,749
(This man saw EUNHYUK flirt
with SHINDONG.)

875
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,619
Then I'll sit here.

876
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:00,189
Everyone's trying to sit next to me.

877
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,519
(Silent rivalry between the two
to win SHINDONG's heart)

878
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:08,349
If you look behind,

879
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,219
it's written "Super Solo Cottage."

880
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,249
Did you read that?

881
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,119
(3 Guidelines of Super Solo Cottage)

882
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,319
(The main goal of everyone
in the Super Solo Cottage is...)

883
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,519
(to find your Super Partner.)

884
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,719
(Everyone must actively participate...)

885
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,989
(in living in the Super Solo Cottage.)

886
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,489
(There are no restrictions
in the events and gifts you prepare...)

887
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,019
(to win other people's hearts.)

888
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:24,119
(Events?)

889
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,119
Don't you all feel closer now
after the self-introduction?

890
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,989
- No.
- Not yet.

891
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,789
(Awkward)

892
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:32,819
(Uncomfortable)

893
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:33,919
How about playing a game?

894
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,289
- Let's play a game.
- Shall we?

895
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,519
I love playing games.

896
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,419
I see.

897
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,349
- What game should we play?
- Do you know what's popular these days?

898
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,919
Popular games these days?

899
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,949
We prepared the I Like You Game.

900
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:46,789
What's that?

901
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,949
(The common game at drinks gathering,
I Like You Game)

902
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,519
(The one who is told "I like you"
has to say yes or no.)

903
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,049
I like you, EUNHYUK.

904
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:56,049
I don't.

905
00:39:56,049 --> 00:40:00,719
(You can say "I like you" 3 times.
Get rejected 3 times, you get a penalty.)

906
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:06,089
(The penalty is drinking up healthy
shrubby sophora and lemon tea.)

907
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:07,919
This is really hard.

908
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,849
Games young people play
these days are hard.

909
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,219
It's complicated.

910
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:12,219
Let's try it.

911
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:15,019
(Who will they confess their love to?)

912
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,489
I'm here to see my partner.
How about play the I Like You Game?

913
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,289
I like you, KYUHYUN.

914
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:20,289
I don't.

915
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:24,189
(You don't like me?)

916
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,749
(Why isn't he going again?)

917
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:27,919
(Then you should drink.)

918
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,089
(Aftereffect of the rejection)

919
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:30,149
Are you hurt?

920
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:31,719
It hurts when I hear "I don't."

921
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:34,249
(He's pure.)

922
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:35,619
It's just a game.

923
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:36,949
Why get hurt when it's just a game?

924
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:37,949
You shouldn't feel hurt.

925
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,219
He's so cold.
You'll know when you get it.

926
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:41,649
This is too speedy.

927
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,549
- Let's make it a bit slower.
- Shall we play it a bit slow?

928
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:45,249
Let's start.

929
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:49,789
(Playing again slowly)

930
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,149
I like you, RYEOWOOK.

931
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,049
I don't.

932
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,589
I like you, HEECHUL.

933
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:56,549
You're the worst.

934
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,449
I like you, DONGHAE.

935
00:40:58,449 --> 00:40:59,589
(I trust you, DONGHAE.)

936
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:00,589
Get lost.

937
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:04,049
Get lost.

938
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:06,989
(These people)

939
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:09,219
(Three rejections, three times hurt)

940
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,389
It's just a game.

941
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:14,789
If we play a game like this,
everyone will keep rejecting.

942
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:16,889
Wait. This is a strange game.

943
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:19,189
- Let's start with DONGHAE.
- Why put a serious face?

944
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:21,389
- Try starting the game.
- He's so serious.

945
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:22,419
You start the game.

946
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:25,749
(Serious Face, LEETEUK)

947
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:29,089
I got angry and was at a loss for words.

948
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:31,889
I know it's just a game,

949
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,819
but hearing "I don't like you"...

950
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:36,489
hurt my feelings.

951
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:39,649
I said we should keep playing it...

952
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,249
so they'd feel hurt as well.

953
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,349
(LEETEUK is a grudge holder.)

954
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:46,619
(The room is heated in a different way.)

955
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,719
I'm a gambling teacher.

956
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,989
Let's start with the gambling teacher.

957
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:53,949
(Will two people like each other
this time?)

958
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,289
I like you, EUNHYUK.

959
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:57,289
I don't.

960
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:58,919
I like you, SHINDONG.

961
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,519
(Two rejections)

962
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,289
I like you, RYEOWOOK.

963
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:03,819
(Please, RYEOWOOK)

964
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:04,719
Get lost.

965
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:07,919
Get lost.

966
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:11,449
(HEECHUL became as rough
as sandpaper due to the rejections.)

967
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:13,349
I told you. We can't play this game.

968
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,689
How can an Ethics teacher swear like that?

969
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:18,649
I don't think
he's an Ethics teacher, either.

970
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,489
He's such a liar.

971
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:26,119
(Feeling sympathy)

972
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,919
I'm sorry, but I can't accept it.

973
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:29,249
- I know, right?
- Yes.

974
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:31,519
(They're going against the purpose
of this game.)

975
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,949
Lastly, let's start with DONGHAE.

976
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:37,419
(Will DONGHAE's confession
be accepted?)

977
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:38,489
I like you, SHINDONG.

978
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:43,589
(Bad-mouthers)

979
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,719
(Love is in the air
in the Super Solo Cottage.)

980
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,649
You guys swear so naturally.

981
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,119
I get how you feel now. It hurts.

982
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,249
- This hurts.
- I don't think we should play this game.

983
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,349
Hold each other's hands.

984
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:57,289
We love each other.

985
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,889
I love you.

986
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:02,149
To get to know each other more,
how about playing the Five Fingers Game?

987
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:04,649
(Everyone willingly accepts
SHINDONG's suggestion.)

988
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,919
The Five Fingers Game sounds fun.

989
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:10,519
I'm still interested in SHINDONG.

990
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,189
He kept leading everyone.

991
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:15,849
He even has leadership.

992
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:16,949
He's even good.

993
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:20,049
The person who still has unfolded fingers
in the end has to drink.

994
00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:21,189
Fold all five early to win.

995
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:24,749
(Will they get to know each other?)

996
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,289
- I'll start.
- We didn't play this for a long time.

997
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:30,319
In the past year, with a woman,

998
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,849
with a woman...

999
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:32,919
Is he out of his mind?

1000
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,949
- Listen.
- Are you trying to kill all of us?

1001
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,149
No. Listen to me.

1002
00:43:37,149 --> 00:43:39,889
I've dated a woman.

1003
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:42,049
(RYEOWOOK and LEETEUK folded
their fingers.)

1004
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:42,989
Really?

1005
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:45,049
But as far as I know, you haven't.

1006
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:46,649
He's just trying to save himself.

1007
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:48,119
I'll show you later.

1008
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,819
Are we being honest?

1009
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:52,289
(Super Solos suffering from
identity crisis)

1010
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,249
This is what we say
before we start this game.

1011
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:58,889
If you lie, the ruin will last
for three generations.

1012
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,249
Isn't it just a game?

1013
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:02,349
- Anyway, you folded one finger.
- Next is KYUHYUN.

1014
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,389
It's been a long time
since I dated someone.

1015
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:06,689
I brushed my teeth today.

1016
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:09,419
(Everyone folded their fingers.)

1017
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:10,519
I don't think you did.

1018
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,149
Brushing your teeth is the basics.

1019
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,449
I don't think you did, HEECHUL.

1020
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:15,049
I always do.

1021
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:17,689
- Always?
- My nickname is Brushing.

1022
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,089
That doesn't sound like brushing teeth.

1023
00:44:20,189 --> 00:44:22,489
(Somewhat embarrassed
to call HEECHUL by his nickname)

1024
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:24,019
Isn't your nickname Blushing?

1025
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:26,749
(Zero credibility)

1026
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:30,619
I woke up before 8 a.m. today.

1027
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:31,789
One, two, three.

1028
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:34,649
(RYEOWOOK, DONGHAE,
and HEECHUL folded their fingers.)

1029
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:36,089
We have to be really honest.

1030
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,819
Totally honest.

1031
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:40,949
I like to use kind words...

1032
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,489
so during the past year,

1033
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:46,349
I've never said a cuss word.
Fold your finger.

1034
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:48,589
(Staring)

1035
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,189
There was a lot of swearing
earlier outside.

1036
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:55,119
Wasn't what you said a cuss word?

1037
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,149
(Only shameless HEECHUL
folded his finger.)

1038
00:44:57,149 --> 00:45:00,819
To the person I like,

1039
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:03,849
I can give 100,000 dollars.

1040
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:06,089
(Not easy to fold their fingers)

1041
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:07,189
Not lending?

1042
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:09,249
(Will anyone fold their fingers?)

1043
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:11,589
(No change in their hands)

1044
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,389
He asked, but he didn't fold his finger.

1045
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:16,989
(Unfolded)

1046
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,389
(Even the one who asked
can't fold his finger at this.)

1047
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:20,989
It seems like too much
to give 100,000 dollars, not lending.

1048
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:22,249
Your turn is over.

1049
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:24,219
SHINDONG.

1050
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:27,689
I can eat everything my partner offers.

1051
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:29,019
Even if it's something I can't eat?

1052
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,749
Yes, just for your partner.

1053
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:32,389
I can't.

1054
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:33,549
One, two, three.

1055
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:34,819
(SHINDONG, DONGHAE,
and KYUHYUN folded their fingers.)

1056
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,819
It's harder than I thought
to fold my fingers.

1057
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,189
(Thinking)

1058
00:45:39,189 --> 00:45:40,189
I weigh less than 100kg.

1059
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:47,419
(They burst out in laughter
at the unexpected remark.)

1060
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:50,049
What was that?

1061
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:50,849
Sorry.

1062
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:54,489
SHINDONG will actually...

1063
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:57,049
remember my name, RYEOWOOK.

1064
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:01,189
He'll remember me and think about me.

1065
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:02,949
"Is he interested in me?"

1066
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:05,949
I'm sorry, but I had to say that.

1067
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,019
One left.

1068
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:13,149
- You're good.
- When I go home after the shoot today,

1069
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:16,989
I plan to carpool with someone here.

1070
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,189
(Welcoming carpools)

1071
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:21,389
(RYEOWOOK, SHINDONG,
and EUNHYUK folded their fingers.)

1072
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:23,819
(Everyone except for HEECHUL
folded their fingers.)

1073
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:25,919
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

1074
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,189
Our musical actor.

1075
00:46:27,189 --> 00:46:28,389
(Number of fingers left)

1076
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,619
Something related to my partner.

1077
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,589
What does weighing less than 100kg
have to do with partners?

1078
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:37,119
(What's common
between partners and 100kg?)

1079
00:46:37,189 --> 00:46:38,649
They may be curious
about their partner's weight.

1080
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:40,349
(He surely remembers his name.)

1081
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:42,619
I like people who weigh over 100kg.

1082
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,389
This year...

1083
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:45,819
This year? It's still early in the year.

1084
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:47,889
(What kind of partner does KYUHYUN like?)

1085
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,519
It's only been two weeks.

1086
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,389
I've had a drink.

1087
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,689
Seriously? That was no fun at all.

1088
00:46:54,149 --> 00:46:56,349
(SHINDONG doesn't get a penalty.)

1089
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,649
(Who's left now?)

1090
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:01,149
(Promise to become my eternal partner.)

1091
00:47:01,149 --> 00:47:02,249
We have one finger left.

1092
00:47:02,249 --> 00:47:04,549
I regularly...

1093
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:05,889
Regularly.

1094
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,089
Get a Brazilian wax.
Fold your finger if it's you.

1095
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:09,089
One, two, three.

1096
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:10,489
(All three folded their fingers.)

1097
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:12,389
You do, too? Come here, all of you.

1098
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:13,389
Both of you, come here.

1099
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:14,789
Please give us a dash cam.

1100
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:16,919
(You three should just drink.)

1101
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:17,719
Pick one each.

1102
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:18,849
You can ask for someone else
to drink for you.

1103
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:22,219
(Musty smell hitting the adenohypophysis)

1104
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:24,089
It smells like an armpit odor.

1105
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:25,619
Do you really get
Brazilian wax regularly?

1106
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,119
- Yes.
- Then don't you have hair in your armpit?

1107
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:29,749
(He's being pathetic.)

1108
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:34,349
(Is EUNHYUK's armpit clean?)

1109
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:35,349
Why are they...

1110
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:37,119
You drink this yourself.

1111
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,489
He's hairy.

1112
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:41,649
(EUNHYUK is super manly.)

1113
00:47:41,689 --> 00:47:43,519
I have a reservation to get it next week.

1114
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:47,089
- You should drink this alone.
- I'm getting it next week.

1115
00:47:48,189 --> 00:47:50,549
I started to have feelings for EUNHYUK,

1116
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:51,949
so I wanted to play with him.

1117
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,719
But...

1118
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:54,789
he was hairy.

1119
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:57,519
I like celebrities...

1120
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:59,219
like Mithra Jin of Epik High.

1121
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:00,119
Celebrities like him.

1122
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,889
I don't have a mustache, that's why.

1123
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:04,549
But I saw that
EUNHYUK was kind of hairy.

1124
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,249
I fell in love with his cute face,

1125
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:09,419
so that was his charming point.

1126
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,819
(EUNHYUK is both cute and manly.)

1127
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:16,019
Shrubby sophora tea flowing in. Drink up.

1128
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,849
(Shrubby sophora tea makes him shout
automatically.)

1129
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:23,389
- Is it good?
- It's as painful as getting waxed.

1130
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:25,549
(No)

1131
00:48:25,689 --> 00:48:28,149
(He needs sweet candy.)

1132
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:29,519
Green grape candy.

1133
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:31,489
EUNHYUK, are you going to like me
if I give you candy?

1134
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:32,489
I have mine.

1135
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:35,149
(No way)

1136
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:36,549
Don't talk.

1137
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:37,689
Your breath smells like a dry sauna.

1138
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:39,189
(The mood lifted
so they're making jokes now.)

1139
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:43,519
(The Super Solos got closer
to each other.)

1140
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:45,449
<i>Bbabba</i>

1141
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,419
(They're still looking
for their partners.)

1142
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:50,149
(Welcome, shrubby sophora tea.)

1143
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:52,419
(HEECHUL secretly had feelings
for EUNHYUK.)

1144
00:48:52,419 --> 00:48:55,219
(He sings a serenade for EUNHYUK
who's drinking shrubby sophora tea.)

1145
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,819
(Revealing his feelings)

1146
00:48:56,989 --> 00:48:58,219
I was actually really nervous.

1147
00:48:58,449 --> 00:48:59,419
(We can't just stand by.)

1148
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:01,749
(They're becoming skillfully flirtatious.)

1149
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:02,819
(Flirting here)

1150
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:03,849
(Flirting there?)

1151
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,489
Why aren't you giving it to me?

1152
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,889
I'm confused.

1153
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:07,949
It's either one of them.

1154
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:10,589
(Choosing who to have dinner with)

1155
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:12,689
- I'm EUNHYUK.
- Who wants to eat with me?

1156
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:14,289
Who should I pick?

1157
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:15,519
I have a lot on my mind.

1158
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,649
I'm swayed.

1159
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:17,819
What? Together?

1160
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:18,819
Why is this so...

1161
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,449
(In a huddle)

1162
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:22,119
You're hugging me from the back, right?

1163
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,039
(Who will the Super Solos eat with?)

1164
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,039
Dramaday.me
