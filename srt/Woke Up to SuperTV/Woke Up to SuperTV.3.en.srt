1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,470
(Super Solos
who are here to find a match.)

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,140
(Showing off their charms
from the first meeting)

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,570
(Strange dance)

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,910
He's my type.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,980
(From Super Solos who got many choices...)

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,950
I like you, SHINDONG.

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,750
(to Super Solos who only got rejected)

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,720
I don't like you.

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,520
Get lost.

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,820
Fold your finger
if you've never said a cuss word.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,690
(Folding)

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,160
(Fold a finger
if you weigh less than 100kg.)

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,730
(The Super Solos have become close enough
to joke around.)

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,130
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,700
(After the Five Fingers Game)

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,940
That game was fun.

17
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,570
There are other games, too.

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,240
How about a game with some movement
like the Shooting Game?

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,270
(Boom boom)

20
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,380
(Just hearing the name triggers
the melody)

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,180
(Which charms
will they show off this time?)

22
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,120
You have to get up.

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,420
Is that how we're playing it?

24
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,180
That's how you play the game.
What are you doing?

25
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,920
If you want to play the game...

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,050
Let's see.

27
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,190
- This is bad.
- Let's see.

28
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,220
I'm sorry, but my joints aren't great.

29
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,360
Let's do it. This will be confusing.

30
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,390
Bend down.

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,560
You have to stand up properly
and raise your hands.

32
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,000
(Rules of the Shooting Game)

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
(1 to 4 people take turns standing up
and sitting down.)

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,310
(Starting with RYEOWOOK)

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,740
- I came alone.
- We came as two.

36
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,680
- We came as three.
- We came as four.

37
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,510
(EUNHYUK was a beat too late.)

38
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,780
(The first dropout is EUNHYUK.)

39
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,790
You were late on the fourth turn.

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,160
- Was I?
- Shrubby sophora tea.

41
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,230
Shrubby sophora tea

42
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,130
(HEECHUL suddenly appears.)

43
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,370
(Bewildered)

44
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,300
Wasn't that ROSÉ's song?

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,200
(Such a strange person)

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
(Thanks to HEECHUL's cheer song,
EUNHYUK drinks up.)

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,610
Put your cup right there.

48
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,770
Show us.

49
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,870
You're going to get healthy.

50
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,080
(Disgusted)

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,380
(I'm not drinking it this time.)

52
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,380
(Round two)

53
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,120
- I came alone.
- We came as two.

54
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,180
- We came as three.
- We came as four.

55
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,790
- We came as three.
- We came as four.

56
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,160
(He rejected boarding.)

57
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,290
(Was it my turn, too?)

58
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,030
(He's cute.)

59
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,430
(DONGHAE gets the penalty drink.)

60
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,900
(It's not me this time.)

61
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,370
(When someone has a penalty drink,)

62
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,840
(the cheering fairy always appears.)

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,210
(He's hilarious.)

64
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,770
I'm sorry, but what are the lyrics?

65
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,040
"Don't you" what?

66
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,140
Don't you want you, baby.

67
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,180
What are the lyrics?

68
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,710
(DONGHAE drank up
while they were singing.)

69
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,280
This is super strong.

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,920
(I know.)

71
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,020
I'll have to try harder.

72
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,060
(The opening song plays again.)

73
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,730
(I won't get it wrong this time.)

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,630
- I came alone.
- We came as two.

75
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,060
- We came as three.
- We came as four.

76
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,770
- We came as three.
- We came as two.

77
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,630
- We came as four.
- We came as three.

78
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,640
We came as two.

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,470
(Is it you again?)

80
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,410
(DONGHAE lost again.)

81
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,710
Shrubby sophora tea

82
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,740
(Super Solos are united
to avoid the shrubby sophora tea.)

83
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,450
(HEECHUL, the guest singer)

84
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,850
(Dizzy)

85
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,780
This is the end, so two drinks.

86
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,550
(Gently pulling)

87
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,990
(KYUHYUN secretly lets him lean on him.)

88
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,290
You, too, right?

89
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,720
(Shy)

90
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,690
I think DONGHAE was cute.

91
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,300
He seemed silly getting it wrong.

92
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,370
But he also seemed pure.

93
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,230
You, too, right?
We're both drinking, right?

94
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,570
No, it's only you.

95
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,400
Only you.

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,510
I was right.

97
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,510
(Please don't say that.)

98
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,110
Drink up.

99
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,440
How about keeping one glass...

100
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,150
and drinking it together
with the next person who loses?

101
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

102
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,420
(The final round)

103
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,890
Boom

104
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,560
- I came alone.
- We came as two.

105
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,020
- We came as three.
- We came as four.

106
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,420
- We came as three.
- We came as two.

107
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,030
(Is this a déjà vu?)

108
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,600
(Here are two glasses
including the one you kept earlier.)

109
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,370
(The guest singer makes a grand finale.)

110
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,200
(DONGHAE is out three times in a row.)

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
He keeps getting it wrong like a fool.

112
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,740
Why do I keep getting
the same thing wrong?

113
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,240
But I got up in the previous round.

114
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,710
No, you were wrong.

115
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,640
- Was I sitting down?
- Yes, you were.

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,650
DONGHAE.

117
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,450
Why is he here?

118
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,090
He doesn't even talk much,
and he's bad at games.

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,660
I thought he'd be bad,

120
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,390
but he was surprisingly even worse
than I thought in the game.

121
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,360
He's dumb and clumsy.

122
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,660
(They have different opinions
from KYUHYUN.)

123
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't really like games like that.

124
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,970
I have no experience, either.

125
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,510
(Will he do a good job in the next game?)

126
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,840
This time, let's play a game...

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
- Great.
- that requires physical ability.

128
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,250
How about we play Flicking Stone Game?

129
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,280
Isn't LEETEUK good at commentating
on these kinds of games?

130
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,020
(A specialist in old-school things)

131
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,420
(Right up their alley)

132
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,790
Is there a prize?

133
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,220
(The winner gets a special gift
from the production team.)

134
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,190
(I want that.)

135
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,190
(Flicking Stone Game match-up chart)

136
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,690
(SHINDONG, RYEOWOOK / HEECHUL, EUNHYUK
/ LEETEUK, KYUHYUN / DONGHAE gets a bye)

137
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,000
(First match, KYUHYUN vs. LEETEUK)

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,870
Alright, please wait a moment.

139
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,400
EUNHYUK, did you bring something?

140
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,970
- What?
- It seems he prepared something.

141
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,740
(EUNHYUK brought a suitcase.)

142
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,280
(Interested)

143
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,080
(What's inside the suitcase?)

144
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,650
(EUNHYUK packed his suitcase full
of snacks.)

145
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,050
(Will EUNHYUK's snack flirting work?)

146
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,350
Seriously?

147
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,950
For real.

148
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,190
He's such a generous person.

149
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,820
He took out the snacks,
and all of them were delicious ones.

150
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,260
He prepared all that.

151
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,630
(EUNHYUK is the only one who prepared
gifts in advance for the others)

152
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,030
From that moment on,

153
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,930
I think I started...

154
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,570
feeling drawn to EUNHYUK.

155
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,830
Once you eat them,

156
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,970
they might not mean anything.

157
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,340
But just the fact
that he brought those snacks...

158
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,810
was really sweet.

159
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,470
He stopped by a convenience store,

160
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,110
bought them, packed them,
and carried them all the way here.

161
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,910
That's so thoughtful of him.

162
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,120
EUNHYUK definitely has good taste.

163
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,750
He brought a whole bunch of snacks,

164
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,920
and kept making sure everyone knew
he prepared them.

165
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,230
(I love raw ramen.)

166
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,360
You like raw ramen, right?

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
(The snack flirting was a success.)

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,660
(DONGHAE prefers snacks over
the guy he chose to hug from the back.)

169
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,900
(Warm and friendly atmosphere)

170
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,130
Garlic bread is great.

171
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,240
(RYEOWOOK is bothered by the two.)

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,940
There wasn't a single snack I liked.

173
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,210
So I didn't eat any.

174
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,210
It was the worst.

175
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,250
(Finally, the first round begins.)

176
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,920
(KYUNHYUN 38-level, LEETEUK 43-level)

177
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,950
Here they go.

178
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,790
(KYUHYUN takes the first move.)

179
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,990
Here I go.

180
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,020
Goodbye.

181
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,160
(KYUHYUN's piece knocks
LEETEUK's piece out.)

182
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,270
(Both are out.)

183
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,630
- That's Nongae's strategy.
- You're smart.

184
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,270
I know Nongae.

185
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,940
(LEETEUK's counterattack follows.)

186
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,910
I think he'll do well.

187
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,210
(Gentle push)

188
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,710
(That was weak.)

189
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,640
Looks like he lost his strength
in his hands.

190
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,610
(And in the following turns,)

191
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,510
(a weak attack by the 43-level)

192
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,680
Hit it harder.

193
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,150
What are you doing?

194
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,050
(What was that?)

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,390
(A series of mistakes)

196
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,690
(Embarrassed)

197
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,190
Are you not in the mood for a game?

198
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,530
I'm doing my best.

199
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,690
(Can he recover from his mistakes?)

200
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,030
(Now they both have one piece left.)

201
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,160
He was being smart.

202
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,700
(Bring it on.)

203
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,570
(Will he make it in this last chance?)

204
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,370
(Giving up?)

205
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,510
(LEETEUK's action is baffling.)

206
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,170
What was that?

207
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,380
Why did you even join
if you're going to play like this?

208
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,610
Wasn't that just a cheap move?

209
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,750
You should drink shrubby sophora tea
for that.

210
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,750
Is there shrubby sophora tea?
He's rude.

211
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,390
- What was that?
- Shrubby sophora tea.

212
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,920
I lost on purpose, actually.

213
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,290
I wanted KYUHYUN to win.

214
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,390
(It was his way of expressing feelings
for KYUHYUN he voted for.)

215
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,200
LEETEUK was really disappointing.

216
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,060
He was playing,

217
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,700
and when things didn't go his way,

218
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,970
he just threw the game away.

219
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,570
That's a classic loser's mindset.

220
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,010
(Leaving behind unspoken feelings)

221
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,540
I'll show you
what real Flicking Stone Game is.

222
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,340
(Second preliminary round,
HEECHUL vs. EUNHYUK)

223
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,240
- Let's do this.
- This will make a pleasant memory.

224
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,310
- So let's take a picture together.
- Will this become a memory?

225
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,250
(HEECHUL unexpectedly flirts again.)

226
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,980
(Glance)

227
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,250
(HEECHUL, the relentless flirting bomber,
keeps pushing forward.)

228
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,160
(Will EUNHYUK change his mind?)

229
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,730
Is he always like that?

230
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,230
Or is that...

231
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,960
some kind of flirting? I'm not sure.

232
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm sorry, but I wish he wouldn't do that.

233
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,170
He's not my type.

234
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,540
(Unaware of EUNHYUK's feelings,
HEECHUL takes the first move.)

235
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,070
(Loosening his fingers)

236
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,310
(Shoot)

237
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,080
(HEECHUL shoots his bullet of love.)

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,110
This is hard.

239
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,750
What was that?

240
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,950
(He's cute.)

241
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,480
You guys really haven't played
this game before.

242
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,580
- It's hard.
- You have to hit it from below.

243
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,750
It's hard. Try it.

244
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,790
You need to hit it as close as possible...

245
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,790
to make it go in a straight line.
This is too spicy.

246
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,390
(Dumbfounded)

247
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,860
(EUNHYUK was dumbfounded
and just wasted his chance.)

248
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,130
But it did go in a straight line.

249
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,960
I told you.

250
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,570
It went in the right direction, right?

251
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,700
Yes, it did.

252
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,170
(Both players have two pieces left.)

253
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,140
Now's when the real game starts.

254
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
I made it go in the right direction.

255
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,370
This is hard.

256
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,410
(HEECHUL's attack)

257
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,010
(HEECHUL's piece right on the edge)

258
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,710
(It seems this is actually hard.)

259
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,110
I'm really going for it now.

260
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,180
(Will he finally show his skills?)

261
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,150
Sorry.

262
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,350
(Slip)

263
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,290
What was that?
Did he hit it?

264
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,520
Did it even hit?

265
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,990
We call that a miss. It was a little off.

266
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,060
(HEECHUL's chance again)

267
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,230
(The first time seeing him serious)

268
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,430
(Own goal)

269
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
(The game ends so easily.)

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,240
I won.

271
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,810
I won.

272
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,840
(EUNHYUK advances to the semifinals
by pure luck.)

273
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,010
- This is ridiculous.
- I won.

274
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,950
I wanted EUNHYUK to spread his wings.

275
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,650
I wanted to play the role...

276
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,250
of a kingmaker.

277
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,620
(Q. HEECHUL said he lost on purpose.)

278
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,320
That's exactly the kind of stuff...

279
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
that makes me uncomfortable.

280
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,660
(Leaving behind tangled emotions)

281
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,760
(Final preliminary round,
SHINDONG vs. RYEOWOOK)

282
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,500
(SHINDONG takes the first move.)

283
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,100
(A tricky strategy of sneaking into
the enemy territory)

284
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,600
(DONGHAE, pretending not to care,
casually flirts.)

285
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,470
(Bothered)

286
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,970
(The battle between SHINDONG
and RYEOWOOK continues.)

287
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,340
The café owner versus...

288
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,580
(Surprisingly stable skills from RYEOWOOK)

289
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,910
(A clean and successful finish)

290
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,320
Why is he good?

291
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
He's good.

292
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,980
I'm good at this.

293
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,190
(A match that feels like the finals)

294
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,590
(That was close.)

295
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,090
SHINDONG, you lack power.

296
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,560
Eat this before you play.

297
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
(He likes it.)
- What's this?
- It tastes good, right?

298
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,870
Yes.

299
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,170
(Glance)

300
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,140
(HEECHUL also feeds EUNHYUK.)

301
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,070
It tastes good, right?

302
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,600
They're good.

303
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,410
(A slightly weak attack)

304
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,810
(SHINDONG gets a chance to tie the score.)

305
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,650
(He knocks out RYEOWOOK's piece
and ties the game.)

306
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,880
(RYEOWOOK makes a mistake
and is down to one piece.)

307
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,250
Thank you.

308
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,690
(Will he end the game?)

309
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,090
(Nervous)

310
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,360
The last one.

311
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,420
The last one.

312
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,960
(A clean final strike)

313
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,460
(SHINDONG advances to the semifinals.)

314
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,600
(Sad)

315
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,970
- I made it, right?
- You're really good.

316
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,640
You're so good at this.

317
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,140
The more you give,

318
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,140
the more you win people's hearts.

319
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,840
That's why I kept giving food to SHINDONG.

320
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,220
I hope that made an impression.

321
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,080
My feelings for EUNHYUK...

322
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,650
grew a bit.

323
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,290
At first,
I considered things like looks...

324
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,390
and financial status.

325
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,690
But gradually, I started considering
people who click with me...

326
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,030
people whom I can have
a good conversation with,

327
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,500
and people who like me more.

328
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,530
(Semifinal round one
KYUHYUN vs. DONGHAE)

329
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,570
You have to make this commentary exciting
from now on.

330
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,000
You're asking for fun commentary
only during your own game.

331
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,340
Isn't that too selfish?

332
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,640
(He's serious about the game
rather than his partner.)

333
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,380
Why did he even come here?

334
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,440
He has bad manners.

335
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,050
He's still wearing that scarf.

336
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,580
Even though it's boiling hot,
he's wearing a coat.

337
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,050
He thinks he's a star celebrity.

338
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,120
(HEECHUL's heart drifts away once more.)

339
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm going all-in.

340
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,860
(A bold strategy unlike his frail body)

341
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,660
DONGHAE's Crane Wing formation.

342
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,800
That's not a Crane Wing formation.

343
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,930
That's the only strategy I know.

344
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,800
(LEETEUK,
the not-so-professional commentator)

345
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,340
Didn't DONGHAE say
he used to play handball?

346
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,940
Did he play sports when he was young?

347
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
What was that?

348
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,670
(He was focused,)

349
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,140
(and accidentally touched
his opponent's piece.)

350
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,010
Did he play sports when he was young?

351
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,140
(What?)

352
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,610
(Wait a minute.)

353
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,280
Your turn is over.

354
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,720
(The room got noisy.)

355
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,890
(The Super Solos show no mercy
even for their partners.)

356
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,220
Come on.

357
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,190
Come on.

358
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,290
(What?)

359
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,230
Did you just get mad?

360
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,260
No. Sorry.

361
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,230
(DONGHAE immediately backs down.)

362
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,400
Technically, that's a disqualification.

363
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,830
But we'll let it slide
and just pass your turn.

364
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,570
(Hot-tempered DONGHAE)

365
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,500
He can be intense.

366
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,340
Yes, he's got quite a temper.

367
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,110
He's not my type.

368
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,680
(RYEOWOOK is very clear
about his preferences.)

369
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,280
(Q. What did you think
about RYEOWOOK's comment?)

370
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,380
I was completely turned off.

371
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,350
How can someone talk like that
in front of a person they just met?

372
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,220
Is he just plain rude?

373
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,390
(Failed to be immersed)

374
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,460
(In Super Solo World,
every action is scrutinized.)

375
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,330
But when are you taking off that coat?

376
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,800
(Great)

377
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,970
(Teamwork)

378
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,440
(KYUHYUN takes advantage of the chaos
to attack.)

379
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,710
(KYUHYUN's performance is
disappointingly underwhelming.)

380
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,870
But I heard he was good at games.

381
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,640
I should just hit this piece hard
and make it shoot out.

382
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,150
(Shoot)

383
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,920
(He shot it out.)

384
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,650
He meant that.

385
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,390
He keeps his word.

386
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,160
DONGHAE is cute and clumsy.

387
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,230
(KYUHYUN's attack next)

388
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,760
- Okay.
- This is hard.

389
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,160
(Slip)

390
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,670
(The Super Solos are disappointed
by the unexpectedly low-level match.)

391
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,230
This match is kind of boring.

392
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,040
Wait.

393
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,310
(Both end up scoring own goals
in the next round.)

394
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,610
(A semifinal match
worse than the preliminaries)

395
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,110
He was given a bye and...

396
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,980
Is it over?

397
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,680
(It's 2-to-1 so soon.)

398
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,380
I'll finish this in one move.

399
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,480
Okay.

400
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,580
Like a man.

401
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,480
- Are you a man?
- Are you a man?

402
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,050
Let me show you who I am.

403
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,890
You're KYUHYUN.

404
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,520
Let me show you who I am.

405
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,560
You're KYUHYUN.

406
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,360
(Powerful)

407
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,060
(This is the Nongae Strategy.)

408
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
That was cool.

409
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,330
(KYUHYUN advances to the finals.)

410
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,030
DONGHAE is out.

411
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,070
Good job.

412
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,900
But I heard DONGHAE was really good.

413
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,710
(Semifinals begin
with each player having four pieces.)

414
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,640
(Semifinal round two,
SHINDONG vs. EUNHYUK)

415
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
- Wait.
- Why?

416
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,180
These are too close together.

417
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,110
(Spreading)

418
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
(But this is my precious strategy.)

419
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,150
(HEECHUL butted in and got scolded.)

420
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,790
- It's his strategy.
- It's my strategy.

421
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,150
United we stand, divided we fall.

422
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,160
Yes.

423
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,560
(We'll also unite...)

424
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,130
(and part again.)

425
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,260
They're united and they'll fall together.

426
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,130
United you die together.

427
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,500
(Will that happen?)

428
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,670
(Successfully pushing away
the clustered piece)

429
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,670
- As expected, he's good.
- Why is he so good at this?

430
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,510
(Let's see.)

431
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,910
(Eat this and stay strong, EUNHYUK.)

432
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,310
This is really good.

433
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,150
- It's delicious.
- I know, right?

434
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,950
Thank you.

435
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,810
(Is LEETEUK expressing his feelings
for EUNHYUK?)

436
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,850
EUNHYUK just looked so pitiful.

437
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,020
He doesn't seem to eat well.

438
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,090
(LEETEUK was concerned
about frail-looking EUNHYUK.)

439
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,220
Here I go.

440
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,420
(EUNHYUK powered up by the snack)

441
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,230
(Pieces positioned for an easy fall)

442
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,230
(Making more snacks)

443
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,770
(A wildcat eyeing the food)

444
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,680
(RYEOWOOK casually feeds SHINDONG.)

445
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,280
(How is it?)

446
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,210
- This is really good.
- I know, right?

447
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,650
I bought it.

448
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,620
RYEOWOOK is different.

449
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,020
He doesn't say anything.

450
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,260
He just puts the food into your mouth.

451
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,890
That kind of thing is...

452
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,190
really attractive.

453
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,460
I have to choose between two people,

454
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,060
RYEOWOOK and EUNHYUK.

455
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,830
Good luck.

456
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,570
(SHINDONG's attack)

457
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,640
(He knocked out EUNHYUK's piece...)

458
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,940
(and also lost his own.)

459
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
(Current score, remaining pieces 3-to-2)

460
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,210
Still, you did well.

461
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,480
If you make it to the finals, you win.

462
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,650
(Who will make it to the finals?)

463
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,280
Don't use too much force.

464
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,690
(Too much force)

465
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,120
You're so bad at this.

466
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,690
EUNHYUK.

467
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,530
EUNHYUK.

468
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,760
Are you going easy on me?

469
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,330
No, I'm trying my best.

470
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,870
SHINDONG is swayed.

471
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,740
I was really nervous.

472
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,010
For the first time,

473
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,640
we were sitting face to face.

474
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,510
I was so nervous
that I couldn't play properly.

475
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,410
Then...

476
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,210
sorry.

477
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,350
(No worries)

478
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,580
He's good.

479
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,090
He's good.

480
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,220
- I don't think I can beat him.
- SHINDONG is really good.

481
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,120
(SHINDONG advances to the finals.)

482
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,230
Now we have KYUHYUN who admires
Bae Yong Joon from "Winter Sonata"...

483
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,430
and SHINDONG who's a fan of Baek Il Seop.

484
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,300
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

485
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,500
Rock, paper, scissors.

486
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,070
(But they keep choosing the same move.)

487
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,800
(Rock-paper-scissors never ends.)

488
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,140
Wait, is this fate?

489
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,210
You two...

490
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,180
(What was that?)

491
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,340
Six times in a row?

492
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,080
If it happens again, we're meant to be.

493
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,480
We're meant to be.

494
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,880
(What is their fate?)

495
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,850
Rock, paper, scissors.

496
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,950
(Another tie)

497
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,620
(Unbelievable)

498
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,220
Now kiss.

499
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,660
Sorry, but I ate spicy chicken noodles.

500
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,890
(Another round)

501
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,500
They planned this.

502
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,600
(Just admit you planned it.)

503
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,200
(Sigh)

504
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,300
I really hate things like that.

505
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,070
I was displeased.

506
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,470
Rock, paper, scissors.

507
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,380
(The match is finally decided
with SHINDONG's win.)

508
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,480
I'll go second.

509
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,410
Wait. What's going on between you two?

510
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,750
SHINDONG.

511
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,650
(Look at them.)

512
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,520
I'm a fatalist.

513
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,790
When we made the same move
six or eight times in a row,

514
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,290
"Is this fate decided by God?"

515
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,030
I was wondering.

516
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,590
I was a little shaken.

517
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,660
You know,

518
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,100
if two people are too similar, they fight.

519
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,970
If tastes match too well, it's not good.

520
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,170
(The two experienced the same thing
but felt differently.)

521
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,240
(A final round with mixed emotions)

522
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,740
(KYUHYUN takes the first move.)

523
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,780
(Here I go.)

524
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,410
(KYUHYUN's piece is
between SHINDONG's pieces.)

525
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,380
Wait, they're too clustered.

526
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,580
Nice.

527
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,820
(Satisfied)

528
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,450
I'm an ethics teacher,

529
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,190
and we call this "If you lie down
with dogs, you get up with fleas."

530
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,720
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

531
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,220
If you get close to bad thing,
you are imbued with it.

532
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,490
That's what it means.

533
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,130
(He likes that because it sounds cool.)

534
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,630
(Next is SHINDONG's attack.)

535
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,560
- First, I'll...
- Push that one out.

536
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,430
(But SHINDONG's piece moves
into KYUHYUN's pieces instead.)

537
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,500
This got really complicated.

538
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,570
What if I use this one to knock out two?

539
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,170
- A double hit.
- A double hit.

540
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,810
Or you could push
that white piece on the right...

541
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,410
with your black piece, and it'll fly out.

542
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,580
- Will it?
- Yes.

543
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,110
- Will that work?
- Yes.

544
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,320
It's a technique.

545
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,550
(Amazing success)

546
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,690
(That actually worked?)

547
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,330
KYUHYUN shows off a great technique.

548
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,260
The referee is too biased.

549
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,360
Sorry.

550
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,330
(Will SHINDONG overcome this crisis?)

551
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,200
(Out)

552
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,870
(The scale of victory tips
towards KYUHYUN.)

553
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,170
Will Player SHINDONG lose?

554
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,210
Wait.

555
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,480
(Recharging energy)

556
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,010
I'm energized.

557
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,180
(Current score, remaining stones 3-to-5)

558
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,410
How did this happen?

559
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,450
(Will KYUHYUN secure the win here?)

560
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,190
(That was close.)

561
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,490
There.

562
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,830
(Current score, 3-to-4
The match isn't over yet.)

563
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,730
I'll lightly advance into enemy territory.

564
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,470
SHINDONG is at a one-point disadvantage.

565
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,200
(Both pieces fall at once.)

566
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,140
(Sacrificing one and gaining another)

567
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,540
The Nongae strategy.

568
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,210
(Current score, remaining pieces 2-to-3)

569
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,510
If you pull off a double hit here,
you get three points.

570
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,810
(With one piece left,
SHINDONG is at a severe disadvantage.)

571
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,120
Is he heading towards self-destruction?

572
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,990
Will I be in the first place?

573
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,060
(Will KYUHYUN claim victory like this?)

574
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,590
(Do your job, hand.)

575
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,600
(Good direction,
but slightly weak in power)

576
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,200
(Relieved)

577
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,740
(Will SHINDONG convert
this great opportunity?)

578
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,780
(Own goal)

579
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,080
The final winner is KYUHYUN.

580
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,450
I can't believe I won.

581
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,850
- What's the prize?
- KYUHYUN.

582
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,220
(A prize for the winner)

583
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,120
- What is it?
- What is it?

584
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,530
(Super excited)

585
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,730
(What did the production team prepare?)

586
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,260
- A muffler?
- A scarf?

587
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,460
A couple's scarf.

588
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,200
(Scarf)

589
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,130
What's this?

590
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,670
(Couple's scarf and couple's hand warmer)

591
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,070
(I see.)

592
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,970
(Finally, a pair of couple's gloves)

593
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,910
I'm relieved.

594
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,150
KYUHYUN, you don't seem too happy.

595
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,650
- Please show some reaction.
- I needed this.

596
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:27,090
(Three couple's items
to keep the cold away)

597
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,620
(Who will be the Super Solo
to share warmth with KYUHYUN?)

598
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,520
What's your travel style?

599
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,590
I like hotel vacations.

600
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,930
At hotels.

601
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,560
I like staying inside the hotel.

602
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,230
I don't really enjoy walking around.

603
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,100
What about you?

604
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,930
I can meet my partner's expectations.

605
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,200
I like everything.

606
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,740
- Do you drink?
- I don't drink.

607
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,770
We really don't match.

608
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,040
Have some water.

609
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,440
The clueless man is here.

610
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,180
Sorry.

611
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,710
Were you drinking?

612
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,850
(Why is there alcohol?)

613
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,150
(HEECHUL brought alcohol
to share with his partner.)

614
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,490
- Are you a drinker?
- I can't drink at all.

615
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,060
(HEECHUL is having trouble matching
with anyone today.)

616
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,090
HEECHUL.

617
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,390
Is it okay for an ethics teacher
to drink like that?

618
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,330
- Well, I...
- Be honest. What were you like before?

619
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,830
Your whole life is a lie, isn't it?

620
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,670
What are you saying?

621
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,070
I've never told a lie in my life.

622
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,570
You said earlier that you don't swear,
but you swear a lot.

623
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,970
What's the zodiac sign
for people born in 2004?

624
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,110
- People born in 2004?
- Yes.

625
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,880
The Year of Lucky Vicky.

626
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,840
What's your date of birth?

627
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
- My birth date?
- Yes.

628
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,480
December 25, 2004. I'm a Christmas baby.

629
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,720
Your eyes are full of lies.

630
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,050
- I was born at 6 p.m.
- At 6 p.m.

631
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,260
His whole existence seems fake.

632
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,930
It's like this.

633
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,660
You meet someone and have a chat today,

634
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,360
and you say "Let's meet again tomorrow."

635
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
But that person is gone.

636
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,400
Does he even have an identification card?

637
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,770
I don't think he does.

638
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,940
But it's kind of annoying here.

639
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,140
It feels like there are only liars here.

640
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,040
You should at least try to lie.

641
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,450
(Super Solos are willing to lie
to show off their charms.)

642
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,350
What's the name of your gym?

643
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,450
Let me think for a moment.

644
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,120
(He's pressured and leaves.)

645
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,590
You're leaving
because you don't know what to say, right?

646
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,520
Excuse me, but I'm leaving.

647
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,590
What?

648
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,490
(A rash decision due to pressure)

649
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,730
(Let's just talk among ourselves.)

650
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,930
Why is he here again?

651
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,860
(Taking something)

652
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,100
Noodles.

653
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,470
He likes noodles.

654
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,300
(Unbelievable)

655
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,900
(I ate ramen because I was sad.)

656
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,140
(KYUHYUN is out after an interview.)

657
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,380
KYUHYUN, are you done with your interview?

658
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes.

659
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,380
DONGHAE.

660
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,980
(Yes?)

661
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,620
You're cute.

662
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
(Cautiously expressing his feelings)

663
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,650
(DONGHAE is flustered
at the unexpected expression.)

664
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,820
(Shy)

665
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
You're cute, DONGHAE.

666
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,420
- But I'm not in a good mood.
- Why?

667
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,330
Everyone seems to be lying.

668
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,830
(Leave them to me.)

669
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,400
That's enough.
What do you think you guys are doing?

670
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,730
I think he has no manners.

671
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,030
He's practicing his line.

672
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,300
Is that practice?

673
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,470
(Practicing like it's the real thing)

674
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,270
What is he pretending to be like?

675
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,870
(Rummaging)

676
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,640
(KYUHYUN suddenly takes out
the couple's scarf.)

677
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,910
That.

678
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,110
I want that.

679
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,446
(Interested)

680
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,082
(Who will he give it to?)

681
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,083
Flirting?

682
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,818
(It's EUNHYUK.)

683
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,520
- Wait a minute.
- I'm going to take it.

684
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,688
Wait a minute.

685
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,190
(Everyone is shocked
by his unexpected choice.)

686
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,960
How did you know I like blue?

687
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,895
Blue is my favorite color.

688
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,464
Was that a line from a movie or something?

689
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,801
It must be a line
from "The Man Who Laughs."

690
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,270
(KYUHYUN also takes out
the couple's gloves.)

691
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,139
(Is he giving them to EUNHYUK again?)

692
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,641
(The unexpected owner
of the gloves is DONGHAE.)

693
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,309
Is he a two-timer or what?

694
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,711
(Dumbfounded)

695
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,779
- It's to keep you from eating ramen.
- But I was about to eat it, KYUHYUN.

696
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,681
Because it's too hot?

697
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,350
I get it now. How considerate.

698
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,818
Aren't those basically handcuffs?

699
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,453
(This is basically
telling him not to eat ramen.)

700
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,488
(Then I'll take it.)

701
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,223
(Lost all his ramen.
It's like a daylight robbery!)

702
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,791
It looks delicious.

703
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,061
Wait a minute.
Are you stringing everyone along or what?

704
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,930
(His intentions are unclear.)

705
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,399
(Just then, SHINDONG walks in.)

706
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,067
Come here.

707
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,103
(EUNHYUK takes care
of his first choice, SHINDONG.)

708
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,374
(KYUHYUN approaches SHINDONG.)

709
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,708
(Confused)

710
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,846
Why don't I get any?!

711
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,082
(Punishing the playboy.)

712
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,918
(KYUHYUN's unpredictable feelings)

713
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,088
EUNHYUK, SHINDONG, and DONGHAE.

714
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,656
EUNHYUK's meticulousness,

715
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,892
DONGHAE's cute and clumsiness,

716
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,961
and SHINDONG's...

717
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,562
fateful moments with me.

718
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,399
(Three men captured KYUHYUN's interest.)

719
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,635
(The sky darkens
as they focus on finding a partner.)

720
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,638
(But a meal first, then partner finding.)

721
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,409
Now, it's time to choose a meal partner.

722
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,210
(Hungry baby birds)

723
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,413
HEECHUL will choose first.

724
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,380
Wait.

725
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,349
Wait.

726
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,385
If all six people come,

727
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,287
do I have to choose among them again?

728
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,623
(Is he the imaginative type?
Coming up with unnecessary ideas.)

729
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,425
The first person to go out is...

730
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,994
usually the most popular one.

731
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,328
They get seated first.

732
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,864
But I'm worried
because I'm bad at rejecting people.

733
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,169
(Will HEECHUL have a reason
to reject someone?)

734
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,204
I'm HEECHUL.

735
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,139
Who wants to eat with me?

736
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,341
(Come and eat with me.)

737
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,844
(Who does HEECHUL want to eat with?)

738
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,412
(EUNHYUK whose name just makes him laugh.)

739
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,381
(HEECHUL had his eye
on kind-hearted EUNHYUK.)

740
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,715
He knows how to give.

741
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,454
(HEECHUL expressed his feelings
consistently throughout the games.)

742
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,189
While having a meal,

743
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,357
I want to get to know him better
and become closer.

744
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,359
So, with EUNHYUK,

745
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,694
I'd like to have a drink.

746
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,931
(Will EUNHYUK he hopes for step forward?)

747
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,133
(Full of anticipation.)

748
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,568
Go ahead, everyone.

749
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,936
Feel free and go ahead.

750
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,738
(But the Super Solos don't budge an inch.)

751
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,109
(They are all doubting
HEECHUL's sincerity.)

752
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,677
He's not that sincere.

753
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,678
He's not sincere at all.

754
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,581
(Hoping it’s not zero votes.)

755
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,882
- Shall we count together?
- Yes.

756
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:03,255
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- To have a drink together,

757
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,057
(Nobody stepped forward.)

758
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,125
Seriously?

759
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,994
(EUNHYUK didn't step forward.)

760
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,462
But you never know yet.

761
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,730
You can choose someone yourself.

762
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,298
- Really?
- Yes, so just wait.

763
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,833
You can choose someone yourself.

764
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,803
Is this a hidden camera prank?

765
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,138
Is this all staged?

766
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,839
Try being in that situation yourselves.

767
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,774
You'd naturally start swearing.

768
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,843
Next, EUNHYUK.

769
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,677
Please take a seat.

770
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,646
(Next is EUNHYUK,
whom HEECHUL really wanted.)

771
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,581
That scarf looks really warm.

772
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,917
I'm so nervous.

773
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,919
(Shy)

774
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,887
What's that?

775
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:37,589
(EUNHYUK sends a signal to someone.)

776
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,857
Is he flirting?

777
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,927
(Who is he signaling to?)

778
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:42,961
SHINDONG.

779
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,665
(After hugging him from the back,
he remained by SHINDONG's side.)

780
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,334
I think we both felt the sincerity.

781
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:54,306
(His feelings toward SHINDONG
keep growing stronger.)

782
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,809
But now that this has happened,

783
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,379
I do care about him now.

784
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,347
KYUHYUN.

785
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,685
He wrapped the scarf around my neck
like he was hugging me.

786
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,522
KYUHYUN keeps lingering...

787
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,523
in my mind.

788
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,260
(Who will have dinner with EUNHYUK?)

789
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,162
I think he'll also end up eating alone.

790
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,264
I'm...

791
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,800
EUNHYUK.

792
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,905
Who wants to eat with me?

793
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,540
(Thinking deeply.)

794
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,509
Wait a minute, everyone.

795
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,543
If I become partners...

796
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,678
with someone who didn't pick me...

797
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,979
- What?
- What?

798
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,815
(The man in the scarf,
KYUHYUN, moves out.)

799
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,418
(No, he's my partner.)

800
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,086
What? Both of them?

801
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,422
(My gosh.)

802
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,591
(U-turn)

803
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,725
No, he didn't go.

804
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,893
He has to choose.

805
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,027
(KYUHYUN turns back again.)

806
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,530
So it's HEECHUL...

807
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,098
- Wait a minute.
- No.

808
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,466
(This isn't what I wanted.)

809
00:28:55,934 --> 00:29:00,405
I'm not used to fighting over someone.

810
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,840
So I decided to give up.

811
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,110
(A man whose heart sways like reeds.)

812
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,946
- It's over.
- I don't like guys who aren't popular.

813
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,147
(He suddenly became an unpopular guy.)

814
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,251
Five, four, three...

815
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,218
Is this really happening?

816
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,289
(Is SHINDONG also giving up?)

817
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,590
Is this really happening?

818
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,958
(He moves.)

819
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,993
Is this really happening?

820
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,861
(SHINDONG sets off.)

821
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,232
(Relieved)

822
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,234
There isn't enough room.
No, it's just right.

823
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,571
(Luckily, SHINDONG manages to sit.)

824
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,806
I'd like to eat with EUNHYUK.

825
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,343
RYEOWOOK seems
like the type who adjusts to me.

826
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:42,214
EUNHYUK feels
like he leads with what he wants.

827
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,549
What? Is that even allowed?

828
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,318
What?

829
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,552
(RYEOWOOK moves toward EUNHYUK.)

830
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,620
Move over a bit.

831
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,258
(The seats next to EUNHYUK fill up
in an instant.)

832
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,495
(With three votes, EUNHYUK becomes
the popular guy in Super Solo World.)

833
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,431
(What is RYEOWOOK's true feelings?)

834
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:00,732
I was a little upset.

835
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,969
EUNHYUK and SHINDONG were sitting
too close together.

836
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,938
(From the back hug choice,)

837
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,474
(his rivalry with EUNHYUK has continued.)

838
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,811
(Watching their deepening friendship,)

839
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,281
(RYEOWOOK started to feel uneasy.)

840
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,619
I got the feeling
they might go all the way.

841
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,321
(Unwilling to lose SHINDONG,
RYEOWOOK had to step in.)

842
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,625
(Everyone had different motivations...)

843
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,629
(as they sat beside EUNHYUK.)

844
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,298
(Looking this way)

845
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,633
(Looking that way)

846
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,369
(Just feeling so good.)

847
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,438
- But...
- It's definitely not HEECHUL.

848
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,272
Why not?

849
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,075
You're also thinking
you came to the wrong place, right?

850
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,110
(Indignant)

851
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,379
If HEECHUL gets rejected here,
that would be his second time.

852
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,580
Why would you say that?

853
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,615
(Things are getting interesting.)

854
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,185
- He made up his mind.
- Yes.

855
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,186
What?

856
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,289
(Is it me?)

857
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,057
(Goodness, EUNHYUK)

858
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,059
Please go back to your original seat.

859
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,461
Wait, time out.

860
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,995
Can I leave first?

861
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,430
He's out.

862
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,365
HEECHUL, come here.

863
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,833
Look.

864
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,568
You got rejected by all six of us,

865
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,837
and just now again,
so seven rejections total.

866
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,172
I'll make my choice now.

867
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,776
The person
I'll be having dinner with today is...

868
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,179
SHINDONG. Let's eat together.

869
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,281
(SHINDONG)

870
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,918
(The first dinner partners are set.)

871
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,520
Are they off to eat now?

872
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,689
(He's unwilling to move.)

873
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,491
I couldn't look at RYEOWOOK.

874
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,326
I couldn't face him.

875
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,962
It didn't seem
like RYEOWOOK had chosen EUNHYUK,

876
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,563
but like he'd chosen to sit next to me.

877
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,534
Next, RYEOWOOK, please take a seat.

878
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,306
(SHINDONG already chose EUNHYUK.)

879
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,075
I'm RYEOWOOK.

880
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,743
Who wants to eat with me?

881
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,145
This is too sad.

882
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,346
He looks so pitiful.

883
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,747
Why does he suddenly look miserable?

884
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,316
HEECHUL, come on.

885
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,252
I'm thinking.

886
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,186
Let's count.

887
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,554
(Will he find someone else?)

888
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:03,989
If there's competition, I'll go.

889
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,360
(LEETEUK sets off.)

890
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,462
I want to eat with RYEOWOOK.

891
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:13,231
Because I could feel...

892
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,369
a weird aura around him
like I shouldn't get too close.

893
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,706
(From the start, his mysterious presence
intrigued LEETEUK.)

894
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,442
It seemed like he was hiding something.

895
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:27,679
I want to get to know him more.

896
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:33,118
(LEETEUK moves forward
to get to know RYEOWOOK.)

897
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,087
(Competition addict HEECHUL joins in.)

898
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,291
(Two people fill the empty seats
next to RYEOWOOK.)

899
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,893
It seems he enjoys that.

900
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,163
(Did he choose HEECHUL?)

901
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,731
(Of course not)

902
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,668
- RYEOWOOK.
- Wait a minute.

903
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,670
HEECHUL got rejected for the eighth time.

904
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,905
(The second meal partners,
RYEOWOOK and LEETEUK.)

905
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,608
That was at least a relief.

906
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,311
It was better than eating alone.

907
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,014
It's a good chance
to get to know someone new.

908
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,117
Next, DONGHAE, please take a seat.

909
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,288
(Who will eat with DONGHAE?)

910
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,556
I'm DONGHAE.

911
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,591
I know.

912
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,493
(He couldn't help it.)

913
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,261
Who wants to eat with me?

914
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,963
Please say that in dialect.

915
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:18,797
No.

916
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,131
(Reaping what he sowed.)

917
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,500
How many times has he been rejected?

918
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,003
- Even his remark got rejected.
- HEECHUL got rejected nine times.

919
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,173
I think he's a fake Mokpo guy.

920
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,475
Four, three...

921
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,877
(KYUHYUN sets off.)

922
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,714
(And he also sets off.)

923
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,683
(It's just instinct now.)

924
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,285
Is he a ghost?

925
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,122
(Just go away.)

926
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,791
(Get lost, ghost!)

927
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,395
(A particularly clingy ghost)

928
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,931
DONGHAE, make your choice.

929
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,333
You're hugging me from behind, right?

930
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,203
It's cold.

931
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,706
(Is it his tenth rejection or not?)

932
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,910
I can hear footsteps coming my way.

933
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,211
I can hear them clearly.

934
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,716
(He turns into a stone in the streets.)

935
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,287
(DONGHAE and KYUHYUN
become meal partners.)

936
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,223
Stop joking, guys.

937
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,758
(HEECHUL is officially dining alone.)

938
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,626
(Nobody chose you.)

939
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,862
This feels
like some kind of huge conspiracy.

940
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,965
You know "The Truman Show"
starring Jim Carrey, right?

941
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,000
I think all of this is "The Truman Show."

942
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,537
My pride is hurt.

943
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,375
Thank you, RYEOWOOK.

944
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,677
- Yes.
- For choosing me.

945
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,046
It's nice to have a partner.

946
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,881
Let's toast before we eat.

947
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,318
Cheers. Nice to meet you.

948
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,789
(Will they get closer?)

949
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,856
It looks appetizing.

950
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,692
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

951
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,395
- You must've been hungry.
- I was starving.

952
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,901
But RYEOWOOK,
why did you really come here?

953
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,502
(Thinking)

954
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,704
I've been feeling lonely lately.

955
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,238
- Lonely?
- Yes.

956
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,707
But you don't look lonely at all.

957
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,976
(Flustered)

958
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,144
- To promote my café.
- To promote your café.

959
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,449
But I think that's also part
of life wisdom.

960
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,350
We've been here...

961
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,088
for eight or ten hours now, right?

962
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,025
What do you think?
Are you developing any feelings?

963
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:29,894
I think I am.

964
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,363
- Really?
- Yes.

965
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,499
But I'm not sure yet.

966
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,500
For whom?

967
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,403
(Flustered)

968
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,473
If you ask me like that, I...

969
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:47,579
But you said you liked SHINDONG.

970
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,347
- The 100kg guy?
- Yes.

971
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,483
Do you usually like that kind
of warm, big guy?

972
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,385
(Do you focus on the weight class?)

973
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,386
I like kind people.

974
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,755
But SHINDONG doesn't seem that kind.

975
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,626
Honestly, everyone here seems
pretty much the same.

976
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,029
You also seem like a kind person.

977
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,032
I'm not a kind person.

978
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,967
- Really?
- I'm a good person.

979
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,803
(I'm a good human.)

980
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,305
When you're told to be a kind person,

981
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:18,443
then you get trapped inside that frame.

982
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,478
He should've just eaten.

983
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,282
What was he even talking about?

984
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,551
That thought crossed my mind.

985
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,755
But I also wondered
"Is he interested in me?"

986
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,726
I want to be a good person
rather than just a kind one.

987
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,463
You look great.

988
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,898
You look great, too, RYEOWOOK.

989
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,567
Thank you.

990
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,369
(Staring)

991
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,303
Can I have one of these?

992
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,471
Sure.

993
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,839
But there's still some left on your plate.

994
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,107
I like the fatty parts.

995
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,975
Really? I don't like fat.

996
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,178
Should we switch? This one's lean meat.

997
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,212
Great.

998
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:55,980
I didn't know you liked this.

999
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,449
We seem like a good match.

1000
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,519
I prefer half of it to be fat.

1001
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,621
(Eating)

1002
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,756
It seems you don't watch your diet.

1003
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,559
It seems you don't watch your diet.

1004
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,664
What diet?

1005
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,165
I mean,

1006
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,067
most people avoid fat.

1007
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,569
(LEETEUK ruins the good vibe
in an instant.)

1008
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,938
(Annoyed)

1009
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,272
Did I offend you?

1010
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,273
No.

1011
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,079
Didn't you say you were a good person?

1012
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,447
I was concerned about your health.

1013
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,085
You like fat, but you don't eat much rice.

1014
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,253
Right.

1015
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,521
(Annoyed even more)

1016
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,491
(Silence)

1017
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,925
Are there other rooms here?

1018
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,594
Can I eat somewhere else?

1019
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,996
(Startled
by RYEOWOOK's solo dining request)

1020
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,631
- Why?
- Just.

1021
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,700
I need to use the restroom.

1022
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,571
(He suddenly gets up and leaves.)

1023
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,541
(Dumbfounded)

1024
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,677
- Why did you leave?
- I lost my appetite.

1025
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,549
What does he know?

1026
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,952
"Don't you watch your diet?"
That was so rude.

1027
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,454
It was offensive.

1028
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,522
I do watch my diet.

1029
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:15,326
It was uncomfortable
like eating with an elder.

1030
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,294
He's such a boomer.

1031
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,366
(Just thinking about LEETEUK
gives him chills.)

1032
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,568
I don't really get it.

1033
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,572
I just didn't want the meal
to be awkward with no conversation.

1034
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,908
So I was making small talk.

1035
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,510
I saw him only eating fat.

1036
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,615
So I made a concerned comment.

1037
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,851
I wanted to steer things
in a positive direction.

1038
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,053
(Their communication styles were
too different.)

1039
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,454
We didn't click.

1040
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,723
(HEECHUL eating his solo meal)

1041
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:46,991
I could overpower them with force.

1042
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,129
I like pig's feet.

1043
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,130
The rice is warm.

1044
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,965
(HEECHUL is in the same space
as EUNHYUK and SHINDONG.)

1045
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,067
This boiled pork is good.

1046
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,669
Yes, it is.

1047
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,871
(Let me in the conversation.)

1048
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,173
(Who's talking?)

1049
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,443
(It must be from the next room.)

1050
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,112
(Hmph)

1051
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,081
EUNHYUK, do you like boiled pork?

1052
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,216
I do.

1053
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:13,184
- I prefer boiled pork over pig's feet.
- Me, too.

1054
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,686
(My goodness)

1055
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,088
(Their food preferences are
a perfect match.)

1056
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,557
Producer, don't you have pig's feet?

1057
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,326
I like pig's feet.

1058
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,361
Nobody seems to click with him.

1059
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,332
I know, right? I noticed earlier
when he showed up...

1060
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,100
that he'd be eating a solo meal.

1061
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,802
But still, they gave him the same dish.

1062
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,470
It was supposed
to be black bean sauce noodles.

1063
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:34,639
What's this?

1064
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,941
(EUNHYUK is struggling to open
the sauce packet.)

1065
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,243
(He spots that.)

1066
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,177
EUNHYUK.

1067
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,645
EUNHYUK.

1068
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,847
You have to do it like this.

1069
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,583
I'm the type who needs a lot of help.

1070
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,719
I think it's nice to take care of someone.

1071
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,421
- You're so considerate.
- I prefer taking care of others.

1072
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,657
So I think we're a good match.

1073
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,459
Can I be honest with you, EUNHYUK?

1074
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,060
Yes, go ahead.

1075
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,730
I'm debating between two people.

1076
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,098
(Shocked)

1077
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,767
I wanted to talk with you, EUNHYUK.

1078
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,271
But...

1079
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,572
(Hesitating)

1080
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,275
If you're debating between two people,

1081
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:14,746
is it a fifty-fifty choice or...

1082
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,414
It's 51 to 49.

1083
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,316
So it's a close call.

1084
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,851
And to be more honest,

1085
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,219
you're 51 percent.

1086
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,157
(I've found my dopamine.)

1087
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,960
That's why I wanted to get
to know you better.

1088
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,696
I wanted to know
if we can be long-term partners.

1089
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,134
Before I chose my meal partner,

1090
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,436
it was also fifty-fifty for me.

1091
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,771
Half-and-half,
like spicy and fried chicken!

1092
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,807
(Big laugh)

1093
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,275
(It seems like there's a wall
between them.)

1094
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,611
To be honest,

1095
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,546
KYUHYUN was flirting with me earlier.

1096
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:52,583
So I thought maybe we should talk more
while eating.

1097
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,253
But he was kind of shy.

1098
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,722
So I decided...

1099
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,124
to choose you, SHINDONG.

1100
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,895
(Confessing with a nervous voice)

1101
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,864
This might be a bit overwhelming
to you, right?

1102
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,833
- I love it.
- Is it okay?

1103
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,671
I really want to go on a trip with you.

1104
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,807
If we could choose
a destination together...

1105
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:16,941
If we could choose?

1106
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,143
I've been thinking about Vietnam lately.

1107
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,712
Let's say the city name on three.
One, two, three.

1108
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:21,713
- Ho Chi Minh.
- Ho Chi Minh.

1109
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,850
There's a really good Korean restaurant
in Ho Chi Minh. Do you know?

1110
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,818
One, two, three.

1111
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,886
(EUNHYUK and SHINDONG match so well.)

1112
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:29,887
This is crazy.

1113
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,223
(My goodness)

1114
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,591
What do you like to drink?

1115
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,626
For drinks,

1116
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,627
whiskey.

1117
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,965
(Their travel and food preferences
are one and the same.)

1118
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,801
What do you like to pair with whiskey?

1119
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,570
I like to pair chocolate.

1120
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,637
(At this point, it's like one of them
did background research.)

1121
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,206
The brand name on three. One, two, three.

1122
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,041
(They're practically the same person.)

1123
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,242
My goodness.

1124
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,178
I found my meant-to-be.

1125
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,780
I found him.

1126
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,216
He's perfect as my partner.

1127
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,719
When I first saw SHINDONG,

1128
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,691
I thought he'd be totally different
from me starting with the build.

1129
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,659
I thought we'd be opposites.

1130
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,129
(But while talking,
they realized they matched.)

1131
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,297
I think we match really well.

1132
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,934
I was wondering if he was just lying...

1133
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,303
to please his friend.

1134
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,672
Was he saying those things
to match with me?

1135
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,809
I'm having second thoughts.

1136
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,913
(Someone who's been completely forgotten)

1137
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,649
(Flaring up)

1138
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,751
(Why do I feel a fierce stare?)

1139
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,159
I'm uncomfortable eating.

1140
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,629
(I'm even more uncomfortable.)

1141
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,464
Have you ever thought of learning golf?

1142
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,900
I want to learn from you, SHINDONG.

1143
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,935
Nice to meet you all.

1144
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,403
Shall we...

1145
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,039
(Too lonely and attempting to join them)

1146
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,240
have a drink?

1147
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,580
(The rice grain attack)

1148
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,849
(Shocked)

1149
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,485
(An even flashier entrance than expected)

1150
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:08,920
What are you doing?

1151
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,488
Did you come alone?

1152
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,590
My partner is right here.

1153
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,693
(Talking nonsense
because he's scared he'll become solo)

1154
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,296
We have a lot in common.

1155
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,098
I also go to Ho Chi Minh often.

1156
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,766
Do you like Ho Chi Minh?

1157
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,967
I thought you go to Da Nang more often.

1158
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,969
There's ** in Ho Chi Minh.

1159
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,238
Should we play the Unanimous Game again?

1160
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,674
I'd love to. That's fun.

1161
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:33,811
When you go to the karaoke room,
which artist's song do you sing first?

1162
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,647
One, two, three.

1163
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,182
- SUPER JUNIOR.
- Green Area.

1164
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,817
Obviously Green Area.

1165
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,185
Don't you sing SUPER JUNIOR's songs?

1166
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,921
(Dry throat.)

1167
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,094
(He keeps spitting out things.)

1168
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,097
(But I tried.)

1169
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,366
(I don't care anymore.)

1170
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,502
(Disgusted)

1171
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:02,273
(Please stop this person.)

1172
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,041
(Shaking his head)

1173
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,477
I don't want to hear that person's name.

1174
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,247
I hope he doesn't interfere
between us anymore.

1175
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,349
Shall we eat?

1176
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,417
(KYUHYUN and DONGHAE's meal)

1177
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,552
Do you like Korean food?

1178
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:15,953
I love Korean food.

1179
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,456
I've been watching you
for a while, DONGHAE.

1180
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,592
When we were playing games,

1181
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,194
(He's been watching since the game.)

1182
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:26,164
you kept making the same mistake.

1183
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,632
I thought that was cute.

1184
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,669
(DONGHAE is embarrassed
by KYUHYUN's bold flirting.)

1185
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,937
Didn't you feel my gaze?

1186
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,175
You're a sweet talker.

1187
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,310
You must be popular...

1188
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,445
- outside.
- I am.

1189
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,347
But I don't give my heart to just anyone.

1190
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:49,086
Earlier, with the scarf and gloves.

1191
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,722
If you had only one,

1192
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,924
only one,

1193
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,158
Then I would've given it to you, DONGHAE.

1194
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,627
(Does he mean it?)

1195
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,695
Isn't it obvious?

1196
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,400
I easily trust people.

1197
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,703
(But in this case...)

1198
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,938
But I won't trust so easily here.

1199
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,840
You said you're a musical actor, right?

1200
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,576
I can't trust actors.

1201
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,277
(DONGHAE doesn't easily trust him.)

1202
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,546
- Because they act.
- I'm not a good actor.

1203
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,317
(DONGHAE can't trust KYUHYUN.)

1204
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,018
(Thinking)

1205
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,620
I wonder what the others are doing.

1206
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,957
Honestly, I was really disappointed
with HEECHUL.

1207
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,825
He's a mood-maker.

1208
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,662
He tries to do things
nobody else does first.

1209
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:32,830
So I thought he was great.

1210
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,066
But everything he says seems like a lie.

1211
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,602
- It's all lies.
- He's like a scammer.

1212
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:39,937
When he's on television,

1213
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,038
his past will be revealed.

1214
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:46,410
(I can't believe him.)

1215
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,080
If he's an ethics teacher for real,

1216
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,183
Korea's system is messed up.

1217
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,517
What do you think about LEETEUK?

1218
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,321
I've seen a bit of good in LEETEUK.

1219
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,422
- Really?
- Yes.

1220
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,059
He gave me snacks and stuff.

1221
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,961
I think LEETEUK is the worst.

1222
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,699
Didn't you see him
playing games carelessly?

1223
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,934
I thought he was giving in.

1224
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,569
It wasn't giving in.

1225
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,371
He threw the piece like he was annoyed.

1226
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,972
- Really?
- Yes.

1227
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,209
I was behind him,
so I couldn't see his face.

1228
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,178
In those small moments,
you can see a person's true nature.

1229
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,147
(Evaluating character through gossip)

1230
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,949
What about RYEOWOOK?

1231
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:25,950
RYEOWOOK?

1232
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,185
(Spending time talking about others.)

1233
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,720
When I was playing the game,

1234
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,623
he said "He's not my type."

1235
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,858
It seemed like he had a temper.

1236
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,059
I do agree.

1237
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,295
DONGHAE, you get me.

1238
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,131
How could he say that
when we'd never met before?

1239
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,667
It seems
like he doesn't care about others.

1240
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,403
But you seem thoughtful, KYUHYUN.

1241
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,071
I am. Did you see me cleaning up earlier?

1242
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,005
I did.

1243
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:55,780
(KYUHYUN cleaned up
when the game was over.)

1244
00:46:57,448 --> 00:47:01,552
You really get to know a person
when you talk to them.

1245
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:06,791
When EUNHYUK was sitting down
for others to choose him,

1246
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:10,461
you were about to go but came back.
Why did you do that?

1247
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:12,096
That was a smoke screen.

1248
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,266
(What?)

1249
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,401
I wanted to confuse him.

1250
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,836
Why confuse him?

1251
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,138
I wanted to mess with EUNHYUK.

1252
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,841
He's the type to easily take advantage of.

1253
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:26,811
(Cool attitude)

1254
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:27,812
Do you need money?

1255
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,216
This person does this to everyone.

1256
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:36,954
I thought KYUHYUN was really considerate
of others,

1257
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:37,922
but now that I think about it,

1258
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,157
he's a scammer.

1259
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,930
DONGHAE, you're the type
who's devoted to one person only.

1260
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:51,135
I saw earlier and you seemed
to have a strong build like Lee Byung Hun.

1261
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:52,403
You'll make a great partner.

1262
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,372
(KYUHYUN's persistent flirting)

1263
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:58,743
(Thinking)

1264
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:01,178
To scam someone,

1265
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,447
scammers are nice at first.

1266
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,050
They offer their own things first,

1267
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,786
praise you and make you trust them,

1268
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:12,423
and then they scam you.
That's what he's doing.

1269
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:15,092
(Reality hit again.)

1270
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:18,062
I can't trust anyone here.

1271
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,364
I think I should just go solo.

1272
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,233
Rather than being chosen by a scammer,

1273
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,434
going solo is better.

1274
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:29,039
(Various human relationships were observed
during the meal.)

1275
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:33,677
(Like the changing shape of the moon,
their relationships keep changing.)

1276
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,681
(You cannot see...)

1277
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,584
(through the minds of the Super Solos.)

1278
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,853
(Finding a partner starts now.)

1279
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,456
This could be a game
to appeal to sexiness.

1280
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,358
(Sexy appeal)

1281
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,260
What are you doing?

1282
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,128
(The Super Solos aren't holding back.)

1283
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,764
(They're obviously cheating.)

1284
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,199
Can we eat other people's food?

1285
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,801
(Eating it is the point, isn't it?)

1286
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,736
What's this?

1287
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,404
(What?)

1288
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,939
(Docking completed)

1289
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,842
(Real flirting starts now.)

1290
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,377
(Blowing)

1291
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,412
(The flirting intensifies.)

1292
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,080
(It's now time for the final choice.)

1293
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,416
I have no regrets today.

1294
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,718
(The Super Solos reveal
their true feelings.)

1295
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,188
I think it would be great
to become partners with this friend.

1296
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,554
(Will a final couple be formed?)
