1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
(20 years ago, SUPER JUNIOR was born.)

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,710
Hello, I'm HEECHUL of SUPER JUNIOR.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,610
Hello, I'm SIWON of SUPER JUNIOR.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,210
I'm DONGHAE, a man as vast as the sea.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,380
Hello, I'm EUNHYUK.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,140
Hello, I'm RYEOWOOK.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,710
Hello, I'm YESUNG.

8
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,050
Hello, I'm LEETEUK, a special man.

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,980
Hello, I'm SHINDONG, a talented man.

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,950
(And the new member KYUHYUN)

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,490
(The first idol group with many members)

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,130
(The start of synchronized group dances)

13
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,800
(The idols of variety shows
recognized by everyone)

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,100
(In SUPER JUNIOR you can always trust)

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,640
SUPER JUNIOR's 20th year, 2025.

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,910
We're now a respectable 20-year-old group.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,010
(During the 20 years,)

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,910
(their faces changed quite a lot.)

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,880
(There are exceptions.)

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,380
(Like how they matured on the outside,)

21
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,850
(Like how they matured on the outside,)

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,220
(SUPER JUNIOR became stronger.)

23
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,720
(That's how they became grown-ups.)

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,230
(That's how they became grown-ups.)

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,500
Traditionally, grown-ups always
take responsibility for what they say.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,270
Like SHINHWA did a nude photoshoot,

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,970
- we should also do that.
- I hate it.

28
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,940
We have to hold a photo exhibition
to celebrate our 20th anniversary.

29
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,810
Let's go to an amusement park
wearing school uniforms.

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,010
I want all of us to get a colonoscopy.

31
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,740
I want SIWON to go to a temple.

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,950
(A Christian in despair)

33
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,650
Going to a fasting center together.

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,750
Getting waxed.

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,620
Having fun at HEECHUL's house
without HEECHUL.

36
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,720
(Disgusted)

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,420
We should do that in all of our houses.

38
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,590
Getting in the seawater in the winter.

39
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,790
(Why get in the water?)

40
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,090
I really want to go to the restaurant.

41
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,260
That's just physical labor.

42
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,060
We'll get hurt.

43
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,560
How about "SUPER JUNIOR Olympics?"

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,890
I want to try "The Great Escape" together.

45
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,860
I want all of us to go on a trip...

46
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,230
in three groups of three.

47
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,070
We said we'll do everything
on our 20th anniversary, right?

48
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,030
I'm scared they're going to do this
in the show.

49
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,500
(Once spoken,
words cannot be taken back.)

50
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,670
What?

51
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,770
Why am I here?

52
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,740
Why is it so hot?

53
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,940
This is a dry sauna.

54
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,810
Where am I?

55
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,250
Is nobody here?

56
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,480
(Will SUPER JUNIOR get caught
by their own words?)

57
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
- What should we do?
- What do we do now?

58
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,750
I knew it.

59
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,850
(The world of spoken words changes
every time they wake up.)

60
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,190
What's this?

61
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,460
This is crazy.

62
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,130
What's this?

63
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,430
(Right there...)

64
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,730
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,530
My head...

66
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,200
(SUPER JUNIOR's war to escape)

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,840
(United they escape,)

68
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,740
(divided they get locked up.)

69
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,710
(Let's unite and do it.)

70
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,540
(This is the teamwork
of people with 20 years of experience.)

71
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,680
(All they can trust is their members.)

72
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,250
(But they keep getting it "Wrong.")

73
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,580
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

74
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,120
(So angry)

75
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,890
(I'm the crazy dog around here.)

76
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,650
(To escape, they hit each other,)

77
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,820
(beat each other,)

78
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,190
(and the escape war overheats.)

79
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,230
(No)

80
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,190
(The members are losing their minds.)

81
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,070
(SUPER JUNIOR's
world of spoken words escape log)

82
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,300
(Woke Up to SuperTV begins now.)

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,370
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

84
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,870
Yes.

85
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,480
Good. That's it.

86
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,110
Good.

87
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,680
- Look sexy.
- He's so shameless.

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,880
- That's too much.
- Look cuter.

89
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,950
- None of them is good enough.
- Yes. Two, three.

90
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,220
(Yes)

91
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,820
What?

92
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,730
What am I doing?

93
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,060
Everyone's wearing a school uniform.

94
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,230
Focus. EUNHYUK, focus.

95
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,030
Why would you lose your mind?
What's wrong?

96
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,800
You said we should do
a photo exhibition, EUNHYUK.

97
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,740
Exactly.

98
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,870
Did I say that?

99
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,710
Did I say we should do
a photo exhibition?

100
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,310
Did I?

101
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,480
We're doing a photo exhibition
to celebrate our 20th anniversary.

102
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,050
I think the eyes, nose, and mouth
should not show.

103
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,190
It should look like this.
Eyes, nose, and mouth not showing.

104
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,290
(Porcelain-like skin)

105
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,690
I have a question.
This is a graduation picture,

106
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,960
so how do all of them have long hair?

107
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,490
(Peekaboo)

108
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,260
Use this one.

109
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,430
(Not a single one of them is normal.)

110
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,470
If you're too close,
the camera loses focus.

111
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,530
Zoom in

112
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,340
(So close)

113
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,140
(The graduation pictures
are getting spoiled.)

114
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,040
When I mentioned a photo exhibition,

115
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,340
I didn't mean this.

116
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,280
(Will they be able to take pictures
without any problems?)

117
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,320
Let's take a picture
to celebrate our 20th anniversary.

118
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,650
Okay.

119
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,350
They told us to finish in 20 minutes
but I don't think it'll take that long.

120
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,760
- Twenty seconds.
- Of course not.

121
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,920
Twenty seconds per person.

122
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,330
How about this?
It's our 20th anniversary,

123
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,890
so let's take one picture and use that.

124
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,600
Okay. One chance.

125
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,230
Let's not make it fun, but...

126
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,430
(Just then, HEECHUL spotted something.)

127
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,770
(Laughing)

128
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,870
I prepared this. Take a look at this.

129
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,070
This is the worst.

130
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,510
(What did SHINDONG prepare?)

131
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,310
(Graduation pictures of SUPER JUNIOR)

132
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,650
(Unlike now, they were quite fresh.)

133
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,390
- KYUHYUN.
- KYUHYUN.

134
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,820
(I won't watch it.)

135
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,460
Did you drink the previous day?

136
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,830
Why the puffy face?

137
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,230
KYUHYUN should come
without double eyelids.

138
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,100
(Everything's the same
except for his eyes.)

139
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,130
Look at LEETEUK.

140
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,400
Let's start with LEETEUK,
Park Jung Soo.

141
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,670
But where's LEETEUK?

142
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,770
He's not here.

143
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,340
Some of the members are not here.

144
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,980
Big Nose?

145
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,450
That's LEETEUK
and his hair looks like a mussel.

146
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,780
- Who's that?
- Some of them aren't here.

147
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,120
That's when I was working
in a factory in Gangwon-do.

148
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Wait a minute.

149
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,690
Guys.

150
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,890
SIWON...

151
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,660
His chin is 3cm shorter here.

152
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,030
(SIWON grew a lot.)

153
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,760
Wait a minute.
These two should stop working out.

154
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,300
You guys should stop working out.

155
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,600
Who is he?

156
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,130
Don't exercise.

157
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,840
(DONGHAE and SIWON
are not allowed to exercise.)

158
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
(EUNHYUK spotted something.)

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,170
All of us are students,
but there's a teacher here.

160
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,610
(Guys, let's take a picture.)

161
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,280
(The automatic American reaction)

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,580
YESUNG, did you have something
on your chest?

163
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,720
Look at your pose.

164
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,690
(How cute.)

165
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,650
(It's time to go 20 years back
when they were young and cute.)

166
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,820
Were you that fair-skinned?

167
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,420
I was born fair-skinned.

168
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,460
Who's first?

169
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,260
(The first customer is KYUHYUN.)

170
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm only taking one and final picture.

171
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,430
This is a test shot.

172
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,840
His eyes are gleaming venomously.

173
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,940
(Madman with innocent eyes)

174
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,540
You have to make the same face.

175
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,010
But I look a bit gloomy.

176
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,110
He's about to laugh at someone.

177
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,310
Just the eyes are different. It's okay.

178
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,450
(Showing his American reaction)

179
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,150
Why is my nose so red?

180
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,650
Because you drank the day before

181
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,090
That's not your graduation picture,
is it?

182
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,090
I don't think
that's a graduation picture.

183
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,160
He obviously looks ill.

184
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,430
You have to make the same face, okay?

185
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,590
(The actual shot this time)

186
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,760
One, two...

187
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,730
- Smirk more.
- three.

188
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,160
(Smirking)

189
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,500
Yes. That's it.

190
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,270
(Quite synchronized except for eyes)

191
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,340
- He lowered his shoulders just right.
- He's too good-looking.

192
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,040
But his eyes got closer.

193
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,380
He looks delicate.

194
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,380
He looks delicate.

195
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,310
(His eyes got closer
like his relationship with the members.)

196
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,720
- Epicanthoplasty?
- Did you get that?

197
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,050
(So fun)

198
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,150
Are they magnets?
Why are they getting closer?

199
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,650
That's hilarious.

200
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm next.

201
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,020
This way to the front?

202
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,560
I had a sharp jawline at the time.

203
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,230
HEECHUL looks really handsome.

204
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,130
Smile for the test shot.

205
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,500
One, two.

206
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,870
- Test shot.
- One test shot.

207
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,070
This is what you'll look like.

208
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,800
HEECHUL got chubbier.

209
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,740
He looks more gentle.

210
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,770
HEECHUL's eyes got slanted downwards.

211
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,780
(Frowning)

212
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,880
Your eyes should gleam venomously.

213
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,910
Make your cheeks look hollow like this.

214
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,010
Then...

215
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,580
Tuck your chin in.

216
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,750
Yes. There.

217
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,450
There.

218
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,320
(Somewhat familiar)

219
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,160
"Sunflower."

220
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Kim Byung Ok.

221
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,960
Oh Tae Sik.

222
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,600
(You're back, Oh Tae Sik.)

223
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,030
Oh Tae Sik.

224
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,230
(Actor Kim Byung Ok is here.)

225
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,500
(Next is YESUNG.)

226
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,040
You have to take off your jacket.

227
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,040
You have to take off your jacket.

228
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,470
(Taking off)

229
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,240
(The mic is stuck in his jacket.)

230
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,680
The mic.

231
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,650
Just crouch down and hold his jacket.

232
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,220
(Crouched)

233
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,350
Why weren't you wearing your jacket?

234
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,190
(He can't hear him.)

235
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,190
Are his hands clasped behind his back?

236
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,590
I think so. I think his hands are behind.

237
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,920
And your bangs have to be parted.

238
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,090
(Hands behind his back and parted bangs)

239
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,460
(So satisfied)

240
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,800
The hairstyle is similar.

241
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,100
He has to hold out his chest.

242
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,370
I have a question. How can you have
long hair in a graduation picture?

243
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,940
There's a finger in the picture.

244
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,140
(Peekaboo)

245
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,340
(Dumbfounded)

246
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,380
Let's use that one.

247
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,650
(I did a nice one.)

248
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,420
There's a finger.

249
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,920
(Thanks to KYUHYUN,
the picture looks cute.)

250
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,050
(YESUNG's second picture)

251
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,820
This is hilarious already. How annoying.

252
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,590
(How about this time?)

253
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,860
One, two.

254
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,200
- He's getting greedy.
- Wait. Behind...

255
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
(What is it this time?)

256
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,100
Wait. Behind...

257
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,440
(There's room behind YESUNG.)

258
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,100
(Peekaboo)

259
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,140
(Everyone has to tease Tom YESUNG.)

260
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,980
Doesn't that look
like he has a ghost behind him?

261
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
(He might appear in a nightmare.)

262
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,780
This isn't a graduation picture.

263
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,350
(YESUNG's graduation picture ended
with everyone teasing him.)

264
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,150
(The fourth to go is EUNHYUK.)

265
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,690
(Expecting another fun scene)

266
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,660
I wanted to look charismatic.

267
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,230
- You should take a picture from close.
- Yes.

268
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,700
EUNHYUK, make the eyebrows
look the same.

269
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,540
(Loading EUNHYUK from 20 years ago
with his arched eyebrows)

270
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,740
(What does the picture look like?)

271
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,570
That looks nice.

272
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,540
You zoomed in too much.

273
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,080
(He looks like he's been betrayed.)

274
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,280
The ends of his eyebrows should rise.

275
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,880
(Making his tie look the same)

276
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,050
(The atmosphere getting heated
because he's not satisfied)

277
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,290
(Even turning his back on the camera)

278
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,390
(So close)

279
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,460
You're too close.

280
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,930
It's in a wide angle instead.

281
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,130
This is necessary.

282
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,600
(Clearly too close)

283
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,530
If you're too close,
the camera loses focus.

284
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,240
So I set it at a wide angle.

285
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,810
(Wide)

286
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,210
(Too small)

287
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,080
(Perfect)

288
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,210
(Mischievous)

289
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,520
This is good.

290
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,880
This is good. He looks nice.

291
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,590
(Everyone is satisfied with the picture
of EUNHYUK, except for him.)

292
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,390
(Time for the next customer)

293
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,330
(The good-looking DONGHAE is here.)

294
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,560
DONGHAE, were you in ninth grade then?

295
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,100
- Yes.
- Yes, right? In Mokpo.

296
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,230
Make your bangs parted the same.

297
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,000
(Parting his hair like the old days)

298
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
I know how to take a picture of DONGHAE.

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,010
I think the eyes, nose,
and mouth should not show.

300
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
It should look like this.
Eyes, nose, and mouth not showing.

301
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,780
(What does the picture
look like this time?)

302
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,450
It should look like this.
Eyes, nose, and mouth are not showing.

303
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,550
(Eyes, nose, and mouth deleted)

304
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,820
(I can't even.)

305
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,850
(Successfully took
the same picture again)

306
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,190
(Successfully showed his fair skin)

307
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,060
Look how fair-skinned he looks.

308
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,430
That's like a Haduri picture.

309
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,100
(Do I like you?)

310
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,200
Who's next?

311
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,730
- RYEOWOOK.
- RYEOWOOK?

312
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,540
You look like you were about
to get surprised.

313
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,140
Make your cheeks look hollow.

314
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,610
(Cheek-lighting)

315
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,210
RYEOWOOK's picture was taken from afar.

316
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,780
Let me practice.

317
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,510
(Awkward)

318
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,920
Is this wrong?

319
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,250
He looks too artificial.

320
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,050
Slightly turn your body.

321
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,790
- In the opposite direction.
- Like this?

322
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,920
And tilt your head.

323
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,320
Tilt. That's it.

324
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
Make your cheeks look hollow.

325
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,030
That's when RYEOWOOK used to look
like Hyun Bin, right?

326
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,200
Right.

327
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,670
One, two. Purse your lips.

328
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,170
(Will he look like Hyun Bin again?)

329
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,300
- There.
- This looks nice.

330
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,010
(The customer is satisfied.)

331
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,240
(You can always trust
SHINDONG's photo studio.)

332
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,940
(Since when were E.L.F.s so pretty?)

333
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,480
Who's next?

334
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,380
His face looks completely different.

335
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,320
He's a different person.

336
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,850
They're not the same people.

337
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,120
(Who are you?)

338
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,760
We should make him a member
of the National Assembly.

339
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,700
(Candidate 47 SIWON)

340
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,170
(Next is LEETEUK.)

341
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,840
But LEETEUK's picture has
poor resolution, doesn't it?

342
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,540
LEETEUK and I graduated
from elementary school longer ago.

343
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,110
Poor resolution? Okay.

344
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,180
One, two.

345
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,540
There.

346
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,610
Poor resolution? Okay.

347
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,720
(I can make you go back in time.)

348
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,880
The photographer is skilled.

349
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,950
(100 percent the same)

350
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,590
(The best photographer, indeed)

351
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,090
It's SHINDONG's turn now.

352
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,860
But how can anyone make SHINDONG
look like that?

353
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,730
I look too different now.

354
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,100
So make him look like a different person.

355
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,240
- Make a cheesy look.
- One, two.

356
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,540
Make a cheesy look.

357
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,540
(Bleary-eyed)

358
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,710
(Why is he making the same face?)

359
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,270
(Blurry)

360
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,640
It's out of focus.

361
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
(The intern's cute mistake)

362
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,510
His neck is gone.

363
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,980
Make his neck show.

364
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,580
How can we delete the chubby cheeks?

365
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,050
Chubby cheeks and chin.

366
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,390
Suck in your cheeks.

367
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,320
(Photoshopping himself for the intern)

368
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,290
(The chubby cheeks cannot be hidden
despite his efforts.)

369
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,630
(Still satisfied)

370
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,500
- That's not it.
- He looks ill.

371
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,370
(But they look quite similar.)

372
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,570
(SHINDONG's photo studio ended business
without any problems.)

373
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,070
(SUPER JUNIOR's graduation pictures)

374
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,670
(Park Jung Soo, Kim Hee Chul,
Kim Jong Un, Shin Dong Hee, Lee Hyuk Jae)

375
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,640
(Lee Dong Hae, Choi Si Won,
Kim Ryeo Wook, Cho Kyu Hyun)

376
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,340
(LEETEUK, HEECHUL, YESUNG,
SHINDONG, EUNHYUK)

377
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,910
(DONGHAE, SIWON, RYEOWOOK, KYUHYUN)

378
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,350
Let's take a group photo now.

379
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,250
(A cute picture of everyone
hugging each other from behind)

380
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,120
- Do we hug the person in front tightly?
- Yes.

381
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,360
(Showing how close they've become
the past 20 years)

382
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,030
Slightly bend over.

383
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,960
(Like this?)

384
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,660
(Smile)

385
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,900
(Touching)

386
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,370
Don't touch my stomach.

387
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,770
(Cuteness overload)

388
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,740
There. That's good.

389
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,880
The middle is too high.

390
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,140
SIWON, bend lower.

391
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,980
Like this?

392
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,680
We do look a bit like high schoolers.

393
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,880
(Adjusting the height)

394
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,090
(Doing a smile)

395
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,590
(Does the picture look fine this time?)

396
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,160
(Their faces show how comfortable
they've become in 20 years.)

397
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,400
(Perfect height, perfect face)

398
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,570
(We're SUPER JUNIOR,
perfect even on our 20th anniversary.)

399
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,040
What's next?

400
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,040
To celebrate
SUPER JUNIOR's coming of age,

401
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,740
we prepared a special gift.

402
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,010
It's what pops into your head when you
think about a coming-of-age ceremony.

403
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,780
- Rose.
- Perfume.

404
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,180
First kiss?

405
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,250
(What did the staff prepare?)

406
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,550
(Blue)

407
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,530
(Beautiful blue roses
that reminds us of SUPER JUNIOR)

408
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,890
Pass it over.

409
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,300
(SUPER JUNIOR sharing roses.)

410
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,470
Blue roses mean something.

411
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:11,877
Blue roses are not in the encyclopedia.

412
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,502
I remember.

413
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:16,302
They don't exist, so they mean hope.

414
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:17,272
(Floral language of blue roses
used to be called something impossible.)

415
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,272
(In 2004, blue roses were developed.)

416
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,112
(So the floral language changed
to unfailing love and miracles.)

417
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,342
There's a card here.

418
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,382
I'll read what's written.

419
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,482
Where's the card?

420
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:26,052
There.

421
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,152
(I see.)

422
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:29,122
Don't we get perfume
on the coming-of-age day?

423
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:30,352
What?

424
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,882
Why?

425
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,222
(What's written on the card?)

426
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:37,922
(A gift that was hidden
next to the rose)

427
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,092
(A chance to kiss the member you cherish)

428
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:43,732
(Who will be the lucky one?)

429
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,132
(It's DONGHAE.)

430
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:48,672
The member with the red ribbon...

431
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:51,272
should choose a member he loves...

432
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:54,112
and kiss him where he wants to.

433
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,342
Wait a minute.

434
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:59,782
The staff is weird.

435
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:00,982
This is the worst.

436
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:03,252
I gave out the roses without thinking.
You know that, right?

437
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,192
(Handing over the roses
he randomly picked)

438
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,522
(SUPER JUNIOR was only focused
on the blue roses.)

439
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,362
(Rose with a red ribbon)

440
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:13,932
(The rose was passed over...)

441
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,232
(and ended up in DONGHAE's hands.)

442
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:19,102
Let's make it nice and clear
with a kiss on the lips.

443
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:21,872
Kiss on the lips
since it's our 20th anniversary.

444
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,472
(Flustered)

445
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:26,042
Kiss the other member where you want.

446
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:30,412
(His tongue is waiting.)

447
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:33,152
He has no white coating. It's clean.

448
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,352
(This is how idols with 20 years
of experience do variety shows.)

449
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,322
(Embarrassed to show do it to others)

450
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:40,852
If you two kiss, viewer ratings will soar.

451
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:44,922
Now kiss.

452
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,962
What's this?

453
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:48,732
Why do I have to do this?

454
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,732
Just imagine you're eating beef tongue.

455
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,932
(EUN-tongue)

456
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,642
Kiss someone.

457
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,912
(Who will get DONGHAE's precious kiss?)

458
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,172
(Secretly excited)

459
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:04,882
- HEECHUL.
- Me?

460
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:06,552
- HEECHUL?
- Really?

461
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:08,712
(Sad)

462
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:11,982
- Kiss...
- Kiss?

463
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,552
(Ready to get a kiss)

464
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:17,122
(Interested)

465
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,162
Why would I kiss you there?

466
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,432
Peck him.

467
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,562
We can peck each other, can't we?

468
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,002
(My lips are dry.)

469
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,102
Do I really kiss him?

470
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:28,132
- Where do you want it?
- Where do you want it?

471
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,002
Kiss him on the belly.
Do a belly raspberry.

472
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:32,072
- Belly raspberry.
- Do a belly raspberry.

473
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,982
- Belly raspberry is fine.
- Is this seriously happening?

474
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:38,382
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.
Why do you look embarrassed?

475
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:39,782
I'm the one who's exposing the stomach.

476
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:42,682
(Yes, he's the one who's embarrassed.)

477
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,382
- Is this for real?
- Yes.

478
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:49,492
This is our 20th anniversary,

479
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:50,862
so I'll kiss you on the cheek.

480
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,162
It'll erase my makeup.
You should just give a belly raspberry.

481
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,562
(Pouting his lips)

482
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:56,662
I told you it's not there.

483
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,032
Right. My cheek.

484
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:00,502
(Excited to watch)

485
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:03,702
(It's now time to kiss.)

486
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:05,642
(Eun-tongue is also excited.)

487
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:08,742
Just kiss him on the lips.

488
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:11,782
(Spit)

489
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:13,812
(Spitting at the excited face)

490
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,182
Why spit at him?

491
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:16,382
Seriously.

492
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,122
(Seriously cute friends)

493
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:20,722
I did it.

494
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:23,822
(Coming-of-age gift presentation
is complete.)

495
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:26,262
We've prepared a big event
for the coming-of-age ceremony next.

496
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:27,762
Is there an event?

497
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:30,102
It's time to do something else
that EUNHYUK mentioned.

498
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:31,602
Why did you mention so many things?

499
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,572
What did I mention this time?

500
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,872
Just be quiet.

501
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:38,242
I should keep my mouth shut.

502
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,572
This is what EUNHYUK said.

503
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:43,042
We have lots of old pictures.

504
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,782
Let's take a picture with the same pose.

505
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:47,852
This is not hard.

506
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:49,822
What's that?

507
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:52,752
This is Ivy Club.

508
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:53,822
(A school uniform brand?)

509
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:56,022
This is Ivy Club.

510
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,462
(Young HEECHUL)

511
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:01,592
HEECHUL had an injury at the time.

512
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:04,032
So there's a video of HEECHUL
coming back to the music video set.

513
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,932
- Right.
- Yes.

514
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:10,142
(Ivy Club commercial, a 2006 commercial
of a school uniform brand)

515
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:12,572
I remember that.

516
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,042
That was in the year 2006, right?

517
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,042
- Yes.
- During the winter.

518
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,612
We shot that on the rooftop
of the COEX building.

519
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:20,952
Right.

520
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,752
I wasn't there.

521
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:25,322
(SUPER JUNIOR was nimble at the time.)

522
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:27,192
If we do that now,
our crotches will be torn.

523
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:30,592
We worked so hard.

524
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:33,392
(That's what we used to do.)

525
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:38,102
(Passionate kick in those days)

526
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,672
(SIWON was the kicker.)

527
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:42,702
That was a nice kick, SIWON.

528
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:46,672
Min Hyo Rin.

529
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:50,982
(Min Hyo Rin was also a model.)

530
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:53,052
I wasn't there.

531
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,476
(Was KYUHYUN there?)

532
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:59,616
(Let's check.)

533
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,346
(DONGHAE, KYUHYUN, SIWON, SHINDONG)

534
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,856
(RYEOWOOK, YESUNG, EUNHYUK, LEETEUK)

535
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:04,616
(Everyone's here except for HEECHUL.)

536
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:06,486
- Where is he?
- Wait, I'm there.

537
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:09,456
- Why am I there?
- I'm not there.

538
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:10,626
HEECHUL...

539
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,526
I think I left after doing this.

540
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:14,566
I'm not there.

541
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:15,696
- Everyone's there.
- I'm not there.

542
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:18,296
- SHINDONG is there.
- I don't look like that anymore.

543
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,706
But we have to copy that.

544
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:22,836
Watch and learn the moves,

545
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:24,336
you and SHINDONG.

546
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:32,616
(Learning the moves)

547
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,186
(Done copying the moves)

548
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:35,686
This is easy.

549
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:36,886
Ready? Teach us.

550
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,016
Stand in your places.

551
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:39,686
EUNHYUK, stand in the front.

552
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:44,596
(Practice started
with EUNHYUK on the lead.)

553
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:46,366
(Focused)

554
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:49,666
(Thinking of the year 2006)

555
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,336
(The members are immersed.)

556
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,406
(RYEOWOOK is also practicing hard.)

557
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:58,276
And at the end, SIWON shows his kick.

558
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,206
Can you still do it?

559
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,976
- I don't think so.
- Try it. A roundhouse kick.

560
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,106
A roundhouse kick.

561
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,446
I don't think I'll be able to do it.

562
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,116
(Light)

563
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:06,616
I don't think I'll be able to do it.

564
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,586
(SIWON's agile kick)

565
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,956
That was the National Assembly kick.

566
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:13,826
(Getting a bit greedy)

567
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:15,026
RYEOWOOK?

568
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,156
How do you do it? Show us.

569
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:17,556
Show us.

570
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:20,166
Imagine someone's in front of you
and kick.

571
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,966
(Right away)

572
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:25,436
(Kick with no basis)

573
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:27,006
Are you a scorpion?

574
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:28,666
Was that a scorpion kick?

575
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,606
Good.

576
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:31,836
(It's time to dance in full swing now.)

577
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:33,246
SIWON stands in the center.

578
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:34,406
We stand in a V and dance.

579
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:36,416
In the end, SIWON shows his kick.

580
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,816
(Slowly)

581
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:40,386
(Showing a scorpion kick again)

582
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,686
(Not satisfied)

583
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:43,886
Let's get out of the frame.

584
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,726
(The rest of the members
get out of the frame at the end.)

585
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:47,686
Okay.

586
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,026
SIWON, you have a big role.

587
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:50,256
Your kick has to look super cool.

588
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,966
You should stretch before we start.

589
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:55,966
Your pants should be torn.

590
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,736
(A difficult request
for a variety show beginner)

591
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,736
(A pressuring interview
of the experienced variety show idols)

592
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,536
You should practice doing that kick.

593
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,376
I'll do it right away for the mission.

594
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:07,046
(I'm Horse SIWON of SUPER JUNIOR.)

595
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:08,506
Count for everyone.

596
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,276
(Having been together for 20 years,)

597
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:12,146
(SUPER JUNIOR shows the best teamwork.)

598
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,246
(Will they make it?)

599
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,086
Five, six, seven, eight.

600
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,286
(The beginning like the starter
of synchronized groups dances they are)

601
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:20,956
(Or not)

602
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:23,126
(The only one half a beat late)

603
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,096
Kick.

604
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,066
(Late moves)

605
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:27,796
(Shout)

606
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:28,966
(Startled)

607
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:30,896
(I can feel we failed.)

608
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,436
Get out.

609
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,636
(A mess)

610
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,036
Are we doing this at the end?

611
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:38,376
We can be doing that
while SIWON shows his kick.

612
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:40,046
I don't think we should get out
of the frame.

613
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:40,906
Okay.

614
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:43,276
Let's make it this time.

615
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:46,916
(Second try)

616
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,516
(Will they make it this time?)

617
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,116
What are we doing?

618
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:55,426
(Who and where am I?)

619
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:58,726
(Confused DONGHAE)

620
00:22:58,726 --> 00:23:00,126
(Are you kidding?)

621
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,326
I have a muscle cramp so it hurts.

622
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,736
Sorry.

623
00:23:03,736 --> 00:23:05,136
HEECHUL is better than us.

624
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:07,936
I wasn't even there at the time, guys.

625
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:08,936
HEECHUL has a good memory.

626
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,006
(The real final try)

627
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,436
The one who makes a mistake
should take off his clothes.

628
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:14,176
Five, six, seven, eight.

629
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:16,416
I want to make a mistake on purpose.

630
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,946
I want to make a mistake on purpose.

631
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:19,986
(That was a lie.)

632
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,916
Kick.

633
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,086
(We're the ones who started
the synchronized group dance.)

634
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,886
(This is it.)

635
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,856
One, two, three, four.

636
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,396
(Let's go,)

637
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:31,726
(SIWON.)

638
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:35,166
(We're SUPER JUNIOR.)

639
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:39,466
(Successful coming-of-age ceremony)

640
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:52,116
(SUPER JUNIOR's
school uniform commercial, 2025 version)

641
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:55,716
(Run, SUPER JUNIOR!)

642
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:59,286
(Fly, SUPER JUNIOR!)

643
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:02,386
(The group united with loyalty,
SUPER JUNIOR)

644
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:03,896
(This is cool and exciting.)

645
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,296
(Even after 20 years,)

646
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:11,466
(SUPER JUNIOR stays the same.)

647
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:15,136
(After the coming-of-age ceremony)

648
00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:17,636
Because we were in this business
for 20 years,

649
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:19,946
the staff asked us to bring
our four most unforgettable photos.

650
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:22,876
the staff asked us to bring
our four most unforgettable photos.

651
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:25,176
We're going to look
at those pictures here.

652
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,386
I didn't know the purpose
of the photo exhibition.

653
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:29,216
So I just brought pictures
with the most members.

654
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:31,156
I thought they asked for funny pictures.

655
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:32,456
Didn't they ask for solo pictures?

656
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:34,686
I submitted group pictures only.

657
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:35,686
I submitted solo pictures only.

658
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:37,856
I brought pictures from my hard drive.

659
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:38,996
I searched for old pictures.

660
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,796
(Excited to see their pictures)

661
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:44,836
We're going to look at those pictures
and pick 20.

662
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,166
They'll be at the photo exhibition.

663
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,466
- Twenty among the ones we see today?
- Twenty among them.

664
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:51,536
And the one who submits
the best picture among the 20...

665
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,206
will get a gift from the staff.

666
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:54,576
Korean beef?

667
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,876
Something more expensive.

668
00:24:56,916 --> 00:25:00,816
(The prize for the member
who submits the best picture is...)

669
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,756
(an instant camera.)

670
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:06,956
(Who will get the prize?)

671
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:09,926
And the member who brought
the worst picture gets a penalty.

672
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:10,996
I think I'm going to win.

673
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:12,026
Do I still start off?

674
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:13,366
(Confident)

675
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,966
They're pictures
that brings back memories, right?

676
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:17,366
Let's start with KYUHYUN.

677
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,666
They're not pictures
that's been revealed already, are they?

678
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:20,666
Like pictures in articles.

679
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,036
(Boo)

680
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:25,036
(Disappointed)

681
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:30,376
(Pictures we can easily find online)

682
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,816
Did you want to take my place?

683
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,186
I'm in none of those pictures.

684
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:37,116
You're not in any of them.

685
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:39,726
When was that?

686
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:41,556
Let's listen to the story behind them.

687
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,596
I remember that day.

688
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:44,956
- When was it?
- I remember.

689
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:48,696
The singers went on stage with a flag.

690
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:49,696
KBS.

691
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:54,166
(The second picture)

692
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,276
(Staring)

693
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:57,676
Wait a minute. In this picture,

694
00:25:57,676 --> 00:26:00,346
it's not LEETEUK but LEETEUK's mom.

695
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:01,576
But LEETEUK's mom.

696
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:04,216
That's when my mom came to cheer for us.

697
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:07,886
- Even with a purse.
- He has a purse.

698
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,956
That's not my purse.

699
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,156
- Isn't the bag hung on your arm?
- What's that hand on your left?

700
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,286
Why do you have three hands?

701
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:14,526
What's with that left hand?

702
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:15,726
Why do you have three hands?

703
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:16,796
There's a ghost.

704
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:17,856
A ghost.

705
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:18,896
Why are there three hands?

706
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,226
- What's that?
- That's KYUHYUN's hand.

707
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,226
That's not my hand.

708
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:22,996
That's not my hand.

709
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:24,866
- Isn't that SHINDONG's hand?
- That's SHINDONG's hand.

710
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:26,036
Did my hand reach that far?

711
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:28,806
(SHINDONG has quite long arms.)

712
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:37,176
No, that's SIWON's hand.

713
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:39,616
SIWON's hand is somewhere strange.

714
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,116
It seems I stretched that far.

715
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:44,386
(Hilarious)

716
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,786
Next picture.

717
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:47,686
When was that?

718
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:49,526
- That was...
- That was 2012.

719
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,896
What happened to EUNHYUK's hair?

720
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:52,226
I don't know.

721
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:53,296
(Why did I do that?)

722
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:55,266
Did someone pull my hair from above?

723
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:56,936
I think someone pulled
the corners of his eyes up.

724
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,936
(Style that's out of this world!)

725
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:01,106
Someone is pulling EUNHYUK's hair up.

726
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,466
But when was that?

727
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,436
The Golden Disc Awards.

728
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:06,606
We won four awards.

729
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:09,676
Did YESUNG win a gold medal
in the Olympics?

730
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:11,616
It seems we went there
to congratulate him.

731
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:13,786
(Those were the days.)

732
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:14,686
Next picture.

733
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:16,656
I'm not there again.

734
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:17,986
That was your show.

735
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,756
- On JTBC.
- That was during "SUPER Clap."

736
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:23,426
We sang "Sorry, Sorry"
and you were the host of that show.

737
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,996
I was there, too, but where am I?

738
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:26,866
- Why aren't you in the picture?
- You came out on your own.

739
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:28,896
Why did you make me go by myself?

740
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,696
I'm not in the picture.

741
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:32,266
- That's the last picture, right?
- Next picture.

742
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,166
I want to throw away all four pictures.

743
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,666
He abandoned me first, that's why.

744
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,306
- So all are pointless?
- Yes, pointless.

745
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,746
(KYUHYUN shocked by the boycott)

746
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,746
Wait a minute.

747
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:43,816
(Rolling out)

748
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,246
(Standing up)

749
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,686
KYUHYUN's pictures.

750
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:48,946
Burn all three.

751
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,416
Are you sticking them
and removing them afterward?

752
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,516
We have four.

753
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:52,856
The first one.

754
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:53,956
(Boo)

755
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,296
(Throwing it straight in the air.)

756
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,166
(The photo got booed and dropped.)

757
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,896
Wasn't SIWON's arm funny
in the second picture?

758
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:07,966
That hand was funny.

759
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,236
So should we keep this just in case?

760
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:10,306
Keep it.

761
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,406
- Is that a black-and-white picture?
- Winning four awards is meaningful.

762
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,006
- Four awards.
- Boo.

763
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:17,746
(The fourth picture is also out.)

764
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:20,186
(Bitter)

765
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:23,316
(Only one of KYUHYUN's pictures is left.)

766
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:25,316
Next is DONGHAE's pictures.

767
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,686
I'll be looking forward to them, DONGHAE.

768
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,486
It’s been over 20 years between us.

769
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,756
- I trust you.
- These are his pictures.

770
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,556
Not bad.

771
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,826
"Knowing Bros?"

772
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,766
Nice picture.

773
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:36,766
That picture.

774
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:39,766
(What made HEECHUL satisfied?)

775
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:43,876
(HEECHUL is here.)

776
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:46,406
That was our first time
in "Knowing Bros" together, right?

777
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:47,806
Yes. Okay. What's next?

778
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:49,076
Look at that handwriting.

779
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:50,346
"Hilarious picture."

780
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:52,676
- "This is why I like SUPER JUNIOR."
- I've never seen that picture.

781
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:55,386
Aren't those old vibes so nice?

782
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:57,516
Good one.

783
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,856
I was expressing
Edvard Munch's "The Scream of Nature."

784
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:03,526
Wait. Who's that in the top right?

785
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:04,756
Show us.

786
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:07,526
(Yes, this is me.)

787
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:09,326
How can someone's face get that long?

788
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:10,236
(The strange story again,
now the long face)

789
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:11,596
We should all try that much.

790
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,866
I think his soul is being sucked out.

791
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,536
(Embarrassed)

792
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,836
They bring back memories.

793
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:20,206
I have so many pictures like that at home.

794
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,276
- Nice one.
- I know, right?

795
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:23,946
I remember that.

796
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:25,076
That's when I had a mustache.

797
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:28,046
Charlie Chaplin is in the center.

798
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,816
Isn't that Bae Gi Seong?

799
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:32,686
<i>Cowardly</i>

800
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,786
The pictures DONGHAE brought were nice
and full of memories.

801
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:36,056
Who brought these?

802
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,056
DONGHAE.

803
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:37,996
(Evaluating DONGHAE's pictures)

804
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:40,926
All four of mine are the best ones.

805
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:44,466
First of all, the picture taken
on the set of "Knowing Bros."

806
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,796
It was our first variety show together.

807
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,466
Take that out.

808
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:48,406
Pass.

809
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,436
But there are only a few members.

810
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:53,406
(The first picture is out.)

811
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:54,446
"Hilarious picture."

812
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:56,446
I like that one.

813
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,646
It's the picture in the first place.

814
00:29:58,646 --> 00:30:01,246
(One picture, mixed emotions.
One happy, one sad.)

815
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,316
It's RYEOWOOK's turn.

816
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:05,886
Boo.

817
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,226
Why is this "boo?"

818
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:08,956
That's a precious memory for me.

819
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:10,626
- Same.
- When was that?

820
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:13,626
KYUHYUN and LEETEUK came to see me.

821
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:14,596
All the way to Jinpyeong.

822
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,936
I asked for the number
of the person who was the leader...

823
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:19,706
when RYEOWOOK joined the military.

824
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:21,966
- To ask him to pull a prank on RYEOWOOK?
- To ask him how RYEOWOOK was doing.

825
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,406
I heard RYEOWOOK felt so uncomfortable.

826
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,106
Do you remember that?

827
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:27,776
I don't remember at all.

828
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:29,206
I don't remember at all.

829
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,746
(Just laughing)

830
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,046
Next.

831
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:35,916
(RYEOWOOK has lots of memories
with LEETEUK.)

832
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,086
That's when we were honorary ambassadors
of Switzerland.

833
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,486
Why are you
suddenly taking LEETEUK's side?

834
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,456
That doesn't look like Switzerland.

835
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,426
You're so bad at taking selfies.

836
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,726
Isn't that the cable car in Namsan?

837
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:50,036
No, that's Switzerland.
Behind us is the Alps.

838
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:51,566
That doesn't look like Switzerland at all.

839
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:53,266
(Glaring, silent right away)

840
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,206
- RYEOWOOK's pictures.
- Should we keep any of them?

841
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:56,876
Four pictures. The first one.

842
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,736
RYEOWOOK joining the military.

843
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:01,676
(Three for it, five against it)

844
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:02,776
Is this the worst picture?

845
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:04,076
Yes, it's absolutely the worst one.

846
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:06,146
(The majority always wins.)

847
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:07,486
(One of RYEOWOOK's pictures is out.)

848
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:09,186
This is one of the worst pictures.

849
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:11,456
- Don't be like that.
- Is this the worst one?

850
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:14,256
(Even after that,)

851
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:19,096
(his pictures got boos.)

852
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:22,726
(Dumbfounded)

853
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:26,366
All of RYEOWOOK's pictures are the worst.
This is a first.

854
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:32,536
Let's not boo
just because we're not in the picture.

855
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,346
Let's choose after we see all of them.

856
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:36,916
Next is SIWON's pictures.

857
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:37,916
SIWON.

858
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:40,786
I can see them before everyone else
and it's hard for me to hold back.

859
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:42,446
Embrace yourselves.

860
00:31:43,456 --> 00:31:46,426
(What are the pictures that
Hollywood star SIWON chose?)

861
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,226
SIWON's first picture.

862
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:55,696
(Unaccountable intention)

863
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,166
(Dumbfounded)

864
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,336
I can't even.

865
00:31:58,336 --> 00:32:00,036
Why submit your selfies?

866
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:03,136
(What did I just see?)

867
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:07,476
(Where are
SUPER JUNIOR's memories together?)

868
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,876
(SIWON looks like he has a lot to say.)

869
00:32:09,876 --> 00:32:11,516
They told me to bring my pictures.

870
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:13,546
By that, they meant...

871
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:16,186
you should bring the pictures you have.

872
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,886
(Bummer)

873
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:21,026
But it's funny how all four look the same.

874
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,256
SIWON, did you take them on the same day?

875
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,996
SIWON is good at taking selfies.

876
00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:27,766
You're better than RYEOWOOK.

877
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,726
Is that a photo card?

878
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:31,436
It doesn't match the theme.

879
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:34,806
How far below are you going, SHINDONG?

880
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:37,106
How far below are you going, SHINDONG?

881
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:43,216
(The judge has no limit
in the range of evaluation.)

882
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:51,386
(Will there be something below these?)

883
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,086
Next.

884
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:56,386
I didn't really get
the exact instructions, either.

885
00:32:57,256 --> 00:33:00,326
I brought pictures of myself...

886
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,566
that bring back memories.

887
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,626
That's so scary.

888
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:03,996
(Peekaboo)

889
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:07,366
That's so scary.

890
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,266
(He's also scared!)

891
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:10,506
(This...)

892
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,976
(won't do.)

893
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:13,876
Bring it.

894
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,616
(Angry mob crowding in)

895
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,016
I didn't even explain.

896
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:19,646
I haven't explained anything yet.

897
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:22,516
(The photo exhibition became chaos.)

898
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:24,556
- Mine is better.
- That's not true.

899
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:27,486
Mine is better.
His selfie is hard to watch.

900
00:33:27,486 --> 00:33:30,826
That one brings back memories
of all the members.

901
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:33,296
- Leave it at the front.
- For the first time,

902
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:35,866
in the rest area on our way back
from an event in the provinces,

903
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:37,996
the members threw
a surprise birthday party for me.

904
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,406
I was on a diet then,
so I barely ate anything.

905
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:42,036
(A picture with a precious memory)

906
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:43,576
But you look so scary.

907
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,406
(Growl)

908
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,676
(Something between cute and scary)

909
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:51,516
(SHINDONG's second picture)

910
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:53,786
I love that memory.

911
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:54,946
I was touched then.

912
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:55,886
I also have that picture.

913
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:58,586
(A group picture of everyone
wearing uniforms after getting discharged)

914
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,956
(HEECHUL is not here again.)

915
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,856
You didn't do the concert with us.

916
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:04,096
That was when we shot the concert video.

917
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:05,456
You should work.

918
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,866
(Embarrassed)

919
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:07,766
You should work.

920
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:11,466
After this video played,
the members went on stage...

921
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,136
- and we did "Attention!"
- Yes, I remember.

922
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,366
We saluted and that made me emotional.

923
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:15,636
This one does bring back memories.

924
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:19,306
Look how each of us are showing
our different styles with the uniform.

925
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:21,746
But why is LEETEUK's mom
wearing a uniform here again?

926
00:34:22,606 --> 00:34:23,546
Isn't that Kangnam?

927
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,376
- Kangnam.
- Kangnam.

928
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:27,986
(Even the part is the same.)

929
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,186
Lee Sang Hwa's husband.

930
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:31,186
(One picture got to the high rank.)

931
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:32,656
Next.

932
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,226
YESUNG likes taking pictures.

933
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:35,286
I can't wait.

934
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:37,226
YESUNG is a great photographer.

935
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:39,556
That's great.

936
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:41,326
(SM Concert picture taken in 2017)

937
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:43,996
- That's from SM Town, right?
- I cried a lot that day.

938
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,736
Many members were not there
because of the military.

939
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:47,806
But I wanted to perform together.

940
00:34:47,806 --> 00:34:50,536
So I said "I miss you guys"
in our group chat,

941
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:51,506
and DONGHAE saw that,

942
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,706
and he went absent without leave
or something to come and see me.

943
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:56,406
(Did I?)

944
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:57,676
- In the military?
- I was on leave.

945
00:34:57,676 --> 00:35:00,016
- I was on leave.
- If that's true, he can't be here.

946
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,446
I'm saying he did that much
to come to see me.

947
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:05,456
That's the day I really felt
how priceless the members are to me.

948
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,986
Everyone looks okay except for YESUNG.

949
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:12,396
(Only four members had to fill the places
of the rest.)

950
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:20,666
(Their performance struck
particularly hard that day.)

951
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:25,276
(Reminiscent)

952
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:26,176
I can't wait.

953
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,346
(What's YESUNG's next picture?)

954
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,376
I can't wait.

955
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:31,846
(The public reaction completely changed.)

956
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,646
(Gosh)

957
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:37,056
Stick that way below.

958
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,786
(The judge sticks it below right away.)

959
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,926
(Welcome to the lower part.)

960
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:45,856
(Flustered at
the unexpectedly negative reaction.)

961
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,426
I think that's my hand.

962
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,236
That was in Chile.

963
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:51,466
- The winery.
- LEETEUK.

964
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:53,406
You, SIWON, and DONGHAE.

965
00:35:53,406 --> 00:35:56,406
We went to a winery and shot
the music video of "Lo Siento."

966
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,506
(Happy)

967
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:07,686
But that doesn't look like a winery.

968
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,286
- Pass.
- Okay, next.

969
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:10,286
That's it, that's all YESUNG has.

970
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:12,216
- Is it?
- I'll vote for the SM Town picture.

971
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:13,886
Me, too.

972
00:36:13,886 --> 00:36:15,726
(One of YESUNG's pictures survived.)

973
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:16,586
When will I be in any of the pictures?

974
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:18,926
- Who's next?
- EUNHYUK.

975
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,826
It's my turn.

976
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,426
Wait. Are you sure about this?

977
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,666
Here we go.

978
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:25,596
(Shocking)

979
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:31,206
What's that?

980
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:34,106
Are the eyes above or below?

981
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,846
Did you have blue hair?

982
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:36,976
That was during "SUPER Clap."

983
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,946
If this is chosen as the worst picture,

984
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,016
does EUNHYUK get a penalty or LEETEUK?

985
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:42,486
- EUNHYUK.
- LEETEUK.

986
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:43,956
(Showing comradeship and yielding)

987
00:36:43,956 --> 00:36:45,086
(Go down.)

988
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:46,926
That should be way below.

989
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,456
That's not that bad.

990
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,696
It's funny.

991
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:52,896
- Okay, next.
- There's another one.

992
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,196
This is the next picture.

993
00:36:56,936 --> 00:36:57,936
- Who's that?
- I took that picture.

994
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,036
- Is that me?
- We were shooting "SJ Returns."

995
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,206
- We were in a karaoke room.
- That's right.

996
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:04,436
SHINDONG, you look like Kim Min Seok
of MeloMance.

997
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:06,076
I look handsome.

998
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:09,746
All of EUNHYUK's pictures
are a bit of a letdown.

999
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:11,346
(What does EUNHYUK's last picture
look like?)

1000
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:12,746
The last one.

1001
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:13,916
The last one.

1002
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,416
(Moaning members)

1003
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,956
(The last picture is not that great.)

1004
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:23,326
What kind of picture do you want?

1005
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,996
When was that?
What memory does that one bring back?

1006
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:26,626
That was during SM Town.

1007
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:27,626
In Japan.

1008
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:29,696
(This is not that great.)

1009
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:31,266
Wait. Who's that in the back?

1010
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:34,506
(Watching carefully)

1011
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,076
(YESUNG is doing something.)

1012
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:38,736
What is YESUNG taking out of the bag?

1013
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:40,776
YESUNG is ransacking someone else's bag.

1014
00:37:41,746 --> 00:37:43,076
He's ransacking someone else's bag.

1015
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:51,056
(That's not YESUNG's bag?)

1016
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:53,256
Isn't that SIWON's bag?

1017
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,286
Isn't that my bag?

1018
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:59,056
That's my bag.

1019
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:00,666
(The photo exhibition
becomes chaos again.)

1020
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,126
What are you doing with my bag?

1021
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:03,996
That's my bag.

1022
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,236
He's right.

1023
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:09,936
(Is that really SIWON's bag?)

1024
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:12,376
I have that, too.

1025
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:13,946
YESUNG doesn't carry bags like that.

1026
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:15,976
I have that one, too.

1027
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,446
YESUNG also ransacks my bag.

1028
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:18,446
Now that I think about it.

1029
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:19,976
(Is YESUNG's hobby
ransacking other people's bags?)

1030
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:21,686
That's not YESUNG.

1031
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,586
(Teasing YESUNG is fun.)

1032
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,186
I do have that bag, too.

1033
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:27,626
The title of this picture is...

1034
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:28,786
"Caught You."

1035
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,896
(Caught You)

1036
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,366
(Time to evaluate EUNHYUK's pictures)

1037
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:39,096
(His picture ranked high right away.)

1038
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:41,636
He didn't even think of me,
but why is it the best picture?

1039
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:42,536
I'm relieved.

1040
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:44,806
(Thanks to YESUNG, he's in the high rank.)

1041
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:45,936
"Caught You."

1042
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:48,606
The staff expected us
to look at the pictures...

1043
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,816
and talk
about beautiful memories together.

1044
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:54,316
(If it's funny, it's fine.)

1045
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:55,386
Here's the next one.

1046
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:56,816
(LEETEUK's pictures)

1047
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:58,786
It was my first fan meeting event
after I got discharged,

1048
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:00,686
but there was no chair.

1049
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:02,486
Why do a fan meeting event with no chairs?

1050
00:39:02,486 --> 00:39:04,326
We couldn't find a place with chairs.

1051
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:05,826
I had four fan meeting events that day.

1052
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:07,926
The first one was at 9 a.m.

1053
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:10,066
(Standing up all day)

1054
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:11,636
But that's not a memory we all share.

1055
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:15,166
(Poor reaction for the second picture)

1056
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,606
That's when "Kiss the Radio" got an award.

1057
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:17,976
I cannot relate to that at all.

1058
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:19,476
You should bring something we share.

1059
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:21,206
But why am I in the banner?

1060
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:22,446
Why is it RYEOWOOK?

1061
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,416
- He got the award on behalf of RYEOWOOK.
- Because RYEOWOOK was in the military.

1062
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:27,086
I received the award on behalf of him.

1063
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,216
(Okay, got it.)

1064
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:33,416
(A precious memory only for LEETEUK
placed just somewhere on the board)

1065
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,626
Lastly, HEECHUL's pictures.

1066
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:35,956
Why am I the last to go?

1067
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:38,996
(Taking the COVID-19 test
with the members)

1068
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:41,526
This is what you call
a picture bringing back memories.

1069
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,896
RYEOWOOK's face was hilarious then.

1070
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:47,136
RYEOWOOK was funny
so HEECHUL took a video of him.

1071
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:58,046
It hurt so much.

1072
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,816
We weren't in a good mood at the time.

1073
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,816
But they poked us so hard
so we ended up laughing.

1074
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,756
Let's watch a video of EUNHYUK, too.

1075
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:14,026
(Shocking visual)

1076
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:16,566
I look seriously bad.

1077
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:17,666
Okay, next.

1078
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:18,736
(HEECHUL's next picture)

1079
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:19,996
This is a very long time ago.

1080
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:23,836
(So young)

1081
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:26,136
(When we were young trainees)

1082
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:28,176
That was when...

1083
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,276
you guys weren't there yet.

1084
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:30,576
When you guys weren't there yet.

1085
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:31,576
Exactly.

1086
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:33,576
- You guys weren't there.
- Weren't?

1087
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:35,546
Okay, then. This goes down.

1088
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:38,616
(HEECHUL looks for a different picture.)

1089
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:41,026
- This isn't a memory SUPER JUNIOR shares.
- I can't relate.

1090
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:43,796
(Mercilessly brought down)

1091
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:46,356
We should rather use the board
upside down.

1092
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,366
(The lowest group is full.)

1093
00:40:48,366 --> 00:40:49,926
This is it.

1094
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:51,696
Thanks, everyone.

1095
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,206
- But there isn't any we can exhibit.
- I have one.

1096
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:55,936
I think "Caught You" is the funniest.

1097
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:57,606
(Strong candidate)

1098
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:59,276
But that's...

1099
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:00,506
We need something
that brings back memories.

1100
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:03,916
(They should first choose 20 pictures
for the photo exhibition.)

1101
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:06,076
Then...

1102
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:08,616
I think it'll be fun
if we exhibit this kind of picture.

1103
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,956
Let's exhibit this one.

1104
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:14,686
Show really funny pictures
like this one.

1105
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:16,026
(They're choosing pictures they like.)

1106
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:18,496
Let's exhibit the picture
of when we were trainees.

1107
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:21,526
- Okay.
- Why pick that one?

1108
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,566
(I'm going to add this.)

1109
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,296
No, guys.

1110
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:28,436
(Sheriff KYUHYUN on the move)

1111
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,166
These can't be accepted.

1112
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,976
(The two are back in their places.)

1113
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:34,206
Why is this here?

1114
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:36,246
(SIWON's photo card is also returned.)

1115
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:40,216
(He stealthily puts up a picture
of himself looking nice.)

1116
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:42,616
He's just putting up pictures
of himself looking good.

1117
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:46,486
(Arresting him for authority abuse)

1118
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:49,226
(Show a picture of us, too.)

1119
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:52,726
(Focusing again
to choose 20 pictures to exhibit)

1120
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,366
We need one scary picture.

1121
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:56,466
(The four awards picture is up.)

1122
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:58,466
(And the COVID-19 test picture, too)

1123
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,606
- We need one more.
- That one.

1124
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:03,536
The picture of us in the dorm
during the World Cup was nice.

1125
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:05,976
(Lastly, DONGHAE's picture)

1126
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:07,406
Okay! Three of mine are up!

1127
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:09,646
(So excited)

1128
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:11,476
Then DONGHAE is in the first place.

1129
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:16,086
(DONGHAE has the highest chance
to get his picture chosen.)

1130
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:17,256
I want that instant camera.

1131
00:42:17,256 --> 00:42:20,486
(DONGHAE really wants that camera.)

1132
00:42:20,486 --> 00:42:21,726
That camera looks nice.

1133
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:25,126
Among them,
we have to choose the best one.

1134
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,196
I'll go first.

1135
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:28,896
First of all, the best one.

1136
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:30,896
(Which one does SHINDONG choose?)

1137
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:34,106
I would like to choose this day
when we all gathered after discharge.

1138
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:34,966
I like that one, too.

1139
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:37,336
I just liked this one when I saw it.

1140
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:38,936
(Voting for his own picture)

1141
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:40,036
And the worst one.

1142
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:41,976
The worst one is obvious.

1143
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,176
Definitely.

1144
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,316
(What's the worst one they are sure of?)

1145
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:47,716
I think this is the worst.

1146
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:50,016
Me, too.

1147
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:51,586
Because nobody's face even shows.

1148
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,756
(Is this certainly the worst?)

1149
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:56,326
It seems really meaningless.

1150
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:59,326
(YESUNG's picture gets one vote
as the worst one.)

1151
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,866
- RYEOWOOK's turn.
- I choose "Caught You."

1152
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:04,136
"Caught You."

1153
00:43:04,136 --> 00:43:06,536
One vote.

1154
00:43:06,536 --> 00:43:08,436
"Caught You."

1155
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:10,366
- And the worst one.
- Caught him.

1156
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:12,276
I think this is the worst.

1157
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:15,446
That's not that bad.

1158
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:18,246
(SHINDONG and EUNHYUK
in a karaoke room together)

1159
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:21,146
(EUNHYUK's picture gets one vote each
for the best and worst pictures.)

1160
00:43:21,146 --> 00:43:23,146
- DONGHAE's turn.
- I choose...

1161
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:25,356
He really wants that camera.

1162
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:26,986
This one, of course.

1163
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:28,756
It was our first show.

1164
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:31,156
- Let's remember this.
- But the handwriting sucks.

1165
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,826
(Try this to angry YESUNG.)

1166
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:34,826
(Kiss)

1167
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:38,266
(Kiss)

1168
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,336
(He becomes mild.)

1169
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:43,336
No voting for one's own picture.

1170
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:45,136
From now on,
you can't vote for your own picture.

1171
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:47,806
(What DONGHAE votes as the worst)

1172
00:43:47,806 --> 00:43:50,106
(YESUNG's picture)

1173
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:52,216
(Bitter)

1174
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,346
(YESUNG got two votes
for the worst picture.)

1175
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:57,316
(What does YESUNG think is the best one?)

1176
00:43:57,316 --> 00:43:58,716
No voting for your own picture.

1177
00:43:58,716 --> 00:44:00,386
But they all voted for their own pictures.

1178
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:01,786
From now on, you can't.

1179
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:03,756
(Teasing YESUNG is just too much fun!)

1180
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:04,956
Good, well done.

1181
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:06,026
Then I choose...

1182
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:08,196
this one.

1183
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:10,566
(The camera's mine.)

1184
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,766
(Keeping the lead with two votes)

1185
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:13,966
And the worst one?

1186
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:17,476
(Choosing without hesitation)

1187
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,436
This is a close match.

1188
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:22,046
(The match between the worst pictures
is unexpectedly fierce.)

1189
00:44:22,046 --> 00:44:24,146
I get why this can be the worst
because there are no faces.

1190
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:26,176
But why is this the worst?

1191
00:44:26,176 --> 00:44:28,486
With that, the faces shouldn't have shown.

1192
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:30,656
Why? There's no reason.

1193
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:32,686
But what's common between both is...

1194
00:44:32,686 --> 00:44:33,686
that EUNHYUK is in both of them.

1195
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:35,626
(The largest shareholder
of the worst pictures, EUNHYUK)

1196
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:37,856
(SIWON also chooses
DONGHAE's picture as the best one.)

1197
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:41,096
(Interim review of the best pictures)

1198
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,396
- And the worst one?
- I think this is the worst.

1199
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:45,636
(One happy, one sad)

1200
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:46,566
You should think smart.

1201
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,836
Choosing the worst is fun.

1202
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:48,906
This is a close match.

1203
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:51,176
I considered this the best picture
all along.

1204
00:44:51,176 --> 00:44:52,606
"Caught You."

1205
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,306
"Caught You."

1206
00:44:54,306 --> 00:44:55,346
And the worst?

1207
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:58,346
I'll make it a close match.

1208
00:44:58,346 --> 00:45:01,016
Whatever picture is chosen among these,
EUNHYUK gets a penalty, right?

1209
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:04,256
Yes, because EUNHYUK is in both of them.

1210
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:06,356
The person in the picture
doesn't get a penalty.

1211
00:45:06,356 --> 00:45:08,226
Yes, they do, or this is unfair.

1212
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:10,356
All the while, I can't believe
SIWON's pictures aren't the worst.

1213
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:12,796
(The protected cards deflected
bad vibes.)

1214
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:14,696
(Standing up)

1215
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:17,026
- Thank you.
- Let's vote again.

1216
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:19,696
Next time, I'll be more careful.

1217
00:45:19,696 --> 00:45:20,536
Sorry.

1218
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:22,666
But aren't SIWON's pictures
truly the worst?

1219
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,906
But SIWON's face is the best.

1220
00:45:23,906 --> 00:45:25,076
Thank you.

1221
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:27,076
(What about me?)

1222
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:31,076
This is the only picture
with all of us present.

1223
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:33,416
So I choose this as the best one.

1224
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,486
I agree.

1225
00:45:34,486 --> 00:45:37,186
Everyone was too selfish
to bring a picture with all of us in it.

1226
00:45:37,186 --> 00:45:38,156
HEECHUL.

1227
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:39,986
Only you were missing in the pictures.

1228
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:43,486
(Humble apologies)

1229
00:45:43,486 --> 00:45:45,426
You promised to work with us
for the 20th anniversary, right?

1230
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:46,326
Of course, for the 20th anniversary.

1231
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,296
And for the worst one,
I have to choose between these two.

1232
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:50,026
Why is it between those two?

1233
00:45:50,026 --> 00:45:51,636
What's wrong with these pictures is this.

1234
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:53,936
YESUNG is a master at taking selfies.

1235
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:56,536
So if YESUNG was in this picture,

1236
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:57,876
it wouldn't have been the worst one.

1237
00:45:57,876 --> 00:46:00,076
On the other hand, EUNHYUK and SHINDONG...

1238
00:46:00,076 --> 00:46:02,076
have to hide their faces
to get the leverage.

1239
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:04,616
- Exactly.
- Why did the structure change?

1240
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:05,446
Good point.

1241
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,216
Just the hands showing is better...

1242
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:08,816
than these faces showing.

1243
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:11,456
So I choose this as the worst one.

1244
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:12,486
You shouldn't make people uncomfortable.

1245
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:14,286
EUNHYUK, why did your picture
become the worst?

1246
00:46:14,286 --> 00:46:16,686
Is that one that bad?

1247
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:19,526
(EUNHYUK walked in
because he was frustrated.)

1248
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,566
(SIWON just came to have fun watching.)

1249
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:23,666
- What's wrong with this one?
- Because you two...

1250
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,036
were just having fun together without us.

1251
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,806
But that one brings back memories.

1252
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,836
(What does EUNHYUK choose
as the best picture?)

1253
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:32,076
Among these three?

1254
00:46:32,076 --> 00:46:33,076
You can choose anything you want.

1255
00:46:33,076 --> 00:46:34,246
You can choose a new one, too.

1256
00:46:34,246 --> 00:46:36,076
I want to vote for this one.

1257
00:46:36,076 --> 00:46:37,076
Then do it.

1258
00:46:37,076 --> 00:46:39,476
(Voting for his own picture)

1259
00:46:39,476 --> 00:46:40,846
And the worst one?

1260
00:46:40,846 --> 00:46:43,016
Why is this the worst one?
This is ridiculous.

1261
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:46,216
(The two pictures got the same votes.)

1262
00:46:46,216 --> 00:46:48,226
Last is LEETEUK.

1263
00:46:48,226 --> 00:46:51,026
- Let's go.
- LEETEUK chooses the best one, too.

1264
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:52,726
(Candidate one for the best picture,
EUNHYUK's picture with four votes)

1265
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,966
(The picture that won the support
of the members)

1266
00:46:54,966 --> 00:46:57,966
("Caught You")

1267
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,436
(Candidate two for the best picture,
DONGHAE's picture with five votes)

1268
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:03,166
(Overall positive reaction)

1269
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:05,736
Who's that in the top right? Show us.

1270
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:09,946
(Brings back memories and is also funny)

1271
00:47:09,946 --> 00:47:12,246
(Memorable and hilarious picture)

1272
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,016
(Everything depends
on the leader's choice.)

1273
00:47:17,516 --> 00:47:18,656
(Gulp)

1274
00:47:18,656 --> 00:47:20,286
(Which one is honored
as the best picture?)

1275
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:23,326
I'll choose this as the best one.

1276
00:47:23,326 --> 00:47:26,796
(DONGHAE wins with the most votes.)

1277
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:28,896
(Congratulations)

1278
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,296
That was after we promoted "Sorry, Sorry."

1279
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:32,896
So we were all energetic.

1280
00:47:32,896 --> 00:47:34,036
Yes.

1281
00:47:34,036 --> 00:47:35,736
And the worst one.

1282
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:37,906
Can you please explain this again?

1283
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:39,836
When we were in Chile,

1284
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:41,806
I clinked glasses with the members then.

1285
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:44,176
- Just clinked glasses.
- He clinked glasses with EUNHYUK.

1286
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:46,046
(Indifferent)

1287
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:47,146
He clinked bad.

1288
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:50,546
(Failed to persuade LEETEUK)

1289
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:53,686
(Frozen)

1290
00:47:53,686 --> 00:47:56,686
(His picture was chosen as the worst one.)

1291
00:47:56,686 --> 00:47:58,696
(Relieved)

1292
00:47:58,696 --> 00:48:00,196
(Why are sad predictions never wrong?)

1293
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:01,126
That was a long explanation.

1294
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:06,766
The best picture to celebrate
SUPER JUNIOR's 20th anniversary is...

1295
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:09,066
DONGHAE's picture.

1296
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,236
Congratulations.

1297
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:13,876
(The owner of the worst picture
seems to have a lot to say.)

1298
00:48:13,876 --> 00:48:15,606
The owner of the worst picture is
already up.

1299
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,616
The worst picture is YESUNG's.

1300
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:19,846
(Encouraging applause for YESUNG)

1301
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:21,646
No... I'm a photographer.

1302
00:48:21,646 --> 00:48:25,416
DONGHAE who submitted
the best picture gets a gift.

1303
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:27,556
(Amazed)

1304
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:28,826
An instant camera.

1305
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:31,796
While working with the members
to celebrate our 20 years together,

1306
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:33,756
I will take lots of pictures...

1307
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:35,496
to make pleasant memories.

1308
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:39,496
And for the photographer
of the worst one?

1309
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:41,206
What penalty does he get?

1310
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:42,966
EUNHYUK is actually the one.

1311
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:44,106
Because he's in both pictures.

1312
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,006
Exactly.

1313
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,236
It's not me.

1314
00:48:46,236 --> 00:48:49,246
(The heat is on EUNHYUK.)

1315
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:52,746
If EUNHYUK doesn't get a penalty with me,
I won't get anything.

1316
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:54,286
I think I'm about to get a muscle cramp.

1317
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:56,346
Two of them together will look better.

1318
00:48:56,346 --> 00:48:58,016
You two should get a penalty together.

1319
00:48:58,016 --> 00:48:59,416
For the worst picture,

1320
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:02,356
YESUNG and EUNHYUK will get a penalty.

1321
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,456
It should only be YESUNG, not me.

1322
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:05,696
(Stay tuned for their penalty.)

1323
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:08,426
SUPER JUNIOR's Swallowing Back
Spoken Words Project.

1324
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:10,696
Today, we proceeded
with what we mentioned before.

1325
00:49:10,696 --> 00:49:13,336
Although I got a penalty,

1326
00:49:13,336 --> 00:49:15,706
I'm still the ending fairy.

1327
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:17,606
We'll go home now.

1328
00:49:18,176 --> 00:49:20,106
(See you next time.)

1329
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:23,976
(Welcome to "I'm Super Solo.")

1330
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:26,746
I'm here to find a decent partner.

1331
00:49:27,946 --> 00:49:29,486
I'll hold it for you.

1332
00:49:29,486 --> 00:49:30,956
(Flirting on their first encounter)

1333
00:49:30,956 --> 00:49:33,116
(Dancing to show off his charm)

1334
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:35,756
(Super Solos fall in love
with each other.)

1335
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:36,856
(It would be, but...)

1336
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:38,296
(Shocked)

1337
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:40,426
Did you poo in your pants?

1338
00:49:40,426 --> 00:49:41,326
(Endless dissing)

1339
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:42,326
I'm leaving this place.

1340
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:43,966
I work as a ***.

1341
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:46,596
(Lying from the start?)

1342
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:49,836
(A series of strange shows)

1343
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:51,406
I think everyone's out of their minds.

1344
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,376
(They're looking for partners.)

1345
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:56,406
(Among love confessions and disses)

1346
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:57,876
(Staring)

1347
00:49:57,876 --> 00:49:58,999
(Will they be able
to find their partners?)

1348
