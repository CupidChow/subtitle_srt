1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,500
This is my house.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,800
What's this?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
Back then, we didn't live like this.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
The interior design is insane.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,410
The house is amazing.

6
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,580
Is this bed a playground or what?

7
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,750
(SHINDONG's taste is reflected
all over the place.)

8
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,650
This place is totally different
from the place we used to live in.

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,450
Exactly.

10
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,050
(Dorm life stories that can't be left out)

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,820
Is it one member per house?

12
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,190
Yes, he said that.

13
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,390
(Now we can finally talk about it.)

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,490
(After the fight
between LEETEUK and HEECHUL)

15
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,260
I said "LEETEUK, we need to talk."

16
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,390
I have nothing to say to you.

17
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,660
(Second fight that happened in the dorm)

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,130
So I had to leave.

19
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,160
(Nostalgic stories about the dorm
after a long time)

20
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,630
(Woke Up to SuperTV)

21
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,040
Honestly, I didn't expect a lot
from you guys today,

22
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,270
but I didn't think
you'd actually come empty-handed.

23
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,070
I brought toilet paper.

24
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,510
Yes. Others should've brought
toilet paper as well, at least.

25
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,580
Aren't you going to use them at home?

26
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,550
- No.
- Did you bring them to take them home?

27
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,780
(Was that from your grocery run?)

28
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,520
No wonder you didn't give it to me
and just left it at the door.

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,550
(Alone)

30
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,790
Can I make a confession?

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,330
(Did you buy something else, too?)

32
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,600
It was a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

33
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,630
Don't tell him that.

34
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,800
I thought bringing two
would make it obvious it was a deal,

35
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,370
so I only brought one.

36
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,070
Wouldn't people just think you bought two?

37
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,610
(Is giving two gifts that big of a deal?)

38
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,210
(Feeling guilty and confessing
about the deal)

39
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,120
I knew this would happen,
so I prepared a big event.

40
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,580
Big event.

41
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,650
What's this?

42
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,420
- What is it all of a sudden?
- Is it a game?

43
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,720
Welcome to SHINDONG's house.

44
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,360
To everyone who shamelessly came
to the housewarming empty-handed,

45
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,660
I will give you a special opportunity.

46
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,900
You will now participate
in a variety of games.

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,300
Is this "Squid Game?"

48
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,600
Are we going to die?

49
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,340
He sounds like Gong Yoo of "Squid Game."

50
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,610
Dong Yoo.

51
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,840
Dong Yoo?

52
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,510
- Mr. Dong Yoo.
- That sounds like I'd be really oily.

53
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,710
Isn't it Shin Yoo?

54
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,080
(It suits him.)

55
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,150
The winner of the game
will receive a big prize.

56
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,990
But you'll have to choose
whether to take it to your house,

57
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,160
or donate it to SHINDONG's house
under your name.

58
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,330
- Of course, I'm taking it.
- What are you talking about?

59
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,360
Who would donate it? I'm taking it.

60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,160
To explain simply,

61
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,900
if you take the gift,

62
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,330
you'll have to film it at your own house,

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,870
and it'll be aired.

64
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,840
Film it ourselves?

65
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,410
No, with at least five staff members.

66
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,080
But is the prize that good?

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,940
So you look at the item and think...

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,880
whether it's worth filming
in your house and decide...

69
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,380
whether to leave it here...

70
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,020
or take it.

71
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,720
Alright then, everyone.

72
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Will you play the game with me now?

73
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,160
"Squid Game."

74
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,630
(Who will win the game?)

75
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,100
Let's begin
SHINDONG's Frugal Housewarming Game!

76
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
The first game comes
with an amazing prize.

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Let's reveal the first prize.

78
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,040
(What's the first prize?)

79
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,610
What's that?

80
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,010
Wireless earphones
made in collaboration with the leader...

81
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,180
of the world-famous Black Eyed Peas,
will.i.am.

82
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,750
- Seriously?
- And a speaker with 360-degree sound...

83
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,950
and eye-catching lights.

84
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,520
(Bluetooth speaker
with a sleek design)

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
How pretty.

86
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,920
- They're really giving this to us?
- Yes.

87
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,490
But if I take this,

88
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,490
all those staff members will come
to my house.

89
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,230
For just this speaker.

90
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,300
That's too much.

91
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,370
Let me be clear.

92
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,630
To film that, they need insert shots.

93
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,440
(SHINDONG's conditions
getting more intense)

94
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,040
And a one-hour setup before and after,

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,340
so three hours total.

96
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,940
- Is he serious?
- Three hours, minimum of five people.

97
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,850
Five cameras.

98
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,980
And the scriptwriters?

99
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,020
- The scriptwriters join.
- And the producers?

100
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,380
Scriptwriters and producers,
15 people total.

101
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,750
- They're all coming.
- All for this speaker?

102
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,820
Of course.

103
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,590
Three hours just for insert shots?

104
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,560
That's a lot to think about.

105
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,660
Let's begin right away.

106
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,970
Everyone,

107
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,570
please choose a dish
that you'd like to eat from the menu.

108
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,770
Starting with RYEOWOOK.

109
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,070
But we just ate.

110
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,270
I'm so full.

111
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,580
There's spicy honeycomb pork and squid.

112
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,150
These are hard names.

113
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,350
Numbing dumpling hot pot.

114
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,520
Spicy pepper mayo rice balls.

115
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,620
Isn't this that game?

116
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,020
It feels like it.

117
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,720
(As expected, the Perfect Pitch game?)

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,430
I'll go with spicy pepper mayo rice balls.

119
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,790
- I think that's the easiest one.
- Spicy pepper one?

120
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,930
(Picking a menu
without knowing what it is)

121
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll take juicy shrimp dim sum.

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,430
Soft tofu egg stew.

123
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,170
(Menus flying off the shelves)

124
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,670
I'll go with chewy sweet and sour pork.

125
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,940
- Chewy sweet and sour pork.
- We'd better practice these names.

126
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,940
(Starting practice
from "juicy shrimp dim sum" right away)

127
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,780
Juicy...

128
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,350
(Why can't you say
"juicy shrimp dim sum" properly?)

129
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,610
- You're done.
- What about you, LEETEUK?

130
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,780
I'll go
with bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken.

131
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,650
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken.

132
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,950
Bulgogi-flavored stirry...

133
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,160
(I give up.)

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,460
(It's a "Perfect" Pitch game.)

135
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,190
I'll go
with stir-fried tripe with perilla seed.

136
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,330
Try it. Go.

137
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,330
Stir-fried...

138
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,430
You're already done.

139
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,000
(Chuckles awkwardly)

140
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,500
Spicy pepper mayo rice balls.

141
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,870
(Possessed with absolute pitch)

142
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,170
HEECHUL.

143
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,940
You should win this
and take everyone to your house.

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
Spicee...

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,210
This game is hard.

146
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,180
RYEOWOOK, what's yours?

147
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,650
Chewy sweet and sour pork.

148
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,820
Try it. Go.

149
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,650
Chewy sweet and sour pork.

150
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,380
Chewy swit...

151
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,520
- I'm winning this one.
- HEECHUL.

152
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,620
This is hard.

153
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,260
Everyone picked a menu, right?

154
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,490
Now let me explain
what game we're playing.

155
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,630
Let's get started now...

156
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,100
with the Four-Beat game.

157
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,330
The rules are the same
as the I Am Ground game.

158
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,440
It's not the Perfect Pitch game?

159
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,770
Nope.

160
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,970
The food you just picked
will not be your name...

161
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,050
but the name of the member to your right.

162
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,950
The name of the member to your right.

163
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,220
(They chose carefully for no reason.)

164
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,150
The name HEECHUL picked
will be SIWON's name.

165
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,620
So you're spicy pepper mayo rice balls.

166
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,960
(Chaos as they realize
they're using their neighbor's menu)

167
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
What did you choose again?

168
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,530
Juicy shrimp dim sum.

169
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,130
Juicy shrimp dim sum.

170
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,360
Juicy.

171
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,500
No switching seats?

172
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,570
Introduce yourselves.

173
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,900
For example...

174
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,410
You start.

175
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,540
(Loud and chaotic)

176
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,010
You have to say
"I'm chewy sweet and sour pork."

177
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,780
(You must start with "I'm.")

178
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,950
(Understood)

179
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,050
I get it.
<i>Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken</i>

180
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,450
That's not it.

181
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,290
(Makes the stir-fried chicken
have countryside vibes)

182
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,290
<i>You're not allowed
to play the game however you want</i>

183
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,920
You first, introduce yourself.

184
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,530
(Finally, the self-introduction begins.)

185
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,960
Soft tofu egg stew.

186
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,900
Chewy sweet and sour pork.

187
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
- Next?
- Spicy pepper mayo rice balls.

188
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,840
Stir-fried tripe with perilla seed.

189
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,170
(Already in danger)

190
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,070
Juicy shrimp dim sum.

191
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,870
- Next?
- Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken.

192
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,180
His name is easy. Attack him.

193
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,680
(Spreading propaganda)

194
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,220
(Practicing fiercely)

195
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,220
- Let's go slow.
- We'll start with RYEOWOOK.

196
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,090
- No practice round?
- No practice round.

197
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,260
We'll start right away.

198
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,560
(The game starts.)

199
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,290
Starting now.

200
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,090
RYEOWOOK.

201
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,900
Four stir-fried tripe with perseedy.

202
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,930
What are you doing?

203
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,500
(That menu doesn't even exist.)

204
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,570
You're out. Get out.

205
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,670
(Stir-fried tripe is offended.)

206
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:21,904
- It was too tasty.
- RYEOWOOK.

207
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,904
You have to say "four" at the end.

208
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,404
One, two, three, four.

209
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,034
(Struggling)

210
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,444
Let's play again starting with LEETEUK.

211
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:31,674
You're out for real
if you mess up this time.

212
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,644
(Confident)

213
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,384
The game starts now.

214
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,184
(Soft tofu egg stew)

215
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:38,984
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken, four.

216
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,554
Bulgogi burger, bulgogi...

217
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:41,784
Fail.

218
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,154
(It's hard, right?)

219
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:45,524
This is hard.

220
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,624
- It's really hard.
- How are you supposed to do this?

221
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:48,724
You did well, though.

222
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:50,224
How are you supposed to do this?

223
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:51,634
(Don't worry, you're out anyway.)

224
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:53,394
I'm not playing anymore.

225
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:55,334
(Pouting?)

226
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,334
(Sulky DONGHAE is out.)

227
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,874
We're starting from LEETEUK, right?

228
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:00,774
(The game restarts with five players.)

229
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,674
The game starts now.

230
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,244
Soft tofu egg stew, four.

231
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:05,674
(Nervous)

232
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:08,244
Soft tofu egg stew.

233
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,114
(Not sure)

234
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,214
(That much is fine.)

235
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:11,314
Does that count?

236
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,584
You guys are bad at this.

237
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:13,684
Chewy sweet and sour pork, four.

238
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:16,124
Chewy sweet and sour pork.

239
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:17,294
Chewy sweet and sour pork, four.

240
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:20,424
(Rapid-fire sweet and sour pork)

241
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,194
He's good.

242
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,234
Spicy pepper mayo rice balls, four.

243
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,434
Spicy pepper, spicy spice.

244
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,734
(Identity crisis)

245
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:31,304
This is the game of the common people.

246
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,574
SIWON, move out.

247
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,204
Let's all scoot over.

248
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:35,744
(The noble SIWON is out.)

249
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:38,374
You have to be good at rapping.
I can't rap.

250
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:40,614
Let's play one more round after this.

251
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,244
(Sad to be out)

252
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:45,854
YESUNG starts now.

253
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:49,224
(Start with four player)

254
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,124
Chewy sweet and sour pork, four.

255
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:56,324
(MC HEECHUL makes his debut.)

256
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,934
(He's killing it.)

257
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,364
Stir-fried tripe with perilla seed, four.

258
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:05,204
(The rapper suddenly attacks.)

259
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:08,044
Stir...

260
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:10,874
(Unable to express with subtitles)

261
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:11,974
Fail.

262
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,174
(YESUNG is out.)

263
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:14,814
Scoot over.

264
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:17,244
- Let's go.
- HEECHUL.

265
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:19,214
I'm the God of Games.

266
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:20,754
The pronunciation is tough.

267
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,984
Stir-fried tripe
with perilla seed is hard.

268
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,154
But now I want to eat stir-fried tripe.

269
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:25,994
Only the three of us left now?

270
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:28,664
Let's start with RYEOWOOK.

271
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:29,694
Let's go.

272
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,364
(The three-cornered fight begins.)

273
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,404
Chewy sweet and sour pork, one.

274
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:37,934
(Easy peasy)

275
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,274
Juicy shrimp dim sum, four.

276
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:41,544
(Completely botched dim sum)

277
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,244
- Fail.
- Why?

278
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,514
What was with that pronunciation?

279
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,344
It was right.

280
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:49,044
You need
at least HEECHUL's level of pronunciation.

281
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:50,814
Was it too garbled?

282
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,284
(Fast and furious rapping)

283
00:09:57,284 --> 00:10:00,354
(Show Me the Dim Sum)

284
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:01,724
(Smack)

285
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,434
(You witty man)

286
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:06,334
You should've started like this.

287
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:10,004
(The serious student)

288
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,374
(YESUNG,
bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken is...)

289
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:17,514
(A divine demonstration)

290
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:20,614
(Like a top student going solo)

291
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:24,154
(Mom, sign me up
for an after-school class.)

292
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:27,824
MC, is this allowed?

293
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,484
- Is this allowed?
- That's allowed.

294
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:30,724
Adding motions is allowed?

295
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:32,994
(Warming up)

296
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,964
He's a variety show expert.

297
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,694
(The star of the universe)

298
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:38,834
Our team's main vocal...

299
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:41,264
and our team's rogue are left.

300
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:45,274
The youngest versus the rogue.

301
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:48,674
One of them will either take it
or leave it.

302
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,004
I'm taking it.

303
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:53,344
(HEECHUL vs. RYEOWOOK, start)

304
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,244
The game starts now.

305
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,184
Soft tofu egg stew, four.

306
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,054
Soft tofu egg stew.

307
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:58,884
(On the line)

308
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,484
Soft tofu egg stew.

309
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:01,984
(I did it.)

310
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:02,784
What are you doing?

311
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:03,954
Fail.

312
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:07,194
- Soft tofu egg stew.
- Yes.

313
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:08,024
What are you doing?

314
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,094
(RYEOWOOK is out.)

315
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:12,164
What's the point if you only do your own?

316
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:14,404
He was so proud he got his line right.

317
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:17,164
(According to YESUNG,
RYEOWOOK was like this.)

318
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:19,504
(The joy of success was brief.)

319
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:20,774
Let's edit this out. This won't do.

320
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:22,144
Why not?

321
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:26,044
And that concludes Round One.

322
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:29,184
HEECHUL wins.

323
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,454
Show us once more. Encore.

324
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:34,324
(MC HEECHUL's encore performance)

325
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:36,324
(You're amazing.)

326
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:37,224
Let's do one more round.

327
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,154
HEECHUL, choose one of the two.

328
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:41,124
(He gets only one
between the speaker and earphones.)

329
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:42,094
You have to pick one.

330
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,564
(Acts cool and agrees to perform again)

331
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:45,264
- Which one's better?
- Earphones.

332
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,664
Chewy earphones.

333
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,904
(Losing himself in it)

334
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,474
Chewy speaker.

335
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:54,104
(Respect)

336
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,944
I'll go with these earphones.

337
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,714
One is left.

338
00:11:58,714 --> 00:11:59,674
Let's switch the menu.

339
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:00,914
Give me your name tags.

340
00:12:00,914 --> 00:12:05,454
It's boring this way,
so let's make it random.

341
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:06,584
- With these names?
- Yes.

342
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,124
But they're hard to pronounce.

343
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:10,384
Just saying it clearly is hard.

344
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:12,554
Other than HEECHUL, no one can do it.

345
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:13,694
(Amazed)

346
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:16,694
This is the funniest game
I've played this year.

347
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,064
(DONGHAE's favorite)

348
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:21,904
I'll toss these. Take one each.

349
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,404
(Ready to run out)

350
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:24,934
Ready.

351
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,644
(Chaos)

352
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:30,544
(The speaker is mine, too.)

353
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:35,444
(While everyone is scrambling
for menu names...)

354
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,654
(Classy)

355
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,154
Look at that nobleman.

356
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:44,194
(Are you all done, peasants?)

357
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,724
(Even the nobleman has chosen.)

358
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,194
Sit down.

359
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,024
What is this?

360
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:52,594
This is way too hard.

361
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:55,404
(Spicy tangy tom yum goong)

362
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:57,634
He already won once,
so he gets a new name.

363
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:58,804
That's hard.

364
00:12:58,804 --> 00:12:59,804
DONGHAE, what did you get?

365
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:02,544
Stir-fried tripe with perilla seed.

366
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:04,574
You're number one to lose.

367
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,574
Did you just grab what you wanted to eat?

368
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:07,944
This is way too hard.

369
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,544
- Let's go around with self-intros.
- Then start right away.

370
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:14,554
Then HEECHUL the winner will start.
Got it?

371
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:15,854
Freeze.

372
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:17,954
I've played this game before.

373
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:20,424
(Again?)

374
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,364
("Squid Game" addict.)

375
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:24,994
(Feeling embarrassed instead)

376
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:27,294
(Fascinated)

377
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:28,964
Keep it to three beats.

378
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,074
(Who will win this time?)

379
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:32,504
Starting with SIWON.

380
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,304
(SIWON's self-intro first)

381
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:35,204
Spicy honeycomb pork and squid.

382
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:36,904
- Good.
- Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken.

383
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:38,614
- Yes.
- Spicy tangy tom yum goong.

384
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,314
- Next?
- Soft tofu egg stew.

385
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:42,844
- Good.
- Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles.

386
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:44,414
Peril...

387
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:45,884
Why?

388
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:49,384
(Literally incomprehensible)

389
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:50,584
He couldn't introduce himself.

390
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:52,624
Stir-fried squid?

391
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,294
(Shameless)

392
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,024
Let's start from HEECHUL.

393
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:57,934
(Glance)

394
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,194
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken, four.

395
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:00,394
(Eyes fixed)

396
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,004
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken.

397
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,734
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken.

398
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,404
That's right.

399
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:06,374
Fail.

400
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:07,904
(Frozen)

401
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,474
(Proud)

402
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,974
(Didn't you forget something?)

403
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:15,044
Why am I like this?

404
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,684
I froze for real.

405
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:20,714
RYEOWOOK was just satisfied with himself.

406
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:21,584
Nice try.

407
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:23,484
(RYEOWOOK is out.)

408
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:25,254
RYEOWOOK is out.

409
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:28,794
I honestly thought
DONGHAE would be the first one to be out.

410
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:32,164
(Dead serious)

411
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,764
(Starting without RYEOWOOK)

412
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,164
Let's start from SIWON.

413
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:37,674
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles, four.

414
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:38,974
(Nervous eyes)

415
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,604
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles.

416
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:42,544
That rhythm...

417
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,644
That wasn't accurate. Hold on.

418
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:45,944
That rhythm was unpleasant.

419
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:48,584
It's just so unpleasant.

420
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,444
Say that again.

421
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:53,184
(Resetting the rhythm)

422
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,524
That's correct.

423
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:57,924
Soft tofu egg stew, four.

424
00:14:57,924 --> 00:15:01,424
Soft tofu egg stew.

425
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:04,064
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken,
three.

426
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,794
He's dead.

427
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:10,664
(Unrevivable)

428
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:14,104
(How silly)

429
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:16,544
Where's bulgogi-flavored
stir-fried chicken here?

430
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,274
I wanted to eat that.

431
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,214
And he rushed it and pronounced "three"...

432
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:21,584
thwee.

433
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:23,184
Bulgogi-flavored stir-fried chicken,
thwee.

434
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,114
That's stir-fried chicken, man.

435
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,454
Why'd you die?

436
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:28,584
(Poor stir-fried chicken takes the blame.)

437
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:30,784
Somehow I ended up here.

438
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:34,624
Neck-and-neck.
Let's start from DONGHAE now.

439
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:38,034
(Four player match)

440
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:39,734
Starting from DONGHAE.

441
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:41,634
Garlic bomb sp-c-n, four.

442
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:42,534
What?

443
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:43,534
(Give me a break.)

444
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:46,204
(Enjoy it while you're still in the game.)

445
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:49,474
(Perfect timing and pronunciation)

446
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:50,674
Stir-fried tripe with perilla seed, three.

447
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:53,774
Stir-fried tripe with perilla seed, three.

448
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,814
(Making the game slow)

449
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,344
Fail.

450
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,954
- Why?
- You started in the first beat.

451
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:02,684
Have you seen "Zootopia?"

452
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:05,654
(Slow laugh)

453
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,524
(Did I do that?)

454
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:12,894
(Two stir-fried tripe with sloths)

455
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:15,734
(Don't you think I'm right?)

456
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,334
(That's enough.)

457
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:20,374
Dong-topia.

458
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:22,044
(DONGHAE is out.)

459
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:25,274
Now LEETEUK, HEECHUL, and SIWON are left.

460
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:26,214
Let's go.

461
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:29,244
(Who will make it to the semi-finals?)

462
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,614
Spicy honeycomb pork and squid, three.

463
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,484
Spicy honeycomb pork squid shrimp, what?

464
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,654
(The nobleman's never played
this kind of game before.)

465
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:37,124
You haven't been attacked
until now, have you?

466
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:38,724
Right.

467
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40,794
Now it's guys born in 1983.

468
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:42,194
After the Incheon Battle...

469
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:42,994
(The Home Goods Battle
after the Incheon Battle)

470
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:44,934
Spicy tangy tom yum goong.

471
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,894
If LEETEUK wins and takes the prize,

472
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,304
each member born in 1983 gets one prize.

473
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,874
But if HEECHUL wins again,

474
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:55,474
he'll have two prizes
and must film for six hours.

475
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,474
- Okay?
- Right, since it's two prizes.

476
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,074
And the number of staff varies
per product.

477
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,614
So a total of 30 people will join you.

478
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:04,714
Thirty people will join you.

479
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:07,554
So if I win, I get two prizes.

480
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:08,554
(Math king)

481
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:11,124
But LEETEUK is serious, too.

482
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,224
Because he really loves free stuff.

483
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:17,224
(Drooling for it)

484
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,994
LEETEUK attacks first.

485
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,064
Start.

486
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,734
Starting from LEETEUK.

487
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,774
Spicy tangy tom yum goong, three.

488
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:27,134
Spicy tangy tom yum goong.

489
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:28,144
(Smooth)

490
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:29,444
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles, four.

491
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,944
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles.

492
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,714
(Neck and neck)

493
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:36,014
(He's good at this.)

494
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,514
(So that's how you want to play?)

495
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:40,354
(He stands up.)

496
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,324
(Performance begins.)

497
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:44,554
(The maestro of this area)

498
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:49,064
(I can't lose.)

499
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,334
(This is real hip-hop.)

500
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:53,594
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles, one.

501
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,234
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles.

502
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,674
Spicy tangy tom yum goong, two.

503
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,374
(I offer this rap to god.)

504
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:02,574
Garlic bomb spicy cold noodles, four.

505
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:05,674
(Suddenly outstanding)

506
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:08,784
(Overwhelmed)

507
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,584
Spicy tangy tom yum goong, three.

508
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:13,354
(Chaos)

509
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,884
Wassup!

510
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:15,954
Yes!

511
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:19,194
(Even DONGHAE starts dancing.)

512
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:22,364
(Adds choreography)

513
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:23,664
(Take that!)

514
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,564
(Spear vs. shield)

515
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,664
(This match is heating up.)

516
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:30,664
You guys are so good at this.

517
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:31,474
Good.

518
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:34,374
I need to assign something new.

519
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,474
Why are they so good at this?

520
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:37,504
Now that I've tried it,

521
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:39,574
I've learned that moving around
like HEECHUL really helps.

522
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:42,084
Change your names.

523
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,084
Take your name tags off.

524
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,914
(A real showdown is coming.)

525
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:45,984
Top one or bottom one?

526
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,884
- Top one.
- Here. The bottom one is yours.

527
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,184
Put them on.

528
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,784
I lost.

529
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,524
Numbing dumpling hot pot.

530
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,164
Juicy shrimp dim sum. I lost.

531
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:56,724
Game over.

532
00:18:56,724 --> 00:19:00,464
(That totally butchered dim sum returns.)

533
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,434
HEECHUL, how are you going to play this?

534
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:02,704
Let's do eight beats.

535
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,674
Let's go with eight beats.

536
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,874
(So excited)

537
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:07,874
Start.

538
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:10,904
(The final match begins.)

539
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,044
Numbing dumpling hot pot, seven.

540
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:14,514
Numbing dumpling hot pot, seven.

541
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:18,384
Numbing dumpling hot pot.

542
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:20,414
(I am the god of games.)

543
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,924
(Wait, what?)

544
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:24,524
Juicy shrimp dim sum, eight.

545
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:25,694
Juicy shwimp dim su, juicy shwimp sum,

546
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,154
juicy shwimp sum, juicy shwimp su,

547
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:28,794
juicy shwimp dim su.

548
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,864
(That pronunciation)

549
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:33,394
(The dim sum gets butchered again.)

550
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:34,464
I lost.

551
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:39,034
- I won!
- And with that, HEECHUL wins.

552
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,244
(HEECHUL wins both the wireless earphones
and the Bluetooth speaker.)

553
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,274
Play a song here.

554
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,114
Can I try playing the big speaker?

555
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,914
(Let's see what it sounds like.)

556
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:51,614
(Music fills the whole room.)

557
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:53,854
That's so good.

558
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:56,524
The LED lights are pretty, too.

559
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:57,724
The sound is so constant.

560
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:02,794
(360-degree immersive sound)

561
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:03,594
It's really nice.

562
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:04,894
It matches the interior design
of my house perfectly.

563
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,234
Why are you calling it your house?

564
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:07,734
I won it.

565
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,334
I just mean it fits well with my place.

566
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,634
(Everyone wants it now.)

567
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:11,974
Who do you think you are,
trying to claim it?

568
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:13,804
This is mine.

569
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:16,374
(Do you know how hard I worked for this?)

570
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:18,714
(My baby)

571
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:20,774
Let's go home together.

572
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:26,514
(I won't give this to anyone.)

573
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:29,224
Let me try the earphones.

574
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:31,424
- Like this?
- Put it in your nose.

575
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:32,824
Like this?

576
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:35,124
I can hear piano sounds.

577
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,234
That doesn't suit him.

578
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,134
HEECHUL and earphones don't match at all.

579
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,664
(He can't hear them
because of noise canceling.)

580
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,034
The bass is really deep.

581
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:47,834
Will you donate
these high-performance items...

582
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:50,974
to SHINDONG?

583
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:55,414
What will his choice be?

584
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:59,014
- What's your decision?
- Wait a minute.

585
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:00,184
Are they really filming at my house?

586
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,324
Yes.

587
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:03,584
If you need them, you should take them.

588
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:06,054
Six hours of shooting with 30 people.

589
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,364
I don't need the speaker,

590
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:11,024
but I need the earphones for our tour,

591
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,864
especially on planes.

592
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:14,634
(Okay, I've made up my mind.)

593
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:16,634
I really need to keep the earphones.

594
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:20,334
I can give up this one.

595
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:23,504
Then HEECHUL, I'll make a concession.

596
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:26,474
We'll cut your earphone shoot time
to one hour and 30 minutes.

597
00:21:26,914 --> 00:21:28,284
With how many staff?

598
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,984
The number reduces to half, so 15 people.

599
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,184
Do I really have to shoot at home?
It's just earphones.

600
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:35,754
You can shoot the earphones outside.

601
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,024
(Sweet deal)

602
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,594
Then give me the speaker.

603
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:41,994
Wait, they can shoot
the speaker outside as well.

604
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,464
No.

605
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:48,134
(That's actually right.)

606
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,664
If we go to the US,
hip-hop artists would use this...

607
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:53,034
(Demonstrating hip use of speakers)

608
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:57,274
But that's not the purpose of that.

609
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,914
It's meant for interior decoration.

610
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:01,074
Give me this one.

611
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:04,184
This one really suits SHINDONG. Okay.

612
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:05,184
I'll give it to you.

613
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,754
(The speaker is officially donated
to SHINDONG.)

614
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:08,784
Lucky guy.

615
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:10,454
Everyone,

616
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,054
many prizes have been prepared
for this game.

617
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:16,694
This is your chance
to win a bunch at once.

618
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:18,094
Let's reveal the prizes.

619
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:20,794
First up,
the item everyone wants the most.

620
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:22,064
Laundry detergent.

621
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:23,204
That's great.

622
00:22:23,204 --> 00:22:25,234
I have a washing machine at home.

623
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:30,544
- I use this one at home.
- It's the one I use.

624
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:33,014
I picked gifts I personally wanted.

625
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:36,844
Next, a box of instant rice,

626
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:42,584
and a Spam set.

627
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,284
Spam fried rice is delicious.

628
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:47,224
And everyone,
there's also a toothpaste set.

629
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:48,224
That toothpaste is mine.

630
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:50,364
I'm out of toothpaste. I need to buy some.

631
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:52,934
- What kind is it?
- What brand?

632
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:57,564
(Luxury toothpaste from Europe)

633
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:58,974
Next up is...

634
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:01,404
an Eternity Plant.

635
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,944
- What's an Eternity Plant?
- It attracts wealth into the home.

636
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:04,744
That's fake, right?

637
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:06,344
No, it smells nice.

638
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:08,044
It smells good.

639
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:10,014
And finally,

640
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,014
a portable beam projector.

641
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:13,054
That one's mine.

642
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:14,284
Portable beam projector.

643
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:16,054
What is that?

644
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:21,054
You can carry it around
and project movies or videos anywhere.

645
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:22,894
By the way, it's 4K.

646
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:25,834
It can go up to 120 inches.

647
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,134
Let me touch it once.

648
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:31,674
(They can win 10 items in this round.)

649
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,434
The game for these many prizes is...

650
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,004
a Celebrity Face Quiz.

651
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:39,214
(We've met this game again.)

652
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:41,374
(Flashbacks of the game
with Producer Na Yeong Seok)

653
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:42,414
Celebrities.

654
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:45,914
(From the start,
it was a streak of failures.)

655
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:46,954
Wrong!

656
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:50,824
(Who's Faker?)

657
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:54,964
(Apologies to the entire nation piled up.)

658
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:56,824
This went way worse than I expected.

659
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:59,934
(That humiliating game
in front of Na Yeong Seok)

660
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:03,204
(Will they do better this time?)

661
00:24:03,204 --> 00:24:06,034
Every wrong answer eliminates one prize.

662
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:08,574
You get ten chances in total.

663
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,574
If we win them all,

664
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,944
can we split them ourselves?

665
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:12,514
Yes, you can divide them.

666
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:13,414
So it's a team game?

667
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,014
If you succeed all at once,
you get everything.

668
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:17,214
Each wrong answer removes one item.

669
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:19,784
So just think of it as donating to me.

670
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,654
Either you take them, or I do.

671
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:23,554
SHINDONG worked hard today, so okay.

672
00:24:23,554 --> 00:24:24,824
Says who?

673
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:27,624
I worked the hardest.

674
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:29,124
Brother.

675
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,664
SIWON doesn't need these things.

676
00:24:30,664 --> 00:24:33,394
Yes, I do. I like those stuff.

677
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:34,534
Who goes first?

678
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:35,804
We'll start from here and go around.

679
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:36,664
(In a round-trip order)

680
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:38,634
If you get it wrong,
go straight to the back.

681
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:41,434
I'll show you the speed. Ready, go.

682
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:42,774
One, two, three.

683
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,074
(Must answer within three beats)

684
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:45,274
Ready.

685
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:48,314
(Nervous)

686
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:50,614
- One.
- Song Joong Ki.

687
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,014
(Proud)

688
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,684
(That's a good start.)

689
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:55,984
One, two, three.

690
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:57,754
- Trump.
- Okay.

691
00:24:57,754 --> 00:24:59,294
Why is it proceeding so fast?

692
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:00,694
One, two, three.

693
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:01,824
Lee Jung Hyun.

694
00:25:01,824 --> 00:25:04,494
- Please, no. It's my turn.
- That was close.

695
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:08,534
(If it were me, I'd have failed.)

696
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:10,304
Please. It's my turn.

697
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:12,604
(Praying hard)

698
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:13,674
One, two, three.

699
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:14,834
Choi Daniel.

700
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:16,874
We're doing this in one go.

701
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:19,574
YESUNG, one, two, three.

702
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:20,714
Jay Park.

703
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:22,784
(This is easy.)

704
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:25,314
Hold on.

705
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:26,354
In one shot?

706
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:27,354
SIWON.

707
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:28,884
One, two, three.

708
00:25:28,884 --> 00:25:31,054
Cha Seung Won.

709
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:34,494
(Already halfway there)

710
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,124
This is bad.

711
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:37,524
YESUNG.

712
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:39,764
(Focus)

713
00:25:39,764 --> 00:25:41,634
(Don't worry.)

714
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:43,504
One, two, three.

715
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,504
(Who is this?)

716
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:46,774
Jung Ho Yeon.

717
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:47,804
(Seriously?)

718
00:25:47,804 --> 00:25:49,774
Jung Ho Yeon.

719
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:51,104
That's Jung Ho Yeon.

720
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,774
Her face looks a little different.

721
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:55,214
You squid-faced fool.

722
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:56,884
That's obviously Jung Ho Yeon.

723
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:59,884
(Source: Jung Ho Yeon's social media)

724
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:01,014
You switch with SIWON.

725
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,284
We'll remove one prize.

726
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:03,454
Which one will you remove?

727
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:05,024
- The Eternity Plant.
- Definitely not.

728
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:05,894
- No way.
- We can't remove something expensive.

729
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:07,054
Remove the snacks.

730
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:09,624
(Gets scolded right away)

731
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:12,164
- Remove the snacks.
- Okay, snacks it is.

732
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:13,064
You switch with SIWON.

733
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,394
Is the Eternity Plant expensive?

734
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,234
Yes, it is.

735
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:17,104
(Quick acceptance)

736
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:19,774
(The assorted snack set gets donated
to SHINDONG.)

737
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:22,044
This clip is cute.
Leave the clip here when you go.

738
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:24,274
(Pleased to get household goods)

739
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:25,574
How do you not know Jung Ho Yeon?

740
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:26,944
YESUNG should go to the end now.

741
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,344
- You squid.
- But I want to play it safe.

742
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:30,344
Change places.

743
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:31,514
But I'm actually good at this.

744
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:33,254
That's why, switch.

745
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:36,154
- You want one more chance?
- One more chance.

746
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:39,294
(Thanks, SIWON.)

747
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:41,554
I want to play it safe.

748
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:43,624
- Do we start over? In the same order?
- Yes.

749
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:46,394
I bet a lot of people didn't recognize
Jung Ho Yeon.

750
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:49,164
Hey, squid guy, shush.

751
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:52,204
(Squid guy's special talent, singing well)

752
00:26:52,204 --> 00:26:53,374
Ready.

753
00:26:54,374 --> 00:26:55,304
One, two, three.

754
00:26:55,304 --> 00:26:56,774
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Yes.

755
00:26:58,414 --> 00:26:59,774
One, two, three.

756
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:00,714
- Who is this?
- Wrong.

757
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:03,514
Jo Hyun Ah. Isn't it obvious?

758
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:05,554
(It's clearly Jo Hyun Ah.)

759
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:10,554
(Urban Zakapa's Jo Hyun Ah)

760
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:12,924
But that was tricky.

761
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:16,594
This photo is from Jo Hyun Ah's
social media account.

762
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,694
(Closing his eyes not to seem rude)

763
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:20,364
- We need to call her.
- Call who?

764
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:21,904
Jo Hyun Ah.

765
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:23,704
And say what?

766
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:25,474
Call her and say...

767
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:29,374
<i>I don't love you</i>

768
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:33,474
(LEETEUK always supports you.)

769
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:35,184
You, change places with me.

770
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:38,084
Everyone move one spot to the right.

771
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,514
Which prize will you remove?

772
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:41,614
Let's remove the toilet paper.

773
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:43,054
I like toilet paper.

774
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:46,554
(The toilet paper set goes
to the queen of homemaking.)

775
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:47,894
Hey.

776
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:50,364
- DONGHAE.
- This is too easy.

777
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,364
DONGHAE's good at this.

778
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:53,294
(Can they win the remaining prizes
with DONGHAE in the lead?)

779
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,834
No switching, we're going as is.

780
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,534
Here we go. Ready.

781
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,104
One, two, three.

782
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:01,274
Lee...

783
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:03,804
(No way.)

784
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:06,114
(You're not going
to miss this one, right?)

785
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:07,644
- Three.
- Son Ye Jin.

786
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,014
Okay, that counts.

787
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,414
(Frightened)

788
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:13,284
Hold on. I'm sorry, but...

789
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:14,854
this photo's been photoshopped too much.

790
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:15,854
The production team photoshopped it
too much.

791
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:17,024
I know, right?

792
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,194
This one was uploaded
by Son Ye Jin herself.

793
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:21,654
She looks amazing.

794
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:23,264
Son Ye Jin.

795
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:26,394
We share the same last name "Ye."

796
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:27,534
(Come on.)

797
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:28,904
She's really beautiful.

798
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,404
HEECHUL.

799
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,034
One, two, three.

800
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:33,074
Song Kang Ho.

801
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:38,304
(Even has time for impersonation)

802
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:40,574
(You're really good at this.)

803
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:41,944
One, two, three.

804
00:28:41,944 --> 00:28:43,914
(This person is...)

805
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:46,084
(He showed bad manners to her
on "SJ Returns" last time.)

806
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:47,354
Who is that?

807
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:50,054
(You got the same question last time.)

808
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:51,624
One, two, three.

809
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:54,394
- Lee...
- Wrong.

810
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:56,594
(No)

811
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:58,364
Too late.

812
00:28:58,364 --> 00:28:59,794
Check the VAR.

813
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:02,064
You should've said "Lee Eun," at least.

814
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:04,904
I got her wrong last time,

815
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,674
so if I get her wrong again, I'm doomed.

816
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:09,544
(It's even the same photo as last time.)

817
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:10,944
I was just a little off the beat.

818
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:14,514
(Sorry, Lee Eun Ji.)

819
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:16,284
You, get over there. Go to the end.

820
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:17,984
(The offender goes to the end.)

821
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:19,414
Remove one item.

822
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:22,284
- The Eternity Plant.
- Why do you keep saying the pricey one?

823
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:24,484
(Why is that a no-go?)

824
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:26,554
Remove this one instead.

825
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:27,894
(How about the beam projector?)

826
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:29,824
No. Let's take out that one.

827
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:32,294
Ramen. Instant rice.

828
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:33,494
I like rice.

829
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:38,364
(The instant rice goes to the rice lover.)

830
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:40,474
DONGHAE is doing great today.

831
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,644
Let's make this one a round trip.

832
00:29:42,644 --> 00:29:43,804
Just once.

833
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:45,374
Let's go. Ready.

834
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:47,444
One, two...

835
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:48,814
(Come on, this one's easy.)

836
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:52,954
(It shouldn't be hard
for the ace in this game.)

837
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:53,854
Two, three.

838
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:55,184
Jo Dae Ho.

839
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:56,584
Fencing.

840
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:57,754
- Three.
- Jo Dae Ho.

841
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,724
(Laughing)

842
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:01,224
Oh Sang Uk.

843
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:03,694
(Fencing gold medalist Oh Sang Uk)

844
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:05,194
Who's Jo Dae Ho?

845
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:09,264
Of course, I know him.
I just forgot the name.

846
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:10,464
Wait, but seriously,

847
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:13,804
he's Korea's gold medalist in fencing.

848
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:15,204
(Fencing emperor Oh Sang Uk,
two-time gold medalist at Paris Olympics)

849
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:16,374
(Two-time gold medalist at Hangzhou
Asian Games, one-time at Tokyo Olympics)

850
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:18,504
Why do you hate him?

851
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:21,574
DONGHAE, stop talking and apologize.

852
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:24,144
(His second public apology to the nation)

853
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:27,114
Mr. Oh Sang Uk.

854
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:28,084
I'm a fan.

855
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:30,284
You clearly don't seem like one.

856
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:31,354
Now remove an item.

857
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:32,824
Since DONGHAE got it wrong,
the toothpaste set.

858
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:34,424
(Come on.)

859
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:36,064
But DONGHAE got it wrong.

860
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:38,394
- Then let's remove the detergent.
- No.

861
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,364
Remove the Eternity Plant.

862
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:41,264
Why that one?

863
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:44,234
(It's not edible.)

864
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,834
Take out the toothpaste.

865
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,174
Toothpaste? Okay.

866
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:48,274
But that toothpaste looks nice.

867
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:49,144
No.

868
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:50,204
(Toothpaste?)

869
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:52,114
- Ramen.
- Okay, ramen.

870
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:54,114
(I like toothpaste.)

871
00:30:54,114 --> 00:30:56,784
(The ramen gets donated to SHINDONG.)

872
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:58,484
Lucky you. You're taking so much stuff.

873
00:30:58,814 --> 00:31:01,284
(They already secured nearly half.)

874
00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:03,984
YESUNG, you're up first.

875
00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:05,454
One, two, three.

876
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,994
- Wrong.
- Elon Musk.

877
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:09,994
- Wrong.
- Elon Musk.

878
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,524
- Hey!
- Elon Musk.

879
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:13,134
(This is so frustrating.)

880
00:31:13,134 --> 00:31:15,264
Hey, how do you not know this?

881
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:18,434
(Immediately kneels down)

882
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:20,374
- Tesla.
- I mean...

883
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:21,574
He was too quick with the buzzer.

884
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,144
(You...)

885
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,274
(cannot be...)

886
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:25,144
(forgiven.)

887
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,644
Of course, I know Elon Musk.

888
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:28,144
He's the man going to Mars.

889
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:30,414
(Let's see.)

890
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,314
I'll go first.

891
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,714
I'll go first.

892
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:35,984
No.

893
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:37,224
No.

894
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:39,994
(If you don't know fencer Oh Sang Uk,
you can't go first.)

895
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:43,364
I was going to say Elon Musk on three.

896
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:45,794
(If you're that upset...)

897
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:47,294
Tell your mom about it.

898
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,064
Tell your mom about it.

899
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:52,904
(Dumbfounded)

900
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:54,434
You have to give one up.

901
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:57,274
- The toothpaste?
- No, Spam.

902
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,644
But Spam's so tasty mixed with rice.

903
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:01,074
But there's no rice, right?

904
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:02,744
Okay, Spam.

905
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:04,244
I'm full already.

906
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:08,514
(The rice thief is out.)

907
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:10,154
What round are we in now?

908
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,124
- Is it Round Six?
- Already?

909
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,724
HEECHUL, get ready.

910
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,754
Is this someone I can guess?

911
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:17,424
If not, I feel like he'll hit you.

912
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:18,564
It's a man.

913
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:19,594
Ma Dong Seok.

914
00:32:19,594 --> 00:32:20,694
- Kang Ho Dong.
- Kim Dong Hyun.

915
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:22,664
(Everyone's a threat at this point.)

916
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:23,934
If you get hit by this person,
you might die.

917
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,134
I feel like it's
either Ma Dong Seok or Tyson.

918
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:27,704
One, two, three.

919
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:29,904
- Kim Yeon Koung.
- Yes.

920
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,174
The queen of volleyball.

921
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:32,874
Next, SIWON.

922
00:32:33,674 --> 00:32:35,114
One, two, three.

923
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:36,044
Steve Jobs.

924
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:38,854
Isn't that SIWON?

925
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:40,014
I thought it was you.

926
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:41,614
Did you hear his pronunciation?
It's crazy.

927
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:45,624
(I want to try, too.)

928
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:49,424
It was an honor to live
in the same era as him.

929
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,064
- An honor, really?
- Here we go.

930
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,094
One, two, three.

931
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:59,374
(The person from "Moving")

932
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:01,074
One, two, three.

933
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,074
Go Youn Jung.

934
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:03,774
"Moving."

935
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,304
(Even he's surprised he got it right.)

936
00:33:05,304 --> 00:33:07,414
If you had missed it,
I would've gotten mad.

937
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,744
(Next up is RYEOWOOK.)

938
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:13,184
(Give me an easy one.)

939
00:33:13,184 --> 00:33:14,884
One, two, three.

940
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,024
- Lee Min Ho.
- Wrong.

941
00:33:16,684 --> 00:33:18,284
(Rolling on the ground)

942
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:19,394
- Three.
- Lee Min Ho.

943
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:20,394
Wrong.

944
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:22,324
(That was easy enough.)

945
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:25,294
(Shocked)

946
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,334
(He's the only one who didn't know.)

947
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:31,104
You should emigrate now.

948
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:32,474
Remove one item.

949
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:33,804
Hold on.

950
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,134
Should we remove the Eternity Plant now?

951
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:36,174
Should we remove the Eternity Plant now?

952
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:37,874
(Finally)

953
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:41,044
(Choosing laundry detergent)

954
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:42,884
- Let's remove the toothpaste set.
- No, remove something else.

955
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:44,184
I'm curious about the toothpaste.

956
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:47,214
(Why is he so clingy?)

957
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:48,484
I think you're going to make it this time.

958
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,654
Let's go.

959
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:50,584
Here we go.

960
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:52,454
We have to make it.

961
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:54,124
One, two, three.

962
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:55,254
Yoon Jong Shin.

963
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:57,464
- That's right.
- <i>Amazing</i>

964
00:33:57,964 --> 00:33:59,294
SIWON.

965
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:00,894
One, two, three.

966
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:02,764
ANTON.

967
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:04,464
Yoon Sang's son.

968
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:05,534
LEETEUK.

969
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:07,104
One, two, three.

970
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,534
- Kim Ji Hoon.
- Ju Ji Hoon.

971
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:10,474
Ju Ji Hoon.

972
00:34:11,204 --> 00:34:12,244
Kim Ji Hoon.

973
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:14,544
(Big shock)

974
00:34:14,544 --> 00:34:15,884
Ju Ji Hoon.

975
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:17,814
Ju Ji Hoon.

976
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:19,514
- This is really...
- Ji Hoon.

977
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:20,814
Sorry, Ji Hoon.

978
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:22,224
- Ju Ji Hoon.
- Ji Hoon.

979
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:24,054
It's a world where humans live.

980
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:25,624
(He knows the lines,
but not Ju Ji Hoon himself.)

981
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:27,024
What brings you here?

982
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,654
Please leave the "Light Shop."

983
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:29,864
But I really like "Light Shop."

984
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,464
Was it Jo Ji Hoon?

985
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:33,834
Ju Ji Hoon.

986
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,064
Who's Jo Ji Hoon?

987
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,234
I'm sorry, Ji Hoon.

988
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:39,674
I really love "Light Shop."

989
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:42,744
(Toothpaste set)

990
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:44,544
YESUNG, not the toothpaste.

991
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:46,574
(Time for the toothpaste set to go)

992
00:34:46,574 --> 00:34:49,244
(The toothpaste set is out.)

993
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:51,544
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go one-way now.

994
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:52,614
One-way?

995
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:55,284
Let's boldly go one-way this time.

996
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:56,284
Let's do it.

997
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:57,624
(Such a generous man)

998
00:34:57,624 --> 00:35:00,494
I was very generous. One-way it is.

999
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:01,594
Let's go one-way.

1000
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:02,964
- Ready.
- Let's go for it.

1001
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:04,094
Go for it!

1002
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,134
One, two, three.

1003
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:07,494
- Choo Sung Hoon.
- That's right.

1004
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:09,164
Macho man.

1005
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,834
One, two, three.

1006
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:12,834
Cha Eun Woo.

1007
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:15,174
- He's handsome.
- DONGHAE.

1008
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:17,374
One, two, three.

1009
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:19,474
- Chun Woo Hee.
- That's right.

1010
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:21,014
- That's right.
- Chun Woo Hee.

1011
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:23,284
(That was kind of tricky.)

1012
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:26,254
"Be Melodramatic."

1013
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,884
I thought you'd stumble here.

1014
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:29,824
I'm doomed. Wait a second.

1015
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:32,254
(This one's hard.)

1016
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:34,954
One, two, three.

1017
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:36,664
- Wrong.
- Kim Soo Hyun? Who is that?

1018
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:37,664
Who even is that?

1019
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:39,694
(Giggling)

1020
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:40,994
RISABAE.

1021
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:42,764
I thought it was SUNMI.

1022
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:45,734
Wait. Isn't that RISABAE
in SUNMI's makeup?

1023
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:46,874
How are we supposed to guess that?

1024
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:49,074
This photo was posted by RISABAE herself.

1025
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:50,544
She looks amazing.

1026
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,104
Please tell her I'm a huge fan.

1027
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:55,144
She's the best makeup artist in Korea.

1028
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:57,214
- A makeup artist.
- I don't know makeup.

1029
00:35:57,214 --> 00:35:58,484
Then don't do makeup.

1030
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:00,154
(Just annoyed)

1031
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:03,354
(While he's mad,
SHINDONG got the Eternity Plant.)

1032
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:04,884
(Spotted)

1033
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:06,594
Who gave away the Eternity Plant
without permission?

1034
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:07,754
It should've been the pork.

1035
00:36:07,754 --> 00:36:09,824
(Secretly)

1036
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:12,834
(The annoying Eternity Plant is out.)

1037
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:16,034
(Satisfied)

1038
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:17,404
Wait a second.

1039
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:18,564
The pork still hasn't been removed?

1040
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:22,244
(You guys really want pork belly.)

1041
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:23,374
So cute.

1042
00:36:24,004 --> 00:36:26,144
(The items left are pork
and the beam projector.)

1043
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,314
We have to make it.

1044
00:36:27,674 --> 00:36:28,674
Ready.

1045
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:32,084
One, two, three.

1046
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:33,784
She's...

1047
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:35,454
Ahn Eun Jin.

1048
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:38,754
(Just wait for it.)

1049
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:41,894
(Have mercy.)

1050
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:44,424
She was in "My Dearest" with Namkoong Min.

1051
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:45,994
(Oh no...)

1052
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:47,334
Yes, "My Dearest."

1053
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:48,534
Should we remove the meat
or the beam projector?

1054
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:50,434
- Beam projector.
- Meat.

1055
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:51,304
Meat.

1056
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:53,974
(SHINDONG secures the pork.)

1057
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:55,274
I really want the beam projector.

1058
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:56,604
She was in "The Good Bad Mother," too.

1059
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:59,314
(This is the last chance.)

1060
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:00,714
SIWON's being really serious.

1061
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:02,744
This is fun.

1062
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:05,384
Wait, you're doing this for fun?

1063
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:06,684
We're playing to win and take stuff home.

1064
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:09,154
It's kind of cathartic.

1065
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:11,984
We actually need
these essential supplies, but he's just...

1066
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,824
How about one-way for the last round?

1067
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,054
- Okay.
- One-way.

1068
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:17,064
If we win,
do we get everything you've got?

1069
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:19,234
No. Why would you?

1070
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:21,934
I'll allow one-way.

1071
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:24,134
Also, I'll give you a little more time.

1072
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:25,234
Four seconds.

1073
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,374
I'll count to one, two, three, four.

1074
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:28,434
Don't speed up.

1075
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:30,104
At this pace. One, two, three, four.

1076
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:31,204
That's too fast.

1077
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:34,214
How slow do I need to go?

1078
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:37,444
(Whiny mode)

1079
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:39,214
Then go back to round-trip.

1080
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:41,684
But the other members are allowed to help.

1081
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:43,584
Okay, we're allowed just that.

1082
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:47,224
I wasn't bothered by the first part.

1083
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,754
But the second part hurt my feelings.

1084
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:52,894
(It was a misunderstanding.)

1085
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:55,704
Forget it. Just take what you get.

1086
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,104
One-way, up to four counts.

1087
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:59,034
Okay, that's it.

1088
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:00,204
YESUNG, you're up first.

1089
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,674
Ready.

1090
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:04,444
One, two, three, four.

1091
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:05,544
Jung Kook.

1092
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:06,644
That's right.

1093
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:08,744
(I told you I'm good.)

1094
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,554
(Next is me.)

1095
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:15,254
If you didn't know that,
you'd be in trouble.

1096
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:16,254
Ready.

1097
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,154
One, two...

1098
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:22,054
(Travel YouTuber Pani Bottle)

1099
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:24,594
(Let's take at least one prize.)

1100
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,964
- One, two, three, four.
- Who is that?

1101
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:27,394
I don't know.

1102
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:28,634
(Swinging his hand)

1103
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,464
What's wrong with you?

1104
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:33,434
Swings?

1105
00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:36,204
That's Pani Bottle.

1106
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,904
(All the items are mine now.)

1107
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:39,914
Wrong.

1108
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:41,144
(Confused)

1109
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,214
I don't know him.

1110
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:43,914
We lost.

1111
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,984
And with that, all the prizes...

1112
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:48,014
will be donated to SHINDONG.

1113
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:53,394
(He even neatly secured
the beam projector.)

1114
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:55,254
Everyone, now it's time for Round Three.

1115
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:56,864
The prize for this game is...

1116
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:59,264
an item the members who like to play games
will absolutely go crazy for.

1117
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:01,234
A gaming monitor.

1118
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:02,504
Seriously?

1119
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:04,134
- A gaming monitor!
- That's mine.

1120
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,974
Not only does it have
a vivid OLED display,

1121
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:07,904
its sleek white design makes it...

1122
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:11,104
a stylish interior item, too.

1123
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,814
No matter what, this is mine.

1124
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:14,814
What?

1125
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:16,014
(Look)

1126
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:18,044
He's an artist from our company.

1127
00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:22,524
(EUNHYUK appears.)

1128
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:24,354
- I'm the investor.
- He's doing solo activities.

1129
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:27,654
(New rookie artist EUNHYUK arrives
after finishing his schedule.)

1130
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:39,064
The game
for this ultra-premium prize is...

1131
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:42,434
the Random Sugar Honeycomb Game.

1132
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:50,104
From now on, the Squid Game will...

1133
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:51,704
You guys probably did this already.

1134
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:54,304
- Freeze.
- We already did all that.

1135
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:56,104
(Of course.)

1136
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,774
- We even sang songs.
- "Everyone!" Did you do all of it?

1137
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:58,914
We did all of it.

1138
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:00,274
"I've already played this game."
This, too.

1139
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,274
I'm way too late.

1140
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,284
Each person, at random.

1141
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,584
Don't open it, just take it with you.

1142
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:10,454
(Which shape did they pick?)

1143
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,354
The star among stars,
the king among kings.

1144
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:13,954
"Star King."

1145
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:18,324
I'll be the elf's umbrella.

1146
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:19,464
HEECHUL picked an umbrella.

1147
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:20,934
(LEETEUK, HEECHUL, YESUNG, SIWON)

1148
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,464
(EUNHYUK, DONGHAE, RYEOWOOK)

1149
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:28,074
Whoever finishes the fastest
within five minutes wins first place.

1150
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:30,944
Ready, go.

1151
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:32,014
The game has started.

1152
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,074
I'll show how to succeed with a star.

1153
00:40:34,414 --> 00:40:37,044
(Some are scraping the traditional way.)

1154
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:40,554
(SIWON and YESUNG go
with the saliva technique.)

1155
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,384
Everyone's focused.

1156
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:45,694
I did this a lot as a kid.

1157
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:46,754
Hold on.

1158
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:48,394
(Ouch!)

1159
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:49,864
(Unintentional attack)

1160
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,534
What was that? I almost died!

1161
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,834
(So sensitive)

1162
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,504
(EUNHYUK breaks off one edge of the star.)

1163
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,804
I think mine's defective.
I might need a new one.

1164
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:02,974
YESUNG is out.

1165
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,514
(A chipped piece of the star)

1166
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:06,574
It already had a crack.

1167
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:07,974
There's no such thing as defective.

1168
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:11,144
(This game even makes the nobleman spit.)

1169
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:14,484
HEECHUL, if I win the monitor,
I'll give it to you.

1170
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:15,284
Really?

1171
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:18,494
(LEETEUK already succeeded
with the top part of the umbrella.)

1172
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:20,254
I can't lose that monitor.

1173
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:24,124
(YESUNG who was eliminated first...)

1174
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:26,634
(roams around bothering the others.)

1175
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,634
(I'm doomed.)

1176
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,234
(Even EUNHYUK, who was confident
about the star...)

1177
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:33,004
(Crack)

1178
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:35,744
(DONGHAE and EUNHYUK are both out.)

1179
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,544
(This is fun.)

1180
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:38,544
I'm out.

1181
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,814
(And now the only survivors left are...)

1182
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:44,384
(the four with umbrella-shaped
sugar honeycomb.)

1183
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:46,314
HEECHUL really needs that monitor.

1184
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:47,884
I really do.

1185
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:49,184
That's it. That's how you do it.

1186
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,254
Monitor.

1187
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,194
(I'm going to succeed.)

1188
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:58,294
Imagine it breaks and you get shot.

1189
00:41:58,294 --> 00:42:00,864
Why say such scary things?

1190
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:03,534
Imagine a gun is pointed at you.

1191
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,204
I'm dead.

1192
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:08,304
I'm dead.

1193
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,504
- I'm dead.
- Act like you're shot.

1194
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:14,644
Contestant number 163, eliminated.

1195
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:16,444
(I'll just eat this sugar honeycomb.)

1196
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:20,384
(And behind them, SIWON is laser-focused.)

1197
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,924
He pretended to have fun,
but he's going all in.

1198
00:42:22,924 --> 00:42:24,284
That's what it means to have fun.

1199
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:26,454
It cracked.

1200
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:27,354
It cracked.

1201
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,124
(SIWON is out.)

1202
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,164
LEETEUK versus HEECHUL.

1203
00:42:32,164 --> 00:42:33,994
The members born in 1983 made it far.

1204
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:35,434
Because they're old-timers.

1205
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:37,334
Back in our day,
we had nothing else to play with.

1206
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:39,874
(Glance)

1207
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:41,674
LEETEUK's shape is the same.

1208
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:43,974
I'm getting nostalgic.

1209
00:42:43,974 --> 00:42:45,574
I used to be so good at this
in my neighborhood.

1210
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:48,544
(Ouch!)

1211
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:49,784
(HEECHUL screams at every poke.)

1212
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:50,784
Everyone's so serious.

1213
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:52,714
(Will they succeed with the umbrella?)

1214
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:55,114
Done.

1215
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,984
(HEECHUL succeeded
with the top part of the umbrella, too.)

1216
00:42:57,984 --> 00:42:59,294
The handle is the problem.

1217
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,224
Wait, the lines weren't carved enough.

1218
00:43:05,194 --> 00:43:08,194
No. My umbrella doesn't have a handle.

1219
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:13,234
(Tries to stick it back with spit)

1220
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,304
(Shattered)

1221
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:17,704
You spilled too much.

1222
00:43:17,704 --> 00:43:19,174
LEETEUK is still going.

1223
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:21,414
LEETEUK is super serious.

1224
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:22,684
He's serious.

1225
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,984
He did a lot.

1226
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:27,354
(The shape of the umbrella
is starting to show.)

1227
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,984
Give me just one more minute.
I'm almost done.

1228
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,354
(HEECHUL, who wanted the monitor)

1229
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:35,794
(What is he doing?)

1230
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:36,994
HEECHUL, what are you doing?

1231
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:39,594
I'm just going to hang up
my clothes, SHINDONG.

1232
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:42,964
(He even tries to sneak it away.)

1233
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:46,034
(I want it so bad.)

1234
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:47,174
I'll hang up my jacket.

1235
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,234
I did it.

1236
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:49,274
Really?

1237
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:50,474
I did it.

1238
00:43:50,474 --> 00:43:51,474
Really?

1239
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,874
(For real?)

1240
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:56,084
I did it.

1241
00:43:56,084 --> 00:43:57,184
Really?

1242
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:58,754
But that crack is too obvious.

1243
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:00,054
Where?

1244
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,154
That crack is too clear.

1245
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:02,484
- You can see it?
- Yes.

1246
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:05,824
(Instead of the gaming monitor,
he gets the "Nice Effort" prize.)

1247
00:44:05,824 --> 00:44:07,994
All those dark spots are spit.

1248
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:09,464
- All spit.
- You get the "Nice Effort" award.

1249
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:11,264
You can have the rest of
the sugar honeycomb.

1250
00:44:11,264 --> 00:44:12,264
I'll take it home.

1251
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:14,734
(Gaming monitor)

1252
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:16,904
(Awarded to SHINDONG)

1253
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,874
Now let me introduce the prize
for this game.

1254
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:21,404
It's an incredible prize.

1255
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:24,404
A brand-new 2025 laptop.

1256
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,174
Hold on.

1257
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:29,044
Why is it so light?

1258
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,144
It's really light.

1259
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:31,444
Is that why it's called Gram?

1260
00:44:31,444 --> 00:44:33,114
It's a Gram. 2025 edition.

1261
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:35,254
With the new release,
not only does it have a great design,

1262
00:44:35,254 --> 00:44:37,654
it also comes with on-device AI.

1263
00:44:37,654 --> 00:44:38,924
What's "on-device"?

1264
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:40,454
It means there's AI...

1265
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:41,824
in the device.

1266
00:44:41,824 --> 00:44:43,794
Normally, when you search on your phone,

1267
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:45,964
ChatGPT and everything runs
through the internet, right?

1268
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:47,034
But this one has AI built-in.

1269
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:49,534
So it can search
even without the internet.

1270
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:52,274
Why is he so good at explaining
even without a prompter?

1271
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,804
Because I'm SHINDONG-deng-dong.

1272
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,404
Amazing. He's a real salesman.

1273
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:56,774
I really want this.

1274
00:44:56,774 --> 00:45:00,114

1280
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:15,094
- Yes.
- Ready.

1281
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:16,164
Here we go!

1282
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:18,324
Go.

1283
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:20,064
- Hurry up.
- No talking.

1284
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:21,194
We're getting those kinds of questions.
Watch carefully.

1285
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:22,404
This is too hard.

1286
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:26,074
(Acts super cute)

1287
00:45:26,074 --> 00:45:27,104

(No)

1295
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:39,814

what the questions are like)

There's a fire.

Fanning the flames at a burning house.

1315
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:22,864

1316
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:25,694
(He only needs to explain "ladybug" now.)

1317
00:46:25,694 --> 00:46:27,894
Fanning flames at a burning house.

1318
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:29,204

What's that supposed to be?

1327
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:45,684
In that case, dance like a shaman...

1328
00:46:45,684 --> 00:46:47,084
and act like a bug.

1329
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:49,254
What is that?

1331
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:54,554
You have to say the full phrase.

at a burning house.

1333

(I shouldn't have said that.)

1361
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:50,314
That was the key word.

1362
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:51,984
(Try to guess.)

1446
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:47,524
it burped.

1447
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:49,064
It burped and...

1448
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:51,094
- It did it five times.
- It drank Coke.

1449
00:50:51,094 --> 00:50:52,094
That's right.

1450
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:53,664
Chugged it.

1451
00:50:55,834 --> 00:50:57,804
After chugging a Coke, it burped.

1452
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:01,774
It burped five times
after chugging a Coke.

1453
00:51:01,774 --> 00:51:03,204
(Yes, that's it.)

1454
00:51:03,204 --> 00:51:04,274
This one's hard.

1455
00:51:06,074 --> 00:51:07,074
Crazy dog.

1456
00:51:07,874 --> 00:51:09,484
(What could it be?)

1457
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:10,484
Hyena.

1458
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:12,514
- Crazy dog.
- Hyena.

1459
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:14,614
You cheated, didn't you?

1460
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:17,284
Hyena that burped five times
after chugging a Coke.

1461
00:51:18,424 --> 00:51:19,924
You cheated, didn't you?

1462
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:21,594
- He suddenly got it right.
- I didn't cheat.

1463
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:23,494
(Bald eagle spitting while lying down)

1464
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:24,624
(Spit)

1465
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,194
Spitting while lying down.

1466
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:27,364
Spitting while lying down.

1467
00:51:27,364 --> 00:51:28,894
(Bald)

1468
00:51:28,894 --> 00:51:29,764
It turned bald.

1469
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:32,404
- An eagle.
- Okay.

1470
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:35,034
(Obviously an eagle)

1471
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:37,174
(RYEOWOOK is great at acting.)

1472
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:39,004
(Owl whose eyes rolled
from reading the room too much)

1473
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:40,474
(Eyes moving)

1474
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:41,514
Reading the room.

1475
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:44,214
Reading the room and going crazy.

1476
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:47,054
(Big eyes)

1477
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:48,914
(Starting to get the hang of explaining)

1478
00:51:48,914 --> 00:51:49,954
Owl that went crazy from reading the room.

1479
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:52,554
No.

1480
00:51:52,554 --> 00:51:53,994
- He missed the important part.
- Reading the room.

1481
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:56,794
- The eyes turned.
- Owl whose eyes rolled...

1482
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:58,364
- from reading the room.
- I'll let that pass.

1483
00:51:58,364 --> 00:51:59,534
He's really good.

1484
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:00,394
This team's good.

1485
00:52:00,394 --> 00:52:01,564
EUNHYUK is good.

1486
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:03,364
Laundry.

1487
00:52:03,364 --> 00:52:04,834
Time's up.

1488
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:07,634
How many did they get? They were good.

1489
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:10,244
Team LEETEUK got ten correct.

1490
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:13,814
(That's a pretty solid score.)

1491
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,514
I'll play this seriously.

1492
00:52:15,514 --> 00:52:16,514
Let's go.

1493
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:17,714
(Now it's Team HEECHUL's turn to guess.)

1494
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:20,014
(They have a bit of an advantage
from observing.)

1495
00:52:20,014 --> 00:52:23,454
(Let's see if they can beat
Team LEETEUK's score.)

1496
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:26,554
We need to go with a strategy.
I made one.

1497
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:27,754
- Really?
- Yes.

1498
00:52:27,754 --> 00:52:29,324
DONGHAE says he made a strategy.

1499
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:30,224
So we already won.

1500
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,534
I came up with a strategy.

1501
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:34,964
Ready, go.

1502
00:52:34,964 --> 00:52:36,534
(Crocodile that spouted while gargling)

1503
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:39,834
Gargle.

1504
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:41,734
It spat.

1505
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:45,004
Crocodile that spat out.

1506
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:46,474
Crocodile that spat out.

1507
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:48,814
(Surprised)

1508
00:52:48,814 --> 00:52:50,284
Crocodile that spat out while gargling.

1509
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:52,684
- No.
- Crocodile that spouted while gargling.

1510
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,514
Crocodile that spouted while gargling.

1511
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:55,654
That's right.

1512
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:57,524
(Got the first question right so fast)

1513
00:52:57,524 --> 00:52:59,394
(That was so quick!)

1514
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:01,324
You sit here.

1515
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,724
Wait a second. Is their strategy...

1516
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,224
DONGHAE not doing anything?

1517
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:06,464
Aren't they supposed to rotate turns?

1518
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:07,994
Why did YESUNG step out
when it wasn't his turn?

1519
00:53:07,994 --> 00:53:10,234
(Suspicious but moving
onto the second question)

1520
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:12,804
(High heels)

1521
00:53:12,804 --> 00:53:13,934
(Wearing them)

1522
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:15,374
Tiptoeing and walking...

1523
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:16,444
(No)

1524
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,444
- That's it.
- What should they do now?

1525
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:21,144
Wearing ballet shoes.

1526
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:22,014
Doing ballet.

1527
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:23,544
Wearing ballet shoes.

1528
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:24,814
(No)

1529
00:53:24,814 --> 00:53:25,884
It's messed up now.

1530
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:27,654
(The interference squad)

1531
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:29,584
A thorn.

1532
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:30,954
Wearing high heels.

1533
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:32,424
Wearing high heels.

1534
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:34,094
- Sparrow.
- Chicken.

1535
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:35,154
(It's long.)

1536
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:36,464
Ostrich.

1537
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:38,694
(Run)

1538
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:41,194
Ostrich wearing high heels
flapping its wings.

1539
00:53:41,194 --> 00:53:42,764
Turkey.

1540
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:43,864
Eagle.

1541
00:53:43,864 --> 00:53:44,864
Goose.

1542
00:53:44,864 --> 00:53:46,634
(Wearing high heels)

1543
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,404
Ostrich dashing in high heels.

1544
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:51,404
Okay, "dashing" is accepted.

1545
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:52,474
DONGHAE stepped out.

1546
00:53:53,014 --> 00:53:54,214
(I thought DONGHAE wasn't participating.)

1547
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:55,144
What's this?

1548
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:56,784
Let's see your strategy then.

1549
00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:59,354
(What is his strategy?)

1550
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:00,884
Go on, show us your strategy.

1551
00:54:03,184 --> 00:54:04,184
Pass.

1552
00:54:05,054 --> 00:54:06,694
(Passes without hesitation)

1553
00:54:06,694 --> 00:54:07,624
So that's the strategy.

1554
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:10,094
There's no limit in passing?

1555
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:12,094
(The strategy is not using DONGHAE.)

1556
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:16,304
(So they skip to SIWON's turn.)

1557
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,734
(The innermost tooth)

1558
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:20,804
Pulled out a wisdom tooth.

1559
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:22,944
While pulling a wisdom tooth...

1560
00:54:22,944 --> 00:54:24,474
After getting its wisdom tooth pulled out,
brushing its teeth.

1561
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,614
(Look at my facial expression.)

1562
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:28,014
While getting its wisdom tooth pulled out,

1563
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,174
brushing its teeth fiercely.

1564
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:33,814
(Long neck)

1565
00:54:33,814 --> 00:54:35,014
Giraffe.

1566
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:37,484
Giraffe brushing its teeth fiercely
after getting its wisdom tooth pulled out.

1567
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:38,784
Correct.

1568
00:54:38,784 --> 00:54:40,654
Can SIWON just explain everything?

1569
00:54:41,524 --> 00:54:42,324
He's fun.

1570
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:44,394
(Explaining isn't hard.)

1571
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:46,434
(Crab doing a double sidekick
on the red carpet)

1572
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:47,434
That one's hard.

1573
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:49,164
(What is it?)

1574
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:51,604
(Rolling out a red carpet)

1575
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:53,674
Opened the door and walked in.

1576
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:56,904
He's acting.

1577
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:58,774
(Explaining "red carpet" is tricky.)

1578
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:00,874
<i>Open the door</i>

1579
00:55:00,874 --> 00:55:02,614
- Don't sing.
- "Here I am" by YESUNG.

1580
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:04,614
(This thing)

1581
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:06,084
Red carpet.

1582
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:07,254
Red carpet.

1583
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:08,984
(Kick)

1584
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:10,584
Doing a double sidekick on the red carpet.

1585
00:55:10,584 --> 00:55:12,154
Doing a double sidekick on the red carpet.

1586
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:15,024
What's that?

1587
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,794
Crab.

1588
00:55:16,794 --> 00:55:19,094
(Crab doing a double sidekick
on the red carpet)

1589
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:20,664
(Why are they so good?)

1590
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:22,534
(DONGHAE returns.)

1591
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:23,664
(And passes again.)

1592
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:25,034
What?

1593
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:27,434
(This is my strategy.)

1594
00:55:27,434 --> 00:55:29,744
(Thanks to that,
it's SIWON's turn again quickly.)

1595
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,804
You have to do that.

1596
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:33,444
Backflip.

1597
00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:36,514
- A cervical disk.
- Broken neck.

1598
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:37,944
The neck fell off.

1599
00:55:37,944 --> 00:55:39,384
While doing a backflip,
its neck fell off.

1600
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:41,954
Turtle.

1601
00:55:42,254 --> 00:55:43,754
(He can't explain,
but he's great at guessing.)

1602
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:45,554
(He's good.)

1603
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:48,794
- Wink.
- Winked and...

1604
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:50,024
Magnesium deficiency.

1605
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:54,894
While winking...

1606
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,964
Winked and hurt its eye.

1607
00:55:56,964 --> 00:55:58,234
Twitch.

1608
00:55:58,234 --> 00:55:59,634
Winked and got an eye twitch.

1609
00:56:00,534 --> 00:56:03,704
(This is a sea otter, not an otter.)

1610
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,314
Otter.

1611
00:56:06,314 --> 00:56:09,544
Otter with an eye twitch from winking.

1612
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:12,214
(Touched)

1613
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:16,254
(Unusual movements)

1614
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:18,154
Twist? What's that?

1615
00:56:18,154 --> 00:56:19,794
Salsa.

1616
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:21,454
(Two words)

1617
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,724
(What was this?)

1618
00:56:24,724 --> 00:56:27,434
(They're saying all the sports dances.)

1619
00:56:27,434 --> 00:56:29,804
(Panting)

1620
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,004
YESUNG's solo concert.

1621
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:33,734
Pass this. It's too hard.

1622
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:34,904
Show us the next part.

1623
00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:37,474
(Bear levitating
while dancing sports dance)

1624
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:38,704
Levitating.

1625
00:56:40,114 --> 00:56:41,114
Tyrannosaurus?

1626
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,544
That's it.

1627
00:56:42,544 --> 00:56:43,414
Good.

1628
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:44,914
(A one-syllable word)

1629
00:56:44,914 --> 00:56:46,514
- Dragon.
- Snake.

1630
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,754
(Hibernating)

1631
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:51,084
Bear.

1632
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:52,384
What is this?

1633
00:56:52,384 --> 00:56:55,294
(Only "sports dance" is left now.)

1634
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:56,794
Sports dance.

1635
00:56:56,794 --> 00:56:58,694
Bear levitating...

1636
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:00,464
while dancing sports dance.

1637
00:57:02,334 --> 00:57:03,404
Sports dance.

1638
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:05,764
Do this one well.

1639
00:57:06,804 --> 00:57:08,234
This should be fun.

1640
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:09,544
Belly button.

1641
00:57:09,544 --> 00:57:12,004
Digging out belly button...

1642
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:13,044
Eating belly button gunk.

1643
00:57:13,374 --> 00:57:14,674
(The back looks like this.)

1644
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:15,574
Camel.

1645
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:17,244
Camel eating belly button gunk.

1646
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:18,244
No.

1647
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:19,754
(The judge rejects it.)

1648
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:22,254
There's a key point here.

1649
00:57:22,254 --> 00:57:23,484
(The judge sees every detail.)

1650
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:28,124
Camel that scratched its belly button gunk
and ate it.

1651
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:30,264
Camel that ate a bit of belly button gunk.

1652
00:57:30,264 --> 00:57:32,594
Camel that ate a bit of belly button gunk.

1653
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:34,034
(Something like that)

1654
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,834
Camel that nibbled on belly button gunk.

1655
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:37,804
(What even is this?)

1656
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,974
Change the expression.

1657
00:57:39,974 --> 00:57:41,404
That's what matters.

1658
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:43,344
(An actor knows how to phrase it.)

1659
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:45,074
Camel that pulled out
and ate stuck belly button gunk.

1660
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:48,844
(Finally correct)

1661
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,444
You had to reword it.

1662
00:57:51,284 --> 00:57:53,714
(I did my best.)

1663
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:55,454
SIWON is good at this game.

1664
00:57:56,524 --> 00:57:58,224
(King Kong admiring himself
while showering)

1665
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,394
Showering.

1666
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,554
Looking in the mirror.

1667
00:58:02,394 --> 00:58:04,424
(What is he doing?)

1668
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:07,094
- What are you doing?
- Narcissism?

1669
00:58:07,094 --> 00:58:08,964
Admiring himself.

1670
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:12,164
King Kong admiring himself
while showering.

1671
00:58:13,504 --> 00:58:15,234
(He actually got that?)

1672
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:17,074
(I'm good at guessing.)

1673
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:18,444
(Zombie pig wearing a pearl necklace)

1674
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:21,044
(You wear it on your neck.)

1675
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:23,144
(A round thing)

1676
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:25,614
What's the thing you wear while eating?

1677
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:28,854
(He's thinking of a baby bib.)

1678
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:30,854
- Necklace.
- Pearl necklace.

1679
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,224
(That's it!)

1680
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:34,154
(Snort)

1681
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:35,154
Zombie.

1682
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:38,264
(Look at me. I look like a pig, right?)

1683
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,534
Pig.

1684
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:41,464
Pig wearing a pearl necklace.

1685
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:44,334
Pig wearing a pearl necklace
going sniff sniff.

1686
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:46,974
It's hard to get this part right.

1687
00:58:46,974 --> 00:58:48,074
Crazy pig.

1688
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:51,904
A pig that became a zombie.

1689
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:54,114
Pig that turned into a zombie
wearing a pearl necklace.

1690
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,514
Time is up.

1691
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:56,914
Game over.

1692
00:58:56,914 --> 00:58:59,284
That was so hard.

1693
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:00,284
How many did they get?

1694
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:02,084
It's a tie.

1695
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:03,284
Ten-to-ten.

1696
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:05,124
Really? Ten-to-ten?

1697
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,894
How about this then?

1698
00:59:06,894 --> 00:59:09,394
Since SIWON seems
like a master of expressions,

1699
00:59:09,394 --> 00:59:11,724
let SIWON act out one phrase...

1700
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:14,164
and whichever team guesses it wins.

1701
00:59:14,494 --> 00:59:16,634
(You're a great host.)

1702
00:59:16,634 --> 00:59:20,134
We shouldn't say the words out loud.

1703
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:21,834
They could copy our answer.

1704
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,004
So we have to think carefully.

1705
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:26,214
And if your team guesses once,

1706
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:27,274
the chance goes to the other team.

1707
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:28,414
Okay?

1708
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:30,144
Let's go. I'll show the phrase to SIWON.

1709
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:31,214
Here it is.

1710
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:33,754
(Got it)

1711
00:59:33,754 --> 00:59:35,384
He looks confident.

1712
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:37,424
(Straight to the ground right away)

1713
00:59:40,554 --> 00:59:42,394
(Crying)

1714
00:59:42,694 --> 00:59:43,794
Isn't that scrubbing?

1715
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:48,194
(SIWON scrubbing while lying down?)

1716
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:50,604
(After getting scrubbed in the bathhouse,)

1717
00:59:50,604 --> 00:59:52,464
(looking refreshed?)

1718
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:53,974
Got it. I know the first part.

1719
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:54,874
But the animal...

1720
00:59:54,874 --> 00:59:55,874
(Be quiet.)

1721
00:59:55,874 --> 00:59:58,374
(Does Team LEETEUK also have
the same answer?)

1722
00:59:59,004 --> 01:00:00,014
Okay.

1723
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:03,414
(The second keyword looks easy.)

1724
01:00:03,414 --> 01:00:05,414
(Then immediately, third keyword)

1725
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:06,414
I know.

1726
01:00:06,714 --> 01:00:07,714
I know.

1727
01:00:09,154 --> 01:00:12,024
(He's guessing it at once?)

1728
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:14,594
I know.
Shark shedding tears while getting waxed.

1729
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:17,224
(No way)

1730
01:00:17,224 --> 01:00:19,194
(Is that really the answer?)

1731
01:00:19,194 --> 01:00:20,464
Wrong. That's not the answer.

1732
01:00:20,464 --> 01:00:24,104
(The chance goes to Team LEETEUK.)

1733
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:27,874
Naked and sleeping, then shocked...

1734
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,404
No.

1735
01:00:29,404 --> 01:00:31,074
- Wrong.
- I know.

1736
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:33,214
(Back to Team HEECHUL again)

1737
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:34,444
YESUNG, go ahead.

1738
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:35,444
Go.

1739
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:40,414
Loach shedding tears while getting waxed.

1740
01:00:40,414 --> 01:00:41,414
Correct!

1741
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:43,424
Correct!

1742
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:46,054
(Getting waxed)

1743
01:00:46,054 --> 01:00:46,954
(Shedding tears)

1744
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:49,664
(Loach)

1745
01:00:49,664 --> 01:00:51,894
Team HEECHUL wins.

1746
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:53,734
I thought he was naked.

1747
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,264
You should've expressed waxing properly.

1748
01:00:55,264 --> 01:00:56,164
He expressed waxing accurately.

1749
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:58,664
I've never been waxed,
but it felt like I had.

1750
01:00:58,664 --> 01:01:00,774
Team HEECHUL wins.

1751
01:01:00,774 --> 01:01:03,204
- Good job.
- Since Team HEECHUL won,

1752
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:04,674
this is a gift for Team HEECHUL.

1753
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:06,144
A laptop.

1754
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:09,414
Who will take the prize?

1755
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:12,814
Or will they donate it to SHINDONG?

1756
01:01:12,814 --> 01:01:14,484
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1757
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:15,584
Fair rock-paper-scissors.

1758
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:16,684
Okay.

1759
01:01:16,684 --> 01:01:18,584
(Naturally joins them)

1760
01:01:18,584 --> 01:01:21,424
I can do it, too,
since there's the donation option.

1761
01:01:21,424 --> 01:01:23,624
No play, no win. Rock, paper, scissors.

1762
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:24,564
Rock, paper, scissors.

1763
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:25,494
Rock, paper, scissors.

1764
01:01:25,494 --> 01:01:26,494
Rock, paper, scissors.

1765
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:28,594
(DONGHAE, YESUNG, and SHINDONG are out.)

1766
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:30,104
YESUNG, why are you sweating so much?

1767
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:31,634
- Stand in the back.
- But I tried so hard.

1768
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:33,104
I really gave it my all.

1769
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:35,334
- Dude, your sweat...
- Why are you sweating so much?

1770
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:37,874
He doesn't sweat like this
even at our concert. What happened?

1771
01:01:39,544 --> 01:01:40,414
HEECHUL versus SIWON.

1772
01:01:40,414 --> 01:01:41,644
Rock, paper, scissors.

1773
01:01:42,174 --> 01:01:43,444
Rock, paper, scissors.

1774
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:45,614
(SIWON wins.)

1775
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:47,314
I did all the work and gave it away.

1776
01:01:48,384 --> 01:01:52,684
(The brand-new laptop goes to SIWON.)

1777
01:01:52,684 --> 01:01:54,324
We're going on a retreat.

1778
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:55,954
I'm really good at being the guide.

1779
01:01:55,954 --> 01:01:58,224
Everyone, are you ready to leave?

1780
01:01:58,224 --> 01:02:00,464
We are SUPER JUNIOR.

1781
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:04,064
(Entertainment time on the bus)

1782
01:02:04,064 --> 01:02:05,664
(Absolute chaos)

1783
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:07,034
(Absurd and outrageous wrong answers)

1784
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:08,634
The first meeting is too well-planned.

1785
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:09,534
Wrong.

1786
01:02:10,244 --> 01:02:13,514
(Completely unrecognizable impressions)

1787
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:15,144
(Right up his alley)

1788
01:02:15,144 --> 01:02:17,984
(EUNHYUK the guide collecting fees)

1789
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:20,114
(How much money did RYEOWOOK bring
for the older members?)

1790
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:21,614
(Touched)

1791
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:23,324
(The younger members feel betrayed
by the older members?)

1792
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:25,254
What's wrong with you guys?

1793
01:02:25,254 --> 01:02:26,639
(Will this retreat end
without any trouble?)
