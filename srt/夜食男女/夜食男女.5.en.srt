1
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,691
You people are ruining our country!

2
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,559
Should we just let them be?

3
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,605
Shouldn't we talk to them and work it out?

4
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,069
Me? Why should I?

5
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,784
There's someone else who should do it.

6
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,701
Is there a homosexual among the employees?

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,860
Go get A-jin.

8
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,447
Homosexual love is not love. It's a sin!

9
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,203
Go. And throw this out on the way.

10
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,535
Okay.

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
-Leave!
-Goodness...

12
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,673
-Leave!
-What a mess.

13
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,344
I didn't think you'd really not do it.

14
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,848
You're the one who talked me into this,
and now you're quitting?

15
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,274
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,597
May I ask why?

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,939
Because being in front of cameras

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,400
is not for me.

19
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:56,872
They'll find someone who looks much better
in your clothes than I do.

20
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,617
I'm not doing it either.

21
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,752
Why?

22
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,462
You're quitting, too?

23
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,502
I didn't want to do it from the start.

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,170
I only agreed because you persuaded me.

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,354
A-jin?

26
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,638
Isn't that Ms. Kim?

27
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:27,024
If you publicly support a gay
on a TV show, what will children learn?

28
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:32,815
Well, I don't intend to support
a specific group through this show.

29
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,742
So you can just leave it be and not watch.

30
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,289
What I want to say is that if we admit
that we're not different--

31
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,460
Why did you do that?

32
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,679
96% OF CITIZENS ARE
AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY!

33
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,175
Well... Should I go stop them?

34
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,307
No, don't. She should clean up
her own mess.

35
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,532
-But...
-Don't.

36
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,066
Hey, let's go. Now!

37
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,572
You repent, okay?

38
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,275
Run!

39
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,382
Are you okay?

40
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,924
Yes, I'm okay.

41
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,569
What happened to you? Are you okay?

42
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,402
I'm okay. I'm fine, really.

43
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,658
-I'm really okay.
-My goodness.

44
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,655
Wait a moment here, okay?

45
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,293
-What about you?
-I'm okay.

46
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,423
Mr. Kang.

47
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,587
No, it'll get ruined, too.

48
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,921
It's okay. Just put it on.

49
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,471
What's going on?
Why did you come here together?

50
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,105
A-jin, get in.

51
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,017
Where are you taking me?

52
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,985
Just get in.

53
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,698
By the way, do you two have
any other plans today?

54
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,738
If you have time,
would you like to join us?

55
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,036
Where are you going?

56
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,286
You'll see.

57
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,002
A-jin, hurry.

58
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,422
-Hurry up!
-Let's go.

59
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,092
What are they saying?

60
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,552
Jae-su, go find out what they're up to.

61
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,847
Me?

62
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,258
I don't like it
when those four gather together.

63
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,385
Hey, go now. Hurry up.

64
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,486
What? Go.

65
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,531
Just go. Go now.

66
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,528
Just go get in the car.

67
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,083
Anyway, where are we...

68
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,329
What are you doing?

69
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,877
Why did you get in?

70
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,380
You must be so startled.
Are you all right?

71
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,637
Yes, I'm all right.

72
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,264
She says she's all right.
So get out of the car.

73
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,560
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere far away.

74
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,144
All of you?

75
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,313
I'll go with you.

76
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,395
Why?

77
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,816
We all worked on the pilot together.
So I'll go, too.

78
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,364
But seriously, where are we going?

79
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
There's a perfect place
for a time like this.

80
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,703
Just trust me, okay?

81
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,037
-All right. We'll get going now.
-Wait.

82
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,955
Ms. Kim, switch seats with me.

83
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,547
-What?
-I get carsick very easily.

84
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,585
Why don't we just ditch him?

85
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,174
It was spur of the moment,
but I'm glad we're on this trip.

86
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,418
This feels nice. Right?

87
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,629
Me, too.

88
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,335
<i>We're in Gangwon Province.</i>

89
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,554
<i>Everyone's here,
including Chef Park and Mr. Kang.</i>

90
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,005
What? Why would she take them there
when they said they wouldn't do the show?

91
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,387
<i>They said they wouldn't do the show.
Why did she take them there?</i>

92
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,975
<i>Wait. Did they agree to do it?</i>

93
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,814
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

94
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,108
Hey, keep me posted, okay?

95
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,693
<i>Yes, sir. Don't worry.</i>

96
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,357
<i>I'll keep you posted
on the real-time status.</i>

97
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,378
I can't stand that jerk.
He's here to keep an eye on us.

98
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,172
Of course, he is.

99
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,967
I'll try and distract him,

100
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,006
so go persuade Chef Park and Mr. Kang
in the meantime. Okay?

101
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,314
Don't tell me...

102
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,684
They don't call me a writer for nothing.

103
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,188
I came up with a little scenario
on my own, you know.

104
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,904
God, I can't believe you.

105
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,200
All right. Let's throw him
in the water first.

106
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,082
Hey, Mr. No.

107
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,501
-Oh, my.
-Mr. No.

108
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,080
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking a selfie.

109
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,706
-Why don't we take a walk?
-Let's go.

110
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,592
-This is nice.
-It really is.

111
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,297
Who are you texting so much?

112
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,514
-It was my mom.
-Oh, your mom?

113
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,054
She asked about side dishes.

114
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,771
-Your mom's well, right?
-Sure, she's healthy.

115
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,230
By the way, earlier...

116
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,194
Hey, stop! What are you doing?

117
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,068
A-jin.

118
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,158
Don't! No!

119
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,530
Don't! Stop!

120
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,247
No!

121
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,427
No, I'm okay.

122
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,354
No, wait.

123
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,564
Wait. No!

124
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,467
-I'm so cold.
-Me, too.

125
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,339
It really is cold.

126
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,965
But don't you think we should stay
a little longer?

127
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,728
What if we play hooky today?

128
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,982
-Let's stay out all night.
-What?

129
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,725
What? Where would we sleep?

130
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,237
We can just get a room.

131
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,700
What do you say?

132
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,370
I don't think I can. I can't sleep
in an unfamiliar place.

133
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,366
That's good. Then you can just go home.

134
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,873
What about our clothes?

135
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,335
Well... We can go to town
and buy some. There's a market nearby.

136
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,300
We can also get some barbecue.

137
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,921
Barbecue?

138
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,178
Would that be okay?

139
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,682
Yes. Sure...

140
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,063
-And you?
-Sure.

141
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,811
Then you're the only one
who needs to go home.

142
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,109
All right.

143
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,401
Rock-paper-scissors,
the loser goes grocery shopping.

144
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,985
-Rock-paper-scissors!
-Scissors!

145
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,361
Yes!

146
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,121
No, no. This doesn't count.

147
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
-Why?
-You can't do it so suddenly.

148
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,325
That's ridiculous. You can't do that.

149
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,163
Guys, forget it. I'll go with him.

150
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,378
It's better if I buy groceries anyway.

151
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,882
Is that so?
Well, Ms. Kim wants to join you, too.

152
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,302
Sure, you can go.

153
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,300
What?

154
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,681
All of us are here today because of her.

155
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
-So she should go, too.
-Right. I will.

156
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,386
-Good.
-I'll go with you.

157
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,432
-Then, give me the car key. I'll drive.
-Right.

158
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,227
-Sure.
-But what about your car?

159
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,400
She's covered in sand. Is it okay?

160
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,229
-Sure. It's okay. Don't worry about it.
-Let's go then.

161
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,565
-See you later.
-Okay.

162
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,697
-Gosh, are you okay?
-Oh, my.

163
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,822
Goodness.

164
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,658
Persuade them while you're at the market.

165
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,204
-Okay?
-God...

166
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,415
I can't believe you. I'll see you later.

167
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,495
You're really something.

168
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,247
You're definitely a TV show writer.

169
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,085
Okay. Let's go find a room.

170
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,598
Someone threw paint bombs at A-jin
in front of the building.

171
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,854
She was covered in paint.
It was such a mess.

172
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,227
You saw it, too, right?

173
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,324
Yes, I did. It was unbelievable.

174
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,989
So are you saying Ms. Kim dealt
with those homophobic people alone?

175
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,409
-Yes.
-What was Mr. Nam doing then?

176
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,624
He was just watching
with his arms crossed.

177
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,826
But what's worse

178
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,917
is that he lashed out at Mr. Lee
earlier. I heard it was crazy.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
-Gyu-jang did?
-Yes.

180
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,169
What's wrong with him?

181
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,303
He's so annoying.

182
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,557
<i>You have nothing else to do but
to meddle in other people's business.</i>

183
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,361
Am I wrong? Am I?

184
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,648
Seriously, aren't you ashamed?

185
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,692
What kind of senior producer snoops around
from team to team for free drinks?

186
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,658
-Stop it now. I'm sorry.
-Let go.

187
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,818
Our female director was your junior

188
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,537
and she yells at you all the time,
but you still go around talking nonsense.

189
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,245
He hit the nail on the head.

190
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,240
SAMCHEON PORT RAW FISH CENTER

191
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,075
They're really fresh.

192
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,129
If you grill this, it's really delicious.

193
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,673
You love sashimi. Why don't we buy some?

194
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,755
Sure.

195
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,014
-What else do you want to eat?
-What?

196
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,972
Just say it. I'll cook anything for you.

197
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,759
What's this?

198
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,927
Shall we buy shrimps and scallops, too?

199
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,726
-You love them.
-I'd love that.

200
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,479
Your boyfriend is so sweet.

201
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,981
You must be good at cooking.

202
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,321
-He's not my boyfriend.
-Then is he your husband?

203
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,654
No.

204
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,659
-Have a nice day.
-Sure.

205
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,155
Hey.

206
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,911
What was that?

207
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,325
She just mistook us for a couple.

208
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,333
-That's all.
-We don't look like a couple at all.

209
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,415
-What?
-What? You little...

210
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,421
-Mr. Kang.
-Come on. Hurry.

211
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,881
Hurry up.

212
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,302
-I'll go buy some fruit.
-Sure.

213
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,295
-Hurry, okay?
-Okay.

214
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,391
Should we buy some octopus, too?

215
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,015
Ms. Kim likes it, so I'd make
octopus carpaccio for her sometimes.

216
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,106
You and Ms. Kim must be pretty close.
You speak to each other like friends.

217
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,280
Yes, we knew each other before the show.
She's a regular at my bistro.

218
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,488
Do you usually make friends
with your regulars?

219
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,157
Well, I wouldn't say that.
But we're the same age,

220
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,212
and live in the same building.

221
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,043
You two live in the same building?

222
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,673
What a coincidence, right?

223
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,797
I'm selling a lobster at half price
to one person.

224
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,224
-Half price!
-That's awesome.

225
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,222
-Half price!
-Me! I'll buy it!

226
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,965
You're really fast. Is 20,000 won cool?

227
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,137
-Cool!
-Okay. Great.

228
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,809
This is awesome. We got really lucky!

229
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,057
A-jin will love it!

230
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,821
-A-jin!
-What? What's going on?

231
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,864
What's going on?

232
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,868
I'm buying a lobster.

233
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,199
-Really?
-Sold to one person at half price.

234
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,164
Really?

235
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,664
Yes, I was really lucky.

236
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,076
I've never tried lobster before.

237
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,415
Really?

238
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,250
Then you'll experience
a whole new world of taste today.

239
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,586
This is awesome!

240
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,010
-He's packing it, so we'll get it soon.
-Okay.

241
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,261
-I bought some fruit.
-That's good.

242
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,509
I like meat, you know.

243
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,018
What's up with him? Is he sulking?

244
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,390
What? Is he?

245
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,687
Hold this.

246
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,020
Mr. Kang!

247
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,435
Hey, A-jin.

248
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,194
Mr. Kang. You like meat?

249
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,076
Wait. If we sit across from each other,

250
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:22,962
they might be more comfortable
and it'll be easier to talk about work.

251
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,959
Ms. Yoo?

252
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,131
Thanks.

253
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,548
-How does it taste?
-It's bland.

254
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,350
It's too bland.

255
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,482
Then I should put more coffee in mine.

256
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,810
-Seong-eun!
-Oh, they're here.

257
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,305
-Ta-da!
-Hey.

258
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,066
-Look at this!
-What about mine?

259
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,648
-It's so cute.
-Right?

260
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,573
-It'll look good on you.
-And that's mine.

261
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,402
-Okay.
-It looks good, right?

262
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,952
-I think he's right.
-Right?

263
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,236
So how did it go?
Did they change their mind?

264
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,615
-I couldn't bring it up.
-Why?

265
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,036
How could I talk to them in the market?

266
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,165
I don't know.

267
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,835
It's okay. We have plenty of time today.

268
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,594
Let's do this.

269
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,683
-Just get changed first.
-All right, all right.

270
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,763
Come in.

271
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,431
Hi.

272
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,016
You sent for me, ma'am?

273
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,018
What about A-jin?

274
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,443
She's out on business.

275
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,478
Where?

276
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,534
To persuade Chef Park.

277
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,319
Why?

278
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,453
Didn't you say you'd persuade Chef Park
by yourself?

279
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,374
Well, that's...

280
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,964
I heard she's pretty close with him, so...

281
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,884
-Gyu-jang.
-Yes, ma'am?

282
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,460
Why do you think I gave you that?

283
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:52,967
Pardon?

284
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,257
You can't see it?

285
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,595
Charisma, leadership,
sacrifice, and tolerance.

286
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,895
That's what the title I gave you means.

287
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,437
Ms. Cha, I'll try to get along with A-jin
from now on.

288
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,355
Hold onto it tightly,

289
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,320
or someone will snatch it.

290
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,119
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,998
-Gyu-jang.
-Yes?

292
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,710
There's this one thing
I really can't stand.

293
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,337
What might that be?

294
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,462
Being rude to one's superior.

295
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,971
Being rude to one's superior...

296
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,934
Now leave.
You must have a lot to do today.

297
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,597
Yes, ma'am.

298
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,749
So you're the producer?

299
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,119
If we admit--

300
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,455
Today I realized

301
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:20,051
that a studio is not where I should be.

302
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,602
<i>If Chef Park is out,</i>

303
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,388
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> is out, too.

304
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,529
What's she doing over there by herself?

305
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,950
Ms. Yoo.

306
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,742
You said you wanted to meet me

307
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,535
to talk about something regarding Ms. Kim.

308
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,961
What is it?

309
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,707
Well, it's...

310
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,457
You know, Mr. Nam claimed

311
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,005
that you're not doing the show
because of A-jin.

312
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,433
That she's playing a dirty trick on him.

313
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,101
He made a nonsense accusation like that.
It drove me crazy.

314
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,680
What? That's just ridiculous.

315
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,346
Tell me about it.

316
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,983
He said that she plotted with you
to screw him over

317
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,483
because she's not
the main producer anymore.

318
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,566
That's what he said.

319
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,361
How could he even think of such a thing?

320
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,360
He's so terrible.

321
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,036
But the even bigger problem

322
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,793
is that the director said
if you don't do the show,

323
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,205
it'll be canceled.

324
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,131
God, I feel so bad for A-jin.

325
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,506
It took her four years to finally
get an opportunity like this.

326
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,763
She's been through a lot
to come this far, you know.

327
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,989
Sang-yeong.

328
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,288
I apologize for what I did earlier.

329
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,659
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,958
It's okay, you punk.

331
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,341
What do you mean, it's okay?

332
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,710
Tell the director
that I apologized to you, okay?

333
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,300
What is this?

334
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,554
Are you apologizing
because the director told you to?

335
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,596
So you don't mean it?

336
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,345
What's the difference?
You still got an apology.

337
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,774
Look, Nam Gyu-jang.

338
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,402
What?

339
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,360
If you're here to apologize,
do it properly.

340
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,694
Say you did wrong and ask for forgiveness.

341
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,237
The way I see it,
that's how you accept an apology.

342
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,040
You said yourself that you're like a dove
in our department.

343
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,408
You said you're a peacemaker here.

344
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,246
Then stop making a fuss
and just let it slide.

345
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,087
What did you say? You little...

346
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,168
I can't stand you
pretending to be all nice.

347
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,300
What?

348
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,590
Hey. When did I pretend to be nice?

349
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,217
I know about <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

350
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,305
You were offered <i>Sweet Munchies</i> first,
but you turned it down.

351
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,810
Why?

352
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,982
Just because I'm hungry
doesn't mean I should take anything.

353
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,901
You said you're dying to produce a show.
Why are you being so picky?

354
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,020
Producing a show is all about teamwork.

355
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,648
I knew how A-jin felt
about the show, so how could--

356
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,105
Exactly!

357
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,197
You did it because you didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

358
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,542
If you don't hurt her feelings,
does that make you a good person?

359
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,578
Right. So what you want to achieve at CKTV
is to become a good person?

360
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,793
Yes! I want to become a good person!

361
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,705
Getting along
with all my superiors and juniors--

362
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,963
Sang-yeong!

363
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,375
Becoming a good person
in the Entertainment Department means...

364
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,723
This is ridiculous...

365
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,097
It means becoming a producer
who makes good shows.

366
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,029
Oh, my gosh. You scared me.

367
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,038
Ms. Yoo told me.

368
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:27,126
That Mr. Nam is giving you
a really hard time, isn't he?

369
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,300
It must be difficult.

370
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,654
Why don't I guess what you are...

371
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,824
thinking right now?

372
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,530
What do you think I'm thinking right now?

373
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,949
"There are two people here

374
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,832
that I must persuade.

375
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,166
How should I bring it up?

376
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,584
And how should I persuade them?"

377
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,588
Something like that, right?

378
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,971
No. The opposite, actually.

379
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,974
The opposite?

380
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,023
I think I started to understand...

381
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,266
why you don't want to do it.

382
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,944
So I was thinking

383
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,992
I should respect your decision.

384
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,412
Why?

385
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,295
Because I saw
how people reacted to the show.

386
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,050
People were looking at me

387
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,047
with hatred and anger.

388
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,229
I felt so sad.

389
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,315
How can I persuade you
when I know that it'll hurt you?

390
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,148
What I mean is...

391
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,025
I...

392
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,989
had no idea how it's been for you.

393
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,830
I'm sorry about that.

394
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,207
And...

395
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,883
thank you.

396
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,617
It looks delicious.

397
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,046
All right, guys. The food's ready.

398
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,509
First, the vegetables. Then the shrimp.

399
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,010
Then the meat.

400
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,093
Finally, the long-awaited...

401
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,682
-What is it?
-Ta-da!

402
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,524
Doesn't it look great?

403
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,233
Dig in, everyone.

404
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,686
-Thank you for cooking.
-Thank you.

405
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,771
Look at this.

406
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,698
It's amazing.
It's perfectly firm and chewy.

407
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,244
I think it's better
because you grilled it over charcoal.

408
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,158
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

409
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,456
People don't call me Chef for nothing.

410
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,627
I'll try the meat.

411
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,538
-Thanks for the food.
-Meat.

412
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,836
Enjoy.

413
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,876
It's hot.

414
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,093
It's good, right?

415
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,232
Here. I'll do that for you.

416
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,562
-It's okay.
-Here.

417
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,652
-I always eat shrimp whole.
-Really?

418
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,358
I'll try that, too.

419
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,204
It's so good.

420
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,994
It's unbelievably delicious.

421
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,753
Oh, my.

422
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,583
What's wrong?

423
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,961
-It's the director.
-Goodness.

424
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,260
-I'll go take this call.
-Okay.

425
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,726
Yes, Ms. Cha.

426
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,234
You ditch work
because of such a small incident?

427
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,021
Then how can I entrust anything to you?

428
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,566
You'll end up running away
whenever something happens in the future.

429
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,951
Well, that's not it. I didn't run away--

430
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,448
<i>You think I made time to call you
so I could listen to your excuses?</i>

431
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,872
I'm sorry, ma'am.

432
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,909
You can ditch your responsibility today,
but not tomorrow. Why?

433
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,327
Because it'll mean <i>Sweet Munchies</i> is out.

434
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,128
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

435
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,467
Gather everyone on the <i>Sweet Munchies</i> team
at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

436
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,630
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

437
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,968
But if you fail to persuade Chef Park,
there's no need to have a meeting.

438
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,430
-Pardon?
<i>-Because if he doesn't do the show,</i>

439
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,137
<i>there'll be no</i> Sweet Munchies.

440
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,107
Ms. Cha. But...

441
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,041
What? No, it's nothing.

442
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,170
Our team meeting is at two tomorrow.

443
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,300
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

444
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,807
Let's have fun until two tomorrow.

445
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,691
-Until 2 p.m.
-Yes, until 2 p.m.

446
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,771
It's going to be okay.

447
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,529
Ta-da!

448
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,689
-What?
-Amazing!

449
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,162
-Did you buy that in the market?
-Yes.

450
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,119
-He's doing it all himself.
-Right.

451
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,174
Lobster shells never expand.

452
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,853
So as they grow,

453
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,517
the hard shells put more and more stress
on a lobster's soft flesh.

454
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,347
When that happens,
they go deep into the sea

455
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,685
and shed their old shells
to grow new ones.

456
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,431
It's so cute.

457
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,136
I think when times are difficult,

458
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,060
it means it's time for you to grow.

459
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:44,356
Well, that's if you can take advantage
of the hardship, of course.

460
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,165
You know, our Chef Park looks cool
when cooking,

461
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,676
but when he says things like that,
he's amazingly cool. Isn't he?

462
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,757
Goodness... You like that?

463
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,177
But he doesn't like women.

464
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,733
-I know.
-Then why are you being like that?

465
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,809
-Like what?
-What?

466
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,734
-What's your problem?
-What do you mean?

467
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,025
Anyway. Chef Park, Mr. Kang.

468
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,319
Don't you think our teamwork is amazing?

469
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:31,033
So what do you think about
working together again with this team?

470
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,655
-Gosh, not much food's left. You eat some.
-What?

471
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,674
Fine. I'll just eat.

472
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,837
Mr. Kang, you eat some more, too.

473
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,210
-Jin-seong. You, too.
-Okay.

474
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,811
My goodness.

475
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,258
-My goodness.
-Wow.

476
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,611
-You eat it.
-No, you eat it.

477
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,730
There's only one claw meat left.

478
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,397
No, you made all the food. So you eat it.

479
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,565
-I'm okay. You eat it.
-No, you eat it.

480
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,624
-You eat it.
-No, you eat it.

481
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,739
-This is the best part.
-No, you eat it.

482
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,946
Oh, come on.

483
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,327
Enjoy it, Mr. Kang. Please.

484
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,628
It really is good.

485
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,091
Here, Jin-seong.

486
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,558
-What's with you?
-Okay, fine.

487
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,693
Let's dig in. Do we have to cut it to eat?

488
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,439
-I have this.
-You'll eat it all?

489
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,574
Of course.

490
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,787
NO JAE-SU

491
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,666
<i>-My battery is dying--</i>
-Damn it.

492
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,087
NO JAE-SU

493
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,970
God, this idiot...

494
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,934
This is driving me crazy.

495
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,313
What? The director...

496
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,730
Hello, Ms. Cha...

497
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,153
Oh, it's you.

498
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,857
DIRECTOR:
I CAN'T STAND RUDENESS TO ONE'S SUPERIOR

499
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,407
CHA: YOU SHOULD MAKE SOMEONE YOU HATE
YOUR FRIEND, RATHER THAN YOUR ENEMY

500
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,745
What's this?

501
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,792
Is she saying I can't go home
until I make up with you?

502
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,001
Darn it.

503
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,259
This is crazy.

504
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,641
I can't just ignore her
since she's the director.

505
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,899
Hey, Gyu-jang.

506
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,397
What? What is it?

507
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,742
You know my name, right?

508
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,793
Sang-yeong. If you read it backward,
it means "video."

509
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,580
From the moment I was given this name,

510
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,337
I started to think it was my fate.

511
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,304
My fate is to produce TV shows
and show them to people.

512
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,303
I didn't say it isn't.
There's no need to be so dramatic.

513
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,427
Anyway, I've thought over what you said.

514
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,773
And my conclusion is the same.
To me, a good person

515
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,943
is someone who can care
for the people around them.

516
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,531
Look. I think you should seriously
rethink things.

517
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,362
You think your life will turn out well
if you alone are successful?

518
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,695
Ms. Cha.

519
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,084
How can you guys fight if you're hungry?

520
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,712
Eat this before you fight.

521
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,591
Where are you going? You're not eating?

522
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,380
But you guys haven't made up yet.

523
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,181
I'm going to the restroom first,
so that I can eat a lot.

524
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,311
My goodness.

525
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,071
I'm so full.

526
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,001
Well, I want to thank

527
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,552
both of you.

528
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,219
You even ditched work for me.

529
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,425
I feel a lot better now thanks to you.

530
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,604
I'm quite sleepy, so I'll go to bed first.

531
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,225
-Good night.
-You, too.

532
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,197
Today was...

533
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,252
a little unexpected, but it was fun.

534
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,053
Yes.

535
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,126
You're right.

536
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,055
Should we go to bed, too?

537
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,583
What the heck?

538
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,474
No, just leave him.
First come, first served.

539
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,839
I can sleep on the floor.

540
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,385
Unbelievable.

541
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,991
What's that?

542
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,525
You like to drink beer with <i>jokbal.</i>

543
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,286
And you like to drink wine with it.

544
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,667
Such strange preferences.

545
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
Hey.

546
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,886
I've known you guys for...

547
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,562
Well, I've known you for nine years and...

548
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,313
God, it's been too long.
I've known you for 20 years.

549
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,861
So we're almost like family.

550
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,732
Families don't need to make up.

551
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,743
You just sulk for a while
and get along again before you know it.

552
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,820
My goodness.

553
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,922
What? Where'd she go?

554
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,101
A-jin.

555
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,635
Want some morning coffee?

556
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,022
Thanks.

557
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,083
This feels so nice.

558
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,040
Having coffee while watching the sea.

559
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,082
Are you really

560
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,627
confident you'll be able
to persuade the director?

561
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,183
When will we get the chance
to watch the sea in the morning again?

562
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,515
So don't worry about anything else. Here.

563
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,728
Let's just enjoy the scenery.

564
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,730
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

565
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,692
It is.

566
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,717
Mr. Kang?

567
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,392
Look.

568
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,364
Where am I?

569
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,358
Where are we? Why were you on the bed?

570
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,857
What did you do to me?

571
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,828
Why would I do anything to you?

572
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,581
I clearly said I must sleep on the bed.

573
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,621
What? Are you crazy?

574
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:13,206
Are you saying I slept in the bed
on purpose?

575
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,854
I'm so offended.

576
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,468
-You're offended?
-What a weirdo.

577
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,886
I'm a weirdo? That's ridiculous.

578
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,236
What's going on?

579
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,664
What happened? Why am I here?

580
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,116
Tell me why I'm here!

581
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,879
Are you sure you can handle it?

582
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,499
You really want to know
what you did last night?

583
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,747
No.

584
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,257
What's he doing?

585
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,119
It's good.

586
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,750
-Shall we get going?
-Sure.

587
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,455
-You're driving?
-Of course.

588
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,467
I'll get in first.

589
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,589
Oh, gosh.

590
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,430
-Bye.
-Bye.

591
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,524
Bye.

592
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,819
Thank you, guys.

593
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,609
All right. We ditched work
and had fun yesterday.

594
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,653
So let's work harder today.

595
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,486
Okay! Let's get going now.

596
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,493
-Okay.
-Have a good day.

597
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,624
-You, too.
-Bye.

598
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,871
-Bye.
-Bye.

599
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,332
Bye.

600
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,415
How is she so cheerful?

601
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,337
Mr. Kang.

602
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,971
You said yesterday

603
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:16,938
that you did the show
because you were persuaded by me.

604
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,356
Yes.

605
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,189
What about it?

606
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,442
If it's not too late,

607
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,528
can you be persuaded by me once again?

608
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,910
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

609
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,462
Hello, ma'am.

610
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,631
Hello.

611
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,303
Sit down.

612
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,055
What will happen to <i>Sweet Munchies</i>?

613
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,907
How did it go with Chef Park?

614
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,000
Please give me more time.

615
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,828
I'll find a better chef than him
at all costs.

616
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,377
That's right, ma'am.

617
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,300
I assure you that I will find
someone 100 times better than him.

618
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,182
You just wasted my time.

619
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:40,854
Ms. Cha. I swear I'll find a better chef
if you give me time.

620
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:41,846
A better chef?

621
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,024
Okay, let's say we find one.

622
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,276
Will he be able to win viewers' hearts?

623
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,490
Can you guarantee that?

624
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,874
You two must think viewers
are quite generous.

625
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,958
In my experience, they are not.

626
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,210
I see...

627
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,585
I'm not too late, am I?

628
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,925
About <i>Sweet Munchies...</i>

629
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,439
I'll do it.

630
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,782
And Mr. Kang

631
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,866
will join us.

632
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,700
If Chef Park's doing it,

633
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,834
there's no reason I shouldn't.

634
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,885
What happened? What's gotten into you?

635
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:04,895
What?

636
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,517
You don't like it?
You want me not to do it?

637
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,396
No. That's not what I meant.

638
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,148
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

639
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,277
I mean,

640
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:19,082
are you really okay with this?

641
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,368
Yes.

642
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,753
Thank you, Jin-seong.

643
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,849
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

644
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,266
I'm okay. I should get going.

645
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,817
-Okay. See you.
-It hurts.

646
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,646
-I forgot my bag.
-Okay.

647
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,913
-Thank you, Jin-seong.
-Sure. Have a nice one.

648
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,080
-See you.
-See you.

649
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,029
How is it that you look
totally different when you work?

650
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,991
Does that happen to me, too?

651
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,778
That's good to hear.

652
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,735
Pardon?

653
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,698
That you look different?

654
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,253
To hear you talk to me like a friend.

655
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,169
Why don't we speak casually?

656
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,223
Using honorifics...

657
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,048
It's too formal.

658
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,638
Don't you think so, Jin-seong?

659
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,346
"Jin-seong?"

660
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,189
Then should I call you by your name?

661
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,743
Okay. Let's do that.

662
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,704
Mr. Kang.

663
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,867
Tae-wan.

664
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,814
Father.

665
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,845
Hello.

666
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,227
He and I are doing the TV show together.

667
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,576
Should I step out for a minute?

668
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,792
No.

669
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,325
There's no need.

670
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,839
Okay, then.

671
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:17,748
I hear you didn't go.

672
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,338
So I rescheduled it.

673
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,468
If you don't go today,
I'll make it again tomorrow.

674
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,602
And I'll do the same
the day after tomorrow.

675
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,638
Let's bring it to a close this time.

676
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,102
Please don't.

677
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,396
Why do you keep turning it down?
She's perfect for you.

678
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,699
Let's talk about it later.

679
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,487
I have work to do.

680
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,316
So you should go.

681
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,246
What do you do?

682
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,295
I run a bistro. I'm a chef.

683
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:14,942
Okay.

684
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,269
I'll meet her.

685
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,113
So please leave now.

686
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,197
Don't disappoint me.

687
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,452
Have a nice day.

688
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,090
My goodness.

689
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,841
I didn't open the bistro last night
without any notice,

690
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,554
so my regulars must've been flustered.

691
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,562
Did I tell you that
I have a lot of regulars?

692
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,102
Are you bragging or something?

693
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,812
They couldn't help but become regulars.

694
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:04,148
Because I relieve their stress
whenever they come in.

695
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:10,619
You know, when I cook,
I put a lot of good energy

696
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,540
and good ingredients into the food.

697
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,627
But what about
when you're having a hard time?

698
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,245
What do you do then?

699
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,126
What do you mean?

700
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,095
I do what I like to do.

701
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Don't tell me...

702
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,780
You don't know what you like?

703
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,214
Isn't it funny?

704
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,924
What was that?

705
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:08,259
If you dance when you have a tough time,
it'll blow away your stress.

706
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,471
You call that dancing?

707
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,593
Then what is it?

708
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,598
Shake it like this.

709
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,519
I can't.

710
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,519
You're laughing. That's better.

711
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,792
I heard a lot about you.

712
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,828
That you're so focused on your work
that you don't see any women.

713
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:46,422
That you don't enjoy anything
other than your work.

714
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,796
I don't want to get married at all.

715
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,683
Why?

716
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,261
Because I don't want to make
my wife unhappy.

717
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,520
You don't think I'm attractive?

718
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,479
If that's not the case,

719
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,980
why don't we meet a few more times?

720
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:12,661
Because I'm confident that
I'll make you want to marry me.

721
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,660
If I didn't have anything I have now,

722
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,873
would you find me attractive?

723
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,041
You are...

724
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,621
totally my type.

725
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,798
I can tell by looking
at the clothes you designed

726
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,126
that you're really considerate.

727
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:34,585
You may look like a cold person
on the outside,

728
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,561
-but I know you're warm-hearted...
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

729
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,926
I do what I like to do.

730
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,515
Don't tell me...

731
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,647
You don't know what you like?

732
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,641
Welcome.

733
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,561
Tea-wan.

734
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,161
So this is what it looks like.

735
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,790
Can I sit here?

736
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,707
Of course.

737
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,296
Do you want a drink?

738
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:38,837
I'll have white wine.

739
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,314
All right. White wine...

740
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,152
You want something dry? Or light?

741
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,936
Whatever you recommend.

742
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,735
Then, the light one's better.

743
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,082
By the way,

744
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,118
didn't you go on a blind date?

745
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,788
Well, I did.

746
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,713
Why was it so short?

747
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:15,916
You didn't like her?

748
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,255
Wait. Did you get dumped?

749
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,180
No, it wasn't like that.
Just give me the drink.

750
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,180
Okay.

751
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,234
What will you cook for me?

752
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,902
-What did you have?
-I had escargot.

753
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,028
Escargot...

754
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,199
Wait a little.

755
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,896
This is moon snail escargot.

756
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,234
It's cheaper than escargot,

757
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,316
but it tastes...

758
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,610
All right.

759
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,342
Hold on.

760
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,347
This is really moon snail?

761
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,100
-It's good, isn't it?
-How come...

762
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,854
moon snail is more delicious
than those expensive snails?

763
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,870
So I'm guessing you didn't get dumped.

764
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,913
You just didn't like her, did you?

765
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:18,457
If you eat something
with someone you don't like,

766
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,924
it's not delicious, even if it's expensive
and supposed to be good.

767
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,466
But if you eat it with someone you like,

768
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:27,469
it tastes really good
even if it's just street food.

769
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,363
But I don't understand.

770
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,780
How come someone well-off like you
doesn't have a girlfriend?

771
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:48,568
Is there...

772
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,622
someone you have feelings for?

773
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,006
Is it a crush?

774
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,353
No.

775
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,980
There's no one.

776
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,070
What kind of woman do you like?

777
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,568
What's your type?

778
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,827
Long hair? Or short hair?

779
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,712
Well...

780
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,514
Someone who can understand me...

781
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,466
and love me for who I am.

782
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,348
If you want to be loved,

783
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,734
tell them...

784
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,395
how you feel first.

785
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,110
There's someone
you're interested in, right?

786
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,161
It's just between us.

787
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,578
You know, we're friends now.

788
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,416
Just tell me. Who is it?

789
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,399
You really think

790
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,652
I can meet

791
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,445
someone I love?

792
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,323
Tell them how you feel first.

793
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,664
You know, only the brave win love.

794
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,858
<i>I'll stop ignoring what I really like.</i>

795
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,149
<i>I caught him in the act.</i>

796
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,156
<i>I saw them holding hands like this.</i>

797
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:15,738
<i>Why don't we go eat</i> tteokbokki <i>together?</i>

798
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,780
Did you enjoy the <i>tteokbokki</i>?

799
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,907
-Yes.
<i>-You know,</i>

800
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,374
<i>they say your friend hurts you
more than your enemy.</i>

801
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,365
Are you looking down on me and viewers?

802
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,327
Look who's talking!

803
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,462
<i>I heard there was a burglar downstairs.</i>

804
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,375
Don't go.

805
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,915
You uploaded a post
regarding Mr. Park Jin-seong, right?

806
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,005
<i>Why are you claiming he isn't gay?</i>

807
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,263
<i>I'd want to hear that person</i>

808
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,636
-Tae-wan.
<i>-say he likes me.</i>

809
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,805
