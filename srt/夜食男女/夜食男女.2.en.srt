1
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
It's good.

2
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,664
It's so good.

3
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,710
His looks and cooking skills...

4
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,922
Isn't he the chef we were looking for,
Producer Kim?

5
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,763
Yes. You're right. Yes.

6
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,681
Well... Look at his hands.

7
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,550
They're so pretty, aren't they?

8
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,967
Your hands are so pretty.

9
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,982
Producer Kim.

10
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,521
Can we have a word in my office?

11
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,524
And Chef, why don't you come with us?

12
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,357
Me, too?

13
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,305
Everyone get ready.

14
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,748
Here he goes again.

15
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,917
Why? Is he doing that thing again?

16
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,304
Well, it's nothing new.

17
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,970
He must have a lot on his mind.

18
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,759
All right, we'll take a break.

19
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,222
Who do you think...

20
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,181
made this model depressed?

21
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,690
You don't just wear clothes.

22
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,523
You also wear emotions.

23
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,453
To make you feel emotions,

24
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,159
that's the most important thing
in fashion.

25
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,202
You guys have ruined

26
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,458
my mood as well as the model's.

27
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,270
If one contestant in your team
must be eliminated,

28
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,727
who do you think it should be?

29
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,912
To be honest, this guy is really slow
and lacks basic skills,

30
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,792
so all of us had a hard time.

31
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,539
But you're the one who came up
with the design.

32
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,127
In my opinion, we chose the wrong fabric

33
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,415
in the first place.

34
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,973
What? All of you said
I chose the right fabric at first.

35
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,718
No, I said we should use another fabric.

36
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,090
When did you say that?

37
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,350
You've been working together for days.

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,100
But...

39
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,807
none of you seems to think you're a team.

40
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,939
If you want many people
to wear your clothes,

41
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,702
you have to get used to teamwork.

42
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,485
You can't do everything by yourself.

43
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,830
Just like any other job.

44
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,629
What about the elimination?

45
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,255
All of you...

46
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,965
are eliminated.

47
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,071
Excuse me.

48
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,509
Ms. Cha.

49
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,232
I really want to do <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
with him.

50
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,241
Do your parents know
about your gender identity?

51
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,451
Maybe they know.
Or maybe they don't know yet.

52
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,579
So do they know? Or they don't?

53
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,751
I think even if they knew,
they'd just pretend not to know.

54
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,002
I see.

55
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,585
If you're on TV, memes of you
will be spread all over the Internet.

56
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,092
Ms. Cha.

57
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,635
We can never predict how or why
people will criticize you.

58
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,023
Your family and friends
might end up getting hurt.

59
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,598
Do you want to do this
despite all of that?

60
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,444
Everyone

61
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,066
gets hurt as they live.

62
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,025
Ms. Cha, he already made up his mind
before coming here.

63
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,374
Producer Kim A-jin.

64
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,868
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,536
Wait outside.

66
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,584
Pardon?

67
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,576
But... Why?

68
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,802
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,414
All right.

70
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,450
I'm divorced.

71
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,286
I have a grown-up daughter,

72
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,125
but she loves her boyfriend more than me.

73
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,880
Actually, she loves her dog
more than me now.

74
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,264
Do I date guys? I'm not interested.

75
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,931
Because I know all guys are the same.

76
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,892
All I have now is work.

77
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,141
But it's not that fun anymore.

78
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,404
Try to comfort me.

79
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,070
If you can give me any solutions,
that's even better.

80
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,646
Give you solutions?

81
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Yes.

82
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,862
Say whatever you want to say.

83
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,511
If you can't even win my heart,
how will you win viewers' hearts?

84
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,186
RETURN, REVISION

85
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,784
Then why don't you...

86
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,162
just quit?

87
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,375
Being stuck in a job that's not fun
is the most boring thing in life.

88
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,878
Among the customers in my bistro,

89
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,969
there are people who say they want
to quit their jobs all the time.

90
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,845
Every morning when they wake up,

91
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,180
<i>they say they're irritated
because they have to go work.</i>

92
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>If that's how they feel,</i>

93
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,112
<i>I think they really
should quit their jobs.</i>

94
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,940
<i>Because they're just wasting their lives.</i>

95
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,323
<i>It's such a waste.</i>

96
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,245
But what's interesting...

97
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,878
is that some of those who say the same,

98
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,304
that their jobs are not fun,
are workaholics.

99
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,222
<i>Even when they go on holiday,
they take a laptop instead of a swimsuit.</i>

100
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,103
<i>And beautiful scenery
doesn't impress them anymore.</i>

101
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,186
<i>People like that return in the end</i>

102
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,436
to where they truly love.

103
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,241
So why don't you...

104
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,565
quit your job?

105
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,700
If you want to know
what's precious to you,

106
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,118
losing what you have is one way to do it.

107
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,114
We met earlier, right?

108
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,447
Is your shoulder all right?

109
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,711
Well, seeing that you're here,
you must be all right.

110
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,802
This is so flashy that I stick out, right?

111
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,306
Well, what happened is that--

112
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,680
There's a fine line

113
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,391
between fashion and costume.

114
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,070
It means if you go overboard,
you'll look ridiculous.

115
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,704
Excuse me?

116
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,870
Are you saying I look ridiculous now?

117
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,079
I'm surprised.

118
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,293
You did a good job
considering you only had a day.

119
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,956
Do what you wanted to do on the show.

120
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,764
Do you mean it?

121
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,720
Yes.

122
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,767
Thank you, ma'am.

123
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,855
I mean...

124
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,698
I know it isn't easy
to give me this chance.

125
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,951
I'll try my best to make a good show.

126
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,294
Okay.

127
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,325
Thank you.

128
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,495
Thank you.

129
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,337
Oh, right.

130
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,466
Thank you, Ms. Cha!

131
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,144
Isn't that what you were thinking?

132
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,848
-Sorry?
-You've been self-conscious since earlier.

133
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,191
As if the clothes you're wearing
don't suit you.

134
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,443
There's also a fine line
between fancy and too much.

135
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,487
Balance is important.

136
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,038
Mr. Kang. Shall we go?

137
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,710
Hello.

138
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,841
See you.

139
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,896
Why are you

140
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,985
looking at me like that?

141
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,073
Well...

142
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,703
How did you convince the director?

143
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,417
Are you saying I passed?

144
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,209
She told me to make a pilot.

145
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,127
-Really?
-Yes, it's all thanks to you!

146
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,467
Thank you so much.

147
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,637
-Producer Kim.
-Yes?

148
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,140
When will I... Well...

149
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,023
When will I get paid?

150
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,569
When will you get paid?

151
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,294
You did a good job, A-jin.

152
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,842
I can't believe it.

153
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,091
Seong-eun!

154
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,547
-Seong-eun!
-A-jin.

155
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,927
Seong-eun!

156
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,474
-Oh, my God.
-Seong-eun.

157
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,517
-Are you really debuting?
-Oh, my God.

158
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
-Really?
-This is great.

159
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,766
You're really something, A-jin.

160
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,355
I'm so happy for you.

161
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,940
By the way,
you and the chef knew each other?

162
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,856
It seemed that way.

163
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,072
You know my favorite bistro.
He's the chef there.

164
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,824
He's the chef?

165
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,947
-Yes.
-Then why didn't you cast him sooner?

166
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,575
Why did you go through all the trouble?

167
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,456
Because I didn't know he's gay.

168
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,669
How come?

169
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,378
How could a regular not notice it?

170
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,884
I know.

171
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,588
But then, if he didn't tell you,
there's no way you would've known.

172
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,805
Hey, why do you look so disappointed?

173
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,675
No, I'm not.

174
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,267
Don't tell me you told him you had
feelings for him, and he turned you down.

175
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,112
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

176
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,441
Seong-eun, that's not important right now.

177
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,236
We're already on a tight budget.
What do we do?

178
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,080
Just leave that problem
to tomorrow's Kim A-jin.

179
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,620
-Tomorrow's?
-Today is

180
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,002
your last day as an associate producer.

181
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,620
So we should have a drink tonight.
It'll be your treat, okay?

182
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,247
-To celebrate your debut.
-Okay.

183
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,924
A-jin, you finally made it.
Congratulations.

184
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,804
We should have a drink.

185
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,381
Where should we go? Let me see.

186
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,261
Oh, right.

187
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,226
The entire corridor's smelled
like fried food since earlier.

188
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,848
So let's drink <i>makgeolli</i> tonight.
Right, that sounds nice.

189
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,479
Okay.

190
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,110
-Let's go.
-Okay.

191
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,952
<i>So far, your styling hasn't been bad.</i>

192
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,318
<i>Sophisticated,
and appropriate accessories.</i>

193
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,077
<i>It's been well-balanced.</i>

194
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,869
-Dad.
-Yes?

195
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,043
-That guy's my favorite designer.
<i>-But I asked you to be bolder.</i>

196
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,616
Is that so?

197
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,633
Going on the stage wearing his clothes
is my dream.

198
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,419
Hi, Dad.

199
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,505
Hey.

200
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,092
How are you feeling?

201
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,852
I'm fine.

202
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,474
You didn't have to come.
What about the bistro?

203
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,345
In-deok's there.

204
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,984
<i>Then, Gwang-su, you're...</i>

205
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,400
-Did you eat?
-Hold on.

206
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,610
I have to watch this part.

207
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,610
<i>Because you're that kind of designer.</i>

208
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,779
Wait. He's that rude punk.

209
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,324
<i>-Do you have anything to say?</i>
-Hey.

210
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,366
Is he famous?

211
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,740
Yes.

212
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,737
How famous?

213
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,620
He's hosting such a big show by himself
at that age.

214
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,674
He's super popular right now.

215
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,748
<i>You may go back.</i>

216
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,717
Goodness.

217
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,725
You must be tired from taking care of Dad.

218
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,107
Jin-seong, will you fix me
a late-night snack?

219
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,278
At this hour? Are you hungry?

220
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,286
Yes, I'm starving.

221
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,156
You brat.

222
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,084
Okay. Let me get changed first.

223
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,376
Nice.

224
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,105
Seriously, that brat.

225
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,822
Hurry.

226
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,659
It looks really good.

227
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,829
Jin-seong, how do I look?

228
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,285
I bought this to wear to an audition.

229
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,630
To perform at nightclubs?

230
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,634
Well, what would I know?

231
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,434
You're right.
You don't know anything about fashion.

232
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,515
-Hey, Jin-u.
-Yes?

233
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,058
How...

234
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,395
How did you find out
that you're different?

235
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,565
Why? Are you going to nag me again?

236
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,399
I'm not going to nag. I'm just curious.

237
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,569
It was natural.

238
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,366
I just realized what I liked.

239
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,624
And it turned out to be different
than what other people like.

240
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,872
Then,

241
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,539
can you tell just by looking at someone?

242
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,916
Whether they're gay or not?

243
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,922
I can't if they're hiding it.

244
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,933
You remember our neighbor Tae-sik?

245
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,470
No one knew before he came out.

246
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,943
You can't make her stay
just because you like her.

247
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,571
If the contract is not extended,
she'll have to leave anyway.

248
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,231
To be blunt,

249
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,029
Park Sin-o, Kim Ae-jeong, Ko Seung-ju,

250
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,862
all of them failed
to extend their contracts.

251
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,657
Even her salary negotiation's not
going well. She has no reason to stay.

252
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,793
Who knows if <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
will become a big hit?

253
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,870
You never know.

254
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,620
That will never happen.

255
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,666
It will never become a big hit.
If it does...

256
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,504
Why don't you have an associate producer?

257
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,376
I'm thinking of going without one.

258
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,300
Why?

259
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,761
The only junior assistant producer
is No Jae-su.

260
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,722
I don't think I can work with him.

261
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,263
I'm sure he'll patronize me
since he's a regular employee.

262
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,268
And he'll only ruin the mood on the set.

263
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,520
If you want to work
only with people you like,

264
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,943
why don't you just make a club?

265
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,361
You think you can make
a good show by yourself?

266
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,030
Cooperation is a given.

267
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,239
But still. He doesn't want to work
with me. I can't just force him.

268
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,531
You must make him. That's one
of the qualities of a good producer.

269
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,750
It's like a jungle out here.

270
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,617
How many people do you think

271
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,125
will acknowledge and like you
before you become successful?

272
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,881
You think there'll be any?

273
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,680
What are you doing? Leave now.

274
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,201
Please

275
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,706
don't do this, Sang-yeong. Please?

276
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,205
A-jin's show is about a gay chef.

277
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,167
Yours is a lesbian?

278
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,839
Come on.

279
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,179
Ju-hui.

280
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,759
If her show becomes successful,

281
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,224
then a lot of similar shows will be made.
You know that.

282
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,475
<i>A Gay Chef's Sweet Munchies,</i>

283
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,520
and <i>A Lesbian Chef's Sweet Desserts.</i>

284
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,435
They sound really good.

285
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,898
So do you want to make
a rip-off of her show?

286
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,203
Please don't do this.

287
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,580
I'm turning red
because I'm so embarrassed!

288
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,203
Seriously.

289
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,793
Is it that bad?

290
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,081
Yes!

291
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,838
A rip-off or a third-rate show,
I'm fine with anything.

292
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,261
I just want...

293
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,171
to make a show.

294
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,389
My goodness.

295
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,064
Oh, God. My neck.

296
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,195
Get me the document.

297
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,359
Yes, sir.

298
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:38,657
UNSECURED LOAN
INSTANT CASH LOAN

299
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,973
I think the amount is wrong here.

300
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,467
You said it'd be four million won.

301
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,304
But the amount here...

302
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,927
That is correct.

303
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,723
The prepaid interest is deducted.
So that's the amount you really get.

304
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,561
The prepaid interest?

305
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,024
For God's sake...

306
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,719
Mr. Lee Sang-yeong,
can I have a word with you?

307
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,596
What's this?

308
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,404
Why am I included in your staff?

309
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,028
Let's do <i>Sweet Munchies</i> together.

310
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,118
I know why you don't want to do the show.

311
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,621
First, although you and I are
the same age,

312
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,754
you speak formally to me because
I joined this company a year earlier.

313
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,792
You must hate it.

314
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,008
Drop the honorifics from now on.
Let's just be friends.

315
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,549
But speak formally and respectfully
on the set.

316
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,350
Jeez.

317
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,428
Second,

318
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,098
you're a regular employee,
and I'm a contract worker.

319
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,436
You're right. As you said,
I don't know when I'll be fired.

320
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,730
But if you think about it,

321
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,984
the same goes for everyone else.

322
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,034
Jeez.

323
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,947
More importantly,
you know how it is in this field.

324
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,992
If you make a show successful,

325
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,785
your pay will be different.

326
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,079
I'll try my best
to make this a great show.

327
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,752
What about a third one?

328
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,337
Is there a third one?

329
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,052
You don't trust me, do you?

330
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,556
If you don't,

331
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,179
just think of this as gaining experience.

332
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,482
"If it were me, I would never have done it
the way A-jin did.

333
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,522
If it were me,
I would have done it this way."

334
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,275
It'll be like first-hand experience.
How does that sound?

335
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,739
You can never buy
that kind of experience with money.

336
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,696
What do you say?

337
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,630
You get drunk more easily in the daytime.

338
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,342
I don't like you drunk.

339
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,336
Eat some food, too.

340
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,305
Do you think I'm like a thief, too?

341
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,942
Why? Are you dating
some really young girl or something?

342
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,531
Sometimes I feel like I'm a salary thief.

343
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,108
Gosh, that's why I told you

344
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,237
just to do the management job.

345
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,003
What if I become the chief producer?

346
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,369
I'll work from nine to six, nitpicking
about my junior producers' subtitles.

347
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,038
And walking on eggshells around

348
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,836
the Standards and Practices
so I don't get fired?

349
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,130
-Right.
-Come on, where's the fun in that?

350
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,835
You know,

351
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,048
I want to work on the set.

352
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,283
Now, it's the director
of photography's turn.

353
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,116
What's this? Are you ordering me around
now that you're a main producer?

354
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,962
Of course not. Let me tell you this.

355
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,672
I'm going to work really, really hard.

356
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,921
You're meticulous, so you'll do well.

357
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,304
-Thank you.
-Sure.

358
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,626
Hey, Director Jang. You're here.

359
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,756
-Oh, the lighting director's here.
-Hello.

360
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,014
-Hello.
-Hi.

361
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,505
-Hey.
-Hey.

362
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,556
-Hello.
-Hello.

363
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,019
What is this?

364
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,679
Are you guys almost finished already?

365
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,387
-No.
-Of course not.

366
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,057
We're just getting started.

367
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,605
-Right?
-Yes.

368
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,479
-Let me pour you one, Producer Kim.
-Sure.

369
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,358
"Producer."
I'm still not used to hearing that.

370
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,744
All the directors here.

371
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,406
I'm really counting on you guys.

372
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:10,833
Sure.

373
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,451
Listen.

374
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,999
It's a great honor to work with all of you

375
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,632
for my debut work as a producer.

376
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,131
I look forward to working with you.

377
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,882
To Producer Kim's debut work!

378
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,915
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

379
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,378
Cheers!

380
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,733
Jin-seong.

381
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,068
Why are you up?

382
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,742
Well... It's nothing.

383
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,823
Go back to sleep.

384
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,916
Hey, cover yourself
with the comforter, will you?

385
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:25,904
TV SHOW APPEARANCE AGREEMENT

386
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,410
I shouldn't do this.

387
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,481
I'm finally home.

388
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,199
Hi, Nabi. Are you hungry?

389
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,832
Nabi.

390
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,617
Kitty.

391
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,713
Kitty.

392
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,502
Where are you?

393
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,208
Where are you, Kitty?

394
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,923
Don't hide, and come to me.

395
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,890
Where are you, Kitty?

396
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,851
Come out, Kitty.

397
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,982
Oh, Chef. Chef!

398
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,270
Chef!

399
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,479
You must've drunk a lot.

400
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,899
Yes. I had drinks with the directors.

401
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,032
I see.

402
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,282
Why are you out here?

403
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,656
Have you been waiting for me
by any chance?

404
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,826
Sorry?

405
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,746
Oh, no. It's not that.

406
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,875
But I have something to tell you.

407
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,505
Something to tell me?

408
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,261
Yes.

409
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,715
Is that so?
I have something to tell you, too.

410
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,144
Chef,

411
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,928
if it weren't for you,

412
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,148
I'd never have gotten the chance
to do this show.

413
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,016
You are...

414
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,899
my savior.

415
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,822
You're my savior. I'll work really hard.

416
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,988
I'm home.

417
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,575
I'm home.

418
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,043
-I'm all right.
-Okay. Be careful.

419
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,048
-I'm so drunk, aren't I?
-No.

420
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,510
I'm too drunk, so I'll go in.

421
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,722
Our chef lives upstairs.

422
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,722
Good night. Why don't you go up first?

423
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,764
No, no. You go in first.

424
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,057
-Should I?
-Yes.

425
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,181
You're really...

426
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,619
-Go in already.
-Okay.

427
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,588
Grandma, I've come up with the money.

428
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,473
This is a contract between CKTV and me.

429
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,840
-It's as good as money.
-This is not money.

430
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,353
Well...

431
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,143
A week...

432
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,561
If you give me a week,

433
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,693
I can give you the money.

434
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,211
I've been working really hard.

435
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:26,137
REMEMBER!
USE BELL PEPPERS INSTEAD OF TOMATOES...

436
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,345
SHRIMP CARPACCIO

438
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,185
NO THIN VEGETABLES

SALMON FLOWER SALAD

WEEKEND STUDY

441
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,670
If you give me a few more days,
I can send you the money.

442
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,924
Please.

443
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,929
You have exactly a week.

444
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,813
Thank you so much, Grandma.

445
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,271
Why do you keep calling me Grandma?

446
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,602
Are you my grandson or something?

447
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,937
Pardon?

448
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,522
I'm not a grandmother.

449
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,861
I don't have any grandchildren yet.

450
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,607
I see.

451
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,791
Ma'am, isn't this the top

452
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,830
that was worn on <i>Cooking Class</i>?

453
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,705
That's right. I put that there on purpose.

454
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,712
That one goes really well with kitchens.

455
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,088
I see.

456
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,636
But I don't think this one has anything
to do with kitchens.

457
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,475
You're wrong. That one goes well, too.

458
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,231
It hasn't been on TV much,

459
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,323
so it's all right.

460
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,195
Ma'am, I prepared this.

461
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,374
Could you take a look?

462
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,542
You're working hard.

463
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,461
Of course.

464
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,172
I've been thinking about it.

465
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,964
How about this vibe?

466
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,718
Right, that vibe.

467
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,429
The clothes on the hangers are that vibe.

468
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,055
I don't think they are.

469
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,184
Look, Producer Kim.

470
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,397
You're saying that
because you know nothing about styling.

471
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,241
Listen, I want the show to focus on
fashion as well as late-night snacks.

472
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,990
Fashion and cooking.
The more subjects, the better. Right?

473
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,776
Fashion and late-night snacks?

474
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,237
-So late-night snacking is fashion then?
-Yes.

475
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,578
But if you eat late at night,
you gain weight.

476
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
You get fat.

477
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,338
Ma'am, I'm serious.

478
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,095
I'm serious, too.

479
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,524
Producer Kim,
how long have you been working here?

480
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:17,063
You're still a newbie, so I can understand
you're focusing on packaging.

481
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,862
But if you have time for this,
you should think about the content more.

482
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,861
The clothes are good enough, okay?

483
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,611
"Packaging?"

484
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,790
Then does that mean
you're in the packaging industry?

485
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,746
What? What did you just say?

486
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,712
For the first time in his life...

487
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,580
our chef is coming out as gay.

488
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,209
It won't be enough if we dress him
in delicate, beautiful clothes.

489
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,381
But look at them.

490
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,593
I think I've seen better clothes
in a flea market.

491
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,763
A flea market... Hey, how dare you?

492
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,215
I'm not done yet.

493
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,812
I will not work with you.

494
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,691
What?

495
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,770
I'm not working with you.

496
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,975
-Hey... Hey!
-Wait.

497
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,159
You're daring, aren't you?

498
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,333
What do we do now?

499
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,164
Darn it.

500
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,630
Of course, I want to help you.

501
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,433
You've always been kind to me.

502
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,968
<i>PUBERTY IN MY FORTIES</i>

503
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,101
But if I join your show,

504
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,599
I'll get on her bad side.

505
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,310
I even got a text message from her

506
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,392
saying that we're boycotting you.

507
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,688
That's so childish.

508
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,404
Don't you think she's going too far?
That's so petty.

509
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:51,031
You probably won't find any stylist
in the company.

510
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,036
I should get going now.

511
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,750
What? Oh, I see.

512
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,371
-See you.
-See you.

513
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,538
Thank you.

514
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,135
Producer Kim.

515
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,506
Hey, Chef.

516
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,738
It's hard, isn't it?

517
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,708
Come on, you're lying.

518
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,211
I'm fine. Seriously.

519
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,091
It wouldn't be right if I said it's hard.

520
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,889
I'm finally doing
what I've been dying to do.

521
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,389
So what made you come
to the company today?

522
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,439
Well...

523
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,485
I was nearby...

524
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,824
so I dropped by.

525
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,120
Anyway, you said

526
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,203
I'll be paid after we shoot, right?

527
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,287
Yes, that's right.

528
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,669
When do we shoot?

529
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,053
About that...

530
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,166
We just need to get the clothes ready...

531
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,047
But I haven't found any stylists yet.

532
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,425
Once we solve that, we can set the date.

533
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,262
I'm sorry. Please wait a little longer.

534
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,848
I see.

535
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,896
Right, that rude punk.

536
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,018
Sorry?

537
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,523
You know

538
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,112
Kang Tae-wan, right?

539
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,401
How about Kang Tae-wan of <i>Changing You</i>?

540
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,199
Hold on.

541
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,803
May I ask

542
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,220
why a gay chef of all things?

543
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,049
Well...

544
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,295
Oh, right.

545
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,547
If you take a look at this--

546
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,888
I want to hear it from you,

547
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,143
and rightly so.

548
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,187
It's not like a five-star hotel chef
will cook on the show.

549
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,033
Why does the chef have to be gay?

550
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,359
Well...

551
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,413
Because I wanted the show
to be about people's stories.

552
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,742
I thought if a gay man is the host,

553
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,117
the stories won't be limited to men's,

554
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,084
or biased towards women's views.

555
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:14,342
That we'd be able to tell people's stories
from our host's unique gay perspective.

556
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,670
Have you ever thought

557
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,548
that the way you came up with the idea
was already biased?

558
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,887
I don't want

559
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,351
to put bias on my clothes.

560
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,600
Mr. Kang.

561
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,726
You know, this is a great opportunity
for you to capture the female market.

562
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,696
Every woman dreams of
having a gay friend, you know.

563
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,068
So if you use that--

564
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,695
You can't make friends with someone
just because you want to.

565
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,453
A friend is not something
you can buy, like a bag.

566
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,707
But...

567
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:09,427
God... I'm so stupid.
Why did I have to say that?

568
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,886
I'm such an idiot. Seriously...

569
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,099
What do I do?

570
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,527
I'm so sorry, Chef.

571
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,110
Gosh, what do I do?

572
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,164
I will...

573
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,623
I'll go talk to him then.

574
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,536
Sorry? You'll go talk to him?

575
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,138
You remember me, right?

576
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,478
Please be a stylist...

577
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,058
for <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

578
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,442
I already said no to Producer Kim A-jin
just a while ago.

579
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,702
You told me

580
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,582
that there's a fine line
between fashion and costume.

581
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,708
What are you trying to say?

582
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,251
I don't want to look ridiculous.

583
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,131
That day,

584
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,875
to be honest, what you said

585
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,889
offended me.

586
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,060
And then I realized...

587
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,101
that you were right.

588
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,863
So,

589
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,364
could you please...

590
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,070
help us just this once?

591
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,498
You're reckless.

592
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,379
If I wasn't,

593
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,745
I wouldn't have made it this far.

594
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,799
Does "made it this far" mean...

595
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,603
you coming out?

596
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,522
You don't want to look ridiculous.

597
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,939
But before that,

598
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,897
have you not thought
about how you'll become

599
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,322
an object of ridicule
if you come out on TV?

600
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:29,735
Why is that?

601
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,239
What's wrong with being gay?

602
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,157
To me, being gay is

603
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,535
not something to be ashamed of.

604
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,293
Of course,

605
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,010
if you have such prejudice,

606
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,715
it can't be helped.

607
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,466
No one,

608
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,308
for any reason,

609
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,061
should be ridiculed. That's what I think.

610
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,797
Well done.

611
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,302
I'm so proud of you.

612
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,054
The director the other day,
and now, Mr. Kang, too?

613
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,479
You're really my savior in this life.

614
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,854
-Producer Kim.
-Yes?

615
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,059
I have a favor to ask you.

616
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,477
Tell me whatever you want.
I'll do anything for you.

617
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,406
About my appearance fee...

618
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,567
Could I get paid for it in advance?

619
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,155
Well... That's beyond my power.

620
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:10,173
Even if they say no,
I'll make it happen at any cost.

621
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,087
I should do that much for you.

622
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,848
-Really?
-Really!

623
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,558
-You mean it?
-I mean it!

624
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,691
-Producer Kim.
-Yes?

625
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,770
I'm going to work really hard
on the show. Okay?

626
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,778
I like that.

627
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,569
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

628
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,816
-Let's go.
-Okay!

629
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,866
Mr. Kang, Chef,
I brought some snacks for you.

630
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,333
Wait. Should I go buy coffee, too?

631
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,633
Turn around, please.

632
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,023
This...

633
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,647
makes me pretty nervous.

634
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,856
You have a nice body.

635
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,247
Red looks better on you.

636
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,670
I'll just leave it to you.

637
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,133
The only thing I know
anything about is cooking.

638
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,512
Hold on.

639
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,218
You know how to laugh?

640
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,978
What's your shoe size?

641
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,275
It's 265mm.

642
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,065
I see. That's the perfect size.

643
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,242
Guys.

644
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,591
Hello.

645
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,759
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

646
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,970
Hui-jin, please do your best today.

647
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,728
Hello, sir.

648
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,154
Hi.

649
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,148
-Hello.
-Hi.

650
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:41,182
-Make sure to get them ready.
-Could you make it brighter?

651
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,694
Why does he look so nervous?

652
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,231
Yes, you're right.

653
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,484
What do we do?

654
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,065
I should go talk to him.

655
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,150
Wait a moment.

656
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,242
Chef.

657
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,816
Your lips are blue. Are you okay?

658
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,657
Chef, just do as the script says.

659
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,752
Sure. Don't worry.

660
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,168
Why don't you take a deep breath?

661
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,171
-Breathe in through your nose and...
-Sorry?

662
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,303
A deep breath.

663
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,547
Breathe in through your nose
and breathe out through your mouth.

664
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,719
That's good. Don't be nervous.
You're okay, right?

665
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,434
-You're okay, right?
-Sure, of course.

666
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,811
-We'll begin now, okay?
-Okay. I'm ready.

667
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,141
Good. You're okay now. We'll begin now.

668
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,137
We'll begin now.

669
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,398
-We'll begin.
-Okay.

670
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,729
-We'll begin.
-Okay.

671
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,147
We'll start the shooting.

672
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,069
Two.

673
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,697
One, two, three.

674
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:49,623
Cue!

675
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,711
Cue!

676
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,424
<i>Ta-da!</i>

677
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,174
<i>What's that?</i>

678
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,166
<i>To celebrate our seventh anniversary.</i>

679
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,216
<i>We've been going out for seven years
and we're the same age.</i>

680
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,510
<i>Just a month ago, he said he wanted
to marry me as soon as possible.</i>

681
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:14,475
<i>But it turned out that he'd been cheating
on me for two months,</i>

682
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,520
<i>and that the girl is
10 years younger than me.</i>

683
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,989
<i>Since then, I haven't been able
to eat</i> gopchang, <i>my favorite.</i>

684
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,448
<i>And I cry all the time.</i>

685
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,832
<i>I can't focus on anything.</i>

686
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,411
<i>What should I do to get over him?</i>

687
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,536
<i>A GAY CHEF'S SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

688
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,796
Will I...

689
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,683
be able to love someone again?

690
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,562
Why would you say such a thing?

691
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,780
I think you're the only one

692
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,399
who doesn't know how attractive you are.

693
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,875
No... Just a second. Please.

694
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,756
Chef. Just speak naturally.

695
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,514
Like you're having a casual conversation.

696
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,599
Okay?

697
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,272
-Naturally?
-Yes.

698
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,811
-Okay.
-Naturally.

699
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,984
Let's do it again.

700
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,574
Let's do that again.

701
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,609
-Okay.
-The second take.

702
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,692
The camera's rolling.

703
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,952
I think you're the only one

704
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,163
who doesn't know how attractive you are.

705
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,328
Okay. One more time.

706
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,422
Don't worry.

707
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,932
I think

708
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,682
you're the only one...

709
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,135
Again.

710
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,515
Again. From the top.

711
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,805
PARK JIN-SEONG:
WHY WOULD YOU SAY SUCH A THING?

712
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,980
Don't worry.

713
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,188
When we were born,

714
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,157
our other halves were born...

715
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,118
Again.

716
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,830
Don't worry.

717
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,370
Again.

718
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,753
Our other halves...

719
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,581
Again.

720
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,625
Were born...

721
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,841
Again.

722
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,420
Our other...

723
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,506
Again.

724
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,969
-How attractive...
-Again.

725
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,472
you are...

726
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,564
Again.

727
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,135
Producer Kim,
I have another show to shoot.

728
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,239
I'm sorry.

729
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,371
I've never done this before,
so I'm so nervous.

730
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,999
I'll...

731
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,835
try harder.

732
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,336
Chef.

733
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,087
Do you know

734
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,845
how I became a regular at your bistro?

735
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,140
Sorry?

736
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,477
"I've done enough.

737
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,475
I can't put up with this any longer.

738
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,983
I'm really going to quit."

739
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,686
That day,

740
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,324
I had a long day.

741
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,656
<i>I was going home
after getting yelled at all day</i>

742
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,456
<i>while working for 15 hours
without eating anything.</i>

743
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,835
<i>Then I saw one place that was still open.</i>

744
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,470
<i>"Are they really open at this hour?"</i>

745
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,353
<i>I was glad.</i>

746
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,345
<i>I went in and ordered soju.</i>

747
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,479
<i>Guess what I got for a snack?</i>

748
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,049
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

749
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:55,093
<i>I went to a bar at 2 a.m.
and the drinking snack I got</i>

750
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,804
<i>was like a proper meal.</i>

751
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,522
It seemed like you needed a meal
more than a drink.

752
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,126
<i>"God... I miss my mom so much.</i>

753
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,259
<i>I miss the hearty meals</i>

754
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,178
<i>that Mom cooks for me."</i>

755
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,897
<i>The food you cooked for me that day</i>

756
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,654
<i>felt like the meals
my mom used to cook for me.</i>

757
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,137
<i>I want to make a show
that feels like that.</i>

758
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,595
<i>A show that can comfort those</i>

759
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,146
<i>having hard times.</i>

760
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:37,281
<i>A show that feels like a hearty meal.</i>

761
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,508
Just be yourself.

762
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,129
Act like there are no cameras

763
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,717
and the guest is a customer
at your bistro.

764
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,270
You don't have to stick to the script.

765
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,547
Producer Kim?

766
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,467
What did you say to the chef
that's made him not come back?

767
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:44,891
Did he go home?

768
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,099
What if he just took off?

769
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,696
What's that?

770
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,281
Isn't it <i>gopchang</i>?

771
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:05,927
Hello, Ms. Cha.

772
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:55,927
Are you kidding me?

773
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,769
Just the sight of <i>gopchang</i> makes me sick.

774
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,274
Please get it out of my sight.

775
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,479
Let's just do a retake without the food.

776
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,793
It's just <i>gopchang.</i> If you can't eat it,

777
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,291
how will you get over him?

778
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,801
You said you wanted to get over him.

779
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,135
Try to remember

780
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,055
things you like,

781
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,360
not things he liked.

782
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,539
Long live <i>Sweet Munchies</i>! Cheers!

783
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:23,791
Come on, Chef.

784
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,173
<i>How about we become friends first?</i>

785
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,000
<i>Let's be good friends, Jin-seong.</i>

786
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,165
<i>Let's, A-jin.</i>

787
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,963
<i>What you said today
was so honest and heartfelt</i>

788
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,548
<i>that my clothes looked really special.</i>

789
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:34,682
You were really cool today.

790
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,139
<i>The bulletin board is on fire now.</i>

791
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,755
<i>And it had quite high ratings.</i>

792
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,005
Sweet Munchies <i>has been
officially scheduled.</i>

793
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,807
<i>Is this what you had in mind
from the beginning?</i>

794
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,228
You can't do this
because you're inexperienced.

795
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,230
Don't do this to me. Please.

796
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,232
<i>What does</i> Sweet Munchies <i>mean to you?</i>

797
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,775
<i>It means everything to me.</i>

798
