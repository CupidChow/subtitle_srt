1
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

2
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,152
Oh, Mr. Kang's here, too.

3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,493
Welcome.

4
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,605
Is it just you two today?

5
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,985
Mr. Nam is coming, too.

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,572
-Right. Oh, let's have a seat.
-Okay.

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,197
-I see.
-Hi, Mr. Kang.

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,419
-Do you want to eat something now?
-Gyu-jang will be here soon, so...

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,080
There he is.

10
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,111
Let me introduce my friend here.
This is...

11
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,066
You two already know each other, right?

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,078
Hey.

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,790
Hey, Mr. Nam.
Mr. Nam, let's have a word outside.

14
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,252
It's been a while, Jin-seong.

15
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,788
Has it been three years since we broke up?

16
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,395
"Chef Park Jin-seong is not gay.

17
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,861
He went out with my friend
for as long as a year.

18
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,617
I watched the two begin
and end their relationship myself.

19
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,662
I can't believe he likes men.

20
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,712
There is no way Jin-seong's gay."

21
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,631
This story is quite detailed, right?

22
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,967
I didn't even read all of it.

23
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,312
Gyu-jang, let's have a word outside.

24
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,058
-Come on, let's go outside.
-What are you doing?

25
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,931
Now that I know about this,
I can't just ignore it.

26
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,268
I would be neglecting my responsibility
as the main producer.

27
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,353
But...

28
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,114
You didn't have to bring Su-ae here.

29
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,448
Right. Well...

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,452
I just thought we should clear this up.

31
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,911
Mr. Park Jin-seong.

32
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,585
Why don't you explain to us

33
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,625
what this is all about?

34
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,138
Okay.

35
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,113
Su-ae here is my ex-girlfriend.

36
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,148
What's wrong with that?

37
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,112
Look.

38
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,288
-How can a gay man date a woman?
-When I met Su-ae,

39
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,657
I hadn't figured out
my sexual orientation yet.

40
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,002
It's not something...

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,758
you're necessarily aware of
as soon as you're born.

42
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,222
I was...

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,970
still so confused back then.

44
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,649
For as long as a year?

45
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,308
That's enough, Mr. Nam.

46
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,731
This is not what you said this would be.

47
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,027
-But--
-I think I should just leave now.

48
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,411
Sorry for putting you on the spot.

49
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,450
-I'm sorry about the situation, but--
-I'm going to go.

50
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,833
Hey, why you...

51
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,834
Mr. Nam.

52
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,302
What are you so eager to know
that you're willing to go this far?

53
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,882
Like I just said,

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,295
-Mr. Nam! A word.
-as the main producer of the show--

55
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,644
-Right, let's go outside and talk--
-No, I'd like to talk with him alone.

56
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,683
What are you...

57
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,270
You don't think you crossed a line?

58
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,025
Why would you bring up a woman
he broke up with three years ago?

59
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,608
Didn't you hear?

60
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,903
I did what I had to
as the producer of the show.

61
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,317
I can't understand why you're doing this.

62
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,446
What's the matter with you?

63
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,792
All right. Then let me be blunt.

64
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,423
Honestly, I'm really suspicious of you.

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,593
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Think about it.

66
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,504
You manage to cast a gay chef
in a single day

67
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,758
and the way you solve every single
little problem that comes your way...

68
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,721
All of it is too suspicious.

69
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,353
Are you saying

70
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,521
I had Jin-seong pretend to be gay?

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,026
I know

72
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,528
Mr. Nam is the main producer,

73
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,612
but he's been quite rude to you.

74
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,953
It's just because he feels
overly responsible for the show,

75
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,294
so please forgive him.

76
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,254
In any case,
this was my colleague's fault,

77
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,674
so let me apologize to you on his behalf.

78
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,585
It's not something
you should apologize for.

79
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,387
Shouldn't we go to them?

80
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,762
Well, maybe.

81
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,678
-I'll go talk to them.
-No, no.

82
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,437
I think I should. Stay here, okay?

83
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,145
You're a regular here
and you two are really close.

84
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,395
So I think it's quite plausible.

85
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,407
Mr. Nam. That's like fraud.

86
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,909
If I'd really done that,

87
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,870
then I wouldn't deserve
to be a producer on this show.

88
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,408
Is that what you really think? Seriously?

89
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,327
No, of course not.

90
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,085
He says rude things,
but he doesn't mean it.

91
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,009
Hey, Gyu-jang. That's enough.
You're going too far today.

92
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,679
No, I'm not. I'm only stating the facts.

93
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,969
-You...
-I did not do that.

94
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,393
None of that is true,

95
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,141
so stop bullying Jin-seong.

96
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,812
How would you feel

97
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,101
if you had to see your ex-girlfriend
in a situation like this?

98
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,436
When you made a really difficult decision

99
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,191
to come out on TV?

100
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,935
How could you put it that way?

101
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,195
They were in a relationship.

102
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,109
It's not like I made that up.

103
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,027
You saw how that woman reacted,

104
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,906
but you still don't realize
what you've done?

105
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,003
What I've done? What have I done?

106
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,829
Tell me. What have I done?

107
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,254
Hey!

108
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,882
You little brats.
Can't you see your boss is standing here?

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,300
I said that's enough.

110
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,125
That's enough for today.

111
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,681
Gyu-jang, you come with me.

112
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,679
And A-jin, you go in and resolve this.

113
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,260
Darn it.

114
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,019
What are you doing? Come with me.

115
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,286
Damn it.

116
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,266
They just left.

117
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,321
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,363
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

119
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,276
What's his problem with Jin-seong?

120
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,244
His problem is with me.

121
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,077
Because he thinks I outshone him
and he had to co-produce the show with me.

122
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,751
This happened because he hates me.

123
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,039
No, it's my fault.

124
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,925
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,722
A-jin.

126
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,015
You're not the one who should be sorry.

127
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,559
All right, guys.

128
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,065
Why don't the three of us have a drink?

129
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,859
I'm sorry,

130
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,407
but can you just leave me alone today?

131
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,701
I just...

132
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,870
I just want to be alone today.

133
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,109
You really had no ulterior motives
for doing what you did?

134
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,411
You really did that for
the sake of the show?

135
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,406
Then why else? Why else would I do that?

136
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,162
What other reason could I possibly have?

137
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,502
The way I saw it,
your intention was clearly

138
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,173
to find fault with him

139
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,001
and try to ruin everything.

140
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,206
That's what you think.

141
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,181
Then you should've discussed it
with A-jin first

142
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,679
or checked with Chef Park privately
whether the story was true or not,

143
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,892
not reveal it like that
in front of everyone.

144
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,313
What you chose to do today

145
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,234
is like execution by guillotine.

146
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,531
Something was off.
So what was I supposed to do?

147
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,327
They're hiding something.

148
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:27,314
Now that I'm drinking
with you alone like this, well, it's...

149
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,522
Do you feel awkward?

150
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,649
No.

151
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,992
Right? I mean, we ate <i>tteokbokki</i>
together once.

152
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,413
Exactly.

153
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,040
When I see <i>gopchang,</i>

154
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,713
it reminds me of Chef Park.

155
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,006
It was quite impactful, wasn't it?

156
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,891
Maybe we should've persuaded him
to have a drink with us.

157
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,095
Yes.

158
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,272
You're right.

159
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,636
I can't stop thinking about it.

160
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,691
Well... Is he...

161
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,776
Is Chef Park

162
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,659
seeing anyone?

163
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,619
Is he seeing anyone?

164
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:32,125
I saw a guy in your building
when I went to your place the other day.

165
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,088
He was

166
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,337
wearing Jin-seong's jacket
and going up the stairs.

167
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,564
So he is?

168
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,928
I think you're talking about his brother.

169
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,806
Jin-seong lives with his younger brother.

170
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,109
Yes, that was probably who you saw.
He's quite young, right?

171
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,985
He's quite a bit younger than Jin-seong.

172
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,450
I think he said he's 24.

173
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,080
I see that you know his brother well, too.

174
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,251
Yes. He sometimes came over to my place
with Jin-seong.

175
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,542
Even his brother comes over to your place.

176
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,509
You must be really close with Jin-seong.

177
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,467
But you've been to my place, too.

178
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,057
Right...

179
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,556
That's true.

180
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,698
Did I overreact today?

181
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,460
Then have you ever dated a girl?

182
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,536
Of course, I have.

183
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,092
You have?

184
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,224
Before I realized my orientation,

185
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,891
I tried to date a girl,

186
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,432
like everyone else.

187
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,519
It's been a while, Jin-seong.

188
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,860
Has it been three years since we broke up?

189
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,243
So he dated that woman...

190
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,381
I should just sleep.

191
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,309
Mr. Nam, about what happened...

192
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,608
I don't want to talk about it.

193
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,899
I think you should apologize
to Chef Park properly.

194
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,622
-What?
-Whatever the reason,

195
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,789
what you did to him last night
was very rude.

196
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,036
Didn't I tell you last night?

197
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,825
I did what I had to
as the show's producer.

198
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,418
If I were in the same situation again,
I'd do the same thing. Got that?

199
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,585
But still, how you did it was wrong.

200
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,434
You should've checked with him first.

201
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,270
Shut up. And get out of my way.

202
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,766
Move.

203
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,826
We met last night, right?

204
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,960
Yes.

205
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,429
Jin-seong's stepped out for a minute.

206
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,968
I see.

207
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,523
I was wondering,

208
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,063
how do you know him?

209
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,267
I should've introduced myself sooner.

210
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,106
I'm Kim A-jin, producer of <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

211
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,782
-<i>Sweet Munchies...</i>
-Yes.

212
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,083
My boss...

213
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,250
I mean, Mr. Nam made it quite
uncomfortable for you last night, right?

214
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,540
I'm sorry.

215
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,250
Well, you're not the one
who should apologize,

216
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,169
but yes, I was pretty flustered.

217
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,337
I came because he said
Jin-seong wanted to see me.

218
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,396
What are you doing here at this hour?

219
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,321
What? I just...

220
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,487
I came to eat, of course.
Since it's a bistro.

221
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,489
I see. Wait a minute.

222
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,406
Give me your hand.

223
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,911
Goodness.

224
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,303
It's not that serious.

225
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,643
You're making me feel bad.

226
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,600
Thank you.

227
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,267
Take this with you.

228
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,277
Make sure that doesn't get infected.

229
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,027
Ms. Kim, why don't you sit here?

230
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,075
Sure.

231
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,373
Excuse me.

232
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,589
Jin-seong, I want to eat
the pork cutlet you make.

233
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,425
What?

234
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,433
Please? I've been really craving it.

235
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,397
All right. I'll make it for you.

236
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,355
I'm excited.

237
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,414
What about you?

238
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,873
-Sorry?
-What do you want to have?

239
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,792
Well, I...

240
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,922
Have you tried Jin-seong's pork cutlet?

241
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,041
No, I haven't.

242
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,668
He's like the master of pork cutlet sauce.
It's amazing.

243
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,375
Then I'd like to have the pork cutlet too.

244
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,262
Okay.

245
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,394
Wait a little bit.

246
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,500
I guess you come here often.

247
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,876
Pardon? Oh, yes. I live nearby.

248
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,992
Enjoy.

249
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,618
Thank you.

250
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,023
It's really good.

251
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,111
Thanks.

252
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,080
It's good.

253
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,916
When we were going out,

254
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,097
I had no idea you were agonizing
over such a thing.

255
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,439
Su-ae.

256
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,187
I'm doing well.

257
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,317
So don't worry about me.

258
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,777
Okay.

259
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,084
You know, that guy Nam called me

260
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,504
and said you really wanted to see me.

261
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,292
He asked me to come meet you.

262
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,418
When I heard that, I realized

263
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,472
I really wanted to see you, too.

264
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,559
Eat up.

265
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,315
-I think it'll be fun.
-Right?

266
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,828
Mr. Lee, do you remember that old TV show
called <i>Here Lee Yeong-gyu Goes</i>?

267
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,249
Of course. This show is based on that.

268
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,749
You know, I decided
to become a writer for variety shows

269
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,631
after watching that.

270
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,788
-Really?
-Yes.

271
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,496
I like variety shows

272
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,585
that touch people's hearts like this.

273
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:07,343
That's why I absolutely loved
your <i>Little Umbrella Girl</i>.

274
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,545
You're right.

275
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,468
When the cold-hearted
umbrella girl started crying

276
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,426
-What's this?
-after listening to other's stories,

277
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,768
-everyone started to cry.
-Why is she smiling so prettily?

278
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,476
-Can I come here again?
-Sure.

279
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,648
I'll get going.

280
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,946
-Take care.
-You, too.

281
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,852
Did you come

282
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,018
to see me?

283
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,233
I might've gone a little overboard

284
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,322
when I didn't have to.

285
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,080
I thought you'd be really down.

286
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,623
I should just mind my own business.

287
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,329
You're leaving?

288
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,876
You're still worried, aren't you?

289
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,375
-About what?
-I saw your face earlier.

290
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,587
Other people would've thought
Su-ae was seriously hurt.

291
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,224
A-jin...

292
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,559
What's with her?

293
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,694
What... She didn't even finish her meal.

294
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,782
I remember there were different themes,

295
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,281
-right?
-You're right.

296
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,912
If we add stories
that will move people's hearts...

297
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,483
He's cool.

298
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,737
Oh, right. I need to stop by my office.
I'll be back in a minute.

299
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,899
-Sure.
-Okay.

300
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,376
-Hi.
-What?

301
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,916
Where did you come from?

302
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,174
Sang-yeong's so cool, isn't he?
I also think he's good-looking.

303
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,143
Yes, he's cool. He's tall and handsome.

304
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,640
And today I found he's good
at coming up ideas for a show

305
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,432
and quite straightforward.

306
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,846
-Really?
-Yes.

307
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,982
What's that look on your face, babe?

308
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,526
Are you jealous?

309
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,318
Jealous? Me, jealous?

310
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,780
I've never felt such an emotion
in my life.

311
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,617
-That's a relief, then.
-It is.

312
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,330
Mr. Lee's coming.

313
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,214
-Where are you going?
-We're going out to eat.

314
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,875
You have a nice dinner too, babe.

315
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,843
-Okay.
-Let's go.

316
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,471
-Sure.
-All right. Have a nice evening.

317
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,482
What should we have?

318
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,982
-<i>Jeon</i> platter!
-<i>Jeon</i> platter!

319
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,317
Great minds think alike.

320
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,242
-<i>Jeon</i> platter is the best.
-Exactly.

321
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,361
<i>Jeon</i> platter and <i>makgeolli,</i> please.

322
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,488
Sure.

323
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,494
Of course.

324
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,406
It's not like something creative
will pop up if you sit at your desk.

325
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,908
In order for us to reach
the boiling point,

326
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,958
we need a little bit of alcohol as well.

327
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,463
I knew it. You and I really think alike.

328
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,506
I'm starting to really look forward
to our new show!

329
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,261
Me, too!

330
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,140
This is great.

331
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,726
-Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.
-Sure.

332
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:25,983
Hello?

333
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,068
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

334
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,207
Oh, Jae-su. What are you doing here?

335
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,381
I was just passing by, and I saw you.

336
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,300
Are you alone?

337
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,970
No, I'm with Ms. Yoo. Have you eaten yet?

338
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,379
No.

339
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,427
Really? Why don't you join us then?

340
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,429
I was just passing by, but you're
asking me to join you.

341
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,677
So maybe I should.

342
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,558
Sure. Join us.

343
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,055
-Hey, Jae-su's here.
-I know.

344
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,018
I'm glad he came.

345
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,200
I actually need to leave and take care
of something, so I'm glad he's here.

346
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,568
What?

347
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,412
Where are you going?

348
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,790
Well, A-jin needs me urgently right now.

349
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,329
Is that so?

350
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,670
All right. You should go then.

351
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,843
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lee.

352
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,088
Mr. No, have fun with Mr. Lee, okay?

353
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,427
Could you pass me my bag?

354
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,521
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't worry. I hope everything goes well.

355
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,728
-Thanks.
-Good night.

356
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,151
Gosh, the mood was so great.

357
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,649
I guess it's your lucky day today.

358
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,229
Let's dig in. Enjoy.

359
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,858
Okay.

360
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,910
-Hey, Seong-eun.
-What happened?

361
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,457
Did something happen with Chef Park?

362
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,502
No, nothing happened.

363
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,174
But you only eat spicy octopus
when you're really upset.

364
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,804
You're right.

365
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,466
I really need this today.

366
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,385
Cheers!

367
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,646
Seong-eun.

368
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,278
Are you keeping any secrets from me?

369
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,685
What?

370
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,448
Close friends like us don't keep
any secrets from each other, right?

371
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,454
For me,

372
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,998
even though we met at work,

373
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,040
you're like a sister to me.

374
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:59,007
So I thought you and I wouldn't have
any secrets from each other, but--

375
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,418
A-jin.

376
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:05,354
I couldn't tell you sooner
because I had my reasons.

377
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,184
I...

378
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,807
don't even know...

379
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,812
what I'm feeling lately.

380
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,400
I don't know

381
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,074
why I had Jin-seong hide
in the bathroom that day.

382
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,116
I'm sure you wouldn't have found it weird
if you saw

383
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,541
Jin-seong and me hanging out alone
in my apartment.

384
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,174
You know, I barely slept last night.

385
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,810
After I saw Jin-seong's ex-girlfriend
like that,

386
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,311
I couldn't sleep.

387
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,636
"So that's the woman

388
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,733
he had a relationship with."

389
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,530
And she's so pretty, unlike me.

390
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,451
Come on. You're as pretty as her.

391
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,240
No, you're the prettiest.

392
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,970
Seong-eun.

393
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,300
Whenever I'm with Jin-seong,
I keep forgetting.

394
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,557
Forgetting what?

395
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,604
That he's gay.

396
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,149
A-JIN

397
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,362
<i>You weren't</i>

398
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,531
<i>upset earlier, were you?</i>

399
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,785
One more soju, please.

400
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,919
Sure.

401
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,633
Do you know what the most
dangerous pitfall for us humans is?

402
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,302
Illusion.

403
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,796
That's the scariest thing for us.

404
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,682
Whenever you're having a hard time,

405
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,805
Chef Park swoops in to come and help you.

406
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,482
That's why you're relying
so much on him now.

407
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,811
Whether it's regarding
your work or emotions.

408
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,613
What should I do then?

409
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,987
What do you mean?

410
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,485
You have to break yourself free
from the illusion, of course.

411
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,370
Just trust me.

412
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:51,335
POTATOES

413
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,031
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
take better care of you.</i>

414
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,528
<i>You're a model,</i>

415
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,784
<i>but I haven't been able to make you
a dressing room. I'm sorry.</i>

416
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,443
Dad sent this.

417
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,025
Jin-seong.

418
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,698
I'm hungry.

419
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,581
Okay, I got it.

420
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,712
It must've been quite heavy for you.

421
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,785
Potatoes...

422
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,586
What should I make with potatoes?

423
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,141
Let me peel the potatoes.

424
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,719
I'll help you since I'm so hungry
right now.

425
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,387
Sure. Whatever you say.

426
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,687
Here.

427
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,744
Jin-seong.

428
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,286
Doesn't this remind you of the old days?

429
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,253
You know,

430
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,669
just looking at this

431
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,549
reminds me of Mom.

432
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,277
Peel it properly, will you?

433
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,321
It's not that easy.

434
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,784
Come on. Do it like this.

435
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,874
-Be careful.
-Do it like this, vertically.

436
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,541
Okay.

437
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,535
It's hot.

438
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,746
All right. Come here and try it.

439
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,007
Okay.

440
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,139
It's hot. Use chopsticks.

441
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,890
Be careful. It's hot.

442
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,059
-Is it good?
-Is it good?

443
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,978
-It's so good.
-Is it so good?

444
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,225
-Son,
-Yes.

445
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,477
give your mom a bite.

446
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,195
-Eat as much as you want.
-Okay.

447
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,787
-You, too.
-Okay.

448
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,247
Jin-u.

449
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,921
I'm sorry I didn't...

450
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,682
tell you sooner.

451
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,680
I understand why you did it,

452
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,972
so I don't totally blame you.

453
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,926
You wouldn't have done it
if things weren't so bad.

454
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,645
Thank you for understanding.

455
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,242
Jin-seong,

456
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,318
I'm really starving right now.

457
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,487
Gosh... All right, I'll hurry up.

458
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,030
You're only tolerable
when you're cooking, you know.

459
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,991
You mean I look cool?

460
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,321
No, I said you're tolerable.

461
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,742
Thank you so much for that.

462
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,593
All right. It's ready now.

463
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,801
-It looks good, right?
-Yes.

464
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,224
All right.

465
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,506
Let's try this.

466
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,774
It's good.

467
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,219
Is this your brother?

468
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,641
Yes. This is my brother, Jin-u.

469
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,309
Hello.

470
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,351
Nice to meet you.

471
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,020
-Likewise.
-We've met before, right?

472
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,936
Have we?

473
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,651
Wait. You two have met before?

474
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,237
Hey. Stop holding his hand.

475
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,042
-Have you eaten yet?
-No, I'm going to.

476
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,749
All right. Have a seat.

477
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,171
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

478
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,100
For next season, how about
we go with the genderless look?

479
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,676
-The genderless look?
-Yes.

480
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,305
Chef Park's fashion on <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
is gaining a lot of attention lately.

481
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,154
And more importantly,
you're at the center of it all.

482
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,483
I think it's a good idea.

483
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,151
What do you think, Ms. Yoo?

484
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,276
KANG MIN-SU, KANG TAE-WAN.
BOTH ARE A GOOD MATCH FOR A-JIN!

485
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,697
Ms. Yoo?

486
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,535
Are you guys seeing anyone?

487
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,456
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

488
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,251
Are you seeing anyone?

489
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,551
-No.
-No.

490
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,388
Why don't we have a drink
together tonight?

491
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,850
-Do you have time?
-I actually have plans.

492
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,309
I think I can go.

493
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,231
That's good.

494
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,284
How have I never considered him?
He was right there this whole time.

495
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,532
Right.

496
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,203
Mr. Kang Min-su is quite a catch.

497
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:58,043
He's the ace of CKTV, easygoing,
good at his job, and he's single.

498
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,792
-Plus, he's quite handsome.
-Who's handsome?

499
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,835
You startled me.
Are you watching me all the time?

500
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,669
How do you pop up everywhere?

501
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,295
I asked you who is handsome?

502
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,847
Mr. Kang Min-su.

503
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,845
Goodness.

504
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,359
-Are you a femme fatale or something?
-What?

505
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,900
Or are you playing the field?

506
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,107
Are you crazy?

507
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,368
Why would I think of another guy
when I'm with you?

508
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,283
You got it wrong.

509
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,040
Don't you think
he's a good match for A-jin?

510
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,122
-Who is?
-Kang Min-su.

511
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,131
-You're right.
-Right?

512
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,392
Hey, you came.

513
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,386
Hello.

514
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,149
What's that?

515
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,243
This?

516
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,079
Jin-seong's going to wear it.

517
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,167
What do you think?

518
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,170
I think it could become his signature.

519
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,014
It's not that good.

520
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,721
-Wait a second.
-Sure.

521
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,447
You look good in everything.

522
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,405
-Excuse me for a second.
-Okay.

523
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,403
Yes.

524
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,525
At the bistro?

525
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,199
Can we just go somewhere else?

526
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,871
<i>That's where Mr. Kang Min-su said
he wanted to go.</i>

527
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,834
All right, then.
What time should I be there?

528
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,249
Okay.

529
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,684
Can you get the phone?

530
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,104
This is Entertainment Dept. 1, CKTV.

531
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,056
<i>This is Han Chang-min,
a journalist at</i> K Daily.

532
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,516
<i>I'm calling to request an interview
regarding</i> Sweet Munchies.

533
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,817
<i>Could I speak to the producer, Kim A-jin?</i>

534
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,861
Oh, an interview with Ms. Kim?

535
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,910
But she's not at her desk right now.

536
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,870
Yes.

537
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,410
If you leave a message,
I'll relay it to her.

538
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,790
Yes. So, 010...

539
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,209
It's Han Chang-min, right?

540
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,253
BROTHERS

541
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,010
I guess you and Kang Tae-wan
are really close.

542
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,428
We met yesterday for the first time,
so I know this wasn't for me.

543
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,474
I think it's all thanks to you.

544
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,104
-You're that happy?
-Yes.

545
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,555
I feel like I've already made it

546
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,227
now that I got to talk
with Kang Tae-wan alone

547
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,726
and visit his studio.

548
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,994
Oh, Mr. Kang. Welcome to the bistro.

549
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,617
Hello.

550
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,583
I've been looking forward
to eating here tonight.

551
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,329
Sure. Please sit wherever you'd like.

552
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,577
Okay.

553
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,567
-Hey.
-Hi.

554
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,819
-Hello.
-Hi.

555
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,702
-What about Ms. Yoo?
-I'm sure she'll be here soon.

556
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,623
Hello, Chef. Oh, you're here, too.

557
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,091
I'm sorry I'm late.

558
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,799
They requested script revisions again.

559
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,839
I'm so tired of it.

560
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,882
I've never requested one,
just so you know.

561
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,013
Mr. Kang, why don't we drink wine tonight?

562
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,137
-Wine?
-Yes.

563
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,683
I'm in the mood for wine tonight.

564
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,727
-What do you say?
-I say yes.

565
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,449
Oh, wait. I'm good.

566
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,077
I'm so sorry,

567
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,833
but actually, I have a manuscript
that needs urgent revision.

568
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,957
So I should go back to the office now.

569
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,085
-You're leaving?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

570
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,172
Mr. Kang, I'm so sorry.

571
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,837
No, don't be.

572
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,086
I don't mind drinking with A-jin alone.

573
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,388
-Right?
-Yes.

574
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,136
-Right?
-Sure.

575
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,809
Chef Park.

576
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,983
Please take good care of them.

577
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,444
You know, they're on a date tonight.

578
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,120
Guys, I'm going to get going now.

579
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,253
Have a good dinner.

580
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,119
-Seong-eun.
-I'll call you later.

581
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,707
-Good night.
-You, too.

582
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,011
Here's your food.

583
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,061
Hot oil fondue.

584
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,768
It looks good.

585
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,228
I'll explain how to eat this.

586
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,731
-Put this skewer--
-We know.

587
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,113
We can figure it out ourselves.

588
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,609
Put it like this...

589
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,204
And then...

590
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,297
How do you know so much
about wine and cooking?

591
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,759
I did a food show for a few years.

592
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,472
I feel like you'd be good at cooking, too.

593
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,976
I'm not bad,
but I wouldn't say I'm good at it.

594
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,232
Maybe I'll cook something for you someday.
What do you like?

595
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,440
Well, I eat everything.

596
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,531
So you eat everything...

597
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,402
Okay. Here, try it.

598
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,985
Thank you.

599
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,003
You know, this is the first time
we've ever had a drink together.

600
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,790
-Are you uncomfortable?
-No, I'm totally comfortable.

601
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,165
You've always been nice to me.

602
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,642
Thank you.

603
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,994
<i>What's Jin-seong like as a brother?</i>

604
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,543
The responsible type.

605
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,585
No matter how difficult things
might be for him, he'll never tell me.

606
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,632
He always tries to take care
of things himself.

607
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,795
And he's quite stubborn.

608
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,805
Sometimes I hate him for it.

609
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,598
He is stubborn.

610
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,435
Yes.

611
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,860
On top of that, he's kind of a dummy
who only knows about cooking.

612
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,605
Speaking of which,

613
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,198
could you stay by my brother's side?

614
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,160
No matter what happens.

615
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,496
What kind of thing would happen?

616
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,253
Sorry?

617
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,424
It's nothing. I just...

618
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,081
Jin-seong, I'm going to go now.

619
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,203
Jin-seong!

620
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,077
What?

621
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,844
-Get it together already.
-Just go.

622
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,295
-Good night.
-Good night.

623
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,008
-Was that his brother?
-Yes.

624
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,176
I see.

625
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,516
Are you going to eat it tomorrow?

626
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,529
-Sorry?
-You have something on your face.

627
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,605
Oh, my. Where?

628
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,159
Where?

629
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,453
-There.
-What?

630
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,954
Oh, my God!

631
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,657
Gosh, you're so clumsy.

632
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:33,591
You two came to visit my bistro,

633
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,723
I couldn't just do nothing.

634
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,641
So I prepared something special for you.

635
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,680
-Wait here a moment.
-Special?

636
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,273
-Yes, special.
-But I'm full.

637
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,728
Stir-fried octopus...

638
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,605
Wait. You've run out of wine.

639
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,192
-Hold on.
-Wait.

640
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,244
Could we have a bottle of the same wine?

641
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,905
That's too bad.

642
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,084
I've run out of wine.

643
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,615
But there's wine over there.

644
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,631
Those are for display purposes only.
You can't drink them.

645
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,750
-I see...
-Hold on.

646
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,585
-For display purposes only.
-Right.

647
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,596
So they're just for display.
I didn't know that either.

648
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,392
You should drink <i>somaek</i>
when you eat stir-fried octopus.

649
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,347
Let me make you one.

650
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,016
-Sure. You're okay with it?
-Yes. And you?

651
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,476
-Of course.
-Okay.

652
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,026
Hey, take it easy.

653
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,375
All right. It's all ready.

654
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,297
Okay. To <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

655
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,959
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

656
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,467
It's so foamy.

657
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,773
Oh, right. You should try this.

658
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,849
-Sure.
-Thanks for this.

659
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,399
The octopus is quite big.

660
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,504
It's good.

661
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,384
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes? What?

662
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,089
Can we have a word later?

663
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,010
-It's about work.
-I see.

664
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,433
-Let's talk about work later.
-Okay.

665
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,176
Gosh, it's getting quite late.
It's nearly closing time.

666
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,556
-Wait, Mr. Kang.
-Okay.

667
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,692
Why don't we call it a night then?

668
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,239
-Well, okay.
-Do you want your bill?

669
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,280
Yes. Let me get my card.

670
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,492
-Here's the receipt.
-Please throw it out.

671
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,497
Okay. Thank you for coming.

672
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,869
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

673
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,166
-Good night.
-I'll get going.

674
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,708
-Okay. See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

675
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,592
Good night. Get home safe.
It's pretty late.

676
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,000
Bye. Good night.

677
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,137
What about work?

678
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,638
Hey, A-jin.

679
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,730
-You have feelings for that guy?
-What?

680
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,889
You shouldn't make it so obvious.

681
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,058
Or he'll lose interest in you.

682
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,983
What are you talking about?
When did I do that?

683
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,186
Do you only like him
because he's nice to you?

684
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,986
Why did you giggle like that?

685
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,821
Don't you know
that makes you look like a fool?

686
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,870
-Are you done?
-I'm saying you should be careful.

687
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,501
-I said that for your sake.
-Park Jin-seong.

688
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,632
-What?
-Let's say what you're saying is true.

689
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,840
What's it to you?

690
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,087
Whether I smile at someone
or I like someone,

691
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,512
do I need your permission? Why?

692
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,677
No... What I meant is--

693
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,762
I'm leaving.

694
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,814
I can't stand it anymore.

695
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,885
Hey, A-jin. Wait.

696
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,159
This is not what I wanted. God...

697
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,503
I must've gone insane.

698
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,916
Now I'm seeing things.

699
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,575
Did you see that?

700
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,862
How could you just leave us like that?

701
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,781
-So?
-Seriously.

702
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,570
What already?

703
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,613
How was it last night?

704
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,359
I had fun.

705
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,068
-Really?
-Yes.

706
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:19,747
But what I mean by fun
is not what you think.

707
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,749
I literally had a fun time.

708
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,212
The wine was good and the food was good.

709
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,301
Seong-eun, I'm not attracted to Mr. Kang.

710
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,933
I've known him for years now.

711
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,546
You know, your colleague
can become your boyfriend,

712
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,597
and your boyfriend
can become your husband.

713
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,725
And this comes from personal experience?

714
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,401
You haven't dated a guy for years, either.

715
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,691
How many years has it been?

716
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,653
Why is he calling?

717
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,954
-Is it Kang Min-su?
-Hello?

718
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,320
-Is it Kang Min-su?
-Yes.

719
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,736
Yes.

720
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:58,655
Right now?

721
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,124
Now? Oh, my.

722
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,577
Drink <i>makgeolli</i>?

723
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,172
I see. Okay.

724
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,630
-Oh, my.
-No, it was Nam Gyu-jang.

725
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,552
Gyu-jang?

726
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,170
-He must be crazy. Drinking at this hour?
-What does he want?

727
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,798
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Okay.

728
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,524
-Let me pour you a drink.
-You don't have to.

729
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,309
You don't have to be so polite.

730
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,610
Is something the matter?

731
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,316
Oh... Well...

732
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:41,913
You know, you and I are
co-producing a show.

733
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,957
I should've done this sooner.

734
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,632
It's okay.

735
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,836
Well... About what happened
with Chef Park...

736
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,850
I'm sorry.

737
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,431
I'm sorry, A-jin.

738
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,440
Listen.

739
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,190
Let's try our best to make
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> a good show.

740
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,993
You can take care of internal matters.
I'll take care of external matters.

741
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:18,986
Since Chef Park and Ms. Yoo listen to you
more than me.

742
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,663
Okay.

743
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:31,037
I was wondering,
have you received any calls lately?

744
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,630
What kind of call?

745
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,513
Well, for example,
a request for an interview.

746
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,010
-No, I haven't.
-Really?

747
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:45,136
Then I guess they only called me.

748
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,404
Well, I don't think they need
both of us for the interview.

749
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,283
I'll just do it.

750
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,860
So don't worry about it, okay?

751
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,034
Okay.

752
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,702
-Let's drink. Cheers.
-Sure.

753
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,380
I'm telling you, our <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
is going to become an even bigger hit.

754
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,173
Let's dig in.

755
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,101
-A-jin.
-Park Jin-seong!

756
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,268
Hey, where did you drink so much?

757
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,402
Give me a drink.

758
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,980
Give me a drink!

759
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,816
No. You already had too much to drink.

760
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,279
Is that so?
Then I'll drink somewhere else.

761
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,166
Cheers. Come on, cheers.

762
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,654
I'm sorry.

763
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,775
I was out of line last night.

764
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,653
Like you said,

765
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,319
whether you like someone or not,
it's none of my business.

766
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,407
I don't know why I acted like that.

767
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,122
You hate me, don't you?

768
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,918
I told you, I'm sorry about last night.
And why would I hate you?

769
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,844
Because...

770
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,061
you don't like women.

771
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,567
So?

772
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,164
Does that mean I hate them?

773
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,618
You're wrong.

774
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:25,929
I like you.

775
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,193
Yes, you like me as a friend.

776
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,610
But these days, I...

777
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,452
My heart is so confused.

778
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,496
I feel like I'm

779
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,043
losing my mind because of you.

780
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,967
What did I do?

781
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,087
You?

782
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,850
You did nothing wrong.

783
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,097
I'm agonizing over this by myself.

784
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,814
I'm alone in my confusion,

785
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,780
and it's just me who's getting jealous.
That's the problem.

786
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,445
Are you jealous?

787
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,155
Yes, I'm jealous.

788
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,001
Before I realized it,

789
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,964
I was asking myself all these questions.

790
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,252
"What if...

791
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,760
he didn't like...

792
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,644
men?

793
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,060
If he didn't,

794
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:01,146
would he be attracted to me?

795
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,435
Maybe I wouldn't have to
be the only one...

796
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,569
who's so confused,
and alone with these feelings.

797
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,041
Maybe he'd be attracted--"

798
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,288
A-jin.

799
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:24,091
I know. I know I sound like an idiot.

800
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,012
But...

801
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,971
<i>I must've been so drunk.
I don't remember anything.</i>

802
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,305
I didn't do anything stupid, did I?

803
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,680
No, you didn't.

804
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,806
<i>Is it possible that Jin-seong's not gay?</i>

805
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:03,983
A-jin.

806
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,691
-Hi, Chef Park.
-Hi.

807
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,693
Am I asking you too much?

808
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:11,074
It's my life.
I want to meet someone I love.

809
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,492
So he's had a relationship
with a woman, right?

810
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,911
Well, yes.

811
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,659
<i>Mr. Nam, what are these articles?</i>

812
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,485
I'm being punished, with all this.

813
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,373
Did you really have to announce
that you're gay on television?

814
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,167
<i>If you don't want to eat it,
just get lost.</i>

815
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,880
<i>-Stop! Let go of me!
-Hey!</i>

816
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,709
-Let go of me!
-Hey!

817
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,007
