1
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,885
Who is it?

2
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,439
Mr. Kang?

3
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,196
Well...

4
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,157
What brought you here?

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,164
Well... I...

6
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,583
Why don't you come in first?

7
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,538
Okay.

8
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,000
Here are slippers.

9
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,177
Tae-wan.

10
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,608
Well...

11
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,453
What brought you here?

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,245
Well...

13
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,287
You seemed quite angry at the meeting,

14
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,544
so I went to your bistro,
but it was closed.

15
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,496
And he wouldn't answer his phone.

16
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,962
You called me?

17
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,508
Yes.

18
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,971
I was worried and wanted
to see how you were doing.

19
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,723
But you weren't home either.

20
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,310
And I know you live downstairs from him.

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,772
-I see.
-So...

22
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,062
You mean you came all the way to my home

23
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,149
because you were worried about me?

24
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,069
That's right.

25
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,816
That's one of the reasons.

26
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,407
I'm not interrupting

27
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,624
anything here, am I?

28
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,616
What?

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,417
No. You're not interrupting anything.

30
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,757
Actually, you're quite lucky.

31
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,719
We were about to make
kimchi <i>sujebi</i> just now.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
-I see.
-Right?

33
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,007
Yes, she's right.

34
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,727
Well, I'm not sure

35
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,564
if there's enough for three.

36
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,404
But let's eat together. Yes, we should.

37
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,355
All right. Let's do it.

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,359
Here.

39
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,662
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,374
-May I use the bathroom?
-It's over here.

41
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,164
-I see. Thank you.
-Sure.

42
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,082
You should've told him to just go home.

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,628
-Why did you let him in?
-And do what?

44
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,091
You should've just told him to go.

45
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,261
How could I do that?

46
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,847
Kang Tae-wan's here.

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,929
Kang Tae-wan's here.

48
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,489
God, how can a chef be so bad
at making <i>sujebi</i>?

49
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,913
Look how slow you are.

50
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,408
-Do it faster like me. See?
-Oh my god. That's not how you do it.

51
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,916
You're supposed to make it thin like this.

52
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,498
No, that's just wrong.

53
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,213
It should be thick so that it gets chewy.

54
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,803
-You're wrong.
-No, you are wrong.

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,338
You should make it thin like sashimi.
That tastes better.

56
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,423
No, you're wrong.

57
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,512
I can't say I cooked it by myself,
but please enjoy.

58
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,767
Okay. Thank you.

59
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,559
It looks so good.

60
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,438
This is what you put in, right?

61
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,654
No, you put that in.

62
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,193
It's as thick as some rice cake.

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,450
-It's delicious.
-Right?

64
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,280
-Yes.
-Of course, because I made it.

65
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,486
-It's good,
-So how could it not?

66
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,195
-isn't it?
-Yes.

67
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,963
Gosh, it's so good.

68
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,796
So, are you staying here

69
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,670
until the thief's caught?

70
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,262
No. Of course not.

71
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,515
I just came over
to make her this kimchi <i>sujebi.</i>

72
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,055
Right?

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,316
He's right. You know,

74
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,728
since he lives upstairs,

75
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,986
I told him to come to cook for me.

76
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,743
He's like a private chef.

77
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,949
Could you come to my place to cook for me
one of these days?

78
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,164
-That sounds good.
-What?

79
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,790
Sure.

80
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,136
Hello.

81
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,182
Hi.

82
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,541
Aren't you going home?

83
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,414
Well... I will

84
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,038
when you leave.

85
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,286
Oh, you don't need to.

86
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,916
I'll go home after helping her clean up.

87
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,590
Then I should help you guys.

88
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,641
What? Right. I can do it by myself.

89
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,431
It's not much anyway.

90
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,555
You two just stay here, okay? I'll do it.

91
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,062
-Let's see.
-But...

92
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,563
I'll clean this up and wash the dishes.

93
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,438
I think

94
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,948
you should leave first,

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,740
so that she and I

96
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,624
can clean up and get some rest.

97
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,748
I told you, I'll go when you leave.

98
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,380
I mean, I live right upstairs.
It only takes me a minute to get home.

99
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,838
So you should go first.

100
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,382
Oh, right. I should...

101
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:06,553
Here's your jacket.
And where are your shoes?

102
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,844
Let me see you out.

103
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,315
-But... I see...
-It's quite late.

104
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,493
Good night.

105
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,326
Can you come to my shop tomorrow
to see if the clothes fit you?

106
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,663
Okay.

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,465
I'll get going.

108
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,341
Good night.

109
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,048
You, too.

110
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,348
-Make sure to lock the doors, okay?
-Sorry? Right. Okay, I will.

111
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,385
-Stay safe.
-I will. Good night.

112
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,278
I think I had too much to drink
that day. Gosh...

113
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,151
I really shouldn't have had
that last bottle.

114
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,872
Why did we have to
go for the second round? Right?

115
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,075
Are you saying you regret it?

116
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,251
It was a mistake.

117
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,502
A mistake?

118
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,795
There was definitely something
going on between us.

119
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,669
For me, when we went on that trip
to the beach,

120
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,087
and we woke up in the same bed--

121
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,676
My goodness. You sound like
something actually happened in that bed.

122
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,152
What are you going to do about this?

123
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,652
What do you mean?

124
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,527
I want to do something about this.

125
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,449
I mean, what's there to do anything about?

126
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,031
We didn't do anything...

127
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,902
A-jin, I'm back.

128
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
I bought stir-fry <i>sundae.</i>

129
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,476
Hey, you're here.

130
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,239
-Tae-wan?
-Hi.

131
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,199
What are you doing...

132
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,701
here?

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,330
Where's A-jin?

134
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,537
I'm here!

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,040
All right.

136
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,090
Hey. We're making zucchini <i>sujebi.</i>
Do you want to eat with us?

137
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,263
Sure.

138
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,217
Come on. Look how slow you are.
That's not how you do it.

139
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,267
No, I think you're slower.

140
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,771
-What?
-See? I'm quite quick.

141
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,229
-Hey. Hey!
-Put this in, too?

142
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,225
Are you...

143
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,858
on a first-name basis now?

144
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Jin-seong,

145
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,860
do you remember

146
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,025
that I told you I'd stop ignoring
what I like?

147
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,406
What is it that you like?

148
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,381
A-jin.

149
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,587
You're so sweet.

150
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,425
What's this? Was it a dream?

151
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,271
Why did I dream that?

152
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,170
Yes. Okay, Mr. Kang.
I'll call you later, then.

153
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,921
-Okay.
-What's wrong with you?

154
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,006
How could you be so rude?

155
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,090
What? What did I do?

156
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,426
I mean...

157
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,851
What's it to you if my makeup looks cakey?

158
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,813
And what kind of man is so weak?

159
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,352
Weak? I'm weak?

160
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,693
That's ridiculous. It really is.

161
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,726
Whatever.

162
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,493
What? Did something happen?

163
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,740
I mean,

164
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,820
he said my makeup looked cakey.

165
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,741
It does look cakey.

166
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,077
Did you not sleep well?

167
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,212
What?

168
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,788
You know how he is.

169
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,964
Why are you being so sensitive today?

170
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,173
Just let it go.

171
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,302
Okay.

172
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,258
What did she mean?

173
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,223
Do I really look cakey?

174
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,643
Darn it. This looks bad.

175
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,713
Good morning, Mr. Nam.

176
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,217
Well... About yesterday...

177
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,761
I really shouldn't have taken the call
during the meeting.

178
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,425
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,484
Things happen. It's okay.

180
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,939
Pardon?

181
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,153
I guess you and Chef Park
are really close.

182
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,696
When did you learn he's gay?

183
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,368
Wait. Was <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
inspired by Chef Park?

184
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,751
No, it wasn't.

185
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,709
I found out he's gay when
I was looking for a chef.

186
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,922
Then you didn't know before then?

187
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,549
No.

188
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,800
But how couldn't you tell?

189
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,053
You were a regular at his bistro
and close to him.

190
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,055
Is it even possible to hide it?

191
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,022
Then you had no idea before then?

192
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,403
Yes.

193
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,690
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

194
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,654
I think I just pooped.

195
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,572
-In your pants?
-Really?

196
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,615
I think I did a big one this time.

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,830
-Then go to the bathroom now.
-Oh my God.

198
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,082
Guys, you have some time now, right?

199
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,424
Please help me.

200
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,958
What do you mean help?

201
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,212
Guys...

202
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,917
I told you if you keep farting,

203
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,594
you'll end up pooping on yourself.

204
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,222
Right? I was right.

205
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,639
Everyone, to the meeting room.

206
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,848
-Okay? Oh, this is...
-Oh, no.

207
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,389
-Good morning.
-Oh, hey.

208
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,102
The ace of CKTV. You come with me, too.

209
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,602
Share some good energy from <i>Changing You.</i>

210
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,354
Okay. Everyone,
let's go to the meeting room.

211
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,266
What should we do?

212
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,064
What's all the fuss about?

213
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,018
He said he pooped his pants.

214
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,317
-Well...
-What do we do?

215
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,110
Did he really? He can't be serious.

216
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,699
All right. Let's begin.

217
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,409
What is this?

218
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,368
Why am I in there?

219
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,787
You didn't know, did you?

220
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,376
<i>What was that?</i>

221
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,135
<i>I don't know about anything else, but
we shouldn't fart in front of each other.</i>

222
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,966
What? Then you do other things
in front of each other?

223
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,177
Sorry? What do you mean?

224
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,437
What other things would Ms. Yoo and I do
in front of each other?

225
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,361
Do you two speak casually to each other?

226
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,779
-Well, we can do that.
-Right?

227
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,938
<i>It's all right.</i>

228
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,489
<i>It's not all right for me.</i>

229
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,699
<i>I really didn't see that coming, though.</i>

230
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,203
<i>Oh, God. It smells really bad.</i>

231
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,076
What? I remember that. Oh, my gosh.

232
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,723
<i>So you didn't fart then?</i>

233
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,470
No, I didn't.

234
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,234
God, this punk even has manners.

235
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,809
Let's stop here.

236
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,814
-Who does hidden camera pranks
-Just wait.

237
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,106
-these days?
-The highlight's left.

238
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,229
-Just wait.
-This is a breach of privacy.

239
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,026
Look! It's you.

240
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,161
<i>Ms. Cha.</i>

241
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,407
<i>I'll just pretend I farted.</i>

242
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,537
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

243
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,383
-It's only natural.
<i>-What?</i>

244
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,879
Are you accusing me
when you're the one who farted?

245
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,340
<i>-Well...
-God, did you eat eggs or something?</i>

246
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,384
<i>My goodness.</i>

247
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,217
No, I didn't. I didn't fart.

248
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,683
I know, but you pretended you did
to suck up to her.

249
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,265
All right. This is a proposal
for a retro show. What do you think?

250
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,561
It's still just a rough draft, though.

251
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,566
"Good variety shows always come back."

252
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,029
I have a good feeling about this.

253
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,109
It was really popular in the past, right?

254
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,026
Yes. Right?

255
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,573
If you add
some more interesting characters,

256
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,241
people might like it.

257
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,986
Hidden cameras are always fun.

258
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,698
-You think so?
-Yes.

259
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,658
Gyu-jang, what do you think?

260
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,918
Do I have to say it? Of course, it sucks.

261
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,750
If you don't do it right,
it'll be really tacky.

262
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,009
Let's just go.

263
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,756
Gosh. I think he reacts that way
when he thinks something's good.

264
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,352
-Don't you think it'll be fun?
-I think it's fun.

265
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,468
-Right?
-Yes.

266
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,854
Why don't we watch Gyu-jang's clip again?
It's the best.

267
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,642
I just know he'll be a big hit.

268
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,806
He's so good at sucking up.

269
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,592
Hey.

270
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,915
Hey, the coffee smells great.

271
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,724
Did you sleep well last night?

272
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,852
Yes.

273
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,361
But

274
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,991
where are the clothes?

275
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,911
Just a moment.

276
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,749
When you

277
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,971
came back to my bistro the other day,

278
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,390
what did you

279
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,218
want to tell me?

280
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,274
Oh...

281
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,399
That day?

282
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,445
You said you were going to stop

283
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,406
ignoring what you really like.

284
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,790
What is it that you like?

285
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,878
What I like is...

286
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,064
what I'm doing right now.

287
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,494
You know I'm a workaholic.

288
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,489
Working is what I like the most.

289
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,664
I see.

290
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,703
Do you

291
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,615
want me to set you up with a girl?

292
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,995
She's a regular at my bistro
and she's really nice.

293
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,507
You said you wanted someone
who would understand you for who you are.

294
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,720
I think she will.

295
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,684
Why are you looking at me like that?

296
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,186
You don't trust my taste, do you?

297
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,399
What's gotten into you?

298
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,701
What do you mean?

299
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,660
I know a male model

300
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,502
who you might like.

301
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,002
What do you think?
You want me to set you guys up?

302
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,673
Don't.

303
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,258
It's making me

304
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,880
uncomfortable.

305
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,349
Well... I...

306
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,556
I asked that...

307
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,229
because you looked so lonely.

308
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,232
By any chance,

309
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,412
do you think...

310
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,373
I have a different
sexual orientation like you?

311
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,409
What?

312
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,537
You don't, right?

313
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,130
Of course not.

314
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,801
Okay, then.

315
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,296
Stop taking an interest in my love life.

316
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,889
And try this on.

317
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,517
Okay.

318
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,269
Sure.

319
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,328
Am I reading into this too much?

320
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,836
Then why don't you and I go?

321
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,089
-Let's go.
-Okay.

322
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,047
Or...

323
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,638
am I really clueless?

324
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,889
Mr. Kang?

325
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,609
What brought you here?

326
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,605
Well... I...

327
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,372
Does he...

328
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,411
really have feelings for A-jin?

329
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,686
Do you want me to put this away?

330
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,166
That hurt earlier, didn't it?

331
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,841
I'm sorry.

332
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,835
Can't we just tell them we're going out?

333
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,763
Does it have to be a secret?

334
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,179
I want...

335
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,020
to look professional.

336
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,602
If my scripts become a little less fun,

337
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,154
they'll say it's because
I'm dating my colleague.

338
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,768
If the stories I bring
are a little less fun,

339
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,895
they'll say it's because I'm dating again.

340
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,442
No. I don't want to hear
something like that.

341
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:54,123
But still...
I don't want to keep it from A-jin.

342
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,659
So when the show becomes stable,
let's let people know.

343
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,210
I just hate having to be careful
all the time.

344
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,214
Right. It's quite hard,

345
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,339
isn't it?

346
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,638
What was that?

347
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,385
-What's this?
-What?

348
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,851
-What are you doing there?
-What?

349
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,392
What? You guys... My goodness.

350
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,597
Well...

351
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,440
You guys...

352
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,985
-I caught you, you two.
-No, that's not it.

353
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,861
You were fighting again, weren't you?

354
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:37,793
Your team really should learn
how to get along with each other.

355
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,909
Right...

356
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,575
We weren't fighting.

357
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,254
Then what?

358
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,672
You two were all lovey-dovey or something?

359
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,218
-Ms. Yoo,
-Yes?

360
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,798
-I've been looking all over for you.
-Why?

361
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,014
Why would you look for her?

362
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,599
I'm planning to produce
a TV show and need you

363
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,941
to write the script for me.
Let's work together.

364
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,944
What kind of TV show?

365
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,441
-What is it?
-Well... It's confidential for now.

366
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,111
Let's go.

367
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,572
What is it?

368
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,624
She's so ambitious.

369
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,077
I like that.

370
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,220
<i>It's the premiere.</i>

371
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,099
<i>How about we stay in and have a drink?</i>

372
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,182
<i>Sounds great! I'll cook tonight.</i>

373
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,805
<i>Okay! I'll look forward to it.</i>

374
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,028
Let me get you some water.

375
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,116
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

376
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,989
<i>Do you want to know where I am?</i>

377
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,036
I sneaked into CKTV
and came up to the rooftop.

378
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,961
What am I doing here?

379
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,420
I'm going to watch
the hotly anticipated <i>Sweet Munchies</i>

380
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,211
with you guys up here.

381
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,381
I already see comments about
how handsome the chef is.

382
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,137
I know he's handsome,
but I'm better looking, right?

383
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,639
LET'S WATCH <i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i> TOGETHER
LIVE STREAMING!

384
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,063
I see you guys are super excited.

385
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,638
You're going to kill me?

386
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,249
One more soju, please.

387
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,501
Sure.

388
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,710
One more beer, please.

389
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,601
You all did such a good job.

390
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,936
I think it'll get high ratings.

391
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,822
We can't be sure
until the result comes out.

392
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,649
But it wasn't bad.

393
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,574
So, what now? Should we

394
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,862
-go for a drink?
-I can't. I should go now.

395
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,368
What? Why?

396
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,239
Well... I'm a little too tired.

397
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,673
Jeez. I don't have time for that either.

398
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,458
Good work, guys.

399
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,502
Good night.

400
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,794
-Good night.
-Good night.

401
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,835
Who said
we wanted to have a drink with him?

402
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,764
Now that he's left, how about a drink?

403
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,597
Seong-eun,
I meant it when I said I was tired.

404
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,850
-What?
-Good work.

405
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,971
I'll get going.

406
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,807
-I'll leave it to you.
-Really?

407
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,602
-Good night.
-Are you really leaving?

408
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,656
I'm so tired, too.

409
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,200
Yes. I'm really tired, too.

410
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,497
What?

411
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,925
Oh my God. This is crazy.

412
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,413
Wait. What am I doing?

413
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,624
Oh, my goodness.

414
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,037
What's the point in looking pretty
for Jin-seong?

415
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,636
Still.

416
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,741
Hi.

417
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,817
I'm here.

418
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,783
Hi.

419
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,290
That's awesome.

420
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,753
Did you make it?

421
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,043
-Yes.
-I'm impressed.

422
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,171
Did you know

423
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,092
salmon is good for getting rid
of dark circles?

424
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,335
What? I don't have any dark circles.

425
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,716
-Go have a seat.
-Okay.

426
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,596
Wait. Get some beer
from the fridge for me.

427
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,683
Okay.

428
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,906
Excuse me.

429
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,540
Hello. I'm Nam Gyu-jang,
a producer at CKTV.

430
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,199
You're her, right?

431
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,760
So what's gotten into you, anyway?

432
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,590
Why did you want to cook today?

433
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,354
Because you said no one's
ever cooked for you.

434
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,890
Yes.

435
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,185
No one, let alone a woman,

436
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,685
has ever cooked for me.

437
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,647
Try it now.

438
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,735
Okay.

439
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,744
Thank you for cooking.

440
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,200
You did a really great job.

441
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,833
-It's good.
-Really?

442
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,378
Yes.

443
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,341
Really?

444
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,378
This sauce is so good.

445
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,804
I made all of it.

446
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,807
I didn't know it'd be this delicious

447
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,274
when someone cooked the food for me.

448
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,938
Anyway,

449
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,487
it seems you've cooked for someone else
from time to time.

450
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:11,855
To tell you the truth,

451
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,540
this is the first time
I've ever cooked for someone

452
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,909
in my own kitchen.

453
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,670
Will you cook for me

454
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,922
from time to time?

455
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,171
We'll see.

456
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,705
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

457
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,257
Who could that be?

458
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,600
Kang Tae-wan.

459
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,140
No way.

460
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,523
At this hour?

461
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,437
Who is it?

462
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,310
It's me. Open the door.

463
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,280
It's Seong-eun.

464
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,029
-Ms. Yoo?
-Yes, Ms. Yoo.

465
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,741
Then tell her to come in.

466
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,531
Darn it. What do I do?

467
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,989
-Hide somewhere.
-Why?

468
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,536
-Hurry up!
-Why?

469
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,409
-Don't ask, and just hide.
-What? Where?

470
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,997
-Hide in the bathroom.
-What?

471
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,042
-Hurry! Just go in there now!
-Wait, how can I hide here?

472
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,047
Wait. What do I do?

473
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,459
Right. Your shoes.

474
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,377
-Here. Hide now!
-Wait.

475
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,007
Don't come out. If you do, I'm dead meat!

476
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,309
What now?

477
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,768
Right, his beer.

478
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,940
God, why did she have to come here now?

479
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,943
Did I do something wrong?

480
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,692
Why do I have to hide in here?

481
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,115
Seong-eun.

482
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,002
Hey, were you hiding some guy in there?

483
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,210
What took you so long to open the door?

484
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,830
What brought you here without calling?

485
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,418
What? Do I need a reason to come see you?

486
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,932
I bought some of that soju
that you love so much!

487
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,143
-But...
-I thought about it

488
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,812
and we can't just do nothing
on the day of the premiere.

489
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,271
We should have a drink to celebrate.

490
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,108
-But...
-I'm going to chat with you all night long

491
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,940
and spend the night here.
Sounds great, right?

492
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,323
Then do I have to stay here all night?

493
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,161
Darn it. Should I go out now?

494
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,658
But that'd be so weird.

495
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,996
This is crazy.

496
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,214
What? Oh, right.

497
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,089
I made this.

498
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,998
All right, okay.

499
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,010
I didn't know salmon salad
would go this well with soju.

500
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:43,515
You said you were so tired, but you
were celebrating at home by yourself.

501
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,139
What? Well...

502
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,016
If you want to celebrate,
you should do it properly.

503
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,353
How about we invite Chef Park, too?

504
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,437
Let's call and tell him to come
after getting off work.

505
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,693
What? No, no. Don't do it.

506
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,486
He must be so busy.
Let's just drink together.

507
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,661
You think so?

508
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,317
All right, then.

509
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,157
-This is really good.
-Yes.

510
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,745
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

511
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,627
What? No, no! You can't go there.

512
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,625
-Why?
-The toilet's clogged.

513
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,966
But...

514
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,682
you're constipated.

515
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,725
What? What are you talking about?
I'm not constipated at all.

516
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,441
You always say you can't do a number two.

517
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,070
Wait.

518
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,736
Did you put on make-up?

519
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,236
Oh, my. Did you put on the lipstick, too?

520
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,254
No, I didn't.

521
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,829
Who were you trying to look good for?

522
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,289
I said I didn't put on make-up.

523
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,875
Come on. Just drink.

524
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,212
Something's fishy here.

525
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,468
This is nice.

526
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,313
What's with you?

527
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,734
Who are you texting
that's making you smile like that?

528
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,114
Well...

529
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,862
A-jin.

530
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,744
What do you think about seeing a guy
who's younger than you?

531
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,332
What?

532
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,116
Well... If a guy is younger than me,

533
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,210
I don't think I'd hate it.

534
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,790
Then you're saying you like
younger guys, right?

535
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,455
Kang Tae-wan's younger than her. Damn it.

536
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,466
Well, I don't care if he's younger
or older than me.

537
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,340
As long as it feels right.

538
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,717
Right? It has to feel right.

539
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,805
That's important, right?

540
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,852
I don't know why,
but something just felt right.

541
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,858
What? What do you mean? When?

542
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,861
You know...

543
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,936
What are they saying?

544
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,163
-What's that sound?
-What?

545
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,456
Is someone here?

546
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,054
A phone rang in there just now.
Didn't you hear it?

547
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,720
No, I didn't hear anything.

548
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,176
Just now...

549
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,269
Oh my God. What do we do?

550
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,773
A-jin.

551
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,146
-I think the thief's in there.
-No way.

552
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,403
Someone's in there.

553
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,025
-No, that's not it.
-Keep it down.

554
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,703
-What's the matter with you?
-I think that thief came back.

555
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,283
Seong-eun.

556
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,117
Keep it down. Just stay behind me, okay?

557
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,667
Seong-eun, no one's in there.
It's nothing.

558
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,579
Come on. It's nothing.

559
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,510
Don't worry. Just leave it to me.

560
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,589
I'll take care of it.

561
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,054
Seong-eun, no one's in there.

562
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,804
Seong-eun!

563
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,346
Stop, Seong-eun.

564
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,479
What?

565
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,439
What are you doing here?

566
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,909
The thief!

567
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,986
-The thief's been caught.
-What?

568
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,330
Really?

569
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,870
-Let's go see him. Now.
-What?

570
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,498
Let's hurry.

571
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,165
Why were you hiding?

572
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,051
What? I wasn't hiding.
I was unclogging the toilet.

573
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,839
What? But aren't you supposed
to be working?

574
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,224
But we need to go to the police station
right now.

575
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,971
-Seong-eun, see you tomorrow, okay?
-What?

576
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,514
-Let's hurry.
-Okay.

577
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,734
Why did you come out?

578
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,849
What then? Should I have ignored
the detective's call?

579
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,306
I don't know!
Anyway, she was wrong about that, okay?

580
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,897
-About what? Your constipation?
-Hey! I'm not constipated.

581
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,279
SEOUL JUNGANG POLICE STATION

582
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,208
All you need to do is to see
if the thief is someone you know.

583
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,289
Okay.

584
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,697
How in the world did he know
that I live alone?

585
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,044
If you check a place's deliveries
or their mailbox,

586
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,921
you can get a good idea
how many people live there.

587
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:46,552
Then should I change my name
to a guy's name?

588
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,473
Use my name when you order
something online from now on.

589
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,925
Can I really do that?

590
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,015
Sure.

591
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,654
Jin-seong,

592
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,978
I never noticed what
broad shoulders you have.

593
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,284
Where's my team outfit?

594
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,866
What? Oh, it's in the washing machine.

595
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,913
Okay.

596
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,383
Am I forgetting anything?

597
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,938
I think I got everything.

598
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,438
If I forgot something,
I can just come down and get it.

599
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,161
Well, it's only a minute away after all.

600
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:00,083
Oh, I just realized I get to sleep
in my comfy bed now.

601
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,371
My back hurt so much.

602
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,584
I can't wait.

603
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,921
Sleep comfortably from now on.

604
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,455
Sleep tight.

605
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,353
Good night.

606
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,443
Good night. Call me if you need anything.

607
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,558
Okay.

608
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,557
I just spent a few days with him,
and I already miss him?

609
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,996
What? What's that?

610
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,920
What on earth is that?

611
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,169
Is that a poster?

612
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,461
Oh, that's great!

613
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,837
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

614
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:02,755
That's so cool.

615
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,233
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

616
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,983
-Congratulations!
-You got really high ratings!

617
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,654
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

618
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,033
Congratulations, A-jin!

619
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,649
I was really surprised.

620
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,946
Gosh, I knew it.

621
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,739
How are there so many stories?

622
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,781
-This many viewers sent in stories?
-This is a lot.

623
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,157
My goodness. It'll take a lot of time
just to check all of these.

624
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,454
This is really a lot.

625
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,327
But I love it.

626
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,001
Isn't it better than too few stories?

627
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,793
-You're right.
-Hello, ma'am.

628
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,167
All of you, get up.
Let's go have some Korean beef.

629
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,803
We're eating beef! Beef!

630
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,006
Oh, my.

631
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,054
We're eating beef!

632
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,160
I guess I really made it.
The director's treating me to beef.

633
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,196
You know, even when everyone
in my department had pork,

634
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,325
I wasn't invited.

635
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,751
-Really?
-Yes.

636
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,618
Hey, here.

637
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,206
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

638
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,131
Hello.

639
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,511
-What about Chef Park?
-He's coming.

640
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,009
-He'll be here soon.
-I see.

641
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,009
-Hey, Chef Park.
-Hi.

642
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,308
-Hi.
-Hi.

643
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,641
Hi, Chef Park.

644
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,150
Thank you.

645
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,873
Let me.

646
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,913
You did a great job.

647
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,659
-Jin-seong.
-Yes.

648
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,754
-When did you get here?
-Sorry?

649
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,884
Just now.

650
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,342
Yes, we just got here.

651
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,261
Right?

652
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,054
-Okay.
-All right. Now that everyone's here,

653
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:12,514
why don't you say something for us,
Ms. Cha? Please?

654
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,385
A round of applause, everyone.

655
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,653
First of all, you guys are doing
a better job than I expected so far.

656
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,355
Moving forward, if you guys manage

657
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,816
to get the highest ratings
in CKTV history,

658
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,581
I can do much more than beef.

659
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,248
Why don't you make a promise, then?

660
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,249
Okay, what percent?

661
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,081
Ten percent.

662
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,206
If you get ten percent,
I'll give you a bonus.

663
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,754
If you get 15 percent,

664
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,585
-you'll get an incentive trip.
-Really?

665
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,013
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

666
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,091
Oh, my gosh.

667
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,636
-Let's do this.
-Oh, right.

668
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,889
Mr. Park Jin-seong,
why don't you say something, too?

669
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,061
If it weren't for him, <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
would never have been this successful.

670
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,028
Well...

671
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,411
As I watched

672
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,832
all of you trying your best
to make this a good show,

673
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,342
I started to think
that I should try my best, too,

674
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,298
so that the show doesn't go wrong.
I sincerely hope...

675
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,844
we can keep up the good work
until the very end.

676
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,059
Because, to me,
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> as well as...

677
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,937
all of you here

678
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,771
mean so much to me now.

679
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,948
So I guess I should focus

680
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,161
on my job and on not becoming a nuisance.

681
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,451
-Give it up for him!
-And--

682
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,704
Ms. Cha, the beef's waiting for us.

683
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,036
All right. Why don't we make a toast
and dig in?

684
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,463
Say "<i>Sweet Munchies,</i> let's go." Okay?

685
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,461
<i> Sweet Munchies!</i>

686
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,132
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

687
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,006
Gosh, it's so bitter.

688
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,144
It's beef, so I can't let you grill it.

689
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,888
All right, Chef.

690
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,858
Don't burn it, Chef.

691
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,225
Look at this.
The beef here is really good.

692
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,527
It looks so good.

693
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,100
I'm good at grilling, too.

694
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,557
-Really.
-I see.

695
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,067
Mr. Nam, let me do it.

696
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,670
Mr. Kang.

697
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,296
I wanted to ask you something.

698
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:34,298
Could you recommend a color
that might look good on me?

699
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,429
Well... Are you talking about clothes?

700
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,261
It doesn't matter.

701
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,468
Well...

702
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,311
Judging by your skin tone and hair color,

703
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,608
I think warm colors will look good on you.

704
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,570
I see.

705
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,490
And...

706
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:57,202
matte finishes will look better on you
than glossy ones.

707
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,320
Okay.

708
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,736
And as for rings and necklaces,

709
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,118
I think rose gold will be better
than silver.

710
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,621
I see... You really are a professional.

711
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,537
What are you doing?

712
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,205
-Pardon?
-What are you doing?

713
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,924
Well...

714
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,383
-What's wrong?
-It's nothing.

715
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,965
What? What is it?

716
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,090
Jae-su, can we have a word?

717
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,927
Please, eat. It looks good.

718
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,312
Please eat.

719
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,233
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

720
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,731
-It's good, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

721
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,029
Who is it?

722
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,201
What do you mean?

723
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,618
Is it Kim A-jin or Yoo Seong-eun?

724
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,002
Come on. What are you talking about?

725
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,171
It's Yoo.

726
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,427
Is it funny that I'm dating her?

727
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,353
You little...

728
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,732
I knew something was going on.
I was quite confused when you suddenly

729
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,480
started taking A-jin's side.

730
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,612
I guess it was because of a girl.

731
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:18,239
Gosh... Right, A-jin is
not as competent as I am yet, right?

732
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:23,487
So it's Seong-eun? I see. Seong-eun.

733
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,155
I see.

734
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,293
Thank you.

735
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:39,088
Gyu-jang, do you want to stay here
or go to another place?

736
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:43,804
Well, I think it's better to eat more here
than to go to another place.

737
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,764
I like that.

738
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,557
As you wish.
I'll let you guys have fun then.

739
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,192
Wait, ma'am.

740
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,558
Can we order more meat?

741
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,114
Sure. I'll leave my credit card
to Gyu-jang then.

742
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,191
Eat as much as you want.

743
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,608
-Thank you, ma'am!
-Thank you, ma'am!

744
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,605
-Enjoy it.
-Good night.

745
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,117
-Good night.
-Good night.

746
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,457
Oh, right.

747
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:19,513
About the jacket you wore
when you came to the audition.

748
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,304
What?

749
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,140
Oh, that jacket? What about it?

750
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,309
I happened to see someone wearing it.

751
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,481
-Do you have--
-Chef Park.

752
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,524
-Do you mind if I sit here?
-No.

753
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,440
I hope we'll get closer from now on.

754
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,355
Sure.

755
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,490
By the way, have you ever had
a relationship with a woman?

756
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,616
Sorry?

757
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:55,084
Gosh, I think Mr. Nam's pretty drunk.
Why don't we call it a night?

758
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,417
I'm drunk? No, I'm fine.

759
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:01,303
Can't you tell?
I'm even keeping your secret.

760
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,681
Why would you ask that?

761
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,100
Well... I just thought you might've broken
a lot of women's hearts.

762
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,185
Because that's what you do?

763
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,396
Well, I...

764
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,110
I mean, I just asked
because Chef Park's quite good-looking.

765
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,664
If so, perhaps you should learn
how to compliment a person.

766
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,204
If the person is offended,
then it's not a compliment.

767
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,831
Right.

768
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,003
I see. I understand.

769
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,799
Is <i>Sweet Munchies</i> that good?

770
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,216
All right. I'll watch it now then.

771
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,598
While eating dried pollock
with mayonnaise.

772
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,475
Okay.

773
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,568
All right.

774
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,212
<i>You don't seem nervous at all.</i>

775
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,045
<i>I was so nervous on my first shoot.</i>

776
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,263
What?

777
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,894
<i>When did you decide
you wanted to become an actor?</i>

778
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,392
-Why is he on the show?
<i>-When I was in high school.</i>

779
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,722
<i>I see.</i>

780
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,020
Jin-u.

781
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,408
I'll explain everything.
Have a seat first.

782
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,531
Don't touch me.

783
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,286
What happened is that...

784
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,997
It was because of money, wasn't it?

785
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,598
Because of Dad's hospital bills, right?

786
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,774
I tried to borrow money here and there.

787
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,596
I couldn't even get a million won.

788
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,397
And at that time, A-jin was

789
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,904
looking for a good gay chef.

790
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,491
I was only

791
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,785
going to do it once.

792
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,999
Do you have any idea what you've done?

793
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,711
You lied on television.

794
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,790
You're scamming people.

795
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,389
Are you open?

796
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,926
I think it's open.

797
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,145
Please have a seat.

798
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,533
Jin-u.

799
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,648
Hi, Dad.

800
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,410
Are you eating well, son?

801
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,831
Your son's a chef, you know.

802
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,159
You don't have to worry about that.

803
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,083
Did something happen to Jin-u?

804
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,633
What? Well, I don't think so. Why?

805
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,761
He suddenly called me crying
and saying he missed me.

806
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,425
-Jin-u did?
-So I told him to come see me,

807
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,602
but he said he needed
to go to an audition to make money.

808
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,771
I think he said that because
he's had a lot of auditions lately.

809
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,856
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

810
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,863
<i>Okay. And I know he's on a diet,
but don't let him skip meals too often.</i>

811
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,366
Okay.

812
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,620
How's your health, Dad?

813
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,036
Everything's fine there, right?

814
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,747
Hey, Jin-u.

815
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,208
Where did you sleep?

816
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,304
At a friend's.

817
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,473
Why didn't you tell me? I was so worried.

818
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,231
I made this for you. Did you eat?

819
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,309
I did.

820
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,225
Jin-u, we need to talk.

821
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,822
Jin-seong,

822
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,071
let's talk later.

823
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,198
Let's do it later.

824
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,213
Okay, I see. Okay, thank you.

825
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,173
Sang-yeong, let's go have a drink.

826
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,884
A-jin, you, too.

827
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,756
-Pardon?
-What's the occasion?

828
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,591
You never ask me to have a drink.
Is there something to celebrate?

829
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,847
Well, you could say that.

830
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,719
But I have a meeting.

831
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:53,057
Come on, A-jin. Can't you push it back?

832
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,314
Your superiors want
to have a drink with you.

833
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,186
He's right. Let's have a drink tonight.

834
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,613
Okay, then.
Let me speak with the others then.

835
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,943
Okay, you do that.

836
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:08,244
Hey, Gyu-jang. What's the occasion?
Is there something to celebrate?

837
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:14,955
Sang-yeong, this world is not
as bright as you want it to be.

838
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,671
What are you talking about?

839
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,131
Come on. Of course, it is!

840
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,551
You just asked me
to have a drink with you.

841
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,550
Where should we go? Where?

842
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,937
Hey.

843
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,834
You don't look well.

844
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,699
Is something wrong?

845
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,924
No.

846
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:57,834
Do you want a drink?

847
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,214
I didn't eat much for lunch.
I guess I knew we'd be having a drink.

848
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,262
Will Chef Park give us
sea urchin roe today, too?

849
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,511
Urchin roe.

850
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,509
We're here.

851
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:14,227
Wait. Excuse me for a minute.

852
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,519
Where are you going?

853
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,612
I'll be back soon. You guys go in first.

854
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,019
You're not bailing on us, are you?

855
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,944
-I'll be back soon.
-All right.

856
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,822
He's suspicious. He'll come back, right?

857
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,284
I think so.

858
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,249
-Hello.
-Hello.

859
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:37,038
Oh, Mr. Kang's here, too.

860
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,381
Welcome. Is it just you two today?

861
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,460
Mr. Nam is coming, too.

862
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,295
-Right. Oh, let's have a seat.
-Okay.

863
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,551
I see.

864
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:47,842
Hi, Mr. Kang.

865
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,265
-Do you want to eat something now?
-Gyu-jang will be here soon, so...

866
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,728
There he is.

867
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,796
Let me introduce my friend here.
This is...

868
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,265
You two already know each other, right?

869
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,856
Hey.

870
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:45,981
Hey, Mr. Nam.

871
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,567
Mr. Nam, let's have a word outside.

872
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,283
It's been a while, Jin-seong.

873
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,988
Has it been three years since we broke up?

874
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,634
You still don't realize what you've done?

875
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,842
What have I done?

876
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,221
I really wanted to see you, too.

877
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,473
I was just worried about Jin-seong.

878
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:58,762
I don't even know what I'm feeling lately.

879
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,268
<i>I'm seeing things now.</i>

880
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,311
<i>You like her?</i>

881
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,864
<i>You're supposed to like men now!</i>

882
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:09,568
Could you stay be my brother's side?

883
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,987
Park Jin-seong!

884
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:15,739
"If he didn't like men,
would he be attracted to me?"

885
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,873
<i>I like you.</i>

886
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:22,081
