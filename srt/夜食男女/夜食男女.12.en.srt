1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,110
Yes. I hate you so much.

2
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,319
You've been watching me have
such a difficult time because I like you.

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,910
I hate you for still hiding it from me.

4
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,198
I'm so scared that everything
might go wrong because of you.

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,951
But...

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,955
right now, I'm more worried

7
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,166
about you than all those things.

8
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,634
I'm so scared you'll get hurt.

9
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,554
You must've suffered by yourself
all this time.

10
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,137
I'm so sorry for that.

11
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,466
And it breaks my heart.

12
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,864
I know I'm being selfish to say this now.

13
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,607
But A-jin,

14
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,532
I love you.

15
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,232
Who are you to reveal the truth?
Who do you think you are?

16
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,274
Kim A-jin. You think you're a journalist?

17
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,937
Is this a current affairs show?

18
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,145
What truth?

19
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:39,117
Do you want to make fools of those
who cried and laughed watching your show?

20
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,743
The truth?

21
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,752
What? Do you want to make them
feel uncomfortable and angry?

22
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,415
Do you want to break the fantasy
you've helped them create?

23
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,666
My goodness...

24
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,925
What you should do now

25
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,184
is gloss over this and wrap up the show
as well as you can.

26
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,607
That's what you should do
for the viewers who love your show.

27
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,858
Do you understand?

28
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,567
But...

29
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,907
we can't carry on with the show like this.

30
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,832
Who says we'll carry on?

31
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,213
That matter is not up to you two.

32
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,226
How many people know about this?

33
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,648
For now, just the producers of the show.

34
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,478
If <i>Sweet Munchies</i> is forced to end early,
CKTV will suffer heavy losses.

35
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,435
A lot of ads are associated
with every episode.

36
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,565
If we push ahead with the show like this,
things will get out of hand later.

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,945
It's better to end it early ourselves.

38
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,913
Then what are you going to tell
the public?

39
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,753
I think we should say the first season
was only set for eight episodes

40
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,630
and that there will be a second season
in the future.

41
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,798
-Okay, do as you just said.
-Yes, sir.

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,220
Sir, this matter is not something
we should let slide like that.

43
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,011
It's a serious issue.

44
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,680
Someone must be held responsible.

45
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,352
As soon as this matter is sorted out,

46
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,518
I promise to take responsibility.

47
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,737
I'll step down as director.

48
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,204
Damn it...

49
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,447
Why is <i>Sweet Munchies</i> going
to be canceled?

50
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,958
It's the most popular CKTV show right now.
So why?

51
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,634
Hey, why are you so calm?

52
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,505
Even the episode we already shot
won't be aired.

53
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,136
Did you complain
when I told you to join the show?

54
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,393
You did what I said back then.
Why are you whining so much now?

55
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,849
But that's...

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,960
It seems like I'm the only one
who doesn't know why this is happening.

57
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,302
Please tell me why, Ms. Cha.

58
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,842
I'm the main producer of this show.

59
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,546
Gyu-jang.

60
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,233
I'll tell you the truth,
so make sure to keep it to yourself.

61
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,479
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,273
Park Jin-seong has been lying to us
all this time.

63
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,687
He's not gay.

64
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,151
Pardon?

65
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,177
When did you find out?

66
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,392
Answer me.

67
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,515
Kim A-jin.

68
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,613
I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,025
You messed up the show, and you're sorry?

70
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,909
Is that it?

71
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,238
That doesn't cut it.

72
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,701
How are you going to take
responsibility for this?

73
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,616
What are you going to do about this?
Answer me!

74
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,457
Gyu-jang, don't be like that.

75
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,133
A-jin is as upset and frustrated
as you are.

76
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,762
Are you seriously taking her side
right now?

77
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,971
My reputation is about to be ruined
because of her.

78
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,635
Hold on.

79
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,385
You knew about this, didn't you?

80
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,730
So this is what you've been hiding
from me?

81
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,481
Are you guys all in on this?

82
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,194
God, I can't believe this.

83
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,731
Gyu-jang, I know how you must feel.

84
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,158
It must be frustrating
to find out like this.

85
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,608
No, you have no idea.

86
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,238
How could you possibly understand
how furious I am right now?

87
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,655
What's going on?

88
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,873
Gyu-jang.

89
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,464
What's the matter?

90
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,342
A-jin.

91
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,262
Don't you have a mouth?
Why aren't you saying anything?

92
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,555
You made such a ridiculous mess.
Why are you acting like a victim?

93
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,769
-Hey, stop.
-Damn it.

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,890
She's also a victim here.

95
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,863
I have no excuse for what happened.

96
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,855
I'm so sorry.

97
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,820
Are you admitting you and Jin-seong
have been in on this?

98
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,118
Right?

99
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,696
Answer me.

100
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,373
Answer me!

101
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,790
Why is it so noisy out here?

102
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,166
Get back to work!

103
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,270
Why are you still here?

104
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,975
I've been waiting for you.

105
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,820
It was getting late so I was worried.

106
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,116
My goodness...

107
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,042
Not so long ago, the Entertainment Dept.
was doing amazing, wasn't it?

108
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,334
We even went out to celebrate our success.

109
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,835
I don't know how we ended up like this.

110
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,432
Are you okay with it?

111
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,638
With what?

112
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,555
Stepping down as director.

113
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,982
Honestly?

114
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,744
Of course, I'm not okay with it.

115
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,241
Somehow I found out about it first.

116
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,751
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

117
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,915
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,046
There was nothing
you could've done about it, anyway.

119
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,223
To be honest,

120
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,724
I can't say I didn't do anything wrong.

121
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,144
It would've been hard enough for her
just to find an ordinary chef.

122
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,098
But

123
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,065
I pushed her into finding a gay chef
in a single day.

124
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,027
Don't be so hard on yourself.

125
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,656
I hope I'm the only one
who will be held responsible.

126
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
But I'm not sure
if things will go as I hope.

127
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,665
I'll get going then.

128
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,653
BROTHERS

129
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,369
The episode that was aired this week is
the last episode of <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

130
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,293
Starting next week,
Mr. Lee's show will replace it.

131
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,671
-A-jin.
-It's for the best.

132
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,001
No one's been hurt.

133
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,417
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,591
The show you loved so much
has been canceled.

135
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,720
Even when you couldn't eat all day long
because you were up to your neck in work,

136
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,894
you always said you were happy
because you could produce your own show.

137
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,319
And now...

138
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,112
you lost that precious show

139
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,909
because of me.

140
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,290
No, it's not like that.

141
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,706
What? Mr. Nam?

142
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,596
Now it's clear.

143
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,229
You made Jin-seong pretend to be gay.

144
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,558
Mr. Nam,

145
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,648
A-jin had nothing to do with that.

146
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,566
I just saw you two,
and you expect me to believe that?

147
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,661
Look, Park Jin-seong,

148
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,492
do you take me for a fool?

149
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,615
A-jin really didn't know
anything about it.

150
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,082
Oh, is that so?

151
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,172
But I find it even more difficult
to understand her now.

152
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,341
Hey,

153
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,129
if you really didn't know,

154
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,803
then it doesn't make sense
for you to be so calm.

155
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,432
You should be busting up
this place with me,

156
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,550
saying he's ruined your precious show.

157
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,717
-How can you be here speaking with him?
-Mr. Nam.

158
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,555
-Let's go. Let's have a word.
-Let go of me.

159
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,271
-Let's talk somewhere else.
-I said, let go of me!

160
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,482
A-jin.

161
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,281
What a show, really.
Is this some kind of soap opera?

162
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,741
Did you fall in love
while setting your story straight?

163
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,533
I can't believe this.

164
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,004
Hey, A-jin.

165
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,247
All that...

166
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,711
mattered to you was debuting
as a producer, wasn't it?

167
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,006
And you.

168
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,843
All that mattered to you was
making money, wasn't it?

169
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,434
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> meant a lot to me.

170
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,231
Why did you have to drag me into your lies

171
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,312
and make me suffer like this?

172
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,778
Why? Tell me. What's the reason?

173
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,939
Why?

174
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,526
Say something. Why?

175
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,000
She's the one, right?

176
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,594
How could she do such a thing?

177
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,090
-She's the one, right?
-Yes.

178
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,354
Look who's here.

179
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,401
Hey.

180
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,895
The director's been demoted.
Because of you, a mere contract worker.

181
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,574
-Pardon?
-"Pardon?"

182
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,029
You realize now what you've done?

183
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,478
Come in.

184
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,334
Ms. Cha.

185
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,709
What?

186
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,677
I'm okay.

187
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,307
Why?

188
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,180
Why do you have to be held responsible?

189
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,977
That's also the director's job.

190
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,607
I'm serious.
That's what the position is for.

191
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,898
My job is to give opportunities
to people like you

192
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,744
and to protect you from any stones
thrown down from above.

193
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,656
That way my subordinates can work
without that pressure.

194
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,294
That's what the director position is for.

195
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,420
What am I going to do if you're not here?

196
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,717
What else?

197
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,299
Hold on tight and survive.

198
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,550
In this field,

199
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,769
the one who lasts longer is the winner.

200
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,629
Hello.

201
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,715
I'm Han Chang-min,
a journalist at <i>K Daily.</i>

202
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,258
You know me, don't you?

203
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,175
I've written some articles about you.

204
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,483
What brings you here?

205
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,612
I heard <i>Sweet Munchies</i> has been canceled.

206
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,650
You know that director Cha Ju-hui
has been demoted, right?

207
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,823
And I think

208
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,656
the cancellation of the show

209
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,741
and her demotion are related.

210
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,537
You should leave.

211
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,210
"Park Jin-seong is not gay.

212
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,625
The show was fake. They lied.

213
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,546
Park Jin-seong and producer Kim A-jin
are seeing each other."

214
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,605
Those are the rumors going around CKTV.

215
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,619
Did you make an appointment
for an interview?

216
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,422
Aren't you Mr. Kang Tae-wan?

217
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,130
The way you work hasn't changed.

218
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,753
Raising suspicions
rather than pursuing the truth,

219
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,088
manipulating public opinion
by spreading rumors,

220
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,761
and putting the blame on anyone
who reacts too strongly against you.

221
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,136
A true journalist

222
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:45,811
should write articles that help people,
not tidbits of gossip.

223
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,819
I guess you two are quite close.

224
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,038
Feel free to call me anytime
if you need an interview.

225
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,889
Don't let such a thing get to you.

226
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,440
What if something happens to A-jin?

227
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,328
EXCLUSIVE: <i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>
MAKING FOOLS OF VIEWERS

228
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,588
CHEF PARK AND PRODUCER KIM'S SUSPICIOUS
RELATIONSHIP AND THE CANCELLATION...

229
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,013
IT'S OBVIOUS THE PRODUCER'S A FOX

230
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,892
WE SHOULD MAKE SURE
SHE CAN'T MAKE ANY FUTURE SHOWS

231
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,760
SHE COAXED AN INNOCENT GUY
BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T FIND ANY GAY CHEFS

232
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,887
THIS IS RIDICULOUS

233
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,104
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED!

234
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,433
I FEEL SO BETRAYED

235
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,848
THAT'S HOW BADLY SHE WANTED TO DEBUT?

236
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,146
I WONDER HOW SHE TALKED HIM INTO IT

237
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,520
CHEF PARK AND MS. KIM
REFUSED AN INTERVIEW...

238
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,323
I HEARD THEY'RE DATING AND LIVING TOGETHER

239
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,616
SHE'S A CONTRACT WORKER,
SO SHE LIED TO DEBUT

240
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,831
Where are you going?

241
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,285
I heard he's not gay.

242
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,575
I'm getting goosebumps.

243
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,788
He didn't look gay.

244
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,127
What? You could tell?

245
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,673
You know, Ms. Kim and him
looked good together.

246
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,337
Then he's seeing Ms. Kim?

247
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,217
How could you not know that?

248
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,018
I think the comments sound plausible.

249
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,809
I mean, she was a contract worker
for four years.

250
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:55,022
Then did she make her boyfriend pretend
to be gay to make the show?

251
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,355
It's possible.

252
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,860
She must've been afraid she might remain
a contract worker forever.

253
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,362
My goodness. Did she want to produce
a show so much that she went that far?

254
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,066
I can understand her.

255
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,328
What?

256
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,659
-But that's it.
-I can't understand her.

257
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,165
Sir, we can't just leave things like this.

258
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,038
They're accusing CKTV
of being an accomplice.

259
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,705
What are you going to do?

260
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,260
I think we should tell the press
it's not true

261
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,380
and that nothing's confirmed--

262
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,387
God, you're so frustrating.

263
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,259
Director, you think that'll be enough?

264
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,640
We should announce the contract worker

265
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,806
has already been terminated,
so she's not our employee.

266
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,355
And let's sue Park Jin-seong for fraud,
so that we won't be accused--

267
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,990
I think that's too harsh for them.
They're still quite young.

268
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,699
Kim A-jin

269
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,989
may still be a contract worker,

270
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,783
but she was about to be converted
to a regular employee.

271
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,163
She worked hard for CKTV's sake--

272
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,754
For CKTV's sake?

273
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,250
I see. She made this mess for CKTV's sake?

274
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,632
Let's end this by terminating
the contract worker's contract.

275
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,550
Sir, please reconsider.

276
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,854
Do you want to ruin the whole company
to protect a contract worker?

277
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,230
They say he's really not gay.

278
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,942
What? Then they've been lying?
My goodness.

279
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,777
Kim A-jin and him must've
planned it together.

280
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,109
I guess so.

281
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,578
Chef Park.

282
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,422
What's with the articles?

283
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,838
They're not true, are they?

284
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,684
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,812
I'll talk to you about this another time.

286
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,888
Wait.

287
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,192
Are you here to see A-jin?

288
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,943
She's not here now.

289
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,981
Where did she go?

290
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,031
I don't know.

291
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,703
I don't think you should go upstairs.

292
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,252
A-jin.

293
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,377
Hey, Jin-seong.

294
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,428
Are you okay?

295
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,391
Yes.

296
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,443
I couldn't reach you.

297
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,694
I was so worried.

298
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,899
Well...

299
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,407
Let's go in.

300
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,087
Have you eaten?

301
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,721
No, I'm starving.

302
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,676
How have you not eaten this whole time?

303
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,637
You might ruin your health.

304
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,605
Make me that dish.

305
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,317
<i>Doenjang</i> stew with beef brisket.

306
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,783
Beef brisket?

307
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,820
All right.

308
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,988
Yay!

309
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,145
But I'm worried you might cry again
while eating this.

310
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,364
In case you do,

311
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,276
I have this ready.

312
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,117
I'll cry if it's delicious,

313
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,290
and I won't if it's not.

314
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,826
It can't be not delicious.

315
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,911
It looks so good.

316
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,948
-Let me.
-Okay.

317
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,214
Here.

318
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,755
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

319
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,902
It's good.

320
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,817
Yes, this is it.

321
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,197
It's so good.

322
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,998
Come on. It's not like I'm going to die.

323
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,839
How come you're being fired?
You've done nothing wrong.

324
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,797
I did do something wrong.

325
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,380
You want me to tell you again?

326
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,682
What did Chef Park say?

327
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,183
Does he know what's happening to you?

328
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,493
Everything will be okay.

329
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,122
Because of your mistakes,
CKTV's reputation has been damaged

330
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,381
and is suffering heavy losses.

331
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,461
Do you admit to being responsible?

332
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,727
Yes,

333
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,977
I admit to being responsible.

334
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:25,742
CKTV has not only suffered financially
from this incident,

335
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,954
but company values
such as trust and confidence

336
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,204
have also been greatly compromised.

337
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,248
Therefore, the discipline committee

338
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,081
has decided to cancel
Ms. Kim A-jin's promotion

339
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,883
and to terminate her contract.

340
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,819
A-jin,

341
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,446
come with me.

342
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,101
Cheers.

343
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,034
Here.

344
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,907
Have something to eat, too.

345
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,294
Thank you.

346
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,038
You didn't eat anything today, did you?

347
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,169
Go ahead and eat.

348
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,587
Okay.

349
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,610
Life is not something
that can be ruined that easily.

350
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,870
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

351
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,253
Don't be. Just cry, okay?

352
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,838
You can't be fine in this situation.

353
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,731
If you pretend to be okay,

354
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,638
it might end up eating away at you.
You don't want that.

355
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,808
Yes, just cry and let it out.

356
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,963
But,

357
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,092
don't forget.

358
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,341
You just

359
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,393
stumbled a bit, okay?

360
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,722
You can get back on your feet.

361
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,439
Thank you.

362
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,065
Okay, now. Eat.

363
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,263
A-jin.

364
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,349
When did you get here?
Why didn't you call me?

365
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,902
Why didn't you tell me?

366
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:56,988
Let's get out of here.

367
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,236
Are you okay?

368
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,874
Of course.

369
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,563
What did you think I prepared
that you're so startled?

370
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,648
I think it's the first time
I've treated you two to a meal.

371
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,152
You guys

372
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,107
made <i>sujebi</i> for me last time.

373
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,583
I didn't make these,

374
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,950
but still, enjoy.

375
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,750
It was expensive.

376
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,093
-Thanks for the food.
-Enjoy.

377
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,671
Thanks for the food.

378
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,129
Eat up.

379
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,010
You, too.

380
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,726
Give me your phone.

381
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,502
Why won't he answer his phone?

382
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,839
I'm sure he turned it off
because he's getting so many calls.

383
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,295
It's not like he killed someone.

384
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,586
Why are they pestering him so much?

385
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,532
I'm a terrible father.

386
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,239
I sent my son to his death.

387
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,778
This is all my fault.

388
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,405
Things ended up this bad because of me.

389
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,705
Dad.

390
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,707
Don't be like that.

391
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,542
It'll only make

392
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,085
Jin-seong feel worse.

393
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,045
If things go badly for him,

394
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,054
I'll never forgive myself.

395
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,018
A-jin.

396
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,402
I can't forgive myself.

397
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,790
Don't say such a thing.

398
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,753
If I don't put things right,

399
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,126
you'll be branded as that producer
who coaxed a guy into pretending he's gay.

400
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,425
And it'll follow you

401
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,183
for the rest of your life...

402
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,183
and affect everything you do.

403
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,647
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

404
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,859
But for now,

405
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,196
let's just stay low.

406
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,618
Let's not think about it.

407
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,825
This will all pass.

408
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,249
If you stay by my side,

409
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,627
you'll get hurt.

410
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,392
What do you mean?

411
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,063
No.

412
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,016
I'll never let go of your hand.

413
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,356
So don't even

414
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,235
think about leaving me.

415
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,349
Jin-seong.

416
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,654
Jin-seong?

417
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,227
Mr. Kang.

418
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,649
Where's Jin-seong?

419
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,906
He left.

420
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,536
What?

421
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,371
Where did he go?

422
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,328
When?

423
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,710
Why didn't you stop him?

424
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,383
You shouldn't have let him leave!

425
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,758
He said he couldn't watch someone he loves
get hurt because of him.

426
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,980
I can't either.

427
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,863
Where's Jin-seong now?

428
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,133
-There he comes.
-You're right.

429
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,433
-That's Park Jin-seong, right?
-Yes.

430
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,758
It's really him.

431
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,853
Mr. Park Jin-seong,
is it true that you're not gay?

432
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,639
What's your relationship
with the producer?

433
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,483
Did Ms. Kim A-jin put you up to it?

434
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,808
Is it all true? Please tell us.

435
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,313
What's the truth?

436
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,187
I'll explain everything.

437
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,944
Everything.

438
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,870
Do you admit that
you've been lying about being gay?

439
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,327
Yes.

440
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,080
What was the reason behind this fraud?

441
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,418
I needed money.

442
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,045
<i>To pay for my father's surgery</i>

443
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,224
<i>and the deposit for my bistro.</i>

444
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,604
The amount you can borrow...

445
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,971
is zero.

446
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,805
<i>I was cornered to the edge
of a cliff overnight.</i>

447
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,022
LOTTERY
500 MILLION WON

448
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,154
But I couldn't get the money anywhere.

449
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,197
Who changed the lock?

450
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,529
<i>I was so desperate.</i>

451
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,743
I realized...

452
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,485
<i>A GAY CHEF'S SWEET MUNCHIES</i>
PROPOSAL

453
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,196
<i>I'd be able to come up with the money
if I appeared on the show.</i>

454
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,674
<i>"If I bring myself</i>

455
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,054
<i>to appear just once,</i>

456
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,796
<i>I'll be able to come up with money
for both my father's surgery</i>

457
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,314
<i>and this bistro."</i>

458
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,813
I came up with such a foolish idea.

459
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,823
<i>To everyone who's suffered</i>

460
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,904
because of my mistake,

461
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,869
I sincerely apologize.

462
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,872
<i>I'll try to atone for this</i>

463
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,869
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

464
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,773
Jin-seong!

465
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,654
Jin-seong!

466
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,210
Oh, my.

467
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,506
Thank you so much
for everything, everyone.

468
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,089
You don't have much stuff.

469
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,801
I know.

470
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:08,965
A-jin.

471
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,846
Yes?

472
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,938
You're a good producer.

473
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,479
Don't ever doubt that.

474
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:26,986
Thank you.

475
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,919
Let's go, CKTV!

476
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,668
I'll carry this for you.

477
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,590
Thanks.

478
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,969
Bye, everyone.

479
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,581
Darn it.

480
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,674
Call me.

481
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,674
Okay.

482
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,811
Keep up the good work.

483
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,903
I'll get going.

484
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,238
-Bye.
-Bye.

485
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,048
Are you guys doing well?

486
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,052
Did you buy something for us?

487
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,181
It's nothing much.

488
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,431
I picked this up
in case you guys were hungry.

489
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,433
-Come on.
-Thank you!

490
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,475
What is it?

491
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,805
It looks delicious.

492
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,104
What do you think?

493
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,694
Mr. Kang.

494
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,567
Haven't I improved a lot?
I really think I have.

495
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,449
-Come on, compliment me.
-Compliment him.

496
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,449
-I really improved a lot.
-Just compliment him.

497
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:39,845
Jin-seong.

498
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,891
Tae-wan.

499
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,733
Where are you going?

500
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,980
To my bistro.

501
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,320
Why?

502
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,990
Reporters must be there.

503
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,285
It's not too late to put things right

504
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,667
if I tell the truth now.

505
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,434
Don't do it.

506
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,345
It's not that nothing will happen

507
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,391
if I don't do anything.

508
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,772
A-jin...

509
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,483
doesn't even cry in front of me.

510
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,818
She can't even produce
the show she loves anymore,

511
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,110
but she says she's okay.

512
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,991
I can't watch her like that.

513
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,711
It breaks my heart.

514
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,955
Tae-wan.

515
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:58,801
-Jin-seong...
-There's a way to protect someone I love.

516
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,720
So I can't just do nothing.

517
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,387
If I can gather up my courage
before it's too late,

518
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,402
I think...

519
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,516
I'll be able to protect

520
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,896
the people I love at least.

521
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,246
Tae-wan.

522
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,094
Thank you for everything.

523
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,634
I really hope you find happiness.

524
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,091
I'll get going.

525
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,571
Hi, Father. I didn't know you were coming.

526
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,486
Why don't we have a drink?

527
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,949
Okay.

528
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,839
Father,

529
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,184
is something wrong?

530
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,638
Why, you brat?

531
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,756
I just...

532
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,975
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this.

533
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,904
I guess I'm getting old.

534
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,242
I'll be better to you.

535
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,753
To be honest,

536
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,082
I thought

537
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,923
I was unhappy because of you.

538
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,013
That I wasn't able to live
the life I want...

539
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,684
because of you.

540
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,929
I'm sorry, Father.

541
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,987
I just wanted you

542
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,320
to live a normal life

543
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,740
like others.

544
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,880
I'm gay.

545
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,885
I wasn't unhappy

546
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,601
because of someone else.

547
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,278
I was unhappy
because I couldn't accept myself.

548
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,611
I shouldn't have been afraid of it.

549
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,741
You're the most important person
in my life.

550
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,038
So I hope...

551
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,003
you find happiness as well.

552
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,992
<i>While I was raising you,</i>

553
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,210
<i>it was when you smiled</i>

554
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,456
<i>that I was happiest.</i>

555
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,302
<i>Your life is yours.</i>

556
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,353
That's ridiculous.

557
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,975
If they want you to draw a better picture,
they should give you more money.

558
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:09,193
They got such a good picture at
a low production cost because of you.

559
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,905
I knew it. You're the only one on my side.

560
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,866
Isn't it hard for you?

561
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,869
Of course, it is.

562
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,879
There are too many production companies
that want to work with me.

563
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,054
Here's your food.

564
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,879
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

565
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,586
It looks good.

566
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:34,965
Enjoy.

567
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:45,019
Noodles, because I hope you'll be able
to work there for a long time.

568
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,198
-Is it good?
-Yes, it is.

569
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,148
What's the matter?

570
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,316
What? No, it's nothing.

571
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,094
<i>To some people,</i>

572
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,633
<i>the night is like the rest that comes
after a long day.</i>

573
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,383
Hello?

574
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:59,547
Yes, this is the chauffeur service.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

575
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:03,927
<i>To some, the night is the beginning
of an exhausting day.</i>

576
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,852
<i>And to some,</i>

577
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,477
<i>the night is like a tunnel
too dark to find any hope.</i>

578
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,067
<i>And to some,</i>

579
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,994
<i>the night is like a starting point
for a new beginning.</i>

580
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,962
-Have you been waiting long?
-Yes.

581
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,378
Hey, we'll get going then.

582
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,757
Sure.

583
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,093
-Good night.
-Good night.

584
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,098
Bye.

585
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,260
Bye.

586
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,968
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

587
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,098
Good night.

588
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,449
Welcome.

589
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:33,063
<i>Those who have gone through
the dark tunnel of life must know this.</i>

590
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,515
<i>When the darkness covers your eyes,</i>

591
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,568
<i>you have to get used to the darkness
to survive.</i>

592
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,789
Can I get a beer, please?

593
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:23,987
Thank you.

594
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,103
<i>Just as morning will always follow night,</i>

595
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,903
<i>it's when you begin to think it's all over</i>

596
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,781
<i>that another new beginning
miraculously arrives.</i>

597
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,373
<i>When that time comes, all you have to do</i>

598
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,420
<i>is move forward,
even if the step is small.</i>

599
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,672
<i>Move toward the bright light
that awaits you</i>

600
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,053
<i>at the end of the darkness.</i>

601
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,843
-One more beer--
-Beer, please.

602
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,119
Hi.

603
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,004
Hi.

604
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:29,127
THE END
