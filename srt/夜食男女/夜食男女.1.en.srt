00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,104
Hi, Chef.

3
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,058
Hi.

4
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,379
God, this feels good.

5
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,434
I think you understand how I feel better
than my colleagues

6
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,184
I've been working with
for four years. Seriously.

7
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,348
You told me

8
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,396
drinking cold draft beer
before soju is the best.

9
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,895
Chef, I'm going to drink
hard liquor tonight.

10
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,407
Hard liquor?

11
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,237
Something must have
really upset you today.

12
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,156
Yes. Something made me really angry today.

13
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
What's the drinking snack for tonight?

14
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,135
I'll make something that's perfect

15
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,481
for when you're angry.

16
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,655
Here you go.

17
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,844
It's fun to pull the clam
out of the shell.

18
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,459
Then I should have fun.

19
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,383
It's really good.

20
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,260
Taurine in the Manila clams
helps our livers function well.

21
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,671
So it's the perfect snack for hard liquor.

22
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,992
This really hits the spot.

23
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,700
Did you have dinner?

24
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,243
This is dinner for me.

25
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,892
PASS

26
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,809
Isn't it so unfair?

27
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,857
On regular employee ID cards,
their names are written,

28
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,268
but contract workers
only get "pass" on their ID cards.

29
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,400
That's cheap.

30
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,858
How hard can it be
to print names on a card?

31
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,368
Right?

32
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,621
I mean, I've been working there for years,

33
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,582
but no one's ever called me by my name.

34
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,420
What's your name?

35
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,548
It's... It's Kim A-jin.

36
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,758
This one's on the house,
Producer Kim A-jin.

37
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,056
So enjoy.

38
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,936
Noodles, because I hope you'll be able
to work there for a long time.

39
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,650
Thank you.

40
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,185
It's so good.

41
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,454
-Welcome.
-Hi, Chef.

42
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,029
You come quite often these days.

43
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,373
Of course.

44
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,159
-Soju, please.
-Sure.

45
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,997
-Glasses are in front of you.
-Okay.

46
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,503
What's the drinking snack
going to be tonight?

47
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,545
I'm already looking forward to it.

48
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,799
We look forward to tonight's food, Chef.

49
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,216
Sure.

50
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,150
Dad.

51
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,696
Come on, that's my specialty.

52
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,869
Why are you here? I told you not to come.

53
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,778
How could I not? I'm in charge
of the most important thing here.

54
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,788
-Stop exaggerating.
-What do you mean, exaggerating?

55
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,171
Seasoning food is really important.

56
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,378
Not just anyone can do it.
It's quite hard.

57
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,045
This is too bland. It needs more salt.

58
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,851
-Dad, give me one of those vests.
-Sure.

00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,492
-Come on, Dad.
-What?

61
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,818
A strong, young man like me
should do this.

62
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,827
Hey, I'm still stronger than you.

63
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,581
Are you trying to look good for someone?

64
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,714
What? You brat.

65
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,419
-You're blushing.
-Hey.

66
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,841

of your father?

69
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,929
Dad.

70
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,650
Try these on.

71
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,027
Why did you buy them?

72
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,900
Because I didn't want you
wearing worn-out shoes.

73
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,155
And because you don't have a wife
or girlfriend who'd buy them for you.

74
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,122
Look who's talking.

75
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,325
There's no way a frugal man
such as yourself would buy new shoes.

76
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,501
I mean, you spend all your money
on other people as soon as you earn it.

77
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,844
What can I do? Of course, I should
take care of things like this.

78
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,091
But white shoes get dirty easily.

79
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,219
They look good on you.

80
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,387
See if they're comfortable.

81
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,016
Do they fit well?

82
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,809
How did you even know my shoe size?

What's wrong with this?

90
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,532
The company doesn't provide computers
with contract workers.

91
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,610
Pardon?

92
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,992
Then what should I do?

93
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,623
I have a proposal to submit by today.

94
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,205
Actually, all the employees replaced
their computers not too long ago,

95
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,288
so there are used computers
in the storage room.

96
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,288
Used computers...

97
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,167
I see.

98
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,073
Dad, I prepared this lunch box
with love and care,

99
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,405
so don't skip a meal, and eat all of it.

100
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,621
You worry about yourself.

101
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,695
You're still young,
but you should take care of your health.

102
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,826
Dad, why don't we get a new car?

103
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,843
I'll cover half the cost.

104
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,552
Come on. Just take a look.

105
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,467
This car's still running well.
Why buy a new one?

106
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,353
You bought it when Mom was alive,
so it's been about 20 years, right?

107
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,103
But it still runs fine.

108
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,852
You should get a decent car

109
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,018
so that you can make a girlfriend
or date someone.

110
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,857
You're talking nonsense again.

111
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,784
I'm just worried.

112
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,454
This car's too old, you know.

113
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,779
What if it breaks down on the road?

114
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,118
Hey, don't worry about something
that hasn't even happened.

115
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,625
All right, all right.

116
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,961
I'll take a look and decide which car
to buy before we meet next time.

117
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,086
Are you happy now?

118
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,090
Yes.

119
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,809
I mean, what's the difference between
regular employees and contract workers

120
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,773
when we all work
for the same broadcasting company?

121
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,563
Why do they have to treat us
so differently?

122
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,357
Why didn't they get us contract workers
new computers, too?

123
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,492
If they did, I'd be moved
and more loyal to them. Idiots.

124
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,570
Seriously.

125
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,413

Did they say contract workers are allowed
to submit a proposal?

138
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,037
I thought they said it wasn't allowed.

00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,224

00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,056

00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,395
No, I just got here.

181
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,307
The water pressure here
really agrees with me.

182
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,398
The shower made my body feel relaxed.

183
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,776
Hey, here's my proposal.

184
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,908
Oh, and from now on, run it by me

185
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,989
when you decide what to eat
for a company dinner.

186
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,704
I'm telling you, the director knows
nothing about it.

187
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,075
Sure, Mr. Lee.

188
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,872
Hey, Mr. Park.

189
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,957
Were you busy?
You didn't answer my call earlier.

190
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,206
It's about a new show I came up with.

191
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,927
IN-DEOK

192
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,268
In-deok,

193
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,108
why aren't you picking up?
And why are you not coming to work?

194
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,686
You're making me worry, so call me, okay?

195
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,990
<i>CRAZY DAYS OF 33-YEAR-OLDS!</i>

196
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,035
<i>WINTER OF MY HOMETOWN</i>

197
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,509
A-jin.

198
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,180
A-jin.

199
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,147
Oh, Seong-eun. Are you still here?

200
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,403
I just finished the script.

201
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,227
A-jin,

202
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,201
want to go for a drink?

203
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,907
That sounds good.

204
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,737
How about we go to your favorite place?

205
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,373
No, we can't.

206
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,754
Why not? It must be open by now.

207
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,879
Because I want to keep that place
to myself.

208
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,881
You have to be kidding.

209
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,843
Why? Is the chef handsome?

210
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,264
Is he my type?

211
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,513
Are you worried that our friendship
will be ruined because of him?

212
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,096
BROTHERS

213
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,731
Chef.

214
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,403
What's this? Are you closing up already?

215
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,156
It's not 4 a.m. yet.

216
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,987
There weren't many
customers tonight, so...

217
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,543
But I wanted to have just one more beer
before going home.

218
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,584
Just one beer.

219
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,142
It's good to be a regular.

220
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,984
You opened the bistro again just for me.

221
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,230
Of course, A-jin.
You're my VIP customer after all.

222
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,945
You know, I don't know what it is,
but whenever I come here, I perk up.

223
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,832
And I love talking with you.

224
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,292
-Me, too.
-Really?

225
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,966
It must be pretty stressful
and exhausting to work at the company,

226
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,971
but you always stay cheerful and positive.
I like that about you.

227
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,393
Thank you for saying that.

228
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,689
Cheers.

229
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,699
By the way,
how did you become a regular here?

230
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,987
-Didn't I tell you?
-No.

231
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,158
I think you were quite drunk that day.

232
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,877
No, I wasn't drunk that day.
Not that day at least.

233
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,129
That day...

234
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,058
You're not walking me home
right now, are you?

235
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,098
No, I'm not.

236
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,726
-Right?
-Right.

237
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,173
-Good night, then.
-Good night.

238
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,590
Do you live here?

239
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,681
Which floor?

240
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,849
What about you?

241
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,638
How come we haven't
run into each other once then?

242
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,267
When you live right upstairs?

243
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,693
Tell me about it.

244
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,403
-What a coincidence.
-What a coincidence.

245
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,161
I'll see you around then.

246
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,327
I'll see you around.

247
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,120
Since we're neighbors, I should give you
more free food from now on.

248
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,671
Great!

249
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,003
-Go on in then.
-Welcome.

250
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,764
-What a small world.
-What a coincidence.

251
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,480
How crazy.

252
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,237
So crazy.

253
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,925
What's wrong with this?

254
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,640
What's happening?

255
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,599
Hi, Dad.

256
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,273
Yes.

257
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,560
Park Hyeong-su is my father.

258
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,813
Who am I speaking to?

259
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,884
<i>He had a subdural hematoma,
so we proceeded with emergency surgery.</i>

260
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,712
<i>Fortunately, we stopped the bleeding</i>

261
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,048
<i>and haven't found
any more bleeding so far.</i>

262
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,162
That's mine.

263
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,576
<i>He didn't get car insurance?</i>

264
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,667
<i>He only has liability insurance?
What's that?</i>

265
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,549
<i>Are you saying he won't get
any compensation?</i>

266
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,229
PARK JIN-SEONG'S SAVINGS ACCOUNT
442,019 WON

267
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,424
IN-DEOK

268
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,910
Chef.

269
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,924
We look forward to tonight's food, Chef.

270
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,884
-Hello.
-Are you here to take out a loan?

271
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,264
Well, I...

272
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,302
I came to check the maximum loan amount
I can borrow.

273
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,676
I see. Then could you give me your ID?

274
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,814
Okay.

275
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,059
-Here.
-Thanks.

276
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,569
I can see you already have a student loan.

277
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,738
You need collateral then.
How about the contract for your bistro?

278
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,203
But it wasn't signed in my name.

279
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,407
Then...

280
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,538
how about your house? Do you own it?
Or is it borrowed on key money?

281
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,672
It's a rental.

282
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,547
Then how much is the deposit?

283
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,802
It's five million won.

284
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:50,637
But I've been mainly using this bank
for years now.

285
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,597
What if you take the transaction records
into consideration?

286
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,317
About how much do you need to borrow?

287
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,439
Well...

288
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,029
How much is the maximum I can borrow?

289
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,052
The amount you can borrow...

290
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,335
is zero.

291
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,690
In-deok, why didn't you
call me back earlier?

292
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,032
<i>Where are you? You're not at the bistro.</i>

293
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,358
You're at the bistro?

294
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,826
In-deok.

295
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,495
Hi.

296
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,293
I couldn't reach you for days.
Where have you been?

297
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,088
Why don't you sit down first?

298
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,094
By the way, what's all that?

299
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,143
I'm closing up shop.

300
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,768
What are you talking about? Why?

301
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,811
It just happened.

302
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,660
But you haven't said
anything about closing until now.

303
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,199
How could you tell me something
so important the day of?

304
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,537
-I'm sorry.
-In-deok.

305
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,668
Why are you doing this?

306
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,840
I really need this bistro.

307
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,263
My dad had a car accident,
and had to have emergency surgery.

308
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,591
What? Is he okay?

309
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,638
The surgery went well, but...

310
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,138
In-deok,

311
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,897
can you please reconsider this?

312
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,110
What else can a poor guy like me do
without this?

313
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,985
You know that
all I know how to do is cook.

314
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,152
Jin-seong,

315
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,279
I'm so sorry.

316
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,832
I know better than anyone
that you're having a hard time.

317
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,080
I know that.

318
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,291
But would I do this
if things weren't that bad?

319
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,505
UNSECURED LOAN
INSTANT CASH LOAN

320
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,818
Hey, get this.

321
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,284
It's so good.

322
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,281
-Thank you.
-Eat more.

323
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,493
-How about a game?
-Sure.

324
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,123
Let me start.

325
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,416
I think you guys have filled your bellies.

326
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,456
So why don't we talk
about something productive?

327
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,168
How could you possibly swallow meat now?

328
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,264
Seriously?

329
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,104
The proposals you guys submitted...

330
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,810
I was afraid someone might read them.
I actually turned red.

331
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,931
I put them in the shredder

332
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,597
so they'd never see
the light of day again.

333
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,733
That's how bad they were.

334
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,691
Kim A-jin.

335
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,398
Yes, ma'am?

336
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,412
<i>A Gay Chef's Sweet Munchies,</i> right?

337
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,834
Do you know how many cooking shows
there are on other channels?

338
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,501
-Eight.
-There are eight.

339
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,384
There are already more than enough.

340
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,014
But you want to do a cooking show, too?

341
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,470
Did you not consider
how the viewers might feel?

342
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,890
But it's not just
an ordinary cooking show.

343
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,563
A gay chef will counsel people and...

344
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,482
What?

345
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,307
You think if a gay man
appears on the show,

346
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,017
it'll make the show provocative
and get us high ratings?

347
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:59,121
Then have you thought about
how it might affect the viewers?

348
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,196
This is not a topic
to be handled carelessly.

349
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,752
If we come at this thoughtlessly,
we'll end up criticized by everyone.

350
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,247
Understand?

351
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,301
Yes, here.

352
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,591
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm late because of a meeting.

353
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,546
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

354
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,888
As always, only a seat across
from our director is left empty.

355
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,862
-Next, No Jae-su.
-Sorry? Yes, ma'am.

356
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,938
What's so provocative about it?

357
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,025
And are we supposed
to pretend queer people don't exist

358
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,155
because we're afraid
we might be criticized?

359
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,868
What?

360
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,207
A-jin, what are you doing?

361
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,213
I'd been thinking about that proposal
for a long time before I turned it in.

362
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,087
I didn't write it thoughtlessly.

363
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,589
So?

364
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,682
People think just because

365
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:11,188
they don't know someone, then they must
be completely different from them.

366
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,980
And people become afraid
and uncomfortable of what they don't know.

367
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,780
I want to let people know
that the way queer people live

368
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,491
and the emotions they feel

369
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,530
are the same as ours.
That they're not different from us.

370
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,201
Four million won?

371
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,791
Can't I borrow more?

372
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,537
No one lends money like this
without collateral.

373
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,832
How much is the interest?

374
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,681
It's 47 percent?

375
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,885
Please give me a chance.

376
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,729
If you give me a chance,
I'm confident I'll do a great job.

377
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,612
Oh, my. We CKTV didn't recognize
a future star producer here.

378
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,082
On top of it, we haven't promoted you
to a regular employee.

379
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,078
All right.

380
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,594
I'll give you a chance.

381
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,922
Do you mean it?

382
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,223
But

383
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,602
you only have one day.

384
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,734
So bring me a gay chef
that I'll like in 24 hours.

385
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,230
But how am I supposed
to find him in a day?

386
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,395
If someone can't make their appearance
on a live show due to an accident,

387
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,105
then will you cancel the show
saying you don't have enough time

388
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,566
to find someone else?

389
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,123
A good producer always manages
to find someone in time.

390
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,785
What's wrong?
Now that you're given a chance,

391
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,332
you don't think you can do it?

392
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,206
No, I can do it, ma'am.

393
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,835
You can? That's great.

394
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,796
So what happens then,

395
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,468
if you fail?

396
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,931
Pardon?

397
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,016
If you fail to bring someone I like,

398
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,190
not only will you lose your show,

399
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,859
but your desk will be removed from CKTV,

400
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,911
meaning you'll be gone.

401
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,667
Okay.

402
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,512
I understand.

403
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,047
All right, then.

404
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,023
What have I done?

405
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,410
Producer Kim A-jin.

406
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,080
I didn't know you had it in you.

407
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,291
You ran your mouth really well
in front of the director.

408
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,091
Is it because you're a contract worker?

409
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,800
Is it because you won't see her
for long anyway?

410
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,007
Mr. Nam.

411
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,215
-We're going to another place.
-Okay, I'm coming.

412
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,885
Hey. Please.

413
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,638
You can't act up like that
whenever you want.

414
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,685
Can't you see you totally ruined
our company dinner?

415
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,274
For God's sake...

416
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,993
Don't you have any manners? Is that it?

417
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,033
Let's go. God...

418
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,134
-Good night.
-Good night.

419
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,634
-Bye.
-Why did you drink so much?

420
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,085
Hey, you...

421
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,505
-You--
-Wake up.

422
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,843
-Good night, sir.
-Sure.

423
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,048
-Are you leaving?
-Come on.

424
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,347
Good night.

425
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,599
Everyone's left.

426
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,023
I'll drink with you then.

427
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,809
Forget it.

428
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,815
Hey, are you patronizing me because
you have the corporate credit card?

429
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,359
God, I'm so sick of hearing that.

430
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,743
Hey, let's have one more drink.

431
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,406
Come on.

432
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,124
You're really eating well.

433
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,792
Are you not full?

434
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,040
Try living by yourself.

435
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,916
Right, you practically live by yourself.

436
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,011
Anyway, why did you give A-jin the chance?

437
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,471
Were you persuaded by her logic?

438
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,801
As you know,

439
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,095
M Channel is already airing
an American reality show.

440
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,891
Right.

441
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,523
But a lot of people hate it.

442
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,807
The viewer ratings are quite high.

443
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,273
People love to watch shows
while criticizing them.

444
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,613
Gosh, your position is quite scary.

445
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,401
Just as I thought,
viewer ratings come first.

446
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,244
By the way,
if you decided to give her a chance,

447
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,911
you should've given her enough time.

448
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,830
Why did you give her so little time?

449
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,660
Because I wanted to.

450
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,004
Right. You can do whatever you want.

451
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,996
Did you read my proposal?

452
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,632
All of the proposals including yours
were really lame.

453
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,750
Come on. Be supportive and help me out.

454
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,878
Why do you always say that?
Help yourself out.

455
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,088
Hey. Come on.

456
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,051
Jin-seong.

457
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,432
Dad.

458
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,269
Are you okay?

459
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,480
Here...

460
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,811
Isn't this room expensive?

461
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:56,438
Dad, you almost died in a car accident.

462
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,237
But you're worrying
about the hospital bill?

463
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,697
My insurance probably doesn't cover this.

464
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,532
Exactly. Why did you...

465
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,365
No.

466
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,035
It's not expensive.

467
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,298
So don't you worry about a thing.

468
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,800
Just focus on your recovery.

469
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,342
But you have no money.

470
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,603
If you're that worried,

471
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,720
hurry up and get better.

472
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,533
I'm sorry.

473
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,661
What's there to be sorry about?

474
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
You knew how hot-tempered she is.

475
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,207
Why did you have to talk back to her
like that?

476
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,255
What? Was I supposed to just give in then?

477
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,679
"You're right. I'm so sorry
for coming up with such a ridiculous idea"

478
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,719
"and submitting that proposal."

479
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,313
"I'm such a good-for-nothing."

480
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,020
Like that?

481
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,021
You're so reckless.

482
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,807
I can do this.

483
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,613
I mean, 24 hours is more than enough.

484
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,819
You're crazy.

485
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,111
Seong-eun,
where should we start searching first?

486
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,156
It won't be easy to find
a gay chef who's out.

487
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,108
Darn it.

488
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,448
And they actually have to be good
at cooking, too.

489
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,623
Right?

490
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,947
You're the one who made this mess.
Why do I have to suffer, too?

491
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,785
Come on. Just help me, please?

492
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:38,304
If you think about it,
yes, I will be fired if I fail,

493
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,169
but if I make it,

494
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,545
it'll be a golden opportunity
to become a main producer.

495
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,006
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

496
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,757
-My goodness.
-Let's do this.

497
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,677
You're so scary.

498
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,351
I'm so relieved that you're with me.

499
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,556
And you make me so exhausted.

500
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,318
I love you.

501
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,300
What?

502
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,224
What's this?

503
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,759
Who changed the lock?

504
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,731
IN-DEOK

505
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,766
-The wine's good, right?
-Amazing.

506
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,020
-Here. It's ready.
-This looks delicious.

507
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,193
-Try it.
-Okay.

508
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,195
As I expected.

509
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:13,368
You were really born to cook.

510
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,580
This is so good.

511
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,831
I'm sure this bistro will be a big hit.

512
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,623
Thank you.

513
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,841
If this bistro becomes a success,
it'll be all thanks to you.

514
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,625
I'll never forget what you've done for me.

515
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,682
Just don't forget to pay
the electricity bill, you brat.

516
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,218
And buy me drinks often.

517
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,431
Come on.
You can always drink for free here.

518
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,100
What else do you want to try?

519
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,771
Let's see. This time...
Hey, do you have any noodles?

520
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,440
Okay. Noodles will be served.

521
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,408

533
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,723
Chef?

534
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,764
Chef?

535
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,559
Where are you, Chef?

536
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,771
I need to talk to you.

537
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,517
LOTTERY
500 MILLION WON

538
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,537
Chef.

539
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,502
Why are you here, not at the bistro?

540
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,828
Hi.

541
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,458
I went to the bistro just now,
but it was closed.

542
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,255
Why aren't you eating anything
with your soju?

543
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,668
I'm sorry,

544
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,049
but could you leave me alone?

545
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,019
Oh... Sure.

546
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,332
Chef, I know you're
in a bad mood right now,

547
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,582
but I need to ask you something urgently.

548
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,036
By any chance, do you know

549
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,296
any gay chefs?

550
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,008
What?

551
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:22,603
I mean, I'm planning
a new TV show right now.

552
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,221
If you take a look at this...

553
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,104
Take a look.
On the show, a gay chef cooks and--

554
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,767
Let's talk later. Now, I'm...

555
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,937
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry now.

556
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,935
If you know anyone,
could you introduce him to me?

557
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,697
I can offer an exceptional appearance fee.

558
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,702
Will you offer 10 million or something?

559
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,535
Well, yes. It depends on who it is.

560
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,956
What does the chef have to do?

561
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,760
All he has to do is cook.

562
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,219
-Cook?
-Yes.

563
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,596
All he has to do is cook on the show.

564
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,103
The script will be provided.
It's not that hard.

565
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,444
Chef, I only have one day to find a chef.

566
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,484
Can't you introduce anyone?

567
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,938
Please?

568
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,445
<i>A GAY CHEF'S SWEET MUNCHIES</i>
PROPOSAL

569
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,406
SHOW PROPOSAL

570
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,452
No...

571
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,992
No one's come yet.

572
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,868
Not even one?

573
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,003
Yes, I'm on my way to the Rainbow Group.

574
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,804
I'll see if they can recommend any chefs.

575
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,088
Okay. I'll drop by some other places
and be there.

576
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,302
All right. Bye.

577
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,056
-Take your time and look around.
-Okay.

578
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,232
What do you think? You like it?

579
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,231
It looks nice.

580
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,731
-It's well-maintained, isn't it?
-Yes.

581
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,232
Who are you?

582
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,572
Is this bistro for sale?

583
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,235
Yes.

584
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,783
But may I ask who you are?

585
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,954
I'm a regular here.

586
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,286
This place is full
of cockroaches and rats.

587
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,705
You should never buy this place.
It'll be your loss.

588
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,134
Who the hell are you?

589
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,299
Who are you to talk such nonsense?

590
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,181
Are you the owner of this building?

591
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,062
Yes, I am. I asked who you are.

592
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,733
Grandma, please save me.

593
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,149
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

594
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,486
Get up now.

595
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,701
I've been working here for In-deok.

596
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,908
You can't sell this place to other people.

597
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,202
I made this bistro from scratch.

598
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,997
It's like my other self.

599
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,583
If you give me time,

600
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,456
I'll come up with the deposit at any cost.

601
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,340
Please.

602
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,768
About 15 people must've come
to the audition, right?

603
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,024
Right?

604
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,571
Wait.

605
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,526
Don't tell me no one's come yet.

606
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,615
Ms. Kim, I've been thinking about it.

607
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,790
How about I clear your desk in advance

608
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,374
for you?

609
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,088
Keep it up, then.

610
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,934
It's cold in here. Gosh.

611
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,715
It's cold.

612
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:30,893
Seriously...

613
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,016
This won't do.
I should go out to find someone.

614
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,141
But where will you go?

615
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,727
Then what do we do?
We should do something.

616
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,857
Excuse me.

617
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,856
I'm here for the audition.

618
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,533
-That's us.
-That's us.

619
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,735
This way.

620
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,866
Okay. This way, please.

621
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,382
Ms. Cha.

622
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,430
-What's the reason you're saying no?
-What do you think you're doing?

623
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:59,733
I knew you were never going to give me
a chance, but this is just not right.

624
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,099
You think I have so much free time

625
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,861
that I would do something like this
just to screw you over?

626
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,404
Then why didn't you approve of him?

627
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,194
He's not that bad.

628
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,607
You want me to tell you why?

629
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,987
His hands are too chubby.

630
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,201
Pardon?

631
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,370
You haven't thought about how close-ups
of a chef's hands will look, have you?

632
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,076
Isn't the gay chef supposed
to win women's hearts?

633
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,957
Are you going to use a hand double?

634
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,958
Now, stop blocking the door.

635
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:47,688
Why don't you just beg me
to give you one more day instead?

636
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,284
Ms. Cha, please give me one more day.

637
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,913
But, of course, if you do that,

638
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:59,239
it'll be like admitting to yourself
that you lack the capacity to cast,

639
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,327
and that you are unreliable.
Both are important to be a good producer.

640
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,789
What I meant was...

641
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,416
that I don't need more time.

642
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,179
You have four hours left.

643
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,068
Are you all right?

644
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,661
Yes.

645
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,267
Hey, Seong-eun.

646
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,454
Chef?

647
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,779
What?

648
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,133
<i>From now on,</i>

649
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,674
<i>I'm someone else.</i>

650
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,793
<i>I must completely hide myself.</i>

651
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,681
<i>How hard could it be?</i>

652
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,638
<i>Let's do this just this once.</i>

653
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,179
<i>This is the only way I can survive.</i>

654
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,501
<i>From this moment on,</i>

655
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,589
<i>I am a gay chef.</i>

656
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,276
<i>His looks and cooking skills...</i>

657
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,656
<i>Isn't he the chef we were looking for,
Producer Kim?</i>

658
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:35,713
I really want to do <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
with him.

659
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,578
<i>Do what you wanted to do on the show.</i>

660
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,995
<i>There's a fine line
between fashion and costume.</i>

661
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,004
<i>It means if you go overboard,
you'll look ridiculous.</i>

662
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,376
Are you saying I look ridiculous now?

663
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,383
<i>-Is he famous?
-He's super popular right now.</i>

664
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,335
Right, that rude punk.

665
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,755
<i>I'll go meet him.</i>

666
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,683
Could you help me this once?

667
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:54,771
<i>May I ask why a gay chef of all things?</i>

668
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,849
Let's do <i>Sweet Munchies</i> together.

669
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,984
<i>I'll try my best to make this
a great show.</i>
