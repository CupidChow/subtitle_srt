1
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,650
You really...

2
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,025
think I can meet someone

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,620
I love?

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,080
You know, only the brave win love.

5
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,872
Welcome. Did you come alone?

6
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,712
More will join me soon.

7
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,545
Okay.

8
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,385
Thanks.

9
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,351
It's your first time here, right?

10
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,265
Yes.

11
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,941
Let me know what you'd like to drink,

12
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,902
and I'll make you something accordingly.

13
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,283
Oh, I see.

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,903
Take your time.

15
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,026
Okay.

16
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,875
Hello, Chef.

17
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,086
What? Mr. Kang?

18
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,760
You came too, Ms. Cha.

19
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,255
Yes.

20
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,271
What is this?

21
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,849
What are you doing here?

22
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,517
I heard you two would have a drink here.

23
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,477
Oh, right. He's one of my work superiors.

24
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,606
That's right.
I'm Lee Sang-yeong, a producer at CKTV.

25
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,656
Hello.

26
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,739
Hi.

27
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,866
Hello.

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,791
You're everywhere. How did you know?

29
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,617
I have ears everywhere.

30
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,962
Aren't you tired?

31
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,304
No.

32
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,368
Ms. Yoo.

33
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,617
Do you have a boyfriend?

34
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,091
Why don't you guess?

35
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,176
I guess you don't have...

36
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,814
I think you have one.

37
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,528
No, I don't.

38
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,771
We're the same.

39
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,431
I don't have a girlfriend.

40
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,070
That's what I thought.

41
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,910
Here's to hoping that these three people

42
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,584
will continue to be on good terms
even after the show ends.

43
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,955
-Let's toast to that.
-Sure. Here.

44
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,133
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

45
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,302
Cheers.

46
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:25,933
This is so refreshing.

47
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,644
I'm sure we'll get along really well
all the way to the end.

48
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,062
Right, guys?

49
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,271
Right?

50
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,902
You know, they say your friend hurts you
more than your enemy.

51
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,151
What's there to hurt
if you never consider them your friend?

52
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,485
That way you can just ignore it.

53
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,989
Wait, Ms. Cha.

54
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,198
This guy here didn't hesitate
to take a paint bomb for me,

55
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:53,253
and this guy here readily took off
his jacket and offered it to me.

56
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,370
-Really?
-It's true.

57
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,036
A-jin, I get that you guys
are quite close,

58
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,246
but this isn't like
some social gathering, right?

59
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,513
You know how much money, how much passion

60
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,679
and how many people it takes
to make a TV show, right?

61
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,219
You should always keep some distance
from each other,

62
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,143
so there can be synergy.

63
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,642
-And--
-Keep it in mind.

64
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,063
It's precious advice
from her own experience.

65
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,023
-Okay.
-Sang-yeong, you...

66
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,693
What? I didn't make up anything, did I?

67
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,978
You know, our director here was known

68
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,567
for her competence
even when she was my associate producer.

69
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,945
Well, she's quite cold and harsh now,
but she was kind-hearted back then.

70
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,414
So she became attached
to her colleagues easily.

71
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,116
Whenever they asked to switch schedules,
she did.

72
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,587
Whenever they asked for her help,
she was there.

73
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,298
She kept giving and giving.

74
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,088
But for what? When their shows ended,
they just turned their backs.

75
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,301
Then she would come to me and cry saying,

76
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,045
"How could they be so cold-hearted?"

77
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,808
She'd throw such a fit.

78
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,270
Our director used to be hurt
by her friends easily.

79
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,113
All right. Your food is ready.

80
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,519
Everyone, have a bowl.

81
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,897
-You first.
-Okay. Thank you.

82
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,154
-It's so pretty.
-Tuna sashimi, sea urchin roe,

83
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,817
pickled ginger, and avocado.

84
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,736
It's a combination
that can never go wrong.

85
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,787
Enjoy the food and cheer up, everyone.

86
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,672
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

87
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,539
-It looks good.
-It looks really good.

88
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,306
It's so good.

89
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,368
Excuse me. Could you turn the car around?

90
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,660
No, that can't be.

91
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,449
What am I thinking?

92
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,464
Hey...

93
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,509
Why did you come back?

94
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,733
What's the matter?

95
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,106
Did you leave something?

96
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,493
Why did you come back, Mr. Kang?

97
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,665
You said I should do

98
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,786
what I like when I'm having a hard time.

99
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,256
And you asked

100
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,433
if I didn't know what I liked.

101
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,892
I'm...

102
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,692
going to stop ignoring...

103
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,565
what I really like.

104
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,368
What is it

105
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,408
that you like?

106
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,444
About <i>Sweet Munchies...</i>

107
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,475
I'll do it.

108
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,492
Thank you, Jin-seong.

109
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,632
Come on, A-jin. What are you thinking?

110
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,886
What I like...

111
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,318
Want to have a drink?

112
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,991
Now?

113
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,037
Yes.

114
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,667
But I need to go to the morning market.

115
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,630
Let's go together.

116
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,052
-Together?
-Yes.

117
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,510
Hey, when are you going to sleep?

118
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,192
All right. Wait a minute here.
I'll go get changed.

119
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,196
Good morning.

120
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,278
Are you really okay?

121
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,445
Yes, I'm okay.

122
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,913
Really?

123
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,203
It's your first time here, right?

124
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,908
Yes. This place is
much nicer than I thought.

125
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,957
Right? There's a lot to see here.

126
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,840
The <i>jokbal</i> looks really delicious.

127
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,386
Ma'am, these are rice balls I made.

128
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,848
-Oh, my.
-They're for you.

129
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,938
-Thank you. Hold on.
-Sure.

130
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,154
-Take these, too.
-Come on. You're too generous.

131
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,485
You know, this is what's fun
about coming to the market.

132
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,781
Aren't you tired?

133
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,704
No.

134
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,284
Not at all.

135
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,037
-Here you go.
-How much is it?

136
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,498
-It's 2,000 won.
-2,000?

137
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,408
Yes. It's cheap, right?

138
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,037
Maybe I should buy more.

139
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,711
-Thank you.
-Sure.

140
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,750
Your noodles look more delicious.

141
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,297
-Enjoy.
-You, too.

142
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,940
I'm glad we came to eat.

143
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,477
-God, it's so hot.
-It's hot?

144
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
Come on, man.

145
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,785
I'm okay. Just go home.

146
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,786
I want to do this.

147
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,121
I don't understand you.

148
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,706
You have something to tell me, don't you?

149
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,215
Jin-seong.

150
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,389
What is it?

151
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,434
Jin-seong.

152
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,056
What are you two doing here at this hour?

153
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,443
What is this?

154
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,653
Did you go to the market together?

155
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,194
Yes.

156
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,147
What about you? Are you going to exercise?

157
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,817
What? Well... Why don't we go
to eat <i>tteokbokki</i> together?

158
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,038
-Now? But I'm full.
-Sure, let's go.

159
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,914
Hey, you just had noodles.

160
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,077
Aren't you full?

161
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,457
Then why don't you and I go?

162
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,509
-Let's go.
-Okay.

163
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,129
-See you.
-Okay.

164
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,625
-See you.
-See you.

165
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,466
See you later.

166
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,477
Hey.

167
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,773
My goodness.

168
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,979
It's like a pigsty in here.

169
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,744
I was going to clean.

170
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,949
When I feel like it.

171
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,945
Sure, you will.

172
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,213
Do you need a tissue?

173
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,666
Sorry? No, it's okay.

174
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,940
Do you dip or pour your sauces?

175
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,687
Sorry?

176
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,149
Oh... I usually dip.

177
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,775
That's the same as me.

178
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,412
I see.

179
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,790
You should dip into the sauce
to feel the batter's crispy texture.

180
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,583
Always dip.

181
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,050
I'm...

182
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,799
going to stop ignoring...

183
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,720
what I really like.

184
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,316
No, it'll get ruined, too.

185
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,650
It's okay. Just put it on.

186
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,534
I'll get in first.

187
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,085
Then why don't you and I go?

188
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,169
Sorry?

189
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,429
-Let's go.
-Okay.

190
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,258
No way.

191
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,635
But it's so odd.

192
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,555
What's going on?

193
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,110
A-JIN

194
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,284
<i>Is it good?</i>

195
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,122
<i>Get a takeaway for me.</i>

196
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,917
<i>What are you doing?</i>

197
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,456
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

198
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,502
<i>How can you eat</i> tteokbokki <i>now?</i>

199
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,926
What should I text her?

200
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:34,698
So did you go back to the bistro
after everyone left last night?

201
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,486
Yes. I wanted to go to the morning market.

202
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,333
Oh, I see. The morning market.

203
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,125
You may not know this.

204
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,802
I saw that Jin-seong packs rice balls

205
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,341
and gives them out
to the vendors at the market.

206
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,812
So the vendors love him
and give him extra vegetables.

207
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,524
The rice ball strategy

208
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,687
looked quite nice.

209
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,895
That's so cute, I'd probably give him
a lot of extras, too.

210
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,823
Right?

211
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,490
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

212
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,462
<i>Right after we finish eating.</i>

213
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,343
<i>Let's go together later.</i>

214
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>Wait a little longer.</i>

215
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,512
-Well... Sure.
-Excuse me.

216
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,929
It's coming.

217
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,392
Thank you.

218
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,146
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

219
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,111
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

220
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,406
-Oh, okay.
-Try it.

221
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,794
Dip it.

222
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,873
Okay.

223
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,455
Here.

224
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,340
What? Why are you out here already?

225
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,184
My gosh.

226
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,180
You told me to go with you.
How come you're so late?

227
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,812
My bad. I'm sorry.

228
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,270
Was the <i>tteokbokki</i> good?

229
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,191
What? Yes. We had some fried stuff,
fish cakes, <i>sundae,</i>

230
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,111
and dessert. Mr. Kang ate really well.

231
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,281
Maybe his stomach will explode.

232
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,317
I heard you pack rice balls
when you go to the market.

233
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,411
What? Did he tell you that?

234
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,910
What? Is it supposed to be a secret?

235
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,995
No, it's not. But...

236
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,004
What else did you talk about?

237
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,884
Well...

238
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,416
We asked each other
if we dip or pour the sauce.

239
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,048
So? What was your answer?

240
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,345
We're both dippers.

241
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,259
I'll go get changed.

242
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,266
We?

243
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,847
Jeez.

244
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,766
We?

245
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,356
-Chef Park's here.
-Finally.

246
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,654
-Hello.
-Hello.

247
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,777
-Hello.
-Welcome, Chef Park.

248
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,374
I really appreciate your great decision.

249
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,660
You can count on me.

250
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,043
It'll be much, much better than the pilot.

251
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,081
Sure.

252
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,421
Let's make the show

253
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,421
as well as we did the pilot, Ms. Kim.

254
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,048
We'll make it better than the pilot.

255
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,381
You can count on us.

256
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,717
All right.

257
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,886
This is the real beginning.

258
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,596
Let's get to work.

259
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,226
Okay, everyone. Let's go!

260
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,403
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

261
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,610
Let's go.

262
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,856
All right, then.
Let's start with the story selection.

263
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,913
Okay. You guys read the stories
that I sent you, right?

264
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,529
Which do you think is the best?

265
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,695
-Well...
-Well...

266
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:12,713
The story about a child
who saw their mom having an affair.

267
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,709
I think that's the best one.
The rest are not that impressive.

268
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,085
Okay. What about you, Ms. Kim?

269
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,893
For me, the best one is about
an aspiring actor who is torn

270
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,218
between his dream and the harsh reality.

271
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,224
I think many people will relate to it.

272
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,846
I agree. That one's great.

273
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,642
But isn't it a little too obvious?

274
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,904
I mean, it's not like Chef Park will
advise that reality should come first.

275
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,282
The story about a mom having an affair
is quite provocative,

276
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,320
so it'll help the show get higher ratings.

277
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,025
Then how about we have a show of hands?

278
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,737
Why don't we decide with a show of hands?

279
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,119
-Sure, okay.
-Okay.

280
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,746
Okay, let's do that.

281
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,418
Then I should participate, too, right?

282
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,213
-Of course.
-Yes.

283
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,586
All right, then...

284
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,593
Who agrees with Mr. Nam?

285
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,479
Then who agrees with Ms. Kim?

286
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,822
Then we're going with the story
that Ms. Kim selected, right?

287
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,824
Yes.

288
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,908
No.

289
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,794
Ms. Yoo, please write the script
with the story I selected.

290
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,382
Then why did we just have a show of hands?

291
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,337
Is there anyone here who is
more experienced in TV shows than me?

292
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,013
There isn't.

293
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:51,221
It means I know how to survive
in this field much more than any of you.

294
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,274
You guys can't beat me in that. Okay?

295
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,639
Please do as I said.

296
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,939
-You, too.
-Okay.

297
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,111
See you.

298
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,687
-God.
-Why did we have a meeting then?

299
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,534
-This is how it usually goes.
-Isn't he too dogmatic?

300
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,283
He's always like that. Always.

301
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,907
-He's such a jerk.
-I've already made peace with it.

302
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,453
Is that even possible?

303
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,906
Why does he always do whatever he wants?

304
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,125
You're going with this?

305
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:27,881
Yes. The story shows how torn
the child is, and it's quite provocative.

306
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,046
So I think it'll attract
viewers' attention well.

307
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,296
What do you think?

308
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,717
Give it a go. The story's not bad.

309
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,426
Right? I knew it.

310
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,976
I mean,

311
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,441
they wanted to do the story
about an aspiring actor

312
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,361
who's torn between choosing
his dream or reality.

313
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,570
But I pushed ahead with this myself.

314
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,197
-That sounds good, too.
-Pardon?

315
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,368
A story about an aspiring actor torn
between his dream and reality.

316
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,159
Young viewers will relate to it, too.

317
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,253
But isn't it better to talk
about something provocative?

318
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,659
Just do as I say.

319
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,167
I'm much more experienced than you.

320
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,594
My gut tells me the story
about the aspiring actor is better.

321
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,674
We're done here.

322
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:10,045
But... Ms. Cha, this is...

323
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,859
Please make the food and people
look great.

324
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,939
-Okay.
-Is everything set?

325
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:30,034
MEALS THAT HEAL YOUR FEELINGS
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

326
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,361
So it's your second time now, huh?

327
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,622
You're not nervous anymore.

328
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,778
Did you enjoy the <i>tteokbokki</i>?

329
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,576
Yes.

330
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,167
It looked like you carried
my groceries as an excuse

331
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,881
to eat <i>tteokbokki</i> with A-jin.

332
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,257
Chef Park.

333
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,379
You can do this!

334
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,303
Hi.

335
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,064
How does it feel to co-produce a show
with a great senior producer like me?

336
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,243
Please teach me a lot about production.

337
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,449
Teach you?

338
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,118
Why? It's not like
you're paying my salary.

339
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,123
All right. Let's start rolling.

340
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,713
-Okay.
-Okay.

341
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,158
Let's do this.

342
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,922
The clapperboard.

343
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,167
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

344
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,624
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

345
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,388
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

346
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,060
-Good job, everyone!
-Good job, everyone!

347
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,969
-Good job, everyone!
-Good job, everyone!

348
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,515
-Good work.
-Good work.

349
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,812
-Good work.
-But there's still room

350
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,606
for improvement in your cooking and lines.

351
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,227
Good job.

352
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,437
-Good work.
-Good work.

353
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,987
-See you.
-See you.

354
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,071
Good work.

355
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,775
Well, we can just make it better
with some editing.

356
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,576
All of you did a great job.
Why don't we go eat something?

357
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,870
What would you like?

358
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,213
I don't think I should go.

359
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,790
I write rubbish scripts,
so I don't deserve to eat.

360
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,754
Ms. Yoo.

361
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,009
Still. It was our first shoot
as a regular show.

362
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,090
I think I'll get sick
if I eat in this mood.

363
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,046
So I should go home and think about
what I should do to write better scripts.

364
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,428
All right, then. Let's go
without Seong-eun, then.

365
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,016
Go without me if you want.

366
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,476
Come on. How could we do that?

367
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,565
-Right?
-Right.

368
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,780
Let's eat together next time.

369
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,950
My cooking was terrible too, so...

370
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,908
-Let's do it next time then.
-Sure.

371
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,489
-Okay. Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

372
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,156
-Jae-su?
-Shall we go?

373
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,245
-Have a nice day.
-Good work, Mr. Nam.

374
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,500
-Sure.
-Aren't you leaving?

375
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,791
I need to lock up, so could you leave now?

376
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,166
Good work.

377
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,480
What?

378
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,809
On the left...

379
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,397
This denim shirt... It must be Jin-seong.
And on the right...

380
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,283
It must be Tae-wan.

381
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,240
These punks...

382
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,200
So they went to eat without me?
These little...

383
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,371
Darn it... I hope they all get sick.

384
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,580
They're so annoying.

385
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:15,958
What is this?

386
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:20,335
PARK JIN-SEONG IS NOT GAY

387
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,102
HE DATED MY GIRL FRIEND FOR A YEAR

388
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,851
SO HOW CAN HE BE GAY?

389
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,572
Oh, my God!

390
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,408
-Jeez...
-What are you doing here alone?

391
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,990
You know, the main producer's
always busiest.

392
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,621
Is that so? But the others are
having <i>agu-jjim</i> together.

393
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,002
<i>Agu-jjim</i>? That's not that good.

394
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,464
What are you talking about?
It's really good.

395
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:02,675
If you put bean sprouts, red sauce,
and white <i>agu</i> meat on the rice

396
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,929
and eat it all at once,
then it tastes so good.

397
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,182
I'm not hungry.

398
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:10,846
Really?

399
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,320
Maybe I should go up to the sky lounge
and order in some fried chicken.

400
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,939
Fried chicken sounds good.

401
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,186
Sang-yeong.

402
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,197
I know

403
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:31,159
I ended up sleeping in the same bed
as you because I was so drunk.

404
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,116
But don't think we've become close.

405
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,746
Really?

406
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,634
All right. I didn't say anything about it.

407
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,932
-But Gyu-jang.
-Yes?

408
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,310
Boneless, drumsticks, wings,
garlic chicken, and green onion chicken.

409
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,060
Which do you think is the best?

410
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,227
An order of half fried and half spicy
is the best, obviously.

411
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,023
Right? Half and half is the best, right?

412
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,187
That's right.

413
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,319
Half and half...

414
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,278
Where are you ordering from?

415
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,703
I do feel a little bad
for leaving out Mr. Nam.

416
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,622
All of us worked hard on the show.

417
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:15,076
What do you mean, worked hard?
You did everything.

418
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,424
What the hell did Mr. Nam do

419
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,040
other than go around bragging
how he's the main producer?

420
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,878
He always ruins a good mood.

421
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,973
I knew I didn't like the guy,
but I never knew he was such a jerk.

422
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,390
Don't you agree, Chef?

423
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,850
Why do you hate Mr. Nam so much?

424
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,727
First of all,

425
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,562
he never reads the scripts.

426
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,857
And yet, he complains so much.

427
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,357
And when someone threw a paint bomb
at you the other day,

428
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,909
he just stood by and watched.

429
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,544
-You, too!
-Well...

430
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,331
The mood is so down.
Why don't we make a toast?

431
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,206
Cheers, guys.

432
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,423
Cheers!

433
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,552
All right.

434
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:09,548
Everyone, this is to celebrate
<i>Sweet Munchies'</i> successful first shoot.

435
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:13,096
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

436
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,771
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

437
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,534
Excuse me.

438
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,532
I'm sorry, but could you give us
a big bowl, scissors,

439
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,945
and a little bit of sesame oil?

440
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,700
-What's that?
-What are you going to do with them?

441
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,247
-What for?
-It's nothing.

442
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,296
It's for all of us, right?

443
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,956
Could you give us one more bowl?

444
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,467
-I'm not sure if it'll taste good.
-I don't know.

445
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,259
-I'm really not sure.
-What will you do?

446
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,393
Oh, my.

447
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,219
-What are you doing?
-What?

448
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,354
My gosh.

449
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,854
-Wait. Me too.
-Can I try it?

450
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,774
-I'll try it.
-You go first.

451
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,852
Look. Mr. Kang made the same thing.

452
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,438
Stop eating and give it back.

453
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,359
-This looks really good.
-Is it good?

454
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,534
They should put this on the menu.

455
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,494
How is this so good?

456
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,164
This story is so detailed.

457
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,710
Right? It must be true, right?

458
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,670
I'm sure this person just made it up.

459
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,417
But their real name is on it.

460
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,416
They could've used someone else's ID.

461
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:34,138
Come on. I think you're trying too hard
to look on the bright side.

462
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,680
It might be true that Jin-seong lied.

463
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,394
Why would he do that?

464
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,809
-Because of money?
-Come on.

465
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,813
Who pretends to be gay for money?

466
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,019
And...

467
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,648
I know he likes men.

468
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,695
How do you know that?
Did you see something?

469
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,620
I caught him in the act.

470
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,576
Jin-seong

471
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,497
likes Tae-wan.

472
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,170
No way.

473
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,794
-For real?
-Of course.

474
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,956
I saw them holding hands
tightly like this.

475
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,434
Then Tae-wan's also gay?

476
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,838
No way. I don't think so.

477
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,057
It seemed like Jin-seong was telling him
he had a crush on him.

478
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,346
Anyway, Tae-wan was really flustered
when I walked in,

479
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,314
so he pulled his hand away super quick.

480
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,897
Hey, if Jin-seong weren't gay,
would something like that have happened?

481
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,903
Think about it. Would you be
able to hold a guy's hand like this?

482
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,197
What's wrong with you? That's so gross.

483
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,742
You little...

484
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,275
I hate it more than you do!

485
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,496
You order another one.
I'm eating all of this.

486
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,750
Come on. Don't be so petty.

487
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,502
Order another one. Here, eat this.

488
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,667
Did you have to throw it?

489
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,900
I'm so full.

490
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,824
I think I ate too much.

491
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,280
You're right. You ate like crazy.

492
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,576
My gosh.
I really shouldn't go home like this.

493
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,371
Maybe I'll go for a walk.

494
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,464
Are you asking me to go with you?

495
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,458
To be honest

496
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,260
I'm really full, too.

497
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,468
Really? Then why don't we go together?

498
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,513
Okay.

499
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,562
Right.

500
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,305
-Here. Thank you.
-Sure.

501
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,686
Welcome.

502
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,193
-You did a great job today. Good night.
-Okay.

503
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,645
Good night.

504
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,815
-See you.
-See you.

505
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,479
What are you doing?

506
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,058
-You should go home.
-All right.

507
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,813
-Go in already.
-Okay.

508
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,845
Now.

509
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,068
All right. I will go soon.

510
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,728
Okay, then. Good night.

511
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,817
Good night.

512
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,210
Hurry!

513
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,133
Hurry.

514
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,630
-Why?
-Come and look.

515
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,202
What is this?

516
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,869
To me,

517
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,953
it looks the same.

518
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,325
Isn't it always like this?

519
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,211
No, it isn't.

520
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,249
These clothes were on the table.

521
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,714
And these documents were up here.

522
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,051
And this towel was in the laundry basket.

523
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,844
No!

524
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,677
Look.

525
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,768
Why?

526
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,138
My laptop's gone.

527
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,646
There are no signs of forced entry,

528
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,820
so the thief probably entered
through the front door.

529
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,863
You should change the password
on the door lock first.

530
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,355
I see.

531
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,414
Nothing was stolen in the other units.

532
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,336
My goodness.
Why did they only break into mine?

533
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,464
You haven't been a victim of stalking

534
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,666
or received any strange calls lately,
have you?

535
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,012
No, I don't think so...

536
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:54,981
Don't worry.

537
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,021
We'll check CCTV footage
and catch the culprit as soon as possible.

538
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,225
Okay. Thank you.

539
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,726
All right, then.

540
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,921
If anything happens, call me.

541
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,963
I'll come right away.

542
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,375
Don't worry,

543
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,965
and go to bed.

544
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,767
Don't go.

545
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,174
Jin-seong, where are you?

546
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,803
I heard there was a burglar downstairs.

547
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,591
<i>Make sure to lock the door.</i>

548
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,680
When are you coming home?

549
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,431
<i>I'm spending the night at a friend's.</i>

550
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,024
Jin-seong.

551
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,854
Darn it.

552
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,917
If it's uncomfortable,
you can sleep on the bed with me.

553
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,118
It's okay.

554
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,379
I like sleeping on the floor.

555
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,234
But you know, the more I think about it,
the scarier it is.

556
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,845
The thief must've come in
by unlocking the front door

557
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,596
as if it were his house, right?

558
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,980
Yes.

559
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,067
You know
a few self-defense techniques, right?

560
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,317
No.

561
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,908
What?

562
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,617
Get up. I'll teach you some right now.

563
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,452
Right now? At this hour?

564
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,667
You think a thief will break in
at your convenience, so politely?

565
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,544
Get up now.

566
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,996
-First of all,
-Yes.

567
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,628
I'll teach you how to free yourself
from an attacker.

568
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,563
-Let's say you're waking in the street.
-Okay.

569
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,309
A stranger suddenly...

570
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,571
Well...

571
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,322
I'll teach you how to free yourself
if a stranger ever suddenly

572
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,656
holds you tight like that.

573
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,410
First, fold your hands like this.

574
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,626
No. Like this.

575
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,999
And then, raise your hands to chest level.

576
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,967
Then push him with all your strength.

577
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,218
-Got it?
-Push?

578
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,050
-Yes.
-Push where?

579
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,892
Here. Push here.

580
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,390
-There?
-Around the neck.

581
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,721
Okay. Give it a try.

582
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,466
-Okay.
-Try it. Let's say you're held.

583
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,728
I'm held.

584
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,483
"No." And then, raise your hands.

585
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,271
Hold on.

586
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,897
-Fold my hands.
-Fold them.

587
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,244
And raise them and push.

588
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,411
No, that's not it.
All you did was make a sound.

589
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,491
Okay.

590
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,201
Again.

591
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,866
That was good.

592
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,246
Let's try it for real.

593
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,383
Will this really work?

594
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,749
-All right.
-I'm nervous. Hold on.

595
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,964
-Don't be nervous.
-Okay.

596
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,256
-I'm holding you.
-I'm held.

597
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,880
-Now try it.
-Raise them...

598
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,176
Raise them...

599
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,259
Here.

600
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,809
Yes.

601
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,521
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-Sure.

602
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,391
-Yes, sure.
-Are you okay?

603
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,518
If you push him like that,

604
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,649
he'll fall backward.

605
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,975
Then with all your strength,

606
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,068
run away.

607
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,403
-Run?
-Yes.

608
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,028
Hey, you're pretty cool.
Where did you learn that?

609
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,249
Okay. Next technique.

610
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,663
What are you doing?

611
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,251
I thought you were asleep.

612
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:15,337
So, when did you realize
that you like men?

613
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,050
Forget it.

614
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,302
Come on. Tell me. When was it?

615
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,465
Why are you asking that?

616
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,306
Then...

617
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,017
how do you feel when you're alone
with a pretty girl in a small room?

618
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,518
I just think she's pretty.

619
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,948
And when I'm alone with an ugly girl,

620
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,871
I think,

621
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,251
"Oh, it's a girl."

622
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,788
You punk!

623
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,008
Then have you ever dated a girl?

624
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,351
Have you never?

625
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,428
Of course, I have.

626
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,385
You have?

627
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,856
Before I realized my orientation,

628
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,815
I tried to date a girl,

629
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:21,988
like everyone else.

630
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,909
I see.

631
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:41,973
Jin-seong.

632
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,852
If you were dating someone right now,
what would you do first?

633
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,162
Walk...

634
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:07,817
while holding hands.

635
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,584
Well...

636
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,464
Right.

637
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,916
People think it's strange if they see
two people of the same gender

638
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,592
holding hands in Korea.

639
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,967
What about you?

640
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,514
Me?

641
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,679
Well... I'd...

642
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,729
want to hear that person...

643
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,284
say he likes me.

644
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,621
You have...

645
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,325
a crush on someone, too?

646
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,003
"Too?"

647
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,789
You have a crush on someone?

648
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:59,042
What... I'm not crazy.
Why would I do such a thing?

649
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,718
What do you mean? Do you have to be crazy
to have a crush?

650
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,223
There's someone you like, isn't there?

651
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,430
Who is it?

652
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,308
Is it someone I know?

653
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,234
No, there's no one.

654
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,445
What kind...

655
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,491
of man do you like?

656
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,501
A person who's passionate
about what he does

657
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,165
and the more I get to know him,
the kinder I realize he is.

658
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,547
And you?

659
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,966
Why do you have so many questions today?

660
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,266
You asked me first.

661
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,314
Did I?

662
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,015
My goodness.

663
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,047
What?

664
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,875
Where'd she go?

665
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,643
Wait.

666
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,436
Why'd she make the bed
when the whole house is so messy?

667
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,242
<i>You don't seem nervous at all.</i>

668
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,737
<i>I was so nervous on my first shoot.</i>

669
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,452
<i>When did you decide
you wanted to become an actor?</i>

670
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,748
<i>When I was in high school.</i>

671
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,331
<i>-When you were in high school?
-Yes.</i>

672
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,048
<i>I decided to become a chef
when I was in high school, too.</i>

673
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,053
<i>Did you sleep well last night?</i>

674
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,008
<i>Yes, thanks to you.</i>

675
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,925
<i>Did you have breakfast?</i>

676
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,728
<i>I don't usually have breakfast.</i>

677
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,569
<i>What about you? Did you eat something?</i>

678
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,435
Oh, my gosh.

679
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,699
You scared me.

680
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,667
What? What's wrong?

681
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,088
No. It's nothing.

682
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,637
What about Ms. Yoo?

683
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,523
I don't know.

684
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,063
She must be writing scripts. Why?

685
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,193
I was just wondering
when the scripts would be done.

686
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,105
She didn't say anything, did she?

687
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,318
What?

688
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,409
What?

689
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,576
-What?
-What?

690
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,794
What's wrong with you?

691
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,086
IT WAS A MISTAKE. NO JAE-SU.
NO! HE'S TOO YOUNG.

692
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,046
NO, MAYBE NOT TOO YOUNG. KISS?

693
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,308
Yoo Seong-eun, you must've gone crazy.

694
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,984
You must be crazy.

695
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,265
I should quit drinking.

696
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,227
I should really quit drinking.

697
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,742
But was it really because I was drunk?

698
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:58,934
My God!

699
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,049
Oh, my God. What should I do?

700
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,046
How will I face him at the meeting?

701
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,468
What do I do?

702
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,110
I must've gone insane. I must have.

703
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,363
How could I do that?

704
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,043
Ms. Yoo!

705
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,956
Here!

706
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,971
This is crazy.

707
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,141
I should just go.

708
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,781
Seong-eun.

709
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,239
Where are you going?

710
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,359
I... I'm going...

711
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,616
What? Hey.

712
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,528
-Listen. Later--
-The scripts will be done soon.

713
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,868
Stop pressuring me.

714
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,623
Why are you ignoring my calls?

715
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,584
-It's not because of the scripts.
-What's going on?

716
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,463
Hey, Jin-seong.

717
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,257
Seeing you at the office,

718
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,141
you look like quite a successful producer.

719
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,812
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

720
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,354
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

721
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,234
-You look taller than usual today.
-What?

722
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,521
No, I've always been this tall.

723
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,154
-Really?
-Of course.

724
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,321
Stop it.

725
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,439
Jin-seong.

726
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,197
-Hey.
-Hold on.

727
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,458
There. Good.

728
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,296
Good morning.

729
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,629
You look stylish today, A-jin.

730
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,546
Really?

731
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,182
-Shall we go?
-Thanks. Okay.

732
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,350
You don't usually wear a scarf?

733
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,429
-"A-jin?"
-No, I've never tried it.

734
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,064
I think a scarf
would look really nice on you.

735
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,272
Was something wrong?

736
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,367
The title of the next episode will be,

737
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:35,293
"This love has an obvious ending.
Should I still dive in?"

738
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,583
What do you think?

739
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,836
I think the title is pretty catchy.

740
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,049
How do we know if it's any good
from the title alone?

741
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,260
A good title doesn't mean good content.

742
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:50,846
Oh, right. And there are cookware sets
among the sponsored items.

743
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,061
-About marketing the cookware sets--
-Wait.

744
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,981
I'm sorry, but I have to take this call.

745
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,770
Are you serious?

746
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,443
We're in a meeting, and a producer--

747
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,271
I'm sorry, but it's from the police.

748
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,856
-What?
-Hello?

749
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,531
Why would the police call her?

750
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,156
So what did they say about the cookware?
Is it nice?

751
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,540
Yes. The marketing team just wanted us
to check how much we needed.

752
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,910
That's all.

753
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,417
Check the number and--

754
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,039
I'm so sorry.

755
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,036
Why did the police call?

756
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,707
Well...

757
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,416
A burglar got into my house.

758
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,796
What?

759
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,092
What was stolen?

760
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,545
My laptop and some valuables.

761
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,757
Oh, my gosh.

762
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,560
Are you all right?

763
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,430
Yes, I'm okay.

764
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,137
Hey, A-jin.

765
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,845
You have no idea
what's important here, do you?

766
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,818
Is the burglar in your house
that important here?

767
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,526
Do you realize all of us are waiting
because of you?

768
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,162
Didn't you say you'd put everything
on the line for this show?

769
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,243
You've only recently become a producer,
but you're already slacking off?

770
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,196
All you think about is how
to have more fun,

771
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,536
not how to make the show better.

772
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,672
Mr. Nam, when did I behave like that?

773
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,460
Hey, are you looking down
on me and the viewers?

774
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,092
Isn't that why you do whatever you want?

775
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,382
Hey. What do you mean,
she does whatever she wants?

776
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,218
There was a burglar in her house.

777
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,433
So she just took a call from the police.

778
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,603
Why are you taking it out on her?

779
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,930
To be honest,

780
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,395
I think she's working much harder
than you.

781
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,191
What is this?

782
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,910
What did you tell Chef Park
to make him say that?

783
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,120
Did you brag that you did all the work?

784
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,450
You think she had to tell me that?

785
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,075
I have eyes, too.

786
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,962
You should open your eyes wider if you
don't want to falsely accuse someone.

787
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,670
Look who's talking!

788
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,960
Stop it, Jin-seong.

789
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,303
"Jin-seong?" My goodness.

790
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,629
A producer making friends
with the host of their own show?

791
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,045
You think this is
some kind of social club?

792
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,304
Sure. Why don't you just
make this a social club?

793
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,546
Doesn't that also mean...

794
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,311
that we have good teamwork?

795
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,557
I guess you don't want us
to have good teamwork.

796
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,616
And what's up with his shirt?
Is he going to the beach?

797
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,747
Seriously, what's that jerk's problem?

798
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,159
He's the one who ruined the meeting.

799
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,962
Are you okay?

800
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,168
Why did you interfere?

801
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,594
I could just put up with him for a while
and be done with it.

802
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,343
-But he was picking on you over nothing.
-God...

803
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,677
How am I supposed to make up with him now?

804
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,102
-Why would you make up with him?
-Don't do it.

805
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,561
You're saying that because
you don't know anything about him.

806
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,522
Darn it.

807
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,522
To be honest,
Gyu-jang got really lucky. Right?

808
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,725
He joined the show
that A-jin made by herself

809
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,935
and is trying
to take all the credit, I hear.

810
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,146
He can't be serious. Everyone knows
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> is A-jin's show.

811
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,528
Exactly.

812
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,262
My goodness...

813
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,968
Why didn't he go home?

814
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,909
What's the matter?

815
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:38,991
Be quiet.

816
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,445
I'm trying hard to remember.

817
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,007
Finally.

818
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,431
My muse has finally come.

819
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,931
Just wait and see.

820
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,847
Stop making a fuss.
Great boast, small roast.

821
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,690
-That's bad luck.
-Oh, my God!

822
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,361
Great boast, great roast.

823
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,398
Be ready. You'll be so full.

824
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,659
Jeez.

825
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,421
What are we eating today?

826
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,502
Why do you always ask about food
whenever you see me?

827
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,591
You're right.
I get hungry whenever I see you.

828
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,013
Gosh. Until the thief is caught,

829
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,892
I have no choice but to be in charge
of your late-night snacks.

830
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,220
Are you saying you don't like it?

831
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,926
-I didn't say that.
-You love cooking.

832
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,647
-But not if I have to do it every day.
-Why not?

833
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,907
<i>Well, she's quite cold and harsh now,</i>

834
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,618
<i>but she was kind-hearted back then.</i>

835
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,368
<i>So she became attached...</i>

836
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,414
Chef Park.

837
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,747
You can do this!

838
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,255
What do you mean,
she does whatever she wants?

839
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,684
There was a burglar in her house.

840
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,182
So she just took a call from the police.

841
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,064
Why are you taking it out on her?

842
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,565
Ta-da!

843
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,240
Today's late-night snack is kimchi <i>sujebi.</i>

844
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,962
I kneaded the dough an hour ago.

845
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,750
It's so elastic.

846
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,880
It's nice and elastic, right?

847
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,497
What?

848
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,622
Isn't that Kang Tae-wan?

849
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,543
What's he doing here?

850
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,647
You've got a great body.

851
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,815
-What do you think you're touching?
-What? Come here.

852
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,704
-No. Stop touching me.
-Why?

853
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,991
What?

854
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,914
-You're weird.
-Come on.

855
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,622
-Are you a pervert?
-I didn't look.

856
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,212
-Turn around.
-I just happened to see. I didn't look.

857
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:57,418
-You're staring wide-eyed.
-Just get changed already.

858
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,553
Who is it?

859
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,352
Mr. Kang?

860
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,473
Well...

861
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,347
What brought you here?

862
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,347
Well... I...

863
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,897
Why don't you come in?

864
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,859
Okay.

865
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,742
Here are some slippers.

866
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,212
Tae-wan.

867
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,706
Turns out we get along quite well.

868
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,461
"We?"

869
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,383
<i>Does he really have feelings for A-jin?</i>

870
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,762
Darn it.

871
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,718
Do you want me to set you up with a girl?

872
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:30,128
<i>Stop taking an interest in my love life.</i>

873
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,045
<i>The thief must only sneak into houses
where women live alone.</i>

874
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:38,309
<i>Thank you so much
for coming with me today.</i>

875
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,392
<i>I felt really safe.</i>

876
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,358
<i>What's the point in looking pretty
for Jin-seong?</i>

877
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,775
Excuse me. You're her, right?

878
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,528
<i>Does Jin-seong like women, too?</i>

879
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,610
<i>Do you have any idea what you've done?</i>

880
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,317
<i>You're scamming people.</i>

881
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,158
