1
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,767
But these days, I...

2
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,194
My heart is so confused.

3
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,244
I feel like I'm

4
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,867
losing my mind because of you.

5
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,790
What did I do?

6
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,923
You?

7
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,674
You did nothing wrong.

8
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,259
Before I realized it,

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,256
I was asking myself all these questions.

10
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,724
"What if...

11
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,020
he didn't like...

12
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,767
men?

13
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,284
If he didn't,

14
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,163
would he be attracted to me?

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,710
Maybe I wouldn't have to
be the only one...

16
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,959
who's so confused,
and alone with these feelings.

17
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,173
Maybe he'd be attracted--"

18
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,545
A-jin.

19
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,474
I know. I know I sound like an idiot.

20
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,388
But...

21
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,114
I should go.

22
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,484
What?

23
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,279
But...

24
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,553
This is crazy.

25
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,644
You forgot your bag.

26
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,682
You forgot your bag.

27
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,194
You forgot your bag.

28
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,648
What do I do?

29
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,269
Hello, Father.

30
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,155
I heard you told Yeong-ae
that you have feelings for someone else.

31
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,163
Who is it?

32
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,504
What?

33
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,165
Is she not good enough to introduce to me?

34
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,335
-That's not it.
-Then let me see her.

35
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,014
Introduce her to me, at least.

36
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,097
It's true

37
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,219
that there's someone I have feelings for,
but nothing more.

38
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,982
And I'm not going to tell them.

39
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,686
You're not even
in a relationship with her,

40
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,397
and you turned Yeong-ae down?

41
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,073
How pathetic...

42
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,990
Why are you being so impatient?

43
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,542
I'm not that old yet.

44
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,036
And now is the time to focus on my career.

45
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,081
Am I asking you too much?

46
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,964
Find a good match,
get married, and have kids.

47
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,964
-That's all I want--
-It's my life.

48
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,764
It should be someone I love.

49
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,603
I can't just find a good match for me
and start to love them.

50
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,440
You can't have feelings
for someone like that.

51
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,937
Why are you being so negative?

52
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,073
If you're willing to do it, you can do it.

53
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,440
-You haven't even tried--
-I have!

54
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,947
I've tried many times.

55
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,157
Tae-wan.

56
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,365
I want to love someone

57
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,288
you'd approve of, too.

58
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,085
But my heart refuses.

59
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,933
What do you expect me to do?

60
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,008
Is there really

61
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,596
someone...

62
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,773
you like?

63
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,868
God, I think I'm dying.

64
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,993
I'm so hungover.

65
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,219
IF GAY MAN KISSES A WOMAN

66
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,439
THEN HE CAN'T BE GAY

67
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,059
YOU SHOULD CHECK IF HE'S REALLY GAY

68
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,654
Wait.

69
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,436
Is it possible that Jin-seong's not gay?

70
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,710
Darn it!

71
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,014
What?

72
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,379
I have no <i>ramyeon</i> left?

73
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,930
This is just great.

74
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,191
Where's my bag?

75
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,986
Where the hell did I leave it?

76
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,039
My goodness.

77
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,415
For God's sake, A-jin!

78
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,560
What's this?

79
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,311
I'm such an idiot.

80
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,277
What are you doing here?

81
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,787
Shouldn't you be opening your bistro now?

82
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,457
You forgot your bag.

83
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,383
Right. Thanks.

84
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,013
Well...

85
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,431
All right, then.

86
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,968
Okay...

87
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,237
Wait.

88
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,371
Hey, by any chance...

89
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,695
I didn't do anything stupid, did I?

90
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,543
I mean, I must've been so drunk.

91
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,955
I don't remember anything.

92
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,553
Well, I remember going to your bistro.

93
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,803
But... See? I even left my bag there.

94
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,766
No, you didn't do anything stupid.

95
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,351
I see.

96
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,519
Okay. That's a relief.

97
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,358
-Good night.
-Okay, good night.

98
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,211
HI, I'M A BIG FAN. THANKS TO YOU,
I THINK I'M DISCOVERING MY TRUE SELF.

99
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,714
THANK YOU AND I LOVE YOU, JIN-SEONG

100
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,020
"Meeting Nam Gyu-jang,
the producer of <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

101
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,558
What made you produce the show?

102
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,732
Did you expect it'd be this successful?

103
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,231
Was there any episode
that happened because the host's gay?"

104
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,154
And so on and on.

105
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,732
Wait. There'll be a photoshoot?

106
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,857
A photoshoot...

107
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,824
If they'll take a picture of me...

108
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,735
Mr. Nam.

109
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,451
-Hello.
-Hi.

110
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,872
Hold on. Ms. Yoo, today we don't...

111
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,254
You're dying to come to work these days,
aren't you?

112
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,794
But we have no meeting today.

113
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,093
I'm here to have a meeting
for <i>Changing You.</i>

114
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,762
Right, I see.

115
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,760
I didn't know that,
so I thought there was another reason.

116
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,178
Excuse me.

117
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,135
Hi, Mr. Han. Yes.

118
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,846
Are you on the first floor now?

119
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,806
I see. I'll be right there.

120
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,403
Okay.

121
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,111
-Take care of the editing, okay?
-Okay.

122
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,533
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

123
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,161
-Why aren't you having the interview?
-What?

124
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,116
Well, there's no reason
that both of us should do it.

125
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,285
He insisted on doing it by himself,
didn't he?

126
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,093
Why do you always let him
take all the credit?

127
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,461
Why would you even ask that?

128
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,295
By the way, do you have
no feelings at all for Mr. Kang?

129
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,024
Then how about the other Mr. Kang?

130
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,063
-I can hook you up--
-Seong-eun.

131
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,476
I think

132
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,975
I broke myself free from the illusion.

133
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,278
You know. How I felt about Chef Park.

134
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,372
How?

135
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,365
I thought about it.

136
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,705
What I love the most.

137
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,748
And the answer was easy.

138
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,130
What is it that you love most?

139
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,916
My work.

140
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,139
I love it so much, it feels like there
aren't enough hours in the day for it.

141
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,060
So don't worry about me, okay?

142
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,063
And have a nice meeting.

143
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,726
What am I going to do with her?

144
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,980
Seeing how positive she's trying to be,
this must be pretty serious.

145
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,947
WE ROOT FOR YOUR BRIGHT TOMORROW
<i>LITTLE UMBRELLA GIRL</i>

146
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,067
Once the interview begins,
take as many pictures as you can.

147
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,408
Yes, sir.

148
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,048
I really loved that show back then.

149
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,473
We produced it.

150
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,338
I see.

151
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,005
I'm Lee Sang-yeong, a producer here.

152
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,556
I had a lot of interviews with <i>K Daily</i>
15 years ago.

153
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,980
I think it was in 1999 and 2003.

154
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,020
And the last one was in 2007.

155
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,813
I still have a lot of your magazines
at home.

156
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,778
Oh, that was before I joined.

157
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,778
Oh, was it?

158
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,242
I see.

159
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,991
I'm sorry, but we need
to have an interview now.

160
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,584
Oh, I see.

161
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,489
Wait. I'm actually really happy

162
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,077
to see that a show like <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
is attracting a lot of attention.

163
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,504
As a senior producer here, I'm very proud.

164
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,586
It means we've widened the conversation,

165
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,170
and viewers have become
more aware of a sensitive issue.

166
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,716
That's my opinion.

167
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,340
Is that so?

168
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,516
Mr. Han, I prepared the meeting room
just in case.

169
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,468
Why don't we go there?

170
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,597
-Sure.
-Okay, then.

171
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,064
-All right, then.
-See you next time.

172
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,103
Gyu-jang, good luck with the interview.

173
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,437
Thank you.

174
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,611
Should I have said,
"We'll definitely meet again"?

175
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,910
Well, I'm sure I'll meet him again anyway.

176
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,953
Gosh, this is so uncomfortable.

177
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,924
<i>Like last week,
many viewers sent their stories.</i>

178
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,091
<i>Congratulations on your story
having been selected.</i>

179
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:51,223
<i>Like always, I'll be cooking something
that I hope will heal your feelings.</i>

180
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,928
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

181
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:13,445
<i>And please stay tuned to see if I can help
find some kind of solution.</i>

182
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:23,043
Did you expect <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
to become this popular?

183
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,669
To tell you the truth, I...

184
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,594
expected it.

185
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,299
Why do you think it's so popular?

186
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,255
It's all thanks to Chef Park, of course.

187
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,845
It's his ability to soothe people's
wounded hearts through his sincerity.

188
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,813
I think he was born with it.

189
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,478
You're the main producer,
and you give all the credit to the host?

190
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,065
That's very humble of you.

191
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,783
In other words,
Chef Park must mean a lot to you, I guess.

192
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,244
You're right.

193
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,874
Please emphasize that in the article.

194
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,837
I have an acquaintance who was married,
had kids, and everything seemed fine.

195
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,216
It wasn't until quite a bit later
that he came out.

196
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,144
So people around him were really shocked.

197
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,603
What's Mr. Park Jin-seong's story?

198
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,944
Well... There's not much
to Chef Park's story

199
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,153
since he was never married or had kids.

200
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,526
So...

201
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,533
he's had a relationship with a woman?

202
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,326
Well, yes.

203
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,998
This side... Yes.

204
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,510
What brought you here at this hour?

205
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm going crazy with all these thoughts.
So I should just ask you.

206
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,306
-Ask me what?
-Why...

207
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,072
Why did you kiss me?

208
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,453
Did you feel bad for me
because I said I liked you?

209
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,027
-That's not it.
-Then why?

210
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,656
It's not like you're attracted to women.

211
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,003
Why on earth did you kiss me?

212
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,668
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,799
Sorry?

214
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,181
It didn't mean anything to you, did it?

215
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,266
I hate that I'm so confused because of
someone who can't even accept my feelings.

216
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,484
-What are you doing, A-jin?
-What?

217
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,686
A-jin?

218
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,624
The weather's so nice, so...

219
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,622
Maybe I should exercise a little.

220
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,919
Actually, I came up here to exercise,
you know.

221
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,785
Maybe I should wash my sheets, too.

222
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,673
You didn't go to work today?

223
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,593
I went. I was just dropping by.

224
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,554
Wait, A-jin.

225
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,466
Yes?

226
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,772
About <i>Changing You...</i>

227
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,228
Since the show's so popular,

228
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,439
a lot of models must be competing
to get on the show, right?

229
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,023
Well, I guess so.

230
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,477
Why? Are you going to apply for it?

231
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,357
No. I was just curious.

232
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,155
I see.

233
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,500
-You didn't go to work?
-I did.

234
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,755
And I'm going back now.

235
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,219
I'll get going then.

236
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,056
Did something happen with her?

237
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,978
No, nothing happened.

238
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,765
Are you sure nothing happened?

239
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,229
Yes, I'm sure.

240
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,026
-I'm going to my bistro.
-Wait...

241
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,735
Something definitely happened
between those two.

242
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,963
Let's just forget about it, A-jin.

243
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:35,001
Then it'll be like nothing happened.

244
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,751
Right?

245
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,506
A-jin.

246
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,855
You remember everything,

247
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,032
don't you?

248
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,785
About what happened last night...

249
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,216
I'm sorry.

250
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,388
I don't know

251
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,064
why I did that either.

252
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,436
And...

253
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,483
I'm really sorry

254
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,652
I didn't respond to

255
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,492
what you shared with me.

256
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,467
<i>Like last week,
many viewers sent their stories.</i>

257
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,354
<i>Congratulations on your story
having been selected.</i>

258
00:23:54,182 --> 00:24:00,692
<i>I hope that what I cook for you today will
help heal whatever you're going through.</i>

259
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,862
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

260
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:14,043
<i>I'm sure many of you must be curious
what kind of story was selected</i>

261
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,539
<i>-for this week.
-I feel like late-night snacking.</i>

262
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,421
<i>I'll cook today's dish quickly.</i>

263
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,500
CHEF JIN-SEONG

264
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,665
<i>Please stay tuned
to see if I'll be able...</i>

265
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,530
Among the stories you sent me,

266
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,286
-I think the second one's the best.
-I see.

267
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,908
-We should select it.
-I agree.

268
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,705
-Hi, Chef Park.
-Hello.

269
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,973
Hi, Chef Park.

270
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,377
Hi.

271
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,886
Have you been well?

272
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,400
Hi, Chef Park.

273
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:25,978
Chef Park?

274
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,066
By the way, I guess you two haven't seen
each other for a while.

275
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,084
I've been too busy
to go to the bistro often lately.

276
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,119
Gosh, that's a pity.

277
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,294
All right. Shall we begin
the meeting then?

278
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,377
-Sure.
-Sure.

279
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,679
Mr. Nam, I think we'll really end up
going on vacation abroad at this rate.

280
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,974
The director promised a bonus
if we get 10 percent,

281
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,563
and a trip abroad if we get 15 percent,
you know.

282
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,401
What's wrong?

283
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,832
-Isn't that Park Jin-seong?
-Oh, you're right.

284
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,700
-Hey, take a picture.
-I'll go to the bathroom.

285
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,787
-You guys go ahead.
-Okay.

286
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:23,922
Wait.

287
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,209
What are you doing here?

288
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,587
Why are you here?

289
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,391
I'm having an audition for <i>Changing You.</i>

290
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,888
Jin-u.

291
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,140
I know what you're worried about.

292
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,433
It's really hard to pass the audition,

293
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,688
and I'm not sure if I'll pass,
so I didn't tell you.

294
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,273
-I can't let you be on TV.
-Jin-seong.

295
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,112
This is a really big opportunity for me.

296
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,320
I want to know how capable I am.

297
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,324
Still, I can't let you be on a TV show.

298
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,276
-Why not?
-Do you really have to ask?

299
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,906
Why do I have to give up because of you?

300
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,906
This is my life,
and it's a good opportunity for me.

301
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,963
-Jin-u.
-I'll make sure no one finds out.

302
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,423
If people find out I lied,

303
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,665
you'll suffer from it too.

304
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,933
Suffering from that later
and suffering from giving up now,

305
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,141
they're the same to me.

306
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,221
I can't hide for the rest of my life
because of your lie.

307
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,016
I got to go now. I have an interview.

308
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,415
Hi, guys.

309
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,143
Hey, Chef Park.

310
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,064
-Hello.
-Hi.

311
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,692
Your bistro must be so busy
thanks to <i>Sweet Munchies</i>, right?

312
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,607
-Right.
-I'll come by one of these days

313
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,479
and order a ton to help you out, okay?

314
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,987
-Okay.
-Have a nice day.

315
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,779
-Let's go, <i>Sweet Munchies!</i>
-Thanks.

316
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,702
Keep up the good work!

317
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,122
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

318
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,710
What? Nobody picked it up?

319
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,512
Is it because only five numbers
are circled?

320
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,060
Then I should circle one more.

321
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,096
Why are people so scrupulous?

322
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,130
Hi, Jin-u.

323
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,673
I'm so glad to see you here.

324
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,798
Hello.

325
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,851
When I was reviewing the resumes,

326
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,928
I was so surprised to see
your application.

327
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,055
It's like you and your brother are
meant to be on TV.

328
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,812
Well... Anyway,

329
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,860
I don't want people to know

330
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,072
that Jin-seong and I are brothers.

331
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,405
Sure. I got it.

332
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,035
The show will never reveal the fact.

333
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,538
-Thank you.
-Jin-u.

334
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,881
I may be quite close to you and Chef Park,

335
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:58,458
but I draw a very distinct line
between work and personal life.

336
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,338
Of course.

337
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,633
Besides, I want to be recognized
for my own competence.

338
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,967
That's good.

339
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,234
-Hello.
-Hello.

340
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,018
All right, then.
Shall we begin the interview?

341
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,522
Sure.

342
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,483
Okay.

343
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,913
Let's see what's been filmed.

344
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,453
What? Chef Park was filmed?

345
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,419
But you didn't even call me beforehand.
What's the occasion?

346
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,264
You wouldn't answer my calls,
so I was worried.

347
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,506
You're not sick, are you?

348
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:31,603
No, I just have been quite busy with work.

349
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,564
You don't have a fever.

350
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,903
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-No, not yet.

351
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,147
You made it all by yourself?

352
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:45,899
Of course.

353
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,243
Dig in.

354
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,526
Thank you.

355
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,830
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

356
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,085
To tell you the truth,

357
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,472
I had a falling-out with my father
not too long ago.

358
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,967
Turns out it's not easy to go against
a parent once you're an adult.

359
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,311
I knew it. I'm glad I came to see you.

360
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,901
So?

361
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,030
-You want me to dance for you?
-No, thanks.

362
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,398
I'll just eat.

363
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,157
What's that look for?

364
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,367
You have something to tell me?

365
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,962
No, I don't.

366
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,798
Then what's that look on your face?
You look like a dog that needs to go.

367
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,426
Well...

368
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,240

369
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,954
What are you doing here
with all the lights off?

370
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,781
Hey. You haven't gotten off work yet?

371
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,326
No. I'm still doing the editing.

372
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,868
Okay. Keep it up.

00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,325
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,870
But there's not much to eat.
What do we do?

376
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,081
Should I go buy something?
Or should we order in something?

377
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,162
-No, this is enough.
-Are you sure?

378
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,172
Anyway, I think you're working too hard.

379
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,756
But it's fun.

380
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,678
-Is it fun?
-Yes.

381

I don't know.

389
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:53,092
It's very hard to describe it
with words, but...

390
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,925
He's like my savior.

392
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,345
he appeared at the perfect timing

393
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,977

398
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,746
No, nothing's wrong.

of our personal life like that?

You know, the collagen in ham
is good for your skin.

532
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,267
I guess you're also interested
in skincare.

533
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,805
Well...

534
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,396
We should take good care of our skin.

535
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,574
You're right. We really should.

536
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,453
All right, then.
Why don't we make a toast first?

537
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,583
-Sure.
-Sure.

538
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,372
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

539
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,590
Anyway, why did you gather us?

540
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,384
What did you want to tell us?

541
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,184
Well...

542
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,602
We wanted to tell you guys something
in person.

543
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,643
"We"? You and whom?

544
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,436
Why don't we eat first?
Chef Park prepared all this for us.

545
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,864
I'll tell you afterward.

546
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,903
A-jin, enjoy the food.

547
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,071
Is it something that'll upset me?

548
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,236
No, it isn't.

549
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,745
-Well, let's eat before it gets cold.
-Okay.

550
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,328
-Let me cut it for you.
-Okay. Thank you.

551
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,336
Thanks.

552
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,386
How should I eat it? It looks really good.

553
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,142
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

554
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,484
-You want a piece?
-Sure.

555
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,348
-All right. Here, Ms. Yoo.
-Thank you.

556
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,015
Thank you.

557
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,065
It's so good.

558
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,648
-It's good, isn't it?
-Yes.

559
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,279
-You can eat it by yourself, right?
-Yes, I can.

560
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,782
Right? Okay, then.

561
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,721
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

562
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,970
I think it's time for you to say
what you wanted to tell us.

563
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:42,145
All right. I asked you guys
to gather here tonight because...

564
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,123
It's okay.

565
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,252
To tell you the truth, we're--

566
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,434
I'm sorry, but we're closed for today.

567
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,505
Why don't you just open it again for us?
We came all the way here.

568
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,348
All the lights are on,
but you're not accepting customers?

569
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,225
Are you telling us just to go back?

570
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,951
-Come on in, then.
-Thank you.

571
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,118
What would you like to drink?

572
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,041
Soju, please.

573
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,583
You guys go ahead and eat without me.

574
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,666
Okay.

575
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,968
Here's your soju.

576
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,090
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

577
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,891
And here are your glasses.

578
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,442
I didn't prepare a special for today,
but I do have a dish already made.

579
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,599
Okay.

580
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,528
Here's the dish for you.

581
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,373
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

582
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,288
Gosh.

583
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,211
I'm sorry.

584
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,173
It's okay. I'll bring you a new one.

585
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,716
Thank you.

586
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,258
-Here.
-Thank you.

587
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,188
What's wrong with this?

588
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,688
Pardon?

589
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:51,276
Did you really serve this food
for us to eat?

590
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,405
But it's delicious.

591
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,539
Why don't you taste it?

592
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,464
Okay.

593
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,184
It tastes good.

594
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,757
What are you talking about?

595
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,517
I think I'm getting rashes.

596
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,272
And I'm feeling sick.

597
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,647
That's so funny.

598
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,071
Then I will prepare
something else for you.

599
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,579
Oh, my god!

600
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,623
Forget it.

601
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,293
You'll give us garbage again anyway.

602
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,625
Whatever dish you serve us,

603
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,419
it'll all taste the same
if you made it with those hands.

604
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,716
What's that supposed to mean?

605
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,562
Did you really have to announce
that you're gay on television?

606
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,018
Are you that proud that you're gay?

607
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,857
Just think how ashamed
your parents must be.

608
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,151
You went too far.

609
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,533
What? What did you just say?

610
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,077
Stop making a scene.

611
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,544
If you don't want to eat it,
just get lost.

612
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,996
Who's this bastard?

613
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,801
-His partner?
-Partner?

614
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,056
-He must be it.
-He must be his partner.

615
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,179
Partner...

616
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,186
-You son of a bitch!
-You bastard!

617
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,308
-You son of a bitch.
-Hey, let go of me!

618
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,556
It's on!

619
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,521
So he's the one
who hit that guy first, right?

620
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,444
Yes, that's right.

621
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,816
I think I broke my tooth.

622
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,775
You're done for.

623
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,374
You think you can beat a person up
like this since you're famous?

624
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,201
What? What are you talking about?

625
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,207
You're the ones who picked a fight first.

626
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,829
And the bistro was damaged because of you!

627
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,745
She's right, Detective.

628
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,093
All Mr. Kang did was hit him first.
Just once.

629
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,380
And it was because they were so rude.

630
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,184
That's enough. Why don't you guys
just makeup with each other?

631
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,389
"Makeup"?

632
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,309
We got beaten up, and it was one-sided!

633
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,428
What? Are you writing a novel
or something?

634
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,305
You people are so doomed, okay?

635
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,892
I'll call a reporter I know

636
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,477
and tell him what you did.

637
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,272
I'll make sure your show will be canceled.

638
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,566
It's up to you.

639
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:22,067
It happened because of me,
so I'll apologize to you.

640
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,699
I'm...

641
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,581
-so sorry.
-You don't have to do that.

642
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,122
-Don't, Jin-seong.
-Chef Park.

643
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,705
Whether you're accepting
of homosexuality or not,

644
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,014
that's your choice.
So I think it should be respected.

645
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,472
So I can't blame you even if you hate me.

646
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,887
Because that's also your choice.

647
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,430
But...

648
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,687
just because I'm gay,

649
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,402
doesn't mean you have the right

650
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,816
to condemn me like that,
saying that I'm filthy and disgusting.

651
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,664
The clothes I wear, the actions I take,
the person I am,

652
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,961
that's my choice and my life.

653
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,254
It's none of your business.

654
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,713
So,

655
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,467
I'm never going to settle.

656
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,340
I'll go all the way no matter what.

657
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,851
Please proceed accordingly.

658
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,144
No matter how hard I think about it,

659
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,185
I...

660
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,436
don't deserve to be treated this way

661
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,320
by them.

662
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,168
-Are you okay, babe?
-What?

663
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,750
-Your nose is bleeding.
-My nose?

664
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,085
-Yes.
-My nose's bleeding!

665
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,765
Are you all right, babe?

666
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,888
And are you okay, babe?

667
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,769
What about you, babe?

668
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,781
We're seeing each other.

669
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,985
I love her. That's right.

670
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,754
-Are you all right, babe?
-Yes.

671
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,213
Seong-eun.

672
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,592
This one, too.

673
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,966
Are you that happy? Are you?

674
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,720
How did you keep it from us all this time?

675
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,023
We were going to tell you.
We just couldn't find the right time.

676
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,598
-She's right. My Seong-eun wanted--
-What?

677
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,814
"My Seong-eun"?

678
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,484
My goodness... You two clean this up.

679
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,163
I mean, she wanted to tell you,
but she couldn't find the right time,

680
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,818
so she was so tormented.

681
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,657
That's true.

682
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:14,662
On the day of the first episode,
I went to your place to tell you,

683
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,246
but I couldn't
because the thief had been caught

684
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,422
and you and Chef Park
had to go to the police station.

685
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,461
And I gathered you guys
to really tell you tonight,

686
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,415
but I couldn't because of those bastards.

687
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,838
But still, you eventually told us
at the police station.

688
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:33,258
You two were really cool.

689
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,847
Well, thanks.

690
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,519
By the way, since when?

691
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,228
Was it

692
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,149
when we went to the beach?

693
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,863
God... You totally fooled us all.
Unbelievable.

694
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,867
Congratulations, you two.
I really mean it.

695
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,501
You said you couldn't find
the right time to tell me,

696
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,208
but I'm really hurt.

697
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,918
Come on. I'm so sorry.

698
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:05,553
From this moment on, I'm never
going to keep any secrets from you.

699
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,680
Forget it.
You two are really unbelievable.

700
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:27,074
The clothes I wear, the actions I take,
the person I am,

701
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,278
that's my choice and my life.

702
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,584
It's none of your business.

703
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,208
You don't have a fever.

704
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,514
You don't know what you like?

705
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,097
No, wait.

706
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,387
Wait. No!

707
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,768
-God, it's so hot.
-It's hot?

708
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,194
Did you enjoy the <i>tteokbokki</i>?

709
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,942
Yes.

710
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,955
If you want to be loved,

711
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,125
tell them...

712
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,132
how you feel first.

713
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,147
<i>Jung-tae, you can lift Jae-won, right?</i>

714
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,149
-I'm sure you can.
-But he's the weakest.

715
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,652
See? He can do it.

716
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,653
-Hey, let's try.
-I bet he doesn't weigh much.

717
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,236
-Don't!
-You're studying again?

718
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,781
You're studying too hard.

719
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,574
-You're tickling me!
-Come play with me.

720
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,488
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

721
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,577
What are you talking about?

722
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,463
-I won.
-No, I won.

723
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,671
No, no. Hey!

724
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,629
MATHEMATICS

725
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,511
Come on, stop it!

726
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,378
Gosh, seriously.

727
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,925
<i>I like you so much.</i>

728
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,426
-Hurry up.
-Scissors!

729
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,852
Hurry!

730
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,345
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH

731
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,431
It's not the closing time yet, is it?

732
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,718
Tae-wan.

733
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,690
Is this not a good time for you?

734
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,313
I came to tell you something.

735
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,774
I see. Okay.

736
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,605
Have a seat.

737
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,525
What's that? Is it a drink?

738
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,580
Yes.

739
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,834
Anyway, what is it you wanted to tell me?

740
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,514
Have you ever tried absinthe?

741
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,803
No.

742
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,102
Why don't you try it with me?

743
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,681
Sure.

744
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,493
Thanks.

745
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,501
What's the occasion?
You usually don't drink hard liquor.

746
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,170
My gosh... Is this 55 percent alcohol?

747
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,259
I heard there used to be 75-percent ones.

748
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,221
Really?

749
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,265
How is it?

750
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:15,022
Since sugar was added,
it tastes sweet at first.

751
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,187
But...

752
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,283
it tastes a little stale at the end.

753
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,880
Did you know...

754
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,755
this liquor used to be called
"The Devil's Drink"?

755
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,555
Really? Why?

756
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,401
What is it?

757
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,074
What do you want to tell me
that you're so serious?

758
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,079
They say Rimbaud drank...

759
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,001
absinthe when he confessed his feelings

760
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,750
for another guy.

761
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,175
I never imagined

762
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,598
the day would come when I could

763
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,273
drink this liquor.

764
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,317
When I was in high school, I saw

765
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,204
what happened to my classmate

766
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,616
after he came out of the closet.

767
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,289
Tae-wan.

768
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,210
I...

769
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,174
need to tell you something.

770
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,634
That's when I decided...

771
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,893
not to let anyone know about my sexuality.

772
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,847
You told me

773
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,981
about lobsters before.

774
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,525
That's actually about me.

775
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,202
As my shells got harder,

776
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,248
the soft feelings inside me...

777
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,131
made me so painful...

778
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,218
that I couldn't recognize who I am.

779
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,893
So I haven't told anyone...

780
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,852
and have hidden myself all my life.

781
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,106
Tae-wan.

782
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,541
I never thought I'd tell you like this.

783
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:19,793
The truth is, I--

784
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,384
I'm gay.

785
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,803
<i>And I love you so much.</i>

786
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,145
THANKS TO JANG HYUN-SUNG
FOR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

787
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,170
Tae-wan. Do you have time later today?

788
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,915
Do you think a second season is possible?

789
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:10,837
You can't do that.

790
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,297
Did you think
producing a TV show was a joke?

791
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,136
How will you take responsibility?

792
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,020
I'm not interested
in other people's private life.

793
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,269
Private life?

794
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,440
-I...
-That's enough.

795
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,479
I think I've heard enough.

796
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,649
A-jin and Tae-wan... It's all my fault.

797
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:27,942
-Isn't that Park Jin-seong?
-Where?

798
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,435
I love spending time with that person.

799
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,198
I guess I fell in love at first sight.

800
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:35,698
<i>I think as long as you don't give up,</i>

801
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,333
<i>things will work out for you.</i>

802
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,208
