1
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,813
Try to remember

2
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,317
things you like,

3
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,739
not things he liked.

4
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,256
I love this food so much,

5
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,854
but I wouldn't eat it.
How could I be such a fool?

6
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,998
What do you think...

7
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,786
love is?

8
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,247
-Sorry?
-What do you think

9
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,840
love is, Chef?

10
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,519
<i>I'm going to get on first!</i>

11
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,895
<i>We're riding dinosaurs!</i>

12
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,361
<i>-Take it easy.
-I'll get on first, okay?</i>

13
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,692
<i>Don't pester your dad too much.</i>

14
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,581
If you love someone,

15
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,325
you would gladly give them your liver

16
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,554
or kidney if they needed it.

17
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,644
Even if you might not wake up
after surgery,

18
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,807
you wouldn't regret it.

19
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,395
You would even die for them.

20
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,731
I think that's...

21
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,203
what it means to love someone.

22
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,919
Sang-yeong,
how does soju with <i>gopchang</i> sound?

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,340
It sounds great.

24
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,626
Follow me.

25
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,468
-God, you're so excited tonight.
-Yes, I am.

26
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,643
Let me do this.

27
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,182
Oh, I'm sorry, Chef. Let me pour you one.

28
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,443
Chef, you did a good job today.

29
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,023
A little more.

30
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,358
Seong-eun, you too. Let me pour you one.

31
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,658
Okay. All your glasses are filled, right?
Let me propose a toast.

32
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,661
All of you did a great job
on <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

33
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,164
If it becomes a regular show,
we'll all work together, okay?

34
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,038
Of course. Right?

35
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,705
Long live <i>Sweet Munchies</i>!

36
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,253
-Cheers!
-Long live <i>Sweet Munchies</i>!

37
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,586
-Cheers!
-Come on, Chef.

38
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,472
-The man of the show today. Good job!
-I love it.

39
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,520
-It tastes sweet.
-Mine, too.

40
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,228
Look! There they are.

41
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,402
-Really?
-Yes. He was so cool.

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,400
Seriously. In my mind...

43
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,531
The sauce and chives are so good here.

44
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,238
-No, it wasn't.
-What?

45
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,149
Why? What?

46
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,817
-No.
-But,

47
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,575
we have our chef to thank for everything.

48
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,489
-He was so good.
-You're right.

49
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,040
I hate to spoil the mood, but...

50
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,167
this is it for me.

51
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,013
I'm not going to be on the show.

52
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,299
But...

53
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,800
You saw earlier.

54
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,352
I was such a nuisance to everyone.

55
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,731
-No.
-No, you were not.

56
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,188
-You were so cool. I mean it.
-Right.

57
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,439
It was your first time,

58
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,730
-but you did a great job.
-Yes.

59
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,614
You were kind of a nuisance to me,
but you weren't that bad.

60
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:06,279
Today I realized that a studio
is not where I should be.

61
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,584
I think it's best if I go back
to my bistro,

62
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,620
-and do what I do best--
-Making special clothes

63
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,575
doesn't make me special.

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,340
It's only when a model shines
especially bright in my clothes,

65
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,591
that I can be appreciated
as a good designer.

66
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,585
What you said today

67
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,467
was so honest and heartfelt

68
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,100
that my clothes looked special.

69
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,607
You were really cool today.

70
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,576
Excuse me. Two more servings
of beef <i>gopchang.</i>

71
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,754
-Sure.
-Gosh...

72
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,673
You're unbelievable. Do you have to
ruin our teamwork for <i>gopchang</i>?

73
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,423
Stir it all first.

74
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,973
Maybe I'm not meant to eat beef.

75
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,476
I always eat pork, you know.

76
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,599
You're eating really well
for someone complaining.

77
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,356
I really wanted to have beef <i>gopchang.</i>

78
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,646
They'd hate it if we showed up.

79
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,573
They'd probably think,
"Those boomers are so clueless."

80
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,820
They'd feel like they're still at work.

81
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,448
Not me. I get along
with the juniors quite well.

82
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,664
Right.

83
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,002
Do you have someone

84
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,417
you would give
your own liver or kidney to?

85
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,510
I heard if you truly love someone,

86
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:51,011
you would gladly give them
your liver or kidney.

87
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,636
Who said that?

88
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,595
Chef Park.

89
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,482
Do you think you could do that?

90
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,653
For someone you love?

91
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,989
Hey, just thinking about it
makes me shudder.

92
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,833
What if I don't wake up after surgery?

93
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,124
What's the use of loving someone
if I'm dead?

94
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,661
Right?

95
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,843
But I'm actually jealous
that he can think of love that way.

96
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,763
Are you lonely or something?

97
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,684
Who's not lonely, really?

98
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,854
Do you regret getting divorced?

99
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,607
Of course not. I don't regret
getting married and divorced.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,940
And I think I'm better than you,
who's never been married.

101
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,859
Come on. Maybe I've never been married,

102
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,407
but I've been in love way
more than you ever have.

103
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,541
Oh, sure. I'm so jealous.

104
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,078
My goodness.

105
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:06,462
You know, sometimes this tastes
sweeter than saccharin to me.

106
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,303
Don't you always feel that way?

107
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,264
Come on. How can soju always taste sweet?

108
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,597
It depends on who I'm drinking with.
Sometimes it tastes really sweet,

109
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,931
and sometimes it tastes really bitter.

110
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,306
So how does it taste now?

111
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,317
It tastes like honey, of course.

112
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,572
Free drinks always taste sweet.

113
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,410
God, it's so bitter.

114
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,749
It tastes bitter to me since I'm buying.

115
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,461
Your show ratings are pretty high.

116
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,837
-That's not always a good thing.
-Having high ratings is everything.

117
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,295
Oh, god. What's that?

118
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,892
Are you going somewhere? Where?

119
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,809
Hey, Dad.

120
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,778
I'm getting off work late today.

121
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,900
I don't think I can come to the hospital.

122
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,235
I don't think I've introduced myself.

123
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,663
I'm Nam Gyu-jang, a producer at CKTV.

124
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,245
I'm so honored to have a drink
with someone as famous as yourself.

125
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,673
-I'm honored, too.
-I'm Kang Tae-wan.

126
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,171
Yes, of course. I know that.
Let me pour you a glass.

127
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,594
You look much better in person.

128
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,046
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

129
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,391
How was the shoot? Did it go well?

130
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,140
Yes.

131
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,021
Oh, really? Where's he now, though?

132
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,849
-Pardon?
-I want to see what he's like.

133
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,098
He stepped out to make a phone call.

134
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,649
-Chef, we're over here.
-There he is.

135
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,439
What?

136
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,105
He doesn't look gay.

137
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,744
-Mr. Nam.
-He didn't hear me.

138
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,161
-I'm sorry.
-It's nice to meet you.

139
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,330
I'm Nam Gyu-jang, a producer at CKTV.

140
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,788
I'm Park Jin-seong. Nice to meet you.

141
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,173
Hello, I'm Kang Min-su.

142
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,844
Oh, right. He's the main producer
of <i>Changing You.</i>

143
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,425
-It's nice to meet you.
-Let me pour you one.

144
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,220
All right.

145
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,599
Everyone has a drink now, right?

146
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,811
-Yes.
-Why don't we make a toast?

147
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,942
Sure, let's.

148
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,848
All right. Cheers.

149
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,437
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

150
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,911
Never mind.

151
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,370
Hey, kid.

152
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,990
-Yes?
-Go bring two of these.

153
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,037
Okay.

154
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,080
Well, we like the food and drinks here,

155
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,707
but I'm not sure how Chef Park
and Mr. Kang will feel about it.

156
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,219
-The kimchi is so good. We need more.
-Right, kimchi.

157
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,428
-A-jin?
-Yes?

158
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,178
-Hurry up and sit.
-Oh, okay.

159
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,850
-Here.
-Thanks.

160
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,348
Sure.

161
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,890
-Hey, kid. Wait.
-Yes?

162
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,603
Go get more kimchi and other side dishes.

163
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,563
Okay.

164
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,940
-Excuse me. Could I have...
-Is this your first round?

165
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,572
-No, it's our second one.
-Second?

166
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,109
We had <i>gopchang.</i>

167
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,413
-Here.
-Wait. We need water, too.

168
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,990
-Hey, kid. Go get some water, too.
-Pardon?

169
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,576
-Water--
-Ms. Kim.

170
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,873
You worked really hard today.

171
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,134
So let me pour you one.

172
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,751
Well, everyone worked hard today.

173
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,840
This kid's pretty clueless, as you know.
You must've pulled a lot of the weight.

174
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,681
Her name is A-jin, and she's the producer.

175
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,389
-Pardon?
-She has a name.

176
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,268
Kim A-jin.

177
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,605
She has a perfectly fine name.
Why do you keep calling her "kid?"

178
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,703
You're quite prickly, Chef.

179
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,833
He's prickly.

180
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,697
All right. Kim A-jin, it is.

181
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,999
By the way, Mr. Kang,

182
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,382
you're on two of CKTV shows, right?

183
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,248
You're quite popular.

184
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,174
How do you feel?

185
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,376
On one show is Kang Min-su,

186
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,466
producer of CKTV's biggest title
and a veteran.

187
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,101
And then Kim A-jin, the novice.
It's quite different, isn't it?

188
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,060
Can I ask you something?

189
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,308
Ask me what?

190
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,813
Nam...

191
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,860
It's Mr. Nam Gyu-jang, right?

192
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,451
What's your most famous show?

193
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,537
Well...

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,587
Last year, he...

195
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,259
No, was it the year before that?
Was it three years ago?

196
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,938
You did that to Mr. Nam
on purpose earlier, didn't you?

197
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,729
Yes.

198
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,783
Thank you.

199
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,243
"Hey."

200
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,776
"Kid."

201
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,742
Well,

202
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,084
you said there's nobody who calls you
by your name at work.

203
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,542
It seemed like that guy Nam
is quite a mean boss.

204
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,418
You're a great judge of character.

205
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,756
Thanks...

206
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,720
for helping me earlier.

207
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,559
On set.

208
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,653
The story about the meal
you had at my bistro.

209
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,025
I really meant it.

210
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,861
Whenever I go to your bistro,
I feel a lot better.

211
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,003
By the way, you didn't mean it
when you said this is it for you, did you?

212
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,499
You still have some time,

213
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,998
so why don't you find someone
better than me?

214
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,166
Is it because of me?

215
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,915
Was I terrible on set?

216
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,006
No.

217
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,059
-You were cool.
-Then why?

218
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,465
No, you can't quit.
We have to do the show together.

219
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,104
Okay?

220
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,269
Well, we don't know yet
if it's going to be a regular show.

221
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,897
So let's talk about it when it's decided.

222
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,079
Anyway, Mr. Park Jin-seong,

223
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,618
how about we become friends first?

224
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,037
-Sorry?
-We're the same age

225
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,879
and neighbors. On top of it,
I'm a regular at your bistro.

226
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,842
So let's be friends.

227
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,716
Let's be good friends, Jin-seong.

228
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,069
Let's, A-jin.

229
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,579
Mr. Lee?

230
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,880
You scared me!

231
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,880
You really scared me.

232
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,924
Did you pull an all-nighter here?

233
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,966
No, I didn't. When did I fall asleep?

234
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,142
Oh, God.

235
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,563
Wait. My proposal was here.

236
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,102
-Pardon?
-What?

237
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,435
-Where's my proposal?
-Your proposal?

238
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,111
I put it right here.

239
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,899
I definitely put my proposal here.

240
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,993
-Where is it?
-I don't see it.

241
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,739
-Oh, no...
-I don't see it.

242
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,776
Was it all a dream?

243
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,985
No, I'm sure it wasn't.
I definitely had an amazing proposal.

244
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,829
But I don't remember any of the content.

245
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,961
No, I have to go to sleep again.
It'll come back to me.

246
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,591
-Mr. Lee.
-God, it's so hot.

247
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,468
-It'll come back, right?
-Yes.

248
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,259
Right. It will.
I'll definitely have the same dream again.

249
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,684
It'll come back.

250
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,386
Good luck, Mr. Lee.

251
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,104
-Good luck to you, too.
-You can do it.

252
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,814
-It'll come back.
-See you.

253
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,524
-See you. It'll come back. Bye.
-Bye.

254
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,068
That scared me.

255
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,736
Shall we begin?

256
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,161
<i>A GAY CHEF'S SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

257
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,627
There they are.

258
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,384
-Mr. Nam.
-Not yet...

259
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,006
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Mr. Lee.

260
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,564
It's been forever since the brains

261
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,811
of our entertainment department
have gathered.

262
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,774
Actually, we had a drink together
a few days ago.

263
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,980
Oh, right. I remember now.

264
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,454
A-jin seems really busy.

265
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,949
How come the associate producer
has time to eat?

266
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,494
She said she wanted to edit
by herself first.

267
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,908
Right. It's not going to
be a regular show anyway.

268
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,667
Just let her do what she wants.

269
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,791
But I heard the shoot went well.

270
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,709
That doesn't mean it'll be good.

271
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,375
The final version is what's important.

272
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,837
I just don't get Ms. Cha.

273
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,635
I mean, I don't understand
what she's thinking.

274
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,143
How could she say yes
to a show about a gay guy?

275
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,016
I'm worried she's letting
CKTV's reputation be put on the line

276
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,113
by someone who's not even
a full-time employee.

277
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,244
Why? People might think
it's fresh and unconventional.

278
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,529
Like, "CKTV is really open-minded."

279
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,164
When I first heard what A-jin said
about her proposal,

280
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,042
I thought the show was going
to be a big hit.

281
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,210
-You're right.
-Right?

282
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,000
Have some salad, too.

283
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,253
Is it good?

284
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,086
Hey, Min-su. What do you think?

285
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,085
Well, I don't know. I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

286
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,386
No, this kid...

287
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,510
It's never going to happen.

288
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,766
She acted out at the company dinner,

289
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,478
got lucky,

290
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,981
found a gay chef, and made a pilot.

291
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,562
But what? A regular show?

292
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,607
Let's be serious. There's no way
that's ever happening.

293
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,493
Seriously...

294
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,362
It tastes awful, right?

295
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,067
It tastes awful!

296
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,581
-I'll eat this.
-But that's mine...

297
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,810
EDITING ROOM

298
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,528
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

299
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,720
No... that's not right.

300
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,078
That's what I'm talking about!

301
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,224
Good work, A-jin.

302
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,029
-Breathe in through your nose and...
-Sorry?

303
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,736
A deep breath.

304
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,446
Breathe in through your nose
and breathe out through your mouth.

305
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,497
Don't be nervous. You're okay, right?

306
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,672
-Yes, I'm okay.
-Please do your best.

307
00:23:55,308 --> 00:24:02,108
KM BANK, PARK JIN-SEONG
RECEIVED: 9,670,000 WON

308
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,281
<i>I sent you the money just now.</i>

309
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,276
<i>Please check your account.</i>

310
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,539
Hey.

311
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,751
I finished editing, so check it out.

312
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,880
I'm going to brush my teeth now.

313
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,177
All right.

314
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,559
Jin-u got off work really late last night,

315
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,147
so I told him just to get some rest.

316
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,781
That's good.

317
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,199
The hospital bill's quite expensive,
isn't it?

318
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,741
It was worth it.

319
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,207
You look much healthier now.

320
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,625
And we can always make money, you know.

321
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,546
I'm sorry, son.

322
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,718
Let's eat something nice
to celebrate your discharge.

323
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,483
I do have a place I want to go.

324
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,935
Please come in.

325
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,330
So this is
what my son's bistro looks like.

326
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,748
Let's just go get something nice to eat.

327
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,462
We're here to eat something nice.

328
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,632
There's no better cook than you.

329
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,839
Really?

330
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:36,586
Then should I guess what you want to eat?

331
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,393
Is cooking fun?

332
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,146
Well, it's just work.

333
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,480
Hello.

334
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,412
A-jin, I think the edited version's gone.

335
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,530
What?

336
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,785
No!

337
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,871
No, this is not happening.

338
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,883
How did it happen? No.

339
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,049
<i>How attractive</i>

340
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,300
<i>-you are...</i>
-Where?

341
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,184
-What's this?
<i>-How attractive...</i>

342
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,389
What is this? It's not gone.

343
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,180
You really scared me.

344
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,347
This is the right version.

345
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,389
God, what a relief.

346
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,654
<i>-our other halves were born...</i>
-This is the right version?

347
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,480
-Yes.
<i>-Again.</i>

348
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,725
-But bloopers are still included.
<i>-Again.</i>

349
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,107
Is this really the edited version?

350
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,534
Yes.

351
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,824
You know, Chef Park is not a celebrity.

352
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,578
He's not an actor either.

353
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,289
I want the viewers to know

354
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,500
that his cooking and his lines are not
from a script, but from his heart.

355
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:53,634
That Jin-seong's comforting words are
from the bottom of his heart.

356
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,133
<i>-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?</i>

357
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,797
<i>-Can I...</i>
-The sincere

358
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,795
-gay chef.
<i>-cook first?</i>

359
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,604
<i>Oh, sure. Go ahead, please.</i>

360
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,560
This is the Chef Park character
I had in my mind. All right?

361
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,686
What do you think?

362
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,151
I see.

363
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,488
I see.

364
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,801
It's so good. It really hits the spot.

365
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,885
You know, you cook so well.
Just like your mom.

366
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,234
Come on. I'm much better than Mom.

367
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm a chef after all.

368
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,398
All right. You're better.

369
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:02,408
This food really makes me
miss my Yeong-suk even more.

370
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,245
Dad,

371
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,042
have you ever hated Mom?

372
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,878
-Of course, I have.
-You have?

373
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,507
You know, she hid her illness.

374
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,730
But she did that
because Jin-u was still young

375
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,305
and she was worried about you and I.

376
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,805
I know that.

377
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,108
She did it because she was worried

378
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,741
about her incompetent husband,
her children, and the hospital bill.

379
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,776
I understood why she did what she did.

380
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,163
But I still hated her for it.

381
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,041
One day,

382
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,174
your mom suddenly said
she wanted to go to Jeju Island.

383
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:01,505
But we were barely
making ends meet at the time.

384
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,684
So it kept being pushed back.

385
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,304
"Let's go after I finish this job.

386
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,390
Maybe next month.

387
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,475
Maybe when the weather is warmer."
I kept putting it off.

388
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,612
I never imagined there wouldn't
be a next time.

389
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,453
If I'd known I didn't have much time
left to spend with her,

390
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,368
I would've put everything aside

391
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,674
and gone on a trip with her.

392
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,682
Eat as much as you like.

393
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,743
-She's...
-You have to make it.

394
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,743
You have to succeed so everyone
who's looking down on you

395
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,696
will see what you're made of. Okay?

396
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,577
Today's the day, A-jin.

397
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,917
What if it gets really low ratings?

398
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,211
Don't say that. It's bad luck.

399
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,007
Okay.

400
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,384
I bet the show will be a big hit.

401
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,965
You're the best.

402
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,053
Of course.

404
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,352
-Why do you have chopsticks?
-For the radish.

405
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,561
I don't use...

406
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,314
-Guys, eat as much as you want.
-Yes, sir.

407
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,306
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

408
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,317
-Time for a drink.
-You want one?

409
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,740
-Come on.
-Come on.

410
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,188
What?

411
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,988
Spicy chicken or fried chicken.
Which do you think is better?

412
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,452
-Fried one for me.
-Spicy chicken for me!

413
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,293
-Fire chicken!
-What are you talking about?

414
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,869
Then give all the spicy chicken to me.

415
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,666
-One more beer, please.
-Sure.

416
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,087
-Here.
-One soju, please.

417
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,264
-Soju? Sure.
-Chef, we'll sit here.

418
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,803
-Could we get snacks first?
-Sure.

419
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,227
Here's your soju.

420
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,269

Oh, right. No, I didn't.

439
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,508
Why not?

440
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,228
I had a lot of customers.

441
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,897
Watch it through the VOD service. Got it?

442
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,186
Okay.

443
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,033
Thank you.

444
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,964
This is just what I needed.

445
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,962
We'll only know for sure
when the viewer ratings come out tomorrow,

446
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,545
but I have a good feeling about the show.

447
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,798
BROTHERS

448
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,851
There really is a chance
that it'll become a regular show.

449
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,061
If it does, that's great.

450
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,727
But as I told you before...

451
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,436
Nothing's been decided,

452
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,277
so don't start drawing boundaries already.
You're hurting my feelings.

453
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,655
How did you

454
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,664
come up with <i>Sweet Munchies</i>?

455
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,844
I'm sure you know well

456
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,594
how difficult it is to live
as a sexual minority.

457
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,838
I mean,

458
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,260
you must've been hiding
your sexual orientation, too.

459
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,265
What if someone who's suffered a lot

460
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:51,774
could do the opposite and comfort others
with open arms, without prejudice?

461
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:58,244
And what if it could change
viewers' thoughts on sexual minorities?

462
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,871
Why are you looking at me like that?

463
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,669
What? What do you mean?

464
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,342
How was I looking at you?

465
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,721
It's nothing, really.

466
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,979
What's this?

467
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,071
It's a little something for your debut.

468
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,436
Oh, my.

469
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,451
But I didn't get you anything.

470
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,660
It's okay. Just open it.

471
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,657
You shouldn't have.

472
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,288
What is it?

473
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,053
You got my name engraved on it.

474
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,723
I hope you'll make
many amazing shows with it.

475
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,588
Thank you.

476
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,393

Oh, my. It's so pretty.

478
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,882

00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,130

Hey, A-jin.

The forum is on fire.

525
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,647
And it got high ratings.

526
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,365
Well, I'm not surprised.

527
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,825
What is this? Why are you so calm?

00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,995
So you're doing a regular show now?

529
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,165
Regular?
I haven't heard anything about it.

530
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,419
Hey, of course,
it'll become a regular show.

531
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,667
Congratulations, A-jin.

532
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,376
Seong-eun, money's not mine
until it's in my account.

533
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,968
And until the show's officially scheduled,
you never know.

534
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,891
MOM

535
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,394
Excuse me.

536
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,232
Hey. What did you say you sent me?

537
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,903
I see.

538
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,645
Yes.

539
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,071
You enjoyed my show?

540
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,616
Well, I could make it better.

541
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,668
Gosh. Please stop Dad.

542
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,789
It's not officially scheduled yet.

543
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,086
No, it's as good as decided.

544
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,709
But still.
I think holding a feast is too much.

545
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,337
Mom, I'll call you back later.
I have a meeting now.

546
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,719
I didn't know you had a meeting.

547
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,483
You're so happy, aren't you?

548
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,729
Yes, I am.

549
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,820
Seong-eun, come to my place tonight
and have a drink?

550
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,701
-I'll cook.
-How can I count on you?

551
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,119
And I'll introduce you
to a guy who lives upstairs.

552
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,578
Is he handsome?

553
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,289
You'll be surprised.

554
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,749
Oh, my. Is he that good-looking?

555
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,830
How tall is he? What? Is he single?

556
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,916
How come he doesn't have a girlfriend?

557
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,267
My goodness.

558
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,807
You've gotten more handsome.

559
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,726
Is it that good to have your own bistro?

560
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,200
Of course not.
It was better when I was working for you.

561
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,239
You brat.

562
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:38,992
How have you been?

563
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,987
Just the same old, same old.

564
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,615
Anyway, what's the occasion?
Shouldn't you be working at this hour?

565
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,256
I'm sorry to ask this,

566
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,469
but could you lend me some money?

567
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,434
I'm sorry for barging in
and asking such a thing.

568
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,306
Don't be. You must be having
a hard time to come to me.

569
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,399
But actually,

570
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,821
I'm not doing well these days either.

571
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,189
I'm barely paying my employees' wages.

572
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,607
I see.

573
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,717
Hello, ma'am.

574
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,182
Why? You have something to tell me?

575
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,263
No.

576
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,282
Not this way.

577
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,831
Delivery's not available?

578
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,288
No, I'm sorry, but we can't deliver.

579
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:07,583
But...

580
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,752
Okay. Just bag it then.

581
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,457
Darn it.

582
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,666
Why do they not deliver?

583
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,384
God, I'm exhausted.

584
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,772
May I help you?

585
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,269
Oh, thank you.

586
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,909
Do you live in a rooftop apartment?

587
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,829
How did you know that?

588
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,618
Oh, I saw you this morning.

589
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,003
Right. On the stairs?

590
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,501
Yes.

591
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,209
Do you live with Park Jin-seong?

592
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,877
-You know my older brother?
-Brother?

593
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,176
We don't look alike, do we?

594
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,719
-He's your real brother?
-Yes.

595
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,435
You really bought a lot.

596
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,060
Did I? Anyway, thank you so much.

597
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,896
Thanks. You can put it here.

598
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,574
-Okay.
-Thank you.

599
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,452
So are you and my brother close?

600
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,373
We're really close.

601
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,410
Is he home now?

602
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,623
I'm not sure.

603
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,504
If he is,
could you tell him to come to my place?

604
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,832
-Now?
-Yes.

605
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,417
I'm having a party here
to celebrate something.

606
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,423
-I see.
-See you around.

607
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,125
Sure. Have a nice day.

608
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,484
Jin-seong, you know
the girl living downstairs, right?

609
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,151
She asked me to tell you to come
to her place and have a drink.

610
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,566
What?

611
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,073
Why did she ask you to do that?

612
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,164
And how do you know A-jin?

613
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,183
-A-jin.
-I've come to escort you myself.

614
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,390
Your brother told you, right?
I'm having a party.

615
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,774
Seong-eun came, too.

616
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,098
But I need to go to my bistro.

617
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,687
You want to join us, too?

618
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,112
-Can I? That's awesome.
-Sure.

619
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,441
Hey!

620
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,487
He would've been disappointed
if I hadn't invited him.

621
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,661
You hurry up, too.

622
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,490
This is not good.

623
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,385
You two were really meant to meet.

624
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,849
You even live in the same building.
Aren't I right?

625
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,811
I guess you're right.

626
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:15,931
Sure.

627
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,860
You two brothers are both handsome.

628
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,268
Your parents must be really happy.

629
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,648
All right, guys. I'm the chef tonight.

630
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,238
Leave everything to me.

631
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,582
-I'm going to make kimchi <i>jeon.</i>
-Hey.

632
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,659
Turn on the burner first.

633
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,405
-No, wait. Just give it to me.
-What?

634
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,747
-No...
-No, give it.

635
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,172
-I will...
-That's not how you do it.

636
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,960
But I can do it myself.

637
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,472
Did you watch the show?

638
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,892
The show? What show?

639
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,897
You don't know? The gay--

640
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,808
Hey! Go get some crab meat.

641
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:04,572
What?

642
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,938
You know, in the freezer, the crab meat...

643
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,397
No, the clam meat. Go bring it.

644
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,195
Is it crab meat or clam meat?

645
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,913
I'll add it to this, so whichever is fine.

646
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,453
No, you don't have to do that.
Let's just eat.

647
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,827
-Just kimchi is good enough.
-Right. I have canned tuna.

648
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,825
-That's good.
-What do you think?

649
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,247
That'll work.

650
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,061
Goodness.

651
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,848
-One? Two?
-One's enough.

652
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,232
-Here.
-Okay.

653
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,711
Do you cook, too?

654
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,329
No. My brother cooks well, so...

655
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,247
I envy you.
Does he cook for you every day?

656
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,258
Not necessarily.

657
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,759
Enjoy.

658
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,308
Why don't we make a toast first?

659
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,769
-Sure.
-Cheers.

660
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,929
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

661
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,773
Thank you for cooking.

662
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,698
You are indeed a chef.

663
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,570
-It's so good.
-It's good.

664
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,445
By the way, what are you celebrating?

665
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,543
Oh, that? Jin-seong and she and I worked--

666
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,462
-Kim A-jin!
-Yes?

667
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,711
What's wrong?

668
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,752
This is not right.

669
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,764
-What is?
-I know you're busy,

670
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,876
but how could you let your place
get so messy?

671
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,178
What's gotten into him? My gosh.

672
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,063
But I cleaned today.

673
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,730
-Go talk to him.
-He's so good at folding clothes.

674
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,062
Is he good at housework, too?

675
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,857
Well, kind of.

676
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,400
You don't have to do that.

677
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,364
But why don't we do more
while we're at it?

678
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,738
Should we fold these, too?

679
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,621
This is great. How about these?

680
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,790
I never imagined <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
would be such a hit.

681
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,958
At first, the director approved
this project to teach a lesson.

682
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,587
<i>Sweet Munchies</i>?

683
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,838
Fire! There's fire!

684
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,551
What? Where?

685
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,089
I left the stove on.

686
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,835
-What?
-What?

687
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,217
-Jin-u, let's go.
-Oh, my God.

688
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,263
-Wait.
-Why?

689
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,256
It's right upstairs.
Go turn it off yourself.

690
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,388
She's right.

691
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,694
Actually, my brother's been
on a diet these days.

692
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,149
-What?
-You know, models...

693
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,109
It's really hard to become a model.

694
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,939
-So you two have fun.
-Wait.

695
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,484
-Let me finish this.
-Let him be.

696
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,864
-Then stay until we finish this.
-Wait.

697
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,526
-See you next time, girls.
-Gosh.

698
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,235
"Girls..."

699
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,367
Good night.

700
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,199
Good night.

701
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,831
What's wrong with him?

702
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,918
Chef Park's not

703
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,585
really going to quit, is he?

704
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,854
Gosh. Didn't you tell me not to say
such a thing because it's bad luck?

705
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,598
Why would he quit?

706
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,810
He came to shoot the pilot himself.

707
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,270
-Right?
-Right. He's not going to quit.

708
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,357
-Cheers.
-Sure.

709
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,784
What's going on between you two?

710
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:40,985
What do you mean?

711
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,866
You saw it yourself.
She's just someone who lives downstairs.

712
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,195
But she's pretty.

713
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,035
No, she's not.

714
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,961
If she's just someone you know,

715
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,014
why did you lie about the stove?

716
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,130
-What's going on between you two?
-Stop it.

717
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,434
You'll be hurt if you know.

718
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,264
God...

719
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,682
So they work at CKTV, right?

720
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,555
One's a scriptwriter and one's a producer.

721
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,396
They must be doing really well, no?

722
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,821
-So what?
-I'm just saying.

723
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,741
They just seemed
to be pretty close to you.

724
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,568
So?

725
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,452
Can you ask them
to pull some strings for me?

726
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,504
Hey.

727
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,825
You want to hear people say

728
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,706
that you only made it through connections
when you actually make it?

729
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,089
These days, people find out everything.

730
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,132
Just focus on getting recognized
for your competence, not someone else's.

731
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,224
Darn it... Would it really be a problem?

732
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,683
Of course, it would!

733
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,391
Darn it...

734
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,845
A-jin.

735
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,608
-Yes?
-The director sent for you.

736
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,904
I think it's about your show
being officially scheduled.

737
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,655
I'll find out when I see her.

738
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,068
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

739
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,276
You can do this.

740
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,959
Stop it.

741
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,205
Good luck.

742
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,513
Come in.

743
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,523
Hey.

744
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,821
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

745
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,031
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> has been
officially scheduled.

746
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,365
-Here's the document for it.
-Really?

747
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,579
Thank you so much. I'll work really hard.

748
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,882
<i>A GAY CHEF'S SWEET MUNCHIES</i>
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY SCHEDULED.

749
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,420
PRODUCERS: NAM GYU-JANG
KIM A-JIN

750
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,428
-What's this? Why's Mr. Nam's name on it?
-Oh, that?

751
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,765
-You two will work together.
-Why?

752
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,234
I'm the one who came up with the idea

753
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,982
and made the show on my own
from the very start.

754
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,907
Is this what you had in mind all along?

755
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:30,118
Ms. Kim. Why don't you calm down first?

756
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,079
We all are producers at CKTV.

757
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,173
-At a time like this--
-Now we're both producers?

758
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,377
You mock me because I'm a contract worker.

759
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,802
Sit down, A-jin.

760
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,761
Didn't you hear the director?

761
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,596
-Sit down--
-Just stop talking.

762
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,932
Why don't you show some respect?
Are you crazy?

763
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,227
How can I not be right now?

764
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,901
-You little... I've had enough of this.
-Mr. Nam.

765
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,815
Wait outside.

766
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,574
I'm sorry, ma'am.

767
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,576
Why are you doing this to me?

768
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,091
You can't do this alone
because you're inexperienced.

769
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,216
Everyone's inexperienced at first.

770
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,260
You watched my pilot, right?

771
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,973
You think the higher-ups would make it

772
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,925
a regular show
just because you made a good pilot?

773
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,349
What if we leave the show
to a contract worker and it goes wrong?

774
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,515
-Who'll take the responsibility?
-I will.

775
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,113
Ms. Cha, I know I can do well.

776
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,152
This show...

777
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,574
It means a lot to me.

778
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,121
Don't do this to me. Please.

779
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,082
What does <i>Sweet Munchies</i> mean to you?

780
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,500
It means everything to me.

781
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,498
It's like a child that I gave birth to.

782
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,376
A child?

783
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,350
One day, two women with one baby
came to King Solomon.

784
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:15,008
And they both claimed the baby was theirs.

785
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,811
Pardon?

786
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,942
Both of them yelled and shouted,
claiming the baby was theirs.

787
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,230
And Solomon ordered
the baby to be cut in half.

788
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,318
To divide it fairly.

789
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,033
Come on, Ms. Cha.
What on earth are you talking about?

790
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,663
I'm talking about how Solomon figured out
who was the real mother.

791
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:39,964
The real mother
couldn't let them kill her baby.

792
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,630
So she said, "The baby's not mine.

793
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,837
I lied about it.

794
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,590
So please don't kill the baby."

795
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,217
As you said, you're the one

796
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,013
who created <i>Sweet Munchies</i>.

797
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,638
It's yours, so you can't co-produce it
with Mr. Nam?

798
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,225
And me?

799
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,230
I can just cancel <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

800
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,744
It's entirely up to you now.

801
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,609
You can co-produce the show

802
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,366
or have it canceled.

803
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,531
You decide.

804
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,216
TODAY'S SPECIAL
SNAPPER

805
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,939
Are you that moved to see me?

806
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,544
What's wrong? What happened?

807
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,919
Why are you crying?

808
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,176
I wanted to become a variety-show producer

809
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,811
because I wanted to make people laugh.

810
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,574
But why is it so hard?

811
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,860
Did the show not get scheduled?

812
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,911
Since I'm a contract worker,

813
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,622
they say I have to give it
to a regular employee.

814
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,166
They say I have to co-produce it.

815
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,747
You know...

816
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:38,335
I worked really hard to make this show.

817
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,602
I...

818
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,430
I was so happy thinking I'd finally
get to produce my own show.

819
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:10,935
What people liked was you,
not the format of the show.

820
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,938
I'm sorry, A-jin.

821
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,440
-<i>Chef Park Jin-seong...</i>
-No, I shouldn't do this.

822
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,613
has notified me that
he will not be doing the show.

823
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,863
Chef Park's not going to be on the show?

824
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,242
<i>Kang Tae-wan's not going to do it
because the chef's out?</i>

825
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,164
If you fail to get him back,

826
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,082
then I'll make sure
you're kicked off the show.

827
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,412
You're going to Hell!

828
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,616
This is Kim A-jin, the producer
of <i>Sweet Munchies</i>!"

829
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,536
<i>Can you tell me
why you don't want to do it?</i>

830
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,455
The truth is, I'm...

831
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,955
How are you gay?

832
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,512
