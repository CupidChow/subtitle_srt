1
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,645
You want to be like me?

2
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,937
Then hide it

3
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,862
like me.

4
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,565
I'm...

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,121
not gay.

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,918
That's the truth, Kang Tae-wan.

7
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,671
I am...

8
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,216
a fake.

9
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,812
-Hi.
-Hi.

10
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,207
A-jin.

11
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,854
-I have something to tell you.
-Wait.

12
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,308
Let's talk outside.

13
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,336
Why are they in such a bad mood?

14
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,966
What's going on?

15
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,682
I'm not sure.

16
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,559
-Let me see.
-Are you trying to look at them?

17
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,531
I will...

18
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,791
explain it to you first.

19
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,214
The reason I've been lying...

20
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,416
Let's talk later.

21
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,295
The others are here,

22
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,894
so let's talk later.

23
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,640
Don't let them know about it.

24
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,833
-We had something to discuss, so...
-I see.

25
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,973
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang,

27
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,977
but something urgent came up
so I'll need to get going.

28
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,320
Right. And I think we should go, too.

29
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,229
I see.

30
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,646
Well, we were only going
to have dinner anyway.

31
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,487
Let's just meet up another time.

32
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,952
-Sure, next time.
-Sure.

33
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,701
Okay.

34
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,664
-Let's go.
-Okay.

35
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,865
-Bye.
-Bye.

36
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,470
Why did you do it?

37
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,845
I needed...

38
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,442
money.

39
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,533
What was the meaning of tonight?

40
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,209
I contemplated a lot
before gathering everyone to tell them.

41
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,762
But you're a fake?

42
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,588
-Tae-wan.
-What you've done is really wrong.

43
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,720
I really want to know what's going on.

44
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,177
Do you have any idea?

45
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,827
Come in.

46
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,672
-Did you ask for me?
-Yes. Have a seat and wait a little.

47
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,404
Why are you so nervous?

48
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,435
Director Cha.

49
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,648
The thing is...

50
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:13,826
I haven't been able
to convince Chef Park yet.

51
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,501
Goodness.
I guess you're not that competent yet.

52
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,539
That's a pity.

53
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:26,006
The higher-ups are thinking about
converting you to a regular employee.

54
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,509
Should I tell them to reconsider it?

55
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,512
Wait. Converting me to a regular employee?

56
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,426
That's right.

57
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,226
Well...

58
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,403
-Are you not interested?
-Pardon? I...

59
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,491
I am! Of course, I am.

60
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,565
We still have some time.
So go convince him, okay?

61
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,697
You know,
you eventually succeeded last time.

62
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,951
Yes.

63
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,834
You can do it, right?

64
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:01,918
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,400
What? What's this for?

66
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,524
Sang-yeong,
about the hidden camera folder...

67
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,485
Why did you delete the whole folder?
Was something unusual filmed?

68
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,320
Are you kidding?

69
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,583
Wait. How do you know that I deleted it?

70
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,251
Hey, did you access my computer again?

71
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,540
Didn't I tell you not to do it?
Didn't you hear me?

72
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,625
What's your problem?

73
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,001
I didn't access your computer.

74
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,417
-Hey, you...
-Drink this.

75
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,215
How... After what you said...
I'll sue you for breach of privacy.

76
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,761
-All right, all right.
-You little...

77
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,341
Why are you here?

78
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,680
I wanted to apologize to you properly.

79
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,470
After you left like that last night,

80
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,600
it weighed on my mind.

81
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:56,992
Have a seat.

82
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,891
I'll be honest.

83
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,892
I tried my best to look
for a different option,

84
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,018
but I had no other choice.

85
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,101
And at the time,
A-jin was looking for a gay chef.

86
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,650
She said all the chef needs to do
was to cook on a TV show.

87
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,242
My desperate situation...

88
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,528
clouded my judgment.

89
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,917
Tae-wan.

90
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,052
I'm sorry...

91
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,177
I hurt you.

92
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,728
So...

93
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,694
what are you going to do?

94
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,200
To be honest, I don't know what to do.

95
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,240
Because it'll hurt...

96
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,413
everyone else, too.

97
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,289
I'm so sorry...

98
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,419
I didn't tell you sooner.

99
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,592
I thought hard

100
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,095
what to say to you before I decided

101
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,098
to come here.

102
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,943
As you well know,

103
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,573
I suck at everything except cooking.

104
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,729
So...

105
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,400
I decided to tell you

106
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:01,954
<i>honestly.</i>

107
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:09,995
MEMORIAL PARK

108
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,348
THE LATE JUNG YEONG-SUK

109
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,846
I'm here, Mom.

110
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,359
It's been too long, hasn't it?

111
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,738
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,162
Today, I...

113
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,046
I miss you so much.

114
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,260
Where are you? You even closed the bistro.

115
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,092
What?

116
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,392
Why did you go there?

117
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,518
Let's just drink three glasses each.

118
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,572
Let me pour for you first.

119
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,833
About <i>Sweet Munchies...</i>

120
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,575
So you knew...

121
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,009
Thinking about how much
you must be suffering

122
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,467
and how much you must be hurting...

123
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,556
To think...

124
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,113
that all this happened
because I'm incompetent.

125
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,362
It breaks my heart.

126
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,818
Dad.

127
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,079
It's my fault.

128
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,578
It's not your fault.

129
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,375
You wouldn't have done it
if I hadn't been in that accident.

130
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,564
I'll straighten it out.

131
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,563
I'll go to CKTV,

132
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,481
tell them it's all my fault,
and ask for forgiveness.

133
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,811
You can't do that, Dad.

134
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,985
If this gets out,

135
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,446
a lot of people

136
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,249
will be hurt because of me.

137
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,871
So?

138
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,421
Are you going to keep lying?

139
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,087
Then what will happen to you?

140
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,419
You're the one who will hurt the most.

141
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,629
How can I let that happen?

142
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,127
<i>Where are you, Chef?</i>

143
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,757
<i>Everyone's in the meeting room right now.</i>

144
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,170
Chef Park!

145
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,804
It's been a while.

146
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,585
I really should visit your bistro
again sometime.

147
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,888
I keep thinking about that sea urchin
roe dish you made for us last time.

148
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,726
Sang-yeong, why don't we have
a drink there tonight?

149
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,768
Well, I have a meeting later, so...

150
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,402
Oh, is that so?

151
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,114
Gosh.

152
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,816
Then maybe next time.

153
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,699
I'm sorry,

154
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,492
but I'm late for a meeting right now.

155
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,708
Really? Then you should go.

156
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,458
See you next time.

157
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,213
Wait.

158
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,013
It's not like you'll have a meeting
all night long.

159
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,091
Why are you so clueless today?

160
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,217
You think I wanted us to have a drink
at his bistro just to help him out?

161
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,595
I wanted to go persuade him to do
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> Season 2.

162
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,898
To help A-jin...

163
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,438
For God's sake...

164
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,436
What's wrong with you lately?

165
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,963
Regarding the matter
I spoke about last time,

166
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,879
we need to discuss it
with the marketing team.

167
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,498
As for the rest, we will have to...

168
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,257
I am currently preparing...

169
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,051
I'm sorry, but...

170
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,430
I'll call them.

171
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,474
-Hello.
-Hello.

172
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,310
You're a little late.

173
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,828
-Has the guest come yet?
-Pardon?

174
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
-The guest.
-No, not yet.

175
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,414
Chef Park, did you check the script?

176
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,457
Yes.

177
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,505
You know, Krystal is going to appear
as a guest this time.

178
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,668
She's really busy these days,

179
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,967
but I managed to cast her by myself.

180
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,009
I heard she's a huge fan of yours.

181
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,428
I think we'll get really high ratings.

182
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,847
I think so, too.

183
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,807
All right. I'll see you
at the next shooting.

184
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,896
-Okay.
-Okay.

185
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,981
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

186
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,448
Mr. Kang.

187
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,580
Could we have a word for a minute?

188
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,956
Sure.

189
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,591
Okay, then. I'll get going first.

190
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,999
Okay.

191
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,587
Have a nice day.

192
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,328
Hello?

193
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,043
<i>Jin-seong, I think my place
has been robbed again.</i>

194
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,134
What?

195
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,665
I'll be there right now.

196
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,214
Did you call the police?

197
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,509
Really? Okay, I got it. Just wait there.

198
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,951
What happened? Are you okay?

199
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,389
Oh, gosh.

200
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,975
-Hey, hurry up.
-Oh, right.

201
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,651
Here.

202
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,254
What are you waiting for?
Blow out the candles.

203
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,668
Okay.

204
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,673
Wait!

205
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,724
You should make a wish first.

206
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,841
Okay.

207
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,537
Why don't you take off your shoes?

208
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,587
Right. I should.

209
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,049
-He got here really fast. I was surprised.
-Really.

210
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,470
-I was really surprised.
-So was I.

211
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,302
-Okay, let's sit down now.
-All right.

212
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,756
-Come on, hurry.
-The birthday boy should sit there.

213
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,769
-Okay.
-Let's go.

214
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,102
-Weren't you startled?
-My heart's still pounding.

215
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,807
Of course, I was.

216
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,977
All right, everyone.

217
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:49,645
Today's menu is pork belly
that came directly from Jeju Island.

218
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,779
I'll be the chef tonight.

219
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,866
All right.

220
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,705
By the way, what did you wish for earlier?

221
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,602
Aren't you supposed to keep it a secret?

222
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,558
Come on. Your wish will come true
only if you tell everyone.

223
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,681
-Of course.
-What did you wish for?

224
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,491
I prayed that...

225
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,621
all of us will be able to continue

226
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,922
to be good friends.

227
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,511
No. That doesn't count.
You must make a wish again.

228
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,972
-I'll go bring the cake.
-Wait, the barbecue is ready.

229
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,683
Fill your glasses. Hurry.

230
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,308
Okay. I'll do it.

231
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,772
Fine.

232
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,811
-Here, Chef Park.
-Okay.

233
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,355
Happy birthday.

234
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,539
Is that your dinner or snack?

235
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,455
It's my dinner.

236
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,838
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

237
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,168
No, I shouldn't.
I'm having trouble digesting.

238
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,460
Really?

239
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,133
Yes.

240
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,555
If your even suffering from indigestion,
that means...

241
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,191
That means you must

242
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,992
be having a hard time
because of something. Right?

243
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,110
No, I'm not.

244
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,949
You're producing a show after quite
a long time, so you're stressed out?

245
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,962
-Yes.
-But my gut feeling is saying otherwise.

246
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,342
Do you know how your face
looks like lately?

247
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,934
Come on, am I being interrogated here?
You don't want me to eat this?

248
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,434
You look like someone who's holding
a bomb about to explode.

249
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,723
Boom!

250
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,024
I thought you'd be startled.

251
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,146
Yes, you're right.

252
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm holding a bomb.

253
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,319
What? Why?

254
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,321
What's going on?

255
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,543
If it explodes properly,
it'll be a big hit.

256
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,962
If it doesn't, I'll be dead meat.

257
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,460
Your nagging is what scares me most
in this world.

258
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,796
My show has to be a big hit this time.
I'm so worried.

259
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,758
I should eat this and cheer up.

260
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,932
Anyway, they didn't put
enough abalone in here.

261
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,815
All right.

262
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,026
To lighten up the mood

263
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:21,742
and to make us become much closer,

264
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:27,957
we're going to play Truth or Dare now!

265
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,539
What are you talking about?
Let's just drink.

266
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,205
-Right, let's just drink.
-He's right.

267
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,263
-That's boring.
-But it's so fun.

268
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,338
-Right?
-Yes.

269
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,893
You know, we'll spin this to decide
who will answer the question.

270
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,259
You know that, right?

271
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,135
Okay, I'll spin it first.

272
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,562
Let's go!

273
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,082
All right. Shoot.

274
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,498
I'll ask the question, okay?

275
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,626
I've been really curious about this.

276
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,050
Are you really not seeing anyone?

277
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,313
No, I'm not.

278
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,189
I'm not. You know that, right?

279
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,572
-All right, now. Spin it.
-Okay.

280
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,568
I'll do it again.

281
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,168
You two planned it, didn't you?

282
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,289
No.

283
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,298
-I'll ask the question this time.
-Okay.

284
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,224
All right.

285
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,545
Is there...

286
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,885
someone you have feelings for here
right now?

287
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,778
Look at him. He's not answering.

288
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,567
There is.

289
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,911
-There is?
-There is.

290
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,162
What? There really is?

291
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,921
-Okay. I'll spin it this time.
-All right.

292
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,090
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

293
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,588
-I'm aiming for Chef Park.
-Good, Chef Park.

294
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,921
-Chef Park.
-Chef Park.

295
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,375
Chef Park.

296
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,022
Chef Park!

297
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,237
That was nice.

298
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,870
All right. Now ask him a question.

299
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,195
Do you have anyone you have feelings for?

300
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,384
Yes, I do.

301
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,303
Then are you seeing someone now?

302
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,386
No.

303
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,600
That person has no idea

304
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,267
I have feelings for them.

305
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,277
Then you haven't told them?

306
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,908
No.

307
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,745
I couldn't.

308
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,959
Why not?

309
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,035
Why couldn't you?

310
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,340
Because if I do,

311
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,635
that person will get hurt.

312
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,114
Let's just drink.

313
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,406
They'll get hurt.

314
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,283
Stop talking.

315
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,289
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

316
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,958
Cheers.

317
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,541
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

318
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,629
Stop already.

319
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,597
Jin-seong, have some water.

320
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,148
No! Come on.

321
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,282
Gosh, you're so drunk.

322
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,189
-Drunk?
-Chef Park's drunk.

323
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,527
He's drunk.

324
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,779
-My goodness.
-No, I'm not drunk.

325
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,865
I'm serious.

326
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,621
I'm really not drunk. Do you want proof?

327
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,459
-Do you?
-My goodness.

328
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,421
I guess she needs proof.

329
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,342
Gosh, it's cold.

330
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,514
You spilled it.

331
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,590
Well, I...

332
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,058
I really,

333
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,268
really like you guys.

334
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,356
I love you.

335
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,113
What's with him?

336
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,198
He'll regret this so much
tomorrow morning.

337
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,449
I'm sure of it.

338
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,454
I think it's time to clean up and go home.

339
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,624
He's too drunk.

340
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,622
-What do you mean, go home?
-That's scary.

341
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,905
Try to leave and see what happens.

342
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,674
Nobody leaves.

343
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,961
Until the sun comes up, okay?

344
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,085
When we finish drinking here,

345
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,512
we'll go to my bistro.

346
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,551
-My gosh.
-And then...

347
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,143
we'll drink on the rooftop

348
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,349
of my house.

349
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,390
I'll go to the bathroom.

350
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,306
Oh, my gosh.

351
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,145
-Stay here. Don't leave.
-Okay.

352
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,150
-I mean it. I'll be watching you.
-Okay. Go ahead.

353
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,402
You can hear everything in there.

354
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,404
You know, when I came here
to unclog the toilet...

355
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,275
-Go in there already!
-Constipation...

356
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,283
-Hey! Are you crazy?
-She was constipated...

357
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,365
-What's wrong with you? Go in now.
-She was constipated...

358
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,581
Go on.

359
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,703
He's so drunk.

360
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,620
-Hurry up and give me my bag.
-Okay.

361
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,957
Gosh, Chef Park's so funny.

362
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,753
What's this? Are you guys leaving?

363
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,126
-We should.
-Really?

364
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,223
We should leave before he comes out.

365
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,048
-God, I'm dizzy.
-My mom called me.

366
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,805
Come on, I know you're going
somewhere else.

367
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,058
-No, we're not.
-No, my mom told me to come home.

368
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
-Let's go.
-Bye.

369
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,515
-Bye.
-Bye.

370
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,148
-Thank you.
-Sure.

371
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,444
Are you leaving too, Mr. Kang?

372
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:13,897
Yes.

373
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,738
Good night.

374
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,710
Please

375
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
take good care of Jin-seong.

376
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,021
What?

377
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,481
Where is everyone?

378
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,954
What?

379
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,874
What are you looking at?

380
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,552
I'm looking at you.

381
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,813
Park Jin-seong.

382
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,978
I'm sorry.

383
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,325
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHEF PARK

384
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,875
Why did he drink so much tonight?

385
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,158
<i>Then you haven't told them?</i>

386
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,911
No.

387
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,617
I couldn't.

388
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,955
Why?

389
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,091
Why couldn't you?

390
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,591
Because if I do,

391
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,757
that person will get hurt.

392
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,614
I'm looking at you.

393
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,398
Hey.

394
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,201
Park Jin-seong.

395
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,448
I'm sorry.

396
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,087
What did you mean earlier?

397
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,136
<i>All right.</i>

398
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,176
<i>Say something to Chef Park.</i>

399
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,270
<i>What?</i>

400
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,231
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

401
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,531
<i>I hope you'll like this.</i>

402
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,402
<i>That's it?</i>

403
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,204
<i>Okay, next. Say something to Chef Park.</i>

404
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,702
<i>Chef Park!
We're amazing friends, aren't we?</i>

405
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,656
<i>I haven't thrown a birthday party
in such a long time,</i>

406
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,334
<i>but thanks to you, I got to do it today.</i>

407
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,707
<i>Thank you.</i>

408
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,343
<i>Next is Mr. Kang.</i>

409
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,680
<i>Happy birthday, Jin-seong.</i>

410
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,388
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

411
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,729
<i>Hi, Chef Park. Happy birthday.</i>

412
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,235
<i>For your information,
my birthday's coming soon.</i>

413
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,531
<i>Don't forget that, okay?</i>

414
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,573
<i>All right, everyone. Happy birthday!</i>

415
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,326
<i>-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!</i>

416
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,846
Hello.

417
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,729
Ms. Kang.

418
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,015
This is Park Jin-seong from the bistro.

419
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,363
I...

420
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,700
I want to close

421
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,253
the bistro for good.

422
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,832
Hello?

423
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,582
Yes, this is Park Jin-u.

424
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,642
A-jin.

425
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,442
Jin-u.

426
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,226
Congratulations. Seong-eun told me.

427
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,526
Really?

428
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,399
You look so cool working here
at the broadcasting company.

429
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,815
You'll become cooler
if you keep appearing on TV.

430
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,157
The other contestants
are already gathered. Hurry up.

431
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,203
Oh, I see.

432
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,246
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

433
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,329
I think I saw that guy
in the footage of yours.

434
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,001
What? I don't think so.
What are you talking about?

435
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,545
Gosh.

436
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,169
I think it's him.
I saw him in your hidden-camera footage.

437
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,385
-"Hidden-camera"?
-No, it's nothing.

438
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,845
I'm really sharp-eyed, you know.

439
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,180
He's the guy who was arguing
with Chef Park. Right?

440
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,437
I don't know what you're talking about.

441
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,309
What were they arguing about?

442
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,936
That's what I don't know.

443
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,533
I was putting on my earphones
to listen to it,

444
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,109
but Sang-yeong caught me.

445
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,408
It was nothing, really.

446
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,950
Then why did you delete all the files?

447
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,994
I deleted them because they were nothing.

448
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,372
Do I need your permission
to delete files on my computer?

449
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,126
This dude is ridiculous. My gosh.

450
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,539
You don't need to get worked up.
So who's that guy?

451
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,843
He's Chef Park's little brother.

452
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,925
I see.

453
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,304
I'm even more curious now.

454
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,598
-Hi.
-Hi.

455
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,931
Hello.

456
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,925
Sang-yeong.

457
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,274
How are you doing with Park Jin-seong?

458
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,393
Pardon?

459
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:31,977
I mean,

460
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,148
what does he mean to you?

461
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,119
How did you know about Chef Park?

462
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,923
How did you find out?

463
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,552
How much do you know?

464
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,632
Everything, I think.

465
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,312
Right. That's good.

466
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,813
There are dozens of staff members
counting on you.

467
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,650
Just remember that you have
a lot of people to take care of.

468
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,744
Okay.

469
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,643
Hey, A-jin. Why did you want to see me?

470
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,891
What do you want to talk about?

471
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,561
Mr. Lee.

472
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,768
Well...

473
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,818
How did you find out that I have feelings
for Chef Park?

474
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,403
What?

475
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:15,044
They say there are two things
you can't hide. Sneezing and love.

476
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,586
Then...

477
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,223
You said you knew everything
regarding Chef Park.

478
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,301
Everything...

479
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,677
What did you mean by that?

480
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,139
Please tell me.

481
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,519
Is there something else?

482
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,367
Of course, there's nothing else.

483
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,238
I'm sorry, but I need to take this.

484
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,075
-Wait...
-Oh, hey.

485
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,408
Were you busy earlier?
You didn't answer my call.

486
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,076
No, it's okay. I can talk now. Go on.

487
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,045
<i>Jin-seong, I've been selected

Hey.

491
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,118
-You came.
-Yes.

492
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,452
-You have a lot of customers today.
-Yeah.

493
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,963
You're carrying a lot of stuff today.

494
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,882
Well, yes.

495
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,972
Would you like something to drink?

496
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,346
No, I shouldn't. I'm just dropping by.

497
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,478
What?

498
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,231
You have something to say?

499
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:07,937
Yes.

500
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,242
Well...

501
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,201
There was something I wanted to ask.

502
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,275
By any chance,

503
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,905
did something happen
between Mr. Lee and you?

504
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,014
-Mr. Lee?
-Yes.

505
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,836
Like what?

506
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,889
What? Well...

507
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,641
Mr. Lee is preparing for his new TV show,

508
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,935
so he's been setting up hidden cameras
here and there.

509
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,900
And I heard you and Jin-u were caught
on one of the cameras.

510
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,487
And...

511
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:58,954
I think he found out something
from the footage.

512
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,827
Something about you.

513
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:13,507
And he's always been supportive of me

514
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,853
even when I wasn't doing my job well.

515
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:23,101
But strangely, he's been against
making <i>Sweet Munchies</i> Season Two.

516
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,936
So I've been wondering
why he's acting like this

517
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,895
and wanted to ask you
if you knew anything.

518
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,453
Excuse me. One more beer, please.

519
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,287
Go do your job.

520
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,673
Okay.

I know.

540
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,410
But then, if he didn't tell you,
there's no way you would've known.

541

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,930
Think about it.

544
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,144
You manage to cast a gay chef
in a single day

545
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,811
and the way you solve every single
little problem that comes your way...

546
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,641
All of it is too suspicious.

547
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,895
Will you offer 10 million or something?

548
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,856
Well, yes. It depends on who it is.

549
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,369
What does the chef have to do?

550
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,004
All he has to do is cook.

551
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,047
Jin-seong...

552
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,114
Come on, why do you look so serious?
You're scaring me.

553
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,714
Mr. Lee.

554
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,828
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

555
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,130
No, I'm not.

556
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,514
Do you really have nothing

557
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,303
to tell me about Jin-seong?

558
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,359
He's not gay, is he?

559
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,235
Why... Why didn't you tell me?

560
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:34,162
What if I told you?
What could you have done about it?

561
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,617
It was already too late.

562
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:40,458
Still, we can't carry on
with the show like this.

563
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,338
I really hate

564
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,180
that this is all I can tell you.

565
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,218
But A-jin,

566
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:57,096
you should see the show through
to the end at all costs.

567
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,857
-Mr. Lee.
-Honesty is a good thing.

568
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,981
But...

569
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,816
as your senior producer,

570
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,735
I don't want you to get hurt.

571
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,117
You've been through a lot
to come this far.

572
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,333
Since you're a contract worker,

573
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,286
you've been discriminated and hurt.

574
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,669
But you've worked so hard
without losing passion

575
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,259
and finally made a great show like
<i>Sweet Munchies</i>.

576
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,850
But if it all gets out,
what do you think will happen?

577
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,442
Everything you have worked so hard for

578
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,859
will be gone.

579
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,443
No,

580
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,736
you might end up losing

581
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,279
even more than that.

582
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,371
Mr. Lee.

583
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,044
You have

584
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,424
feelings for Jin-seong, don't you?

585
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,460
Do you think you'll be able to watch
and endure the person you like

586
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,552
getting hurt?

587
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,397
No...

588
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,556
I'm not going to be on the show.

589
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,686
Today,

590
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:08,145
I realized that a studio is not
where I should be.

591
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,735
By the way, you didn't mean it
when you said this is it for you, did you?

592
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,830
Why don't you find someone better than me?

593
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,949
No, you can't quit.
We have to do the show together.

594
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,581
Okay?

595
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,335
If it does, that's great.

596
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,545
But as I told you before--

597
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,803
Nothing's been decided,

598
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,764
so don't start drawing boundaries already.
You're hurting my feelings.

599
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,849
The reason <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
needs Park Jin-seong?

600
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,645
What people liked

601
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,193
was you, not the format of the show.

602
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,409
And that's why we need you,
not anyone else.

603
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,621
They say I have to co-produce it.

604
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,529
Are you okay?

605
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:53,232
Were you going to hide it until the end?

606
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,111
A-jin...

607
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,658
It means everything you've done
was because of me.

608
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,367
You decided to do the show again
to make sure it'd become a regular show.

609
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,669
When Mr. Lee came and grilled you
about the lie,

610
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,420
you kept quiet.
You did that because of me.

611
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,418
It's all my fault.

612
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,509
I started this in the first place.

613
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,969
So it's my fault.

614
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,935
You think I don't know you?

615
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,113
To hide all of this,

616
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,727
you must've suffered a lot by yourself.

617
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:39,567
Still, you've been hiding it
to protect me and <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

618
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,954
Kim A-jin.

619
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,448
Are you an idiot?

620
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,290
Why are you taking my side right now?

621
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,909
I lied to you.

622
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,578
I ruined <i>Sweet Munchies</i>,
something that means so much to you.

623
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,961
You should be swearing at me...

624
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,847
You should be blaming me.

625
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,475
Yes. I hate you so much.

626
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,476
You've been watching me have
such a difficult time because I like you.

627
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,904
I hate you for still hiding it from me.

628
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,283
I'm so scared that everything might
go wrong because of you.

629
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,781
But...

630
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,699
right now, I'm more worried

631
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,951
about you than all those things.

632
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,832
I'm so scared you'll get hurt.

633
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,708
You must've suffered by yourself
all this time.

634
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,125
I'm so sorry for that.

635
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,471
And it breaks my heart.

636
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,113
I know I'm being selfish to say this now.

637
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,819
But A-jin,

638
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,784
I love you.

639
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,814
<i>I heard he's not gay. </i>

640
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,272
<i>Then he's seeing Ms. Kim?</i>

641
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,812
Who are you to reveal the truth?
Who do you think you are?

642
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,316
But we can't carry on
with the show like this.

643
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,358
So this is what you've been hiding
from me?

644
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,942
You made such a ridiculous mess...

645
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,817
Those are the rumors going around CKTV.

646
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,315
<i>"The show was fake. They lied."</i>

647
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,827
A true journalist should write articles
that help people.

648
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:00,411
I pushed her to find a gay chef
in a single day.

649
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,168
I'll step down as director.

650
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,089
I'm so sorry.

651
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,838
Thank you for everything.
I really hope you find happiness.

652
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,171
<i>What's your relationship
with the producer?</i>

653
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,926
-What's the truth?
-I'll explain everything.

654
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,297
Everything.

655
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,722
