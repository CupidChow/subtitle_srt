1
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,313
Why are you crying?

2
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,315
Since I'm a contract worker,

3
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,202
they say I have to give it
to a regular employee.

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,526
They say I have to co-produce it.

5
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,119
You know...

6
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,797
I worked really hard to make this show.

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,921
I...

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,889
I was so happy thinking I'd finally
get to produce my own show.

9
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,092
I look so ugly right now, don't I?

10
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,094
Yes.

11
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,296
This is so embarrassing.

12
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,642
Don't look at me. I'm so embarrassed.

13
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,011
It's okay.

14
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,515
You don't have to worry

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,020
about whether your makeup is smeared
or you look ugly.

16
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,484
Because...

17
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,025
I understand how you feel
better than anyone.

18
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,027
Because you're a gay chef?

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,826
Yes.

20
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,997
I'm really hungry

21
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,708
from crying so hard.

22
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,263
Yes, you cried really hard.

23
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,085
Well, that's good.

24
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,137
Wait a bit.
I'll make you something delicious.

25
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,517
Eat it...

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,400
and cheer up, okay?

27
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,992
What is it? What are you making?

28
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,866
-You must be curious.
-Yes.

29
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,746
I'm making seafood dumplings.

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,956
Dumplings?

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,172
Seafood dumplings.

32
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,590
-Seafood dumplings?
-Yes.

33
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,551
-I'll do it, too.
-What?

34
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,011
I want to make dumplings, too.

35
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,891
-You want to do it?
-Yes, I'll help you.

36
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,388
How much should I put in?

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,099
Let me see. Yes, that much.

38
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,141
Dab your finger in water

39
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,265
so that the wrapper sticks well.
Like this.

40
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,402
Help me, please.

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Okay. Well...

42
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,896
It's going to tear apart.

43
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,858
You're really bad at this.

44
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,028
Look. Fold here and here.

45
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,874
And fold here and here.

46
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,040
Then fold here and here.
And the stuffing comes out like this.

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,290
Then like this.

48
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,919
-Like this.
-Amazing.

49
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,628
-It's pretty, isn't it?
-It is.

50
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,498
-It's a leaf-shaped dumpling.
-Yes.

51
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,795
Let me try, too.

52
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,222
Hold it like this.

53
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,263
And do it like this.

54
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,724
And lastly, take this part out.

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,846
Yes.

56
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,978
You're really bad at this.

57
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,690
They'll all taste the same anyway.

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,940
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,662
This dish is just for you, A-jin.

60
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,118
Thank you for the food.

61
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,134
It's really good.

62
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,256
So

63
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,835
being a producer is really hard, isn't it?

64
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,799
Am I not right?

65
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,270
You had to find a gay chef,

66
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,678
persuade the head stylist,

67
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,229
then be there to encourage the host
because he's really bad at acting.

68
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,443
On top of that, now you have to give
your own show to your superior?

69
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,776
God... I'm glad I became a chef.

70
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,493
That's just how my life is.

71
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,083
I've had to work hard for everything.

72
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,083
Why do you want
to keep doing something so difficult?

73
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,881
Well...

74
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,587
Because I like it?

75
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,128
-Eat up.
-Okay.

76
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,087
You'll need it to fight your superior.

77
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,054
Why would I fight?

78
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,523
Now that we have to work together,

79
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,558
I'm going to make him my best friend

80
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,642
so we can actually create some synergy.

81
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,984
I like that side...

82
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,324
of you.

83
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,162
I don't think anything is
impossible for you.

84
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,325
Whatever it is,

85
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,579
you get it done in the end.

86
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,466
Jin-seong, now that
it's become a regular show,

87
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,215
you have to do the show with me,
no matter what, okay?

88
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,647
I mean, if you don't, how am I going
to find another gay chef?

89
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,895
You have to do it, okay?

90
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,862
Okay?

91
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,869
Okay?

92
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,242
Well...

93
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,497
-You'll find a better--
-Hey.

94
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,869
Why are you backing out now?

95
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,711
Seriously, why?

96
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,212
I really want to know why.

97
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,254
Why don't you want to do the show now?

98
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,564
The truth is...

99
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,932
I...

100
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,478
am not...

101
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,357
Are you gay?

102
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,697
How are you gay?

103
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,178
Jin-u, the thing is...

104
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,049
Why did she say you're gay?

105
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,644
How are you gay?

106
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,355
Why don't we talk about this another time?

107
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,780
Could you just go for today?

108
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,188
What? Okay.

109
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,277
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,576
I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,789
Wait...

112
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,251
His brother didn't know?

113
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,838
That can't be...

114
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,969
Should I not have said that?

115
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,125
What do I do?

116
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,930
Hey, why don't you try this?

117
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,308
I made them. They're seafood dumplings.

118
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,598
I heard everything.

119
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,770
Come on. Why don't you just try this?

120
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,444
Stop trying to change the subject.

121
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,145
Why did you tell her you're gay?

122
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,277
Why?

123
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,817
Tell me.

124
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,412
What are you doing?

125
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,003
Why can't you tell me?

126
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,963
Jin-u.

127
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,587
The truth is,

128
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,130
A-jin was...

129
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,601
She used to be my fiancÃ©e.

130
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,104
What?

131
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,687
She and you were going to get married?

132
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,861
She said she couldn't break up with me

133
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,320
and that she couldn't live without me.

134
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,778
Then how can you live
in the same building?

135
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,874
She's a stalker, isn't she?

136
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,786
Did she move there because of you?

137
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,912
Yes.

138
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,541
Yes, that's right.

139
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,262
Who ordered <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

140
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,262
What's this?

141
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,095
Hey, doesn't this remind you
of the old days?

142
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,147
There were no delivery apps back then.

143
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,730
The only food we could order in
was Chinese food. Right?

144
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,280
God... You know,

145
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,118
I ate so much of this
that I got sick of it.

146
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,919
I know. So why did you bring something
that you got sick of?

147
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,169
You should try something new.

148
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,087
Whether it's food or your proposal.

149
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,885
It's so good.

150
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,306
I heard about A-jin.

151
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,940
A turf war is nothing new.

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,850
What can you do?

153
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,317
My position makes me really harsh.

154
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,319
You know I'm quite popular
among our junior producers, right?

155
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,780
I'll try and console them,
so just leave it to me.

156
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,032
And why don't you just relax?
Live your life.

157
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,078
You think you're steel or something?

158
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,911
You don't get paid more
for being a workaholic.

159
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,292
But you appreciate it.

160
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,297
God, you're really something.

161
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,549
What? Why?

162
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,972
You even know how to handle
your senior producer with class.

163
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,396
I don't think anything is
impossible for you.

164
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,108
Whatever it is,

165
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,701
you get it done in the end.

166
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,496
So that's how you see me, Jin-seong.

167
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,369
I mean, if you don't, how am I going
to find another gay chef?

168
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,457
You have to do it, okay?

169
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,828
Okay?

170
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,857
<i>Try to remember</i>

171
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,110
<i>things you like,</i>

172
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,824
<i>not things he liked.</i>

173
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,453
No...

174
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,070
No, I shouldn't do this.

175
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,253
If you get caught lying,

176
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,830
what will you do then?

177
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,626
Right. No matter
how desperate A-jin seems,

178
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,415
this is not right.

179
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,341
Let's just sleep.

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,560
Hey, Gyu-jang.

181
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,943
Congratulations.

182
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
-I heard about <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>
-Oh, that.

183
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,646
Take good care of A-jin, okay?

184
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,822
Sure, sure.

185
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,487
I told you, didn't I?

186
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,779
That it might become a big hit
since the idea's fresh.

187
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,913
Right.

188
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,908
If you hit any problems, just let me know.

189
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,872
And if there's anything I can help,
just tell me.

190
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,122
I will.

191
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,753
Anyway, I have a meeting soon, so...

192
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,131
Do you? I see.

193
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,133
Mind your own business, please.

194
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,387
Good morning, Ms. Cha.

195
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,097
Did you have any coffee this morning?

196
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,350
No. I will now.

197
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,273
Really?

198
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,741
I mean, it became a regular show
all thanks to A-jin,

199
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,701
because her editing was so unconventional.

200
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,081
Tell me about it.
How can he get a free ride like this?

201
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,710
We all know well how much
she went through to make the pilot.

202
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,999
Of course.

203
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,919
If it's going to be this unfair,
she probably won't do the show.

204
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,882
Why would she not?

205
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,632
So he can take all the credit?

206
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,758
If it were me, I'd never do it.

207
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,262
-Me either.
-Me either.

208
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,554
Me either.

209
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,547
Right?

210
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,267
-Are you enjoying this?
-Of course not.

211
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,521
Isn't it written all over my face?

212
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,523
I'm so sad now.

213
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,435
Oh... You're right. You look so sad.

214
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,317
Unbelievable.

215
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,240
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

216
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,572
-Hello, ma'am.
-Good morning, everyone.

217
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,997
See? I was right.

218
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,796
I'm sorry I'm late.

219
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,516
God... She's really something.

220
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,354
Shall we begin?

221
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,895
Oh, right. Could you say something
for all of us, Ms. Cha?

222
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,202
Now that I see all the crew members,
I look forward to this show even more.

223
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,241
And I trust that you'll do
an excellent job.

224
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,905
Please do your best to make it
one of the best shows on CKTV.

225
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,246
All right?

226
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,040
Let's give her a hand.

227
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,837
Ms. Kim is the producer
that came up with the show,

228
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,723
but with our well-experienced
Mr. Nam as the main producer,

229
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,222
I believe it'll be even better.

230
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,353
Mr. Nam?

231
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,888
Right.

232
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,478
Well... Hello, I'm Nam Gyu-jang.

233
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,361
I've always enjoyed shows that aim
to give "healing" to those who need it.

234
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,111
And I'm good at it.

235
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,355
You can put your trust in me.

236
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,236
I will do my best to make <i>Sweet Munchies</i>

237
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:17,663
the best variety show
that comes to people's mind

238
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,205
when they think about cooking,
the gay community, and healing.

239
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,290
I will make a show that will rewrite

240
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,006
Korean variety-show history,
not just CKTV's history.

241
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,631
Give him a hand.

242
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,974
Ms. Kim, why don't you say something, too?

243
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,353
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,847
First of all,

245
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,478
there's something I should let you know.

246
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,113
I'm still speaking with him at the moment,

247
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,778
but Chef Park Jin-seong has notified me

248
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,238
that he will not be doing the show.

249
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,366
-What?
-What?

250
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,209
So I think I'm going to need some time
to persuade him.

251
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,291
What are you talking about?

252
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,046
The most important aspect
of <i>Sweet Munchies</i> is Chef Park.

253
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,629
Mr. Nam, are you not confident
that you can persuade him?

254
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,967
Of course, I am.

255
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,757
I'm sure I can persuade him.

256
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,886
If Chef Park is out,

257
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>Sweet Munchies</i> is out, too.

258
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,357
I think it's pointless to continue
with this meeting.

259
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,111
-Excuse me.
-Ms. Cha, but...

260
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,277
-Darn it...
-My gosh.

261
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,329
You should've told us before the meeting.

262
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,790
What on earth happened?

263
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,956
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,209
I'm so sorry.

265
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,250
My goodness.

266
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,209
This is bad.

267
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,965
You can't even handle the casting

268
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,089
and you call yourself a producer?

269
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,432
What now?
Is the show going to be canceled?

270
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,391
What? Then is it really going
to get canceled?

271
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,725
Well...

272
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,364
It must've been difficult working
with a novice producer.

273
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,569
But now that I've joined,
you won't have to worry about anything.

274
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,821
You can put your trust in me.

275
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,867
I'll make sure to persuade Chef Park
to join our show.

276
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,995
And I'm sorry, but we should end
today's meeting here.

277
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,368
-All right.
-Thank you, everyone.

278
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,206
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

279
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,252
-I can count on you, right?
-Of course.

280
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,381
-Let's go.
-Thank you, everyone.

281
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,593
-My gosh.
-What should we do?

282
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,054
This is so discouraging.

283
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,845
Ms. Yoo.

284
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,887
I need to speak with Ms. Kim.

285
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,154
Jae-su?

286
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,648
Oh, right.

287
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,569
Let's go.

288
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,278
We have nothing to do here anyway.

289
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,818
Just need to clean this up.

290
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,284
See you later.

291
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,474
Hey.

292
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,474
Hey.

293
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,014
Don't you have anything to say to me?

294
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,394
I hope we can work well together
on <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

295
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Anything else?

296
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,189
You should apologize.

297
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,065
And you should beg me for forgiveness.

298
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,236
What are you talking about?

299
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,533
You lashed out at me the other day.

300
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,239
Why don't you do it again?

301
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,906
How dare you?

302
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,918
How dare you defy your superior like that?

303
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,585
Behave yourself.
I'll be watching you, okay?

304
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,506
My junior producers.
You two look like a good team.

305
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,141
Why don't we have some coffee together?

306
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,643
I'm sorry, but I already had one, so...

307
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,901
Oh, I see. I guess you only have
one cup of coffee a day.

308
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,610
Okay. You must be busy. Bye.

309
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,244
Mr. Nam, maybe I should go with you
to persuade him.

310
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,738
No, you can just stay here.

311
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,660
Don't do anything if you want to help.

312
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,827
God, that punk...
Why does he have to be so harsh?

313
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,457
I'll tell him to treat you better later.

314
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,755
Okay.

315
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,851
You should get back at that guy.

316
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,929
Show him exactly what you can do.

317
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,638
Let him know he shouldn't mess with you.

318
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,154
I will.

319
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,987
All right, then. I'll get going now.

320
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,120
I'll show him.

321
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,870
Good. Cheer up, okay?

322
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,622
Okay. Have a nice day.

323
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,794
You, too.

324
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,308
Seriously,

325
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,184
I think I'm a really cool superior.

326
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,900
All right. Shall we begin the meeting?

327
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,784
This seat's awesome.

328
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,751
I worked really hard to make this show.

329
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,996
I...

330
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,844
I was so happy thinking I'd finally
get to produce my own show.

331
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,364
Hello.

332
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,148
Hello, Chef Park.

333
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,323
It's really nice to see you like this.

334
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,866
Hello.

335
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,503
What brought you here?

336
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,999
We're here to see you, of course.

337
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,332
To see me?

338
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,672
Right. <i>Sweet Munchies</i> has been
officially scheduled as a regular show.

339
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,764
And the main producer has been changed.

340
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm the main producer of the show now,

341
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,932
so I came to greet you properly

342
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,261
and discuss other things, as well.

343
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,557
What about Ms. Kim?

344
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,023
She didn't come?

345
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,015
Well, Ms. Kim is...

346
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,154
Well, from now on,
you can talk to me about the show.

347
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,271
That's right.

348
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,565
You haven't heard, then?

349
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,700
You didn't need to come see me
about changing producers.

350
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:13,542
Since the main producer's been changed,
other circumstances can change too, right?

351
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,788
Exactly.

352
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,423
I mean, please tell me your terms.

353
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,958
I didn't turn down the show
because of the terms.

354
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,303
Then what's the reason?

355
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,460
Would you please leave now?

356
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,797
This is the busiest hour
of the day for me.

357
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,139
Right. You're busy now.

358
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,715
Chef?

359
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,233
Please hear me out.

360
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,979
I'm going to make <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
a really popular show.

361
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,271
Then you'll become famous,

362
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,645
and your bistro will become a hit, too.

363
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,613
I need to prep food for tonight,

364
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,153
and clean.

365
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,196
So I'm busy.

366
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,359
Please leave now.

367
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,867
What do we do?

368
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,961
If this is about money,
just tell us, please.

369
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,711
We can pay you more.

370
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,419
I told you it's not that.

371
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,140
-Then why?
-Wait a minute. He's coming this way.

372
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,559
I'll do it for you, Chef.

373
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,561
Why don't you talk with Mr. Nam?

374
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,603
No, thanks.

375
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,358
Then...

376
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,609
Maybe we should order something here.

377
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,651
-Right?
-You're right. Let's see.

378
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,651
Chef, what should we order?

379
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,107
It's actually break time right now.

380
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,532
-Then nothing's available?
-That's correct.

381
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,030
I see.

382
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,910
I don't know when break time is over,

383
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,287
but we can wait until it ends
and order some food.

384
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,291
Don't mind us. We have plenty of time.

385
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,417
Right. We have all the time in the world.

386
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,545
-Well...
-What should we order?

387
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,635
-How about <i>yukgaejang</i>?
-For me...

388
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,389
I usually don't do this,

389
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,720
but today...

390
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,352
I'll treat you

391
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,850
to something really delicious.

392
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,898
Thank you.

393
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,243
Thank you. We look forward to it.

394
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,128
Chef Park, don't be like that.
Please reconsider. Please?

395
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,508
Thank you.

396
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,966
If you finish this,

397
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,516
I will reconsider.

398
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,982
You got it. Thank you for the food.

399
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,483
Thank you.

400
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,145
It smells really good.

401
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,080
-It's so good.
-It is.

402
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,188
You can

403
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,863
eat every last drop, right?

404
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,362
God, please spare me.

405
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,371
Mr. Park. Listen.

406
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,970
Can you tell us why
you don't want to do the show?

407
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,886
It's simple.

408
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,562
Because...

409
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,392
this is where I belong.

410
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,773
I see.

411
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,032
Okay. I see.

412
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,414
This is... What's the word?

413
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,707
A...

414
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,094
-Avant-garde.
-Right. This is so avant-garde.

415
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,129
And this is totally high fashion.

416
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,973
I can see why you're so famous.

417
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,888
What brought you here?

418
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,595
Right. You heard that the show's
been officially scheduled, right?

419
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,352
-Yes.
-Hey, hold this.

420
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,483
As it's become a regular show,

421
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,192
the main producer's been changed to me.

422
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,113
So I came to greet you properly

423
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,242
and officially offer you a deal

424
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,279
to have you on the show.

425
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,912
Is Ms. Kim no longer working on the show?

426
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,286
Ms. Kim again?

427
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,870
She's going to be his co-producer.

428
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,289
Why?

429
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,339
Pardon?

430
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,460
I don't understand.

431
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,510
I'm assuming the show was picked up

432
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,931
because the pilot was well-received.

433
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,102
So why was the main producer changed?

434
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,601
From what I understand,
Ms. Kim wrote the proposal.

435
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,266
The thing is...

436
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,194
You know, she's a contract worker,

437
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,533
so it had to be this way.

438
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,609
A contract worker cannot
be a main producer.

439
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,656
Is that it?

440
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,909
Yes.

441
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,872
What? No, that's not it.

442
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,536
Of course, it's not that.

443
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,667
What are you doing?

444
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,246
Well...

445
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,335
You can just think
she and I are co-producing it.

446
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,840
Ms. Kim will be producing the show
like she was before.

447
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,883
So the format of the show
will be the same.

448
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,087
The only difference will be

449
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,007
the chef.

450
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,345
We'll have a different chef.

451
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,064
Chef Park's not going to be on the show?

452
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,271
Actually, we met him right
before coming here.

453
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,563
He said

454
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,977
being on TV is not for him.

455
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,066
Yes, he's right.

456
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,991
I mean, how was he supposed to know

457
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,369
if it was for him or not?
Or maybe he could have.

458
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,996
Oh, right. I love this shirt.
Can I try it on?

459
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,253
No, this is not a clothing store.

460
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,631
I see. You're a bit direct.

461
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,545
Imagine some students visit CKTV

462
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,803
and start touching the cameras
without permission. This is the same.

463
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,974
Yes. You're right.

464
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,808
You're disturbing me.

465
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,937
I'm busy right now.

466
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,776
Please read this and think about it.

467
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,963
All right, then.

468
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,169
We'll get going now.

469
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,209
See you next time.

470
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,501
-Have a nice day.
-You, too.

471
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,570
My gosh.

472
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,656
I mean, they're all...

473
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,294
so rude and nasty.

474
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,955
What's wrong with them?

475
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,384
What the hell was that?

476
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,630
What the hell was that?

477
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,841
Wait, I ought to... These bastards...

478
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,389
Aren't you going to stop me?

479
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,305
Seriously...

480
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,403
-Damn it!
-What the hell was that?

481
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,039
To me, being gay is
nothing to be ashamed of.

482
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,333
Of course,

483
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,092
if you have such prejudice,

484
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,092
it can't be helped.

485
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,732
Why aren't they coming?

486
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,323
Why is Mr. Nam not here yet?

487
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,000
I thought he was going to check
every single thing.

488
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,206
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

489
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,793
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

490
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,342
Yes? Why?

491
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,847
Oh, we were hungry, so we came to eat.

492
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,310
Mr. Nam,

493
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,600
it's Ms. Kim.

494
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,595
She said she's with the other writers now,
so we need to come.

495
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,976
Just tell her to take care of the proposal
without me.

496
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,194
He said to take care of the proposal
without him.

497
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,405
About Chef Park?

498
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,029
-Well, he has a personal reason--
-Hey, give it to me.

499
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,786
-Give me that!
-Hold on.

500
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,616
Hey, I'll find another chef by myself,
so you just do your job.

501
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,882
Just hang up.

502
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,719
What did he say? He failed?

503
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,684
He couldn't persuade him, either.
Why did he yell at you?

504
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,555
He's such a jerk.

505
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,099
I can't just do nothing.
I should go to Chef Park--

506
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,396
Don't.

507
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,270
You'll get yourself in trouble.

508
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,491
Let's wait until we hear
from Mr. Nam first.

509
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,369
I mean, is <i>Sweet Munchies</i>

510
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,912
going to be canceled if Park is not on it?

511
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,456
That rude bastard.

512
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,917
Kang Tae-wan? Park Jin-seong?
They can get lost.

513
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,631
Hey, my cup's empty.

514
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,853
Hey.

515
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,649
Eat, will you?

516
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,362
It's not like

517
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,019
Chef Park will change his mind

518
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,488
or Mr. Nam will find another gay chef
right away, if you don't eat.

519
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,700
Fine.

520
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,118
It's good.

521
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,592
-All right. I should eat first.
-Good.

522
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,256
Thank you for the food.

523
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,675
Try it. It's my first time here, too.

524
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,269
Yes, like that.

525
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,190
Eat more. Should we order more?
We're technically working.

526
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,731
I'm using the corporate card.

527
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,255
You're really enjoying the food.

528
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,085
It's nice to meet you, Chef.

529
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,967
This tastes so good.

530
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,563
Here. I'm Nam Gyu-jang, a producer
from CKTV's entertainment department.

531
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,311
I see.

532
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,562
What can I do for you?

533
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,896
Why don't you host a TV show?

534
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,899
A TV show?

535
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,571
Is it about cooking?

536
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,111
Well... Hey, Jae-su.

537
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,399
Oh, right.

538
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,406
We're producing

539
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,951
a variety show called
<i>A Gay Chef's Sweet Munchies</i>, and...

540
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,577
A gay chef?

541
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,754
-Yes...
-A gay chef?

542
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,043
-Yes.
-Yes.

543
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,090
I won't do it.

544
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,681
Why?

545
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Because I don't want to.

546
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,309
I'm sorry, but please leave now.

547
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,403
But we haven't finished yet.

548
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,070
Then just take it home.

549
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,975
Okay.

550
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,491
Leave now.

551
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,987
Okay.

552
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:08,538
PARK JIN-SEONG

553
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,498
JIN-SEONG

554
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,168
CHEF PARK

555
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,883
LATE-NIGHT SNACKS

556
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,305
CHEF JIN-SEONG

557
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,222
Hi, A-jin.

558
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,928
Well...

559
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:55,847
Today,

560
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,605
I came to talk to you as the producer
of <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

561
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,027
Okay.

562
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,738
I'm offering you the position again.

563
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,949
I already told you

564
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,706
that I can't do it--

565
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,999
I know.

566
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,130
But can you listen to what I have to say?

567
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,837
The reason the pilot

568
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,757
was able to become a regular show

569
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,813
was because of how sincere
and comforting you were.

570
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,520
And the viewers liked it
because they felt it, too.

571
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,895
The reason <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
needs Park Jin-seong?

572
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,664
What people liked

573
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,294
was you, not the format of the show.

574
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,158
And that's why we need you,
not anyone else.

575
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,625
I'm sorry.

576
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,009
Can you tell me why

577
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,480
you don't want to do it?

578
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,398
Don't tell me it's because
this is where you belong.

579
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,570
Can't you tell me?

580
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,709
Jin-seong.

581
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,746
I didn't come here
to hear your answer today.

582
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,335
I just

583
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,510
want you to take your time

584
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,093
and seriously think about this.

585
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,521
I'll get going.

586
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,058
So soon?

587
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,339
This time,

588
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,639
I'm here as a regular customer.

589
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,889
Okay.

590
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,259
I'm going to drink hard liquor tonight.

591
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,545
-Hard liquor?
-Yes.

592
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,551
Yes, I will, because someone

593
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,264
really set me off today.

594
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,847
I guess you're feeling guilty.

595
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,111
I hate to break it to you,
but it wasn't you.

596
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,862
-Really?
-Yes.

597
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,614
By the way, what are you giving me
for a drinking snack?

598
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,742
For you? Well...

599
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,368
I'll give you something spicy.

600
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,293
I'd like that.

601
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,428
You really think you can find someone
if we wander around like this?

602
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,888
You little...

603
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,808
Just look at the street.
How can we not find at least one gay guy?

604
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,097
Watch me, okay?

605
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,734
I'll show you an amazing way
to cast people.

606
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,817
Hey.

607
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,035
-Hello.
-I like your style.

608
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,747
Tell me. Your sexual orientation
is different, right?

609
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,499
Sorry?

610
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,174
Come on. Aren't I right?

611
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,760
What did you just say?

612
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,682
Say it again.

613
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,680
Your sexual...

614
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,352
Where were we going? That way?

615
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,307
-This way?
-Maybe that way.

616
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,186
-Really? Let's go.
-Yes.

617
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,737
Where is it?

618
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,051
Hey. Make a list of gay chefs.

619
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,192
-Mr. Nam.
-What?

620
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,070
What? What is it?

621
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:42,161
Well, I just got a call
from Mr. Kang Tae-wan.

622
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,577
Both Kang Tae-wan and Park Jin-seong
won't do it?

623
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,751
Why the hell not?

624
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,248
After hearing Park Jin-seong
wasn't doing the show,

625
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,332
Kang Tae-wan said
he wouldn't do it either.

626
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,545
Kang Tae-wan's not going to do it
because the chef's out?

627
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,051
Yes.

628
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,596
Then the solution is so simple.

629
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,348
Pardon?

630
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,680
If you persuade Park Jin-seong
to do the show,

631
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,475
Kang Tae-wan will join, too.

632
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,269
-Right.
-What are you doing?

633
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,902
Go get Park Jin-seong.

634
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,821
But does it really
have to be Park Jin-seong?

635
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,993
I mean, he's not a famous chef
who has a lot of fans.

636
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:26,201
So if we find a better person
suitable for CKTV's reputation--

637
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,583
We can just find a guy who isn't straight,

638
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,660
who can cook, and make the show with him?

639
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,917
That's not what you're thinking, right?

640
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,170
A-jin pulled it off in a day.

641
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,763
But you're failing to do
what she was able to do in a day, right?

642
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,135
This won't do.

643
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,965
-Then I should just call A-jin--
-I will go

644
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,349
persuade him.

645
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,458
-Jae-su.
-Yes?

646
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,546
A-jin and Jin-seong are close, right?

647
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,255
Yes. She's a regular
at Jin-seong's bistro.

648
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,394
Right? So that's how it is.

649
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,891
A-jin, that brat. She's so sly.

650
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,814
What do you mean?

651
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,893
You still don't get it?

652
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,848
After the main producer was changed,

653
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,358
she must've talked him
out of doing the show.

654
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,356
Come on. No way.

655
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,526
-She wouldn't play such a dirty trick--
-Hey.

656
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,242
Don't you know anything's possible?

657
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,080
Why is Mr. Kang refusing to do it, too?

658
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,297
This is driving me crazy.

659
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,918
Mr. Nam is talking to the director
right now,

660
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,797
and I'm so worried.

661
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,513
What if it really gets canceled?

662
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,554
Did you talk to Chef Park?

663
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,270
I don't think he'll change
his mind easily.

664
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,429
Why on earth?

665
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:20,307
What's wrong with Mr. Kang and Chef Park?
What is the problem?

666
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,647
Seong-eun,

667
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,652
we should start looking
for another chef, right?

668
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,491
Yes, we should.

669
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,201
-We should...
-What do we do?

670
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,782
This is driving me crazy.
Why all of a sudden?

671
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,077
Hey, A-jin.

672
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,672
I never thought you'd stoop so low.
You're really something.

673
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,379
What are you talking about?

674
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:47,672
I got a good scolding from the director
just now because of you.

675
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,508
You talked him out of it, didn't you?

676
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,811
Talked him out of it? What do you mean?

677
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,310
You know, people call me
the King of Persuasion.

678
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,267
He gladly did the pilot.

679
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,435
So why is he so determined not to do
the show now that it's been picked up?

680
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,065
Because you went behind my back
and talked him out of it.

681
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,403
Look.

682
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:13,278
My name is also on this show
as a producer.

683
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,827
Is that what you took me for?

684
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,161
Like you, I must make the show successful.

685
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,956
Be quiet and get Chef Park.

686
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,750
Or I'll make sure to kick you
out of the show.

687
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,134
What did you say?

688
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,764
If you fail to get him back,

689
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:31,336
then I'll make sure you're
kicked off the show.

690
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,048
Nam Gyu-jang.

691
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,676
Don't you think you're going too far?

692
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,189
I even asked you to get along with her.

693
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,398
Don't mind us, Sang-yeong.
This doesn't concern you.

694
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,783
What did you say?

695
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,449
Look, it's about my junior producers

696
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,449
and our entertainment department.
It does concern me.

697
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,621
Mr. Lee.

698
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,991
Do you think you're the white dove
of our department or something?

699
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,581
Am I really?

700
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,882
You're right.
I'm kind of a peacemaker around here.

701
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,130
Doves have been considered pests
for a while now.

702
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,553
And nobody wants you to do this.

703
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,093
Just do your own job.

704
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,466
It's not like anyone's going
to recognize you for doing this.

705
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,724
-Mr. Nam.
-What's wrong with you?

706
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,850
Are you done?

707
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,643
You have nothing else to do
but to meddle in other people's business.

708
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,228
You bastard.

709
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,112
Because I'm not some hotshot producer,

710
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,439
I can't even give a little advice?

711
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,145
What's with you?

712
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,735
Let go of me, you shit.

713
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,412
Am I wrong? Am I?

714
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,119
Seriously, aren't you ashamed?

715
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:40,663
What kind of senior producer snoops around
from team to team for free drinks?

716
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,616
-Stop it now. I'm sorry.
-Let go.

717
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,876
Our female director was your junior

718
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,588
and she yells at you all the time,
but you still go around talking nonsense.

719
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,223
Nam Gyu-jang must've gone crazy.

720
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,509
I'm sure he's gone insane.

721
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,013
Right?

722
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,221
He must be...

723
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,055
What should we do?

724
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,779
Mr. Lee.

725
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,781
Hey.

726
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:22,328
You were attacked for no reason
because of me. I'm so sorry.

727
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,831
No, it wasn't because of you.

728
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,588
He said all that because
it's what he's been thinking.

729
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,509
It was bound to happen someday anyway.

730
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,882
That's not true.

731
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,005
Who can I blame?

732
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:41,934
I haven't been able to produce a show
for years now. I'm the problem.

733
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,557
But you will soon, won't you?

734
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,015
You said you'll keep coming up with ideas.

735
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,113
I think that's really cool.

736
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,654
What if they get turned down?

737
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,486
If you do nothing,
nothing's going to happen.

738
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,286
If you keep doing it,

739
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,619
you'll find something
really fresh and cool someday. Right?

740
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,132
My goodness.
You're comforting your superior now?

741
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,343
-Hey.
-Yes?

742
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,973
Have some candy.

743
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,925
Mr. Lee. This won't do.

744
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:27,061
Nam Gyu-jang, son of a mother trucker!

745
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,114
No, that's not enough.

746
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,439
Sorry?

747
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,185
Nam Gyu-jang, you motherfudger!

748
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,608
You butt munching piece of cockle spit!

749
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:44,035
No one gives a flying hockey puck
who you think you are, Mr. Nam Gyu-jang!

750
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,334
So? What will you do now?

751
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,747
What do you mean?

752
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,047
A producer should take care
of the casting too, right?

753
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,378
So I'll think about
how to persuade Chef Park.

754
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,258
Good. You do that.

755
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,971
Then...

756
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,765
I should eat something.

757
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,853
Enjoy.

758
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,229
Enough is enough!

759
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:25,326
What? A gay host cooking on a TV show?

760
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,042
God... Why does he have to do that?

761
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,287
You know I hate it
when gay men come out on TV.

762
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,337
Why does it have to be on TV?

763
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,882
What? The show's good?

764
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,796
Okay, then.

765
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,974
I'll watch it and let you know.

766
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,845
Okay.

767
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,815
What are you doing?

768
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,904
What? Nothing.

769
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,662
I think you have something to tell me.

770
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,699
No, I don't.

771
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,409
Then move. I'm going to watch TV.

772
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,868
But it's so comfortable here.

773
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,578
Come on. Get out of the way.

774
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,748
Fine.

775
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,762
<i>How have you been?</i>

776
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,551
<i>Hi, everyone.</i>

777
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,175
<i>It's been really long since
I last saw a science textbook.</i>

778
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,852
<i>It's called photosynthesis.</i>

779
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,349
<i>We're studying earth science now.</i>

780
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,685
<i>Because in our class, there's...</i>

781
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,423
Hello, Chef.

782
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,256
Are you busy today?

783
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,471
<i>Today?</i>

784
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:09,095
<i>Well... I'll know for sure
once I open the bistro. What's up?</i>

785
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,890
Can we meet for a minute today?

786
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,055
It's about Ms. Kim.

787
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,758
What do you think

788
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,049
is most important when designing clothes?

789
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,601
Coming up with a new design?

790
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,928
Oh. Well...

791
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,403
Designing clothes that sell well?

792
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,734
That's not it, of course.

793
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,990
A nice silhouette?

794
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,494
To make it fashionable?

795
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,000
The person who will wear it.

796
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,882
Where they go and why in your clothes.

797
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,632
You need to keep that in mind.

798
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,763
If you don't,

799
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,223
you'll end up wasting
your time and fabric.

800
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,845
You people are ruining our country!

801
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,893
What if my son becomes a gay
after watching <i>Sweet Munchies</i>?

802
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,148
Homosexuality is a sin. Repent!

803
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,071
Is CKTV encouraging our children
to become homosexual?

804
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,490
Is there a homosexual among the employees?

805
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,989
Homosexual love is not love. It's a sin!

806
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,872
Live a new life!
Homosexual love is not love.

807
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,700
Should we just let them be?

808
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,865
Shouldn't we talk to them and work it out?

809
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,254
Me? Why should I?

810
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,955
There's someone else who should do it.

811
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,051
Go get A-jin.

812
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,724
Go. And throw this out on the way.

813
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,720
Okay.

814
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:14,262
Goodness... What a mess.

815
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,104
See you later.

816
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,733
Hey.

817
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,904
Gyu-jang wants you on the first floor.

818
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,404
What this time? Did something happen?

819
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,912
Why are you asking me that?
You'll see when you get there.

820
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,664
What?

821
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,245
You people are ruining our country!

822
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,632
What if my son becomes a gay
after watching <i>Sweet Munchies</i>?

823
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,471
Homosexuality is a sin. Repent!

824
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,800
Is CKTV encouraging our children

825
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,296
-to become homosexual?
-What's going on?

826
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,427
Is there a homosexual among the employees?

827
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,596
-What are you doing?
-Homosexual love

828
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,733
-Go handle them.
-is not love. It's a sin!

829
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,310
-Live a new life!
-Me?

830
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,769
This show's from your proposal, isn't it?

831
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,783
Are you bringing that up
whenever it's convenient for you?

832
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,820
How dare you?

833
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,033
Look. They came here
after watching your pilot, didn't they?

834
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,123
Go.

835
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,627
-I told you to go.
-I'm going.

836
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,630
You're going to Hell!

837
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,925
-You're going to Hell!
-You're going to Hell!

838
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,385
Do you know how parents are feeling?

839
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,311
I don't want my son to marry a guy.

840
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,980
What's she doing? Go talk to them now!

841
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,151
Go.

842
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,650
That little...

843
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,106
You're going to Hell!

844
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,355
-You're going to Hell!
-You're going to Hell!

845
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,367
This is Kim A-jin,
the producer of <i>Sweet Munchies</i>!

846
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,537
Again, thank you for taking the time
to see us.

847
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,884
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

848
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,589
Sure.

849
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,669
Well...

850
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,677
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

851
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,562
God, my legs hurt.

852
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,732
Gosh...

853
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,902
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

854
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,234
Mr. Kang.

855
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,944
Mr. Park.

856
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,816
So you're the producer?

857
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,449
Hello.

858
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:28,747
Well... I don't know where you're from...

859
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,503
You even made picket signs.

860
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:36,126
I mean, thank you for coming
all the way here for my show...

861
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:40,175
What I mean is that...
I feel really bad about--

862
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,891
We don't want to hear anything else.

863
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,931
Just promise us
that you won't air the show.

864
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,515
If you publicly support a gay
on a TV show, what will children learn?

865
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:53,522
Well, I don't intend to support
a specific group through this show.

866
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:57,488
So you can just leave it be and not watch.

867
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:02,030
What I want to say is that
if we admit that we're not different--

868
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,713
Why did you do that?

869
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,394
96% OF CITIZENS ARE
AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY!

870
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,942
<i>There's a perfect place
for a time like this.</i>

871
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,980
No, I'm okay.

872
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,903
People were looking at me
with hatred and anger.

873
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:18,904
<i>I felt so sad.</i>

874
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,065
I don't think
you should do <i>Sweet Munchies.</i>

875
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,034
<i>Because it'll be worse next time.</i>

876
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,414
Father.

877
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,620
You were offered <i>Sweet Munchies</i> first,
but you turned it down.

878
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,241
<i>I'm not too late, am I?</i>

879
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,495
Thank you, Jin-seong.

880
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,634
<i>Is there someone you have feelings for?</i>

881
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,956
<i>Is it a crush?</i>

882
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,421
You really think I can meet
someone I love?

883
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,467
Tell them how you feel first.

884
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,601
