1
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,233
Did you know...

2
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,781
this liquor used to be called
"The Devil's Drink"?

3
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,533
Really?

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,612
Why?

5
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,584
What is it?

6
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,459
What do you want to tell me
that you're so serious?

7
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,048
They say Rimbaud drank...

8
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,312
absinthe when he confessed his feelings

9
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,064
for another guy.

10
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,939
I never imagined

11
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,656
the day would come when I could

12
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,371
drink this liquor.

13
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,368
Tae-wan.

14
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,287
I never thought I'd tell you like this.

15
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,712
The truth is, I--

16
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,205
I'm gay.

17
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,558
And I love you so much.

18
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,853
I guess you never noticed.

19
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,562
It's been quite a while, actually.

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,400
You didn't know?

21
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,647
Tae-wan.

22
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,621
I must've hidden it really well.

23
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,329
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,672
I really didn't see that coming, so...

25
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,086
I...

26
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,642
The thing is...

27
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,731
You can tell me how you feel another time.

28
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,565
Let's drink this then.

29
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,503
I'll get going.

30
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,158
Tell them how you feel first.

31
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,162
You know,

32
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,214
only the brave win love.

33
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,729
I'm...

34
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,647
going to stop ignoring...

35
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,360
what I really like.

36
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,184
-Hello.
-Hello.

37
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,431
-Hello.
-Hello.

38
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,153
Mr. Park, did you see that?

39
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,779
<i>SWEET MUNCHIES</i>

40
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,164
Are you attending the meeting today?

41
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,580
Yes.

42
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,865
Did you eat?

43
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,286
Yes, I did.

44
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,995
What did you eat?

45
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,092
This is really awkward.

46
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,181
What?

47
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,314
Just be yourself.

48
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,893
That look on your face

49
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,435
was what I was most afraid of.

50
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,190
Tae-wan.

51
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,128
It was such a mess.

52
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,379
So you even went to the police station?

53
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,001
Yes.

54
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,507
So don't even think about saying something

55
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,840
that might hurt
Chef Park's feelings today.

56
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,006
-Okay.
-Promise me.

57
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,474
I said okay.

58
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,684
A-jin.

59
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,353
Hey, Seong-eun.

60
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,273
Gosh... Those two are really...

61
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,397
Hey...

62
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,199
What...

63
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,448
They...

64
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,001
Hey, why aren't you surprised at all?

65
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,579
You know they're dating?

66
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,674
Yes.

67
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,841
Was I the only one who didn't know? Again?

68
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,668
They're so annoying.

69
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,724
There are a lot of interesting stories.

70
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,803
Yes.

71
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:38,018
But younger viewers started complaining
that we haven't selected their stories.

72
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,520
Well, they can't expect us to select
stories that are not that interesting.

73
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,154
Okay, let's talk
about the next story later.

74
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,744
The chef's story on the previous episode
was well-received,

75
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,200
so why don't we decide
what he will talk about in this episode?

76
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,491
What do you think, Mr. Kang?

77
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,874
Mr. Kang?

78
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,000
Mr. Kang?

79
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,587
What are you thinking so hard about?

80
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,303
It's nothing.

81
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,723
-Oh, my god!
-Oh, my.

82
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,801
-Gosh.
-My gosh...

83
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,056
-No, I'll do it.
-It's okay, Mr. Kang.

84
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,428
-I'll do it.
-It's okay, really.

85
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,096
-It's all wet.
-My goodness.

86
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,234
What do I do?

87
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,441
It's all ruined.

88
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,772
It's okay.

89
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,317
You're not quite yourself today, Mr. Kang.

90
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,786
-You okay?
-Yes.

91
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,591
I ought to...

92
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,918
What's your problem?

93
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,463
Something happened.

94
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,626
What's with him?

95
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,304
Tae-wan.

96
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,175
Do you have time later today?

97
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,136
-Yes.
-Good.

98
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,646
Then can you come to my bistro later?

99
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,807
It'll be okay.

100
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,226
It'll be okay.

101
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,469
Do you want to have a drink?

102
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,595
Do you remember...

103
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,443
when we first met?

104
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,613
You said really mean things
about my outfit.

105
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,742
There's a fine line

106
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,198
between fashion and costume.

107
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,956
It means if you go overboard,
you'll look ridiculous.

108
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,419
Actually, we first met

109
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,835
in the stairwell,

110
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,972
not in the waiting room.

111
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,505
What?

112
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,476
Did we?

113
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,034
Tae-wan.

114
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,117
You're a really good person.

115
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,158
I've felt this way since we first met.

116
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,036
You're way more competent

117
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,633
and cooler than me.

118
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,221
Although you're younger than me,

119
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,215
I have a lot to learn from you.

120
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,512
That's what I've felt about you.

121
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,354
I'm so different from you.

122
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,272
Day by day,

123
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,781
I struggle to survive.

124
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:05,408
I've done things I shouldn't have.

125
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,212
So I don't deserve it.

126
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,327
Deserve what?

127
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,377
What is it that you've done?

128
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,940
I...

129
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,029
The truth is--

130
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,529
That's enough.

131
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,947
I think I've heard enough.

132
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,367
This is...

133
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,963
the second thing I was most afraid of.

134
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,455
"You're a good person.

135
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,134
But..."

136
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,126
-Tae-wan.
-I get it.

137
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,393
Let's drink...

138
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,426
next time.

139
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,356
I thought...

140
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,780
my feelings for you would be enough.

141
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,122
I guess you don't have
any feelings for me.

142
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,383
Should I go in and say hi?

143
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,661
Mr. Kang.

144
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,501
-Ms. Kim.
-Why are you drinking alone here?

145
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,998
Why didn't you go to the bistro?

146
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,044
Are you drinking soju?

147
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,093
Did something happen with Jin-seong?

148
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,217
Well...

149
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,927
It's not that.

150
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,309
I just wanted to be alone.

151
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,771
What?

152
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,524
I'm sorry. I was so clueless.

153
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,523
On second thought,

154
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,146
I could use someone to talk to.

155
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,611
Why don't you have a seat?

156
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,578
Could I get a glass?

157
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,291
Thank you.

158
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,458
Oh, right. Let me.

159
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,218
Oh, thank you.

160
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,814
So...

161
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,811
did something happen?

162
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,781
Well...

163
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,195
I told someone I liked them,
and got turned down.

164
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,989
What?

165
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,242
You got turned down?

166
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,455
I mean, who would turn you down?

167
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,894
Someone with no sense of fashion

168
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,135
and is so clueless

169
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,769
and very nosy.

170
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,318
Someone who doesn't know

171
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,276
how to take care of themselves
like an idiot.

172
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,526
But...

173
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,158
I love spending time

174
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,661
with that person.

175
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,830
I found myself smiling...

176
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,802
whenever I was with that person.

177
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,891
Thanks to that person,

178
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,730
I finally got to say out loud

179
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,307
what it is I really like.

180
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,238
I guess I fell in love at first sight.

181
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,036
Thank you.

182
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,129
-Let me.
-It's okay.

183
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,055
Do you regret telling them you like them?

184
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,150
No.

185
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,726
I don't regret liking them

186
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,403
or telling them

187
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,741
how I was feeling.

188
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,649
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

189
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,364
KANG TAE-WAN

190
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,275
<i>The truth is...</i>

191
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,567
<i>I'm not gay.</i>

192
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,471
I guess

193
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,971
we do have something in common.

194
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,017
We both have a crush on someone.

195
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,558
And we both got turned down.

196
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,653
You got turned down, too?

197
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,114
Yes.

198
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,315
Well, actually,

199
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,992
I confessed my feelings
when I had no chance.

200
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,949
Why is that?

201
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,407
Well...

202
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,089
Because I know
he could never like me back.

203
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,636
Why do you think that?

204
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,136
Because...

205
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,822
Because I just know.

206
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,066
Maybe I'm not good enough for him.

207
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,621
By any chance...

208
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,043
No.

209
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,996
Let's just forget everything and drink.

210
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,395
So what are you going to do from now on?

211
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,358
What do you mean?

212
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,158
Are you going to give up like this
because you got turned down once?

213
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,996
I think

214
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,839
as long as you don't give up,

215
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,216
things will work out for you.

216
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,217
You really think so?

217
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,465
Of course.

218
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,638
Because you're quite attractive.

219
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,811
Oh, my.

220
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,780
I didn't know you cry so much. Here.

221
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,650
I'm sorry.

222
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,237
It's okay. I got turned down, too.

223
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,905
I'm sure that person will realize
how attractive you are.

224
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,665
-Mr. Kang.
-What's wrong with me?

225
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,917
Cry more. Just let it all out.

226
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,032
Stop following me around.

227
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,243
I'm not following you around.

228
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,196
You're the one who can't stop
thinking about me.

229
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:08,724
All you want to do with me
is eat? Is that it?

230
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,888
I mean, you're always like that. Does my
face remind you of food or something?

231
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,851
Did you just sigh?

232
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,768
Unbelievable. And what's that?
Why are you glaring at me like that?

233
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,517
What's the matter?

234
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,066
Why are you guys fighting?

235
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,574
The title is <i>Food is What Matters.</i>

236
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,993
She wrote a one-act play.

237
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,412
-We were practicing lines.
-You totally got me.

238
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,041
-Wasn't it great?
-Wait, you write dramas as well?

239
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,958
There's a screenwriting contest
for dramas right now, so I submitted one.

240
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,709
How many shows are you working on?
You're so greedy.

241
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,842
I'm just doing as many as I can.

242
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,919
And I've always been so interested
in dramas, you know.

243
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,716
You're so cool.

244
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,256
Let's go eat.

245
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,891
What do you want to have, babe?

246
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,970
Let's see...

247
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,931
I don't want to be a third wheel.

248
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,806
Please leave me out of it.

249
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,773
Then can you eat with someone else?
I'll eat with A-jin.

250
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,114
Why? I'll go too.

251
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,149
Forget it! Just go without me.

252
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,526
-Let's go together.
-You come with me.

253
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,031
-What's wrong with you?
-Bye, A-jin.

254
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,937
BROTHERS

255
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,156
Tae-wan?

256
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,082
Hey.

257
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,497
Where did you drink so much?

258
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,176
Hey, careful.

259
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,232
Are you okay?

260
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,693
No.

261
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,404
I'm not okay.

262
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,775
I really didn't want to be like this.

263
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,498
So it was true.

264
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,843
You weren't following me around.

265
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm the one who couldn't let you go.

266
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,704
Wait...

267
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,882
I'm sorry.

268
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,435
Jin-seong.

269
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,406
You came all the way to my home

270
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,446
because you were worried about me?

271
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,952
That's right.

272
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,540
I was just

273
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,332
worried about Jin-seong.

274
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,924
I told someone I like them,
and got turned down.

275
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,120
It's a little something for your debut.

276
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,241
You shouldn't have.

277
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,617
What is it?

278
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,511
You got my name engraved on it.

279
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,427
I hope you'll make
many amazing shows with it.

280
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,496
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

281
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,330
I don't know either

282
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,001
why I did it.

283
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,210
JIN-SEONG

284
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:25,221
PARK JIN-SEONG

285
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,053
Right.

286
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,600
I must've gotten the wrong idea.

287
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,983
I must have.

288
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,062
Now, please pull yourself together.
Okay, A-jin?

289
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,305
Sure.

290
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,989
DELETE

291
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,383
DELETE

292
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,141
Hello.

293
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,259
All right, let's have a meeting.
Everyone, in my office.

294
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,597
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

295
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Hey.

296
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,244
-Pardon?
-The meeting.

297
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,280
Oh, right.

298
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,871
I just went to the executive meeting.

299
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,044
They were really impressed
thanks to you all.

300
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,047
So while we're in good spirits,

301
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,459
before I change my mind,

302
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,627
let's have a drink tonight
with just the five of us.

303
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,217
-Nam Gyu-jang and Kim A-jin.
-Yes.

304
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,642
-Yes.
-Do you think a second season is possible?

305
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,137
You can convince Chef Park, right?

306
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,152
You can't do that.

307
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,726
Why?

308
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,530
Because if you do that,

309
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,817
people like me will have no chance.

310
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,658
Why don't you produce a show, too?

311
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,668
Start with a six-part pilot
for your hidden-camera prank show.

312
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,708
What?

313
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,634
Oh, sure.

314
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,344
Okay.

315
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,835
What's the matter with you?

316
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,927
Why aren't you excited?

317
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,434
She's right. What's up
with the lukewarm response?

318
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,851
What are you talking about?
I'm so excited right now.

319
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,936
I'll make a proper show this time.

320
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,898
-But...
-Anyway, Ms. Cha,

321
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,565
as for Chef Park,

322
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,913
Ms. Kim and I will work out a plan

323
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,239
-to make sure he'll be on the show.
-Okay.

324
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,035
Right. We'll make sure to convince him.

325
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,249
All right. And Min-su,
are preparations for a season two

326
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,830
of <i>Changing You</i> going well?

327
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,956
Yes, of course.

328
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,673
Our CKTV's variety shows
are on a roll these days, aren't they?

329
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,127
-The most talked-about show?
-Our show!

330
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,127
-Highest ratings?
-Ours!

331
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,218
-The most ads?
-Ours!

332
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,353
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy.

333
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,970
God, if this were a dream,
I don't want to wake up forever.

334
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,312
If you don't have anything to report,

335
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,805
I think we can wrap up the meeting here.

336
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,897
-Sure.
-Sure.

337
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,754
What's with him?

338
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,289
Ms. Cha, we've gone a little
over the budget I told you about.

339
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,793
Did you have someone following me?

340
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,422
How do you know my entire schedule?

341
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,384
I know when you go to the hospital,
of course.

342
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,590
Dad,

343
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,552
why don't you drop by my bistro later?

344
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,676
<i>No, I want to go home as soon as possible.</i>

345
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,933
Come on, why do you always go home
in a hurry? You're home every day.

346
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,846
<i>You have a girlfriend or something?</i>

347
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,356
How did you know?
Did you install cameras in my house?

348
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,066
All right. I'll drop by later.

349
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,817
-Isn't that Park Jin-seong?
-Where?

350
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,945
-On the screen.
-You're right. It's him.

351
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,782
-Right? It's Park Jin-seong.
-You're right.

352
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,198
Oh, my.

353
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,536
-Did you watch it?
-It's really popular lately.

354
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,211
A GAY CHEF'S COMFORT FOOD

355
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,876
PARK JIN-SEONG

356
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,596
Mr. Lee.

357
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,478
Are you alone?

358
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,692
Yes.

359
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,979
Have a seat here.

360
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,200
What would you like to have?

361
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,196
Just a cup of cold water will be fine.

362
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,881
Okay.

363
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,357
Is something the matter?

364
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,111
Are you and A-jin close?

365
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,413
Yes.

366
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,832
How close are you?

367
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,825
A-jin thinks

368
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,376
you're like her savior.

369
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,665
She said you appeared
at the perfect moment

370
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,050
when she was having the hardest time.

371
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,636
Did something

372
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,148
happen to A-jin?

373
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,363
I think

374
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,030
you would know better than me.

375
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,052
Don't worry about the hospital bills.

376
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,514
I'll take care of them.

377
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,136
But you have no money.

378
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,023
I've been working day and night.
I have some money saved.

379
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,067
How long do you think it takes
to make a TV show?

380
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,701
For four years, A-jin...

381
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,035
She worked really hard for four years

382
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,594
and finally got the chance
to produce this show.

383
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,972
Yes,

384
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,470
I know that.

385
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,809
Really?

386
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,556
You knew that and you still did this?

387
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,106
Did you think
producing a TV show was a joke?

388
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,646
Or do you

389
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:08,277
have some kind of grudge against A-jin?

390
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,462
Does A-jin...

391
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,378
Does Ms. Kim know, too?

392
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,884
Is that

393
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,300
important right now?

394
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,135
I don't know...

395
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,728
what to say.

396
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,402
I know well...

397
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,991
what I've done.

398
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,406
-I'll take responsibility--
-You have no idea.

399
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,083
How will you take responsibility?

400
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,133
I've thought long and hard about it.

401
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,800
"Should I reveal the truth
about how Park Jin-seong is a liar

402
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,050
to make him get what he deserves?

403
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,849
But what will happen
to <i>Sweet Munchies</i> then?

404
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,430
And what about CKTV's reputation?

405
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,438
Above all,

406
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,688
what about those countless staff members
who have worked so hard for the show?"

407
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,864
Chef Park Jin-seong.

408
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,368
Don't do anything.

409
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,044
Until <i>Sweet Munchies</i> ends,

410
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,835
don't even think about

411
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,169
telling people the truth.

412
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,692
Are you open?

413
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,909
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

414
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,304
Here, enjoy the chicken.

415
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,169
Thank you.

416
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,056
-What in the world is the matter?
-What?

417
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,641
You love chicken,
but you've barely touched it.

418
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,016
And you didn't seem excited
when I told you to make a pilot.

419
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,815
She's right. You're acting really weird.

420
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,192
Gosh...

421
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,607
I wanted to be serious for a change.

422
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,986
But you guys are not helping at all.
Darn it.

423
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,124
Seriously.

424
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,245
It's hot.

425
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,208
Oh, right.

426
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,840
Chef Lee Gang-ju from <i>Today's Breakfast</i>
had to quit the show

427
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,918
because of his DUI case.

428
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,340
Well, the whole show
ended early, actually.

429
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,473
It got canceled.

430
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,599
Gosh... If you make a single mistake,
you can't survive in this field.

431
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,308
Exactly. You guys make sure
your show hosts

432
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:24,559
and staff members don't do anything
that could cause a scandal.

433
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,893
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

434
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,771
Things at CKTV
couldn't be better these days.

435
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,398
If anyone spoils this good mood,
they're dead meat, okay?

436
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:39,777
Ms. Cha, how about we make
Park Jin-seong CKTV's mascot?

437
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,834
I heard many writers are thinking
about Chef Park when they write new shows.

438
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,672
Should we sign a contract with him

439
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,501
for 100 episodes
so that other companies can't touch him?

440
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:57,468
Then what will you do if a scandal
involving Park Jin-seong breaks?

441
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,974
Every show he's on will be canceled.

442
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,925
But isn't he a good person? Gyu-jang.

443
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,386
Didn't you say he doesn't have any issues
with women? He doesn't even drive?

444
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,398
Should we be worried about something?

445
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,230
-I don't think so.
-Damn it.

446
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,824
I need to go to the bathroom.

447
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,328
Now I'm really sure
something happened with him.

448
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,841
What are you doing?
You don't smoke, do you?

449
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,885
Right.

450
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,637
No, I quit smoking 11 years ago.

451
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,603
Then why were you going to smoke?
You shouldn't.

452
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,975
Are you stressed about your new show?

453
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,272
I'll go buy chocolate for you.

454
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,815
No, it's okay.

455
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,320
All right, fine. I won't smoke.

456
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,783
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

457
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,569
Mr. Lee.

458
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,985
You were against making <i>Sweet Munchies</i>
Season 2 because of me, weren't you?

459
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,248
How did you know

460
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,342
about Chef Park?

461
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,007
How did you find out?

462
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,675
How much do you know?

463
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,808
Everything, I think.

464
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,730
I guess that's why
you've been acting odd lately.

465
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,074
Don't worry, Mr. Lee.

466
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,994
I'm not a fool who mixes up
work and private matters.

467
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,833
And I'll make sure my feelings

468
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,289
don't affect my work.

469
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,622
You...

470
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,747
have feelings for Park Jin-seong?

471
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,796
Weren't you against the second season
because of that?

472
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,337
Right.

473
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,602
I really got over it.

474
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,983
I'm really okay now.

475
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,733
Right. That's good.

476
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,316
There are dozens of staff members
counting on you.

477
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,617
Just remember that you have
a lot of people to take care of.

478
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,158
Okay.

479
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,043
We should go back now.

480
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,371
Or they'll eat all the chicken.

481
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,086
It's really good.

482
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,057
You know, I don't know what it is,
but whenever I come here, I perk up.

483
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,444
And I love talking with you.

484
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,687
Mr. Park Jin-seong,

485
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,266
how about we become friends first?

486
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,567
Let's be good friends, Jin-seong.

487
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,697
Let's.

488
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,621
Ta-da!

489
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,668
-What?
-Amazing!

490
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,459
-You eat it.
-No, you eat it.

491
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,585
There's only one claw meat left.

492
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,132
No, you made all the food. So you eat it.

493
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:27,965
Here, Jin-seong.

494
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,233
-What's with you?
-Okay, fine.

495
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,940
Cheers, guys.

496
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,270
Cheers!

497
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,823
Well...

498
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:45,569
This is to celebrate
<i>Sweet Munchies'</i> successful first shoot.

499
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,954
Cheers!

500
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,240
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

501
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,744
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

502
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,080
Dad,

503
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,297
why aren't you here yet?

504
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,272
Dad.

505
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,555
You can't drink yet.

506
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,977
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

507
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,779
Did you have dinner?

508
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,359
Of course, I did. It's quite late already.

509
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,656
Give me that.

510
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,448
Could I have noodles, please?

511
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,123
I told you I had dinner. I'm not hungry.

512
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,997
Yes, you are. Just eat it.

513
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,441
What are you waiting for? Eat it.

514
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,153
How could you only serve noodles?

515
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,572
Give us some kimchi, too.

516
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,319
Why are you so angry, Dad?

517
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,867
Because you're not eating properly.

518
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,285
I was going to eat it.
You don't have to be so angry.

519
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,335
I just got angry.
There's nothing I can do about it.

520
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,388
Dad, did something happen?

521
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,019
In my eyes,

522
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,691
you're still a child.

523
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,355
So I think you still need my help,

524
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,823
but you always act like you're okay.

525
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,573
Like you're not sick,

526
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,905
as if everything's okay.

527
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,620
Why do you do that?

528
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,586
Dad.

529
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,799
Something definitely happened today,

530
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,104
didn't it?

531
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,176
Let's see...

532
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,974
HIDDEN CAMERA

533
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,270
It's Jae-su.

534
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,033
Gosh, this guy.

535
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,526
He's no different.

536
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,087
God, Sang-yeong. Is this fake?

537
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,588
I swear to God I'm going to report
that guy to the police someday.

538
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,885
Look at you. You're trying so hard

539
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:25,683
not to get caught.
What's wrong with you, Gyu-jang?

540
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,775
Who are they?

541
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,952
Is one of them Chef Park?

542
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,198
What are they saying?

543
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,007
What are they saying?

544
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,138
Hey, what are you doing there?

545
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,813
How could you access my computer
without my permission?

546
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,688
What did you watch?

547
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,559
What?
Is there something in there I can't watch?

548
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,767
What the hell is wrong with you?

549
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,397
And didn't I tell you
this is a breach of privacy?

550
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,494
I'll report you to the police someday.

551
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,950
Seriously, what the hell
is wrong with him?

552
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,050
God... What is he hiding
that he's making such a fuss?

553
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,432
I can never understand him.

554
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,135
-Hello.
-Hello.

555
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,472
A-jin.

556
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,137
Hi. Have you checked
Chef Park's schedule with him?

557
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,936
No, not yet.

558
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,986
You should as soon as possible.

559
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,449
If we have a scheduling conflict,
we'll be in trouble.

560
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,449
Okay?

561
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,702
-A-jin.
-Jin-seong.

562
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,372
About...

563
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,380
-what happened with Tae-wan last time--
-No.

564
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,253
You don't have to explain.

565
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,336
I'm not interested
in other people's private life.

566
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,428
"Other people's

567
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,602
private life"?

568
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,978
Listen, Park Jin-seong,

569
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:24,949
you don't have to be sorry
to me like that.

570
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,833
People have a crush
on other people all the time.

571
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:33,828
And just because I have a crush on you,
doesn't mean we can't be friends.

572
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:39,213
So let's remain close friends like before.

573
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,844
That's not it, you fool.

574
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,681
"Friends"?

575
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,138
Why should I be your friend?

576
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,349
Jin-seong.

577
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,580
I'm sorry.

578
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,340
I think I lost it for a moment.

579
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,628
It's okay.

580
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,562
Anyway, what is it?

581
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,692
Why are you here?

582
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,599
What?

583
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,899
Right. I...

584
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,950
Well... No, it's nothing.
Let's talk some other time.

585
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,710
What? Did he delete all the files?

586
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,416
THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY

587
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,760
Oh, gosh.

588
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,887
You scared me. What are you doing there?

589
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,346
We should get off.

590
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,055
-Yes, I should.
-Right?

591
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,150
You're so flustered, aren't you?

592
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,153
You're suspicious.
You got some good stuff there?

593
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,824
No, it's all gone now.
I mean, there isn't any.

594
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,204
Just go.

595
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,282
Right. I can understand that.

596
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,210
-See you.
-Bye.

597
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,894
The clothes I wear, the actions I take,

598
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,347
the person I am,

599
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,390
that's my choice and my life.

600
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,765
It's none of your business.

601
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,458
<i>I have something I need to tell you today.</i>

602
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,677
<i>Can we meet at the bistro?</i>

603
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,243
-Hey.
-Hey.

604
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,325
Do you want a drink?

605
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,366
I'll have it later.

606
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:50,463
Ms. Kim, Ms. Yoo, and Mr. No
are coming, too.

607
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,261
I called them.

608
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,314
Why did you call them here?

609
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,397
Are we doing

610
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,315
something today?

611
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,225
I'm going to tell them I'm gay.

612
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,325
I'm going to tell them I've been

613
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,201
hiding it all this time.

614
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,043
That I haven't been honest with them.

615
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,129
But...

616
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,764
Why all of a sudden?

617
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,551
You told me the other day

618
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,810
that you've tried hard to hide
it all your life.

619
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,067
Because of you.

620
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,319
What?

621
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,858
To be precise,

622
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,032
it's thanks to you.

623
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,420
-Tae-wan.
-I tried to get over you.

624
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,666
I tried really hard.

625
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,916
But what's funny is...

626
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,591
I finally realized then...

627
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,270
why I had a crush on you

628
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,936
and why it's so hard

629
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,606
to get over you.

630
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,528
I think I needed someone to recognize me
and approve of me.

631
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,544
I...

632
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,085
didn't have the courage
to show who I really am.

633
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,295
So I think...

634
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,085
I hoped you'd see who I really am.

635
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,719
I was such a coward.

636
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,346
No, you can't.

637
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,061
Don't do it, Tae-wan.

638
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:57,519
Please don't.

639
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,781
You know better than anyone.

640
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,200
And that's why you've hidden it until now.

641
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,741
You might lose everything you have.

642
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,367
You might hit rock bottom at once.

643
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,581
But you did it.

644
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,158
You didn't avoid it.

645
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,961
I want to be brave

646
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,299
like you.

647
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,126
Just half as well as you did it.

648
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,434
Okay.

649
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,530
You want to be like me?

650
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,834
Then hide it

651
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,713
like me.

652
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,209
I'm...

653
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,554
not gay.

654
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,564
That's the truth, Kang Tae-wan.

655
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,319
I am...

656
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,739
a fake.

657
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,225
What are you going to do?

658
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,608
Because it'll hurt everyone else, too.

659
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,605
<i>I haven't been able to convince him yet.</i>

660
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,277
The higher-ups are thinking about
converting you to a regular employee.

661
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,197
<i>So go convince him, okay?</i>

662
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,830
Is there someone
you have feelings for here

663
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,464
-right now?
-There is.

664
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,960
<i>Because if I do,</i>

665
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,212
that person will get hurt.

666
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,134
I'm sorry.

667
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,172
You look like someone who's holding
a bomb about to explode. Boom!

668
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,836
I'm holding a bomb.

669
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,545
I think he found out something
from the footage.

670
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,346
<i>Something about you.</i>

671
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,849
This is Park Jin-seong from the bistro.

672
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:19,933
I want to close

673
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,306
<i>the bistro for good.</i>

674
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,649
