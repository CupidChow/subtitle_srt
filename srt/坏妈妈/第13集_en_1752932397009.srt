THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,940
EPISODE 13

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,150
GWANGMYEONGHO

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,620
Mr. Cho!

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,300
Mr. Cho, it's me.

6
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,930
Mr. Cho.

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,020
Have you been well?

8
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,030
Mr. Cho.

9
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,530
Mr. Cho, it's me, Choi Kang-ho.

10
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,420
Mr. Cho, what's wrong?

11
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,470
Are you all right?

12
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,930
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

13
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,270
Suicide?

14
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,520
Ms. Hwang committed suicide?

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,560
Strictly speaking,

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,780
it was suicide.

17
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,030
It should be here by now.

18
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,550
Is that the one?

19
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,350
That must be the boat Kang-ho mentioned.

20
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,440
We're here. Please get ready.

21
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,380
You need to hide. Now!

22
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,770
Darn it!

23
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,600
You need to hide! Hurry!

24
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,940
Who are you?

25
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,530
Darn it, you…

26
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,740
After that day,

27
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,570
I called you many times,

28
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,820
but you couldn't be reached.

29
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,450
So I went to the Prosecutors' Office,

30
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,660
and I heard you got into a car accident

31
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,960
and fell into a vegetative state.

32
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,960
I had a feeling
those same men were responsible.

33
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,710
I didn't dare report it to the police.

34
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,180
I was helping her stow away illegally,

35
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,340
and if they found out I was alive,

36
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,810
they would've tried to kill me again.

37
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,020
That's why I sold off my business

38
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,980
and began to live in hiding.

39
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm sorry for earlier.

40
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,610
When I saw you standing there,

41
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,110
looking rather healthy and normal,

42
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,570
I got scared.

43
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
I can't believe anybody anymore,

44
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,870
not even you,

45
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,790
who were like my son.

46
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,000
FLOOR INFORMATION

47
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,210
"Wards, dermatology…"

48
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,930
It can't be the neonatal unit.

49
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,180
It's just as we expected.

50
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,220
They completely denied
that there's a patient here by her name.

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,770
What?

52
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,310
Perhaps we were wrong.
Maybe she's not here.

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,070
We should look around some more.

54
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,440
Okay.

55
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,320
What are you doing?

56
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
-What is it?
-Come here.

57
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,080
-What is it?
-I saw a suspicious man.

58
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,240
What's with you?

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,160
Darn it.

60
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,710
You're the most suspicious one here.
Hurry up and hide.

61
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,830
-I'm serious.
-Okay, just hide.

62
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,130
Get in. It's okay.

63
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,470
-So this is the first floor.
-Going up.

64
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,520
What's with you?

65
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,570
The doors are closing.

66
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,410
-Found it.
-What?

67
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,120
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,910
Goodness, Sis.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
I found the OB-GYN department.

70
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,790
-It's on the eighth floor.
-Yes, right.

71
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
The eighth floor.

72
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,840
My gosh.

73
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,930
I wonder how big your baby is now.

74
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,430
-Goodness.
-I know, right?

75
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,760
I wonder how big my baby is.

76
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,140
Auntie needs to be here for you.

77
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,190
Goodness.

78
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,940
-We're here.
-Yes, we are.

79
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,320
-My niece.
-Gosh, we're here.

80
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,530
Mi-joo, are you okay?

81
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,030
-Do you want to die?
-Maybe later.

82
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,830
-Let's go.
-What's wrong with you?

83
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,960
This way. Hide.

84
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,960
What?

85
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,880
LEADING THE FUTURE
OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL INDUSTRY

86
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,420
Bingo.

87
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,840
That must be where Oh Ha-young is.

88
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,220
What? Oh Ha-young?

89
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,390
How do you know?

90
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,600
-Do you see that guy wearing a cap?
-Yes.

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,850
If he's there,

92
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,390
it means she's there too.

93
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
Who is he?

94
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,240
On the day I met Oh Ha-young…

95
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,490
Yes?

96
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,450
…he tried to kill me.

97
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,870
I saw his tattoo.

98
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,780
Let's go down.

99
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,080
I recognized him back there,

100
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,420
-but you stepped on me so hard.
-Sorry about that.

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,830
-Wait.
-What?

102
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,760
Those who are in love
don't say sorry to each other.

103
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,430
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,970
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

105
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,100
Sam-sik, my friend.

106
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm so truly sorry.

107
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,850
Damn it.

108
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,060
Damn it.

109
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,770
-Follow me.
-I'm sorry.

110
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,980
-Hurry.
-Why?

111
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,440
Why are we here?

112
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,530
-What?
-Why?

113
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,650
It's locked?

114
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,320
Why? It's not like anyone's going to
steal from the laundry room.

115
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,370
We are here to steal something though.

116
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,490
What?

117
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,450
-Yes, you're right.
-That's right.

118
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,290
Hide.

119
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,540
-We seem even more suspicious.
-No.

120
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,340
-Wait.
-What?

121
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,890
All right.

122
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,010
-I think I can do this.
-All clear.

123
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,900
I got it.

124
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,320
My gosh, Sam-sik!

125
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,700
Welcome.

126
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,820
My babies. I'm coming.

127
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,660
What brings you here?

128
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,040
We came to check a few things.

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,420
Is Mr. Choi Kang-ho inside?

130
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
He just fell asleep.

131
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,050
This is urgent.

132
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,880
Wait, sir.

133
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,880
Sir.

134
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,550
You can talk to me.

135
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
You know his condition.

136
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,310
He's not in the state to remember things
to answer your questions.

137
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,940
The visit to the police station
was very disturbing for him.

138
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
He's been having screaming fits.

139
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,360
-Detective Cho.
-Yes, sir.

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,780
Wait, sir.

141
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Sir!

142
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,070
Please.

143
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,820
Did Mr. Choi

144
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,570
run away?

145
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,330
If he didn't, please let go.

146
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,200
-Mr. Choi.
-Sir.

147
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,290
We're the police. May we have a word?

148
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,760
You need to stop!

149
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,180
Why do you keep coming
to harass my son who's unwell?

150
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,390
If his condition worsens
because of the shock,

151
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,020
will you take responsibility?

152
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,270
Wait.

153
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,150
Do you even have a warrant?

154
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,030
Then you can't just
barge into my house and do this!

155
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,370
It's Intrusion upon Habitation.

156
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,030
Goodness.

157
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,450
Excuse me.

158
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,790
I've warned you.

159
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,550
Don't ever come back without a warrant.

160
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,380
If you do…

161
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,090
I don't care if you're detectives.
I won't stand back.

162
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,810
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

163
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,070
You can come out now.

164
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,160
I almost suffocated.

165
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,910
I've been worried

166
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,420
you might suddenly end up losing your job.

167
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,710
I'm relieved to hear
that you're going back.

168
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,600
Thank you for all your hard work.

169
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,430
This isn't much,

170
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,390
but use it for your flight back home.

171
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,110
It's your severance pay.

172
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,650
Ms. Jin, you're wonderful.

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,410
Thanks to you,
I learned a lot about farming

174
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,290
and got addicted to makgeolli too.

175
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,380
Although Korean
is still freaking hard to learn.

176
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,670
Right, Ms. Jin.

177
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,970
I just learned a new word.

178
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,010
What was it?

179
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,800
In…

180
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,970
In…

181
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,730
Intrusion upon Habitation.

182
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,390
I love it to death

183
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,060
When you intrude into my heart

184
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,860
This is a huge hit.

185
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,490
It's blowing up right now.

186
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,370
What on earth is happening?

187
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,830
Tell me about it.

188
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,330
How did you come up with these lyrics?

189
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,710
"Intrusion into My Heart"?

190
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,790
You must be a genius.

191
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,340
We're going to the top
the Billboard charts with this song.

192
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,590
Kang-ho!

193
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,760
Thank you, Kang-ho!

194
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,550
Congratulations, Mr. Son.

195
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,600
A crime-free village commendation

196
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,180
for Jou-ri.

197
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,770
I hear you're the first village
in our area to receive it.

198
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,270
I mean, seriously.

199
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,030
I knew it
when I first heard the name Jou-ri.

200
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,740
Mr. Son, you must feel jolly.

201
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,820
Come on. This is…

202
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,030
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,660
…all because they picked
the great village head.

204
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,830
I never bothered to say it,

205
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,290
but do you have any idea
how much stress I've endured?

206
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,960
They wouldn't even pave the road

207
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,590
because there weren't
enough people in the village.

208
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,340
Because of it,
we couldn't get early morning deliveries.

209
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,510
And because of that,
people wouldn't move into our village.

210
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,050
-It was a--
-Goodness.

211
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,010
That's good.

212
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,180
I'm finally getting some recognition.

213
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,600
That stings.

214
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,900
-What is this, acupuncture? Be careful.
-That's an acupuncture point. You're fine.

215
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,570
Hey, honey.

216
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,150
How does the suit look?
Is the color all right?

217
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,490
Honey, come and look at me.

218
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,530
What on earth are you up to?

219
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,330
I want to make a suit for our baby too,

220
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,540
since Daddy's receiving a huge award.

221
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,460
She treats her dog
better than her husband.

222
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,590
I'm also an animal expert,

223
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,840
so I'll make a nifty suit for your dog.

224
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,260
You're an animal expert?

225
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,140
Well, just birds.

226
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,190
I used to run a fried chicken restaurant.

227
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,350
It went under.

228
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,900
That's my phone.

229
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,280
But I can't move, can I?

230
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,740
-Please be careful.
-My phone…

231
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,030
-Can you answer it?
-Sure.

232
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,660
Be careful. You'll get paralyzed.

233
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,710
You've never seen a village like this.
Is this Jou-ri or heaven?

234
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,790
This is the phone of the village head

235
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,500
of Jou-ri, a crime-free village.

236
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Where?

237
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,670
The police?

238
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,090
What?

239
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,680
A mur…

240
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,390
Murder case?

241
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,140
Oh, my.

242
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,270
You didn't have to.

243
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,690
This is really good…

244
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,860
More for you, doggy.

245
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,910
Gross. He can't have what a human touched.

246
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,540
Sir.

247
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,830
We came to check a few things with you.

248
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,170
You know Mr. Choi Kang-ho, right?

249
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,710
Yes, of course, I know him well.

250
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,340
He's like a son to me.

251
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,390
This is Mr. Choi

252
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,640
during his police investigation
at our station.

253
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,270
And this is him

254
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,110
when he was at the hospital
with his mother, Ms. Jin Young-soon.

255
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,230
I checked with the hospital

256
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,860
and heard he met the doctor himself
as his mother's guardian

257
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,910
to discuss her condition.

258
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,410
And these documents
were also filled out by him.

259
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,630
What do you think?

260
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,210
There's too much of a difference
to say these are the same person, right?

261
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,220
In your opinion,
which man is the true Mr. Choi?

262
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,340
The one at the police station,

263
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,390
or the hospital?

264
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,810
Police station?

265
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,220
Or hospital?

266
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,480
Come on.

267
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,440
You must be able to tell
if he's like a son to you.

268
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,860
Goodness, a son?

269
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,490
I never said that.

270
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,700
The sun.

271
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,530
He's like the sun.

272
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,870
He's always around his mother,

273
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,660
refusing to leave her side.

274
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,910
So we all said,

275
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,500
"He's like the sun that's always there."

276
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,380
Hey, Sung-ae. Are you there?

277
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,380
-You're here.
-Hello.

278
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,470
Where's our minivan?

279
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,810
Where's Sam-sik? Have you seen him?

280
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,770
No.

281
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,020
Sam-sik pulled a Sam-sik again.

282
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,480
Hey, don't pile on like that.

283
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,270
Have you had dinner?

284
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,230
-If not, you should eat.
-What?

285
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,320
My gosh, what's all this?

286
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,870
Skate, braised short ribs,
sweet and sour pork,

287
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,160
and stir-fried glass noodles too?

288
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,740
Is it a special day?

289
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,500
It's nothing like that.

290
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,000
I just made them
because the kids enjoy them.

291
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,420
Eat up.

292
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,830
Don't worry about the kids.

293
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,960
Just play your hand.

294
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,170
-Yes.
-It's my turn?

295
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,630
-Yes.
-Let's see.

296
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,800
Then…

297
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,890
This one.

298
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,970
Goodness me.

299
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,520
How many times do I have to tell you
that these are different suits?

300
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,230
This one is all black

301
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,310
but this one is mixed with red dots.

302
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,770
Good grief.

303
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,980
In that case,

304
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,400
-what should I play?
-Come on!

305
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,900
Goodness gracious.

306
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,740
You can't show me your entire hand!

307
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,740
Wait.

308
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,700
You only got three cards.
I went first, so you should have four.

309
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,620
-Really?
-What?

310
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
-Goodness. What?
-Where did it go?

311
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,410
-We're done with this round.
-Wait.

312
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
-Did you pick up an extra card?
-We're done?

313
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,210
-Wait.
-I almost lost big. What a relief!

314
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,130
I was so close to winning the game,

315
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,760
-but you ruined it!
-Put it down.

316
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,630
-I had it in my hand.
-Put that down.

317
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,220
This is awful.

318
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,140
Goodness, are you two in this together?

319
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,350
Darn it!

320
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,770
Don't worry.

321
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,020
We'll play all night
and you can win all this from me.

322
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,980
All night?

323
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,480
You never play Go-Stop.
What's gotten into you?

324
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,530
Tell me about it.

325
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,240
You've been acting odd since last night.

326
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,360
Not only did you sing and dance,

327
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,030
you even had a drink.

328
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,790
When someone acts out of the ordinary,
it means they'll die soon.

329
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,460
Sung-ae!

330
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,170
You startled me.

331
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,210
Why are you yelling?

332
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,250
Please!

333
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,380
You need to stop blurting out words
without thinking.

334
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,220
Come on. Don't be like that.

335
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,050
What the hell did I do?

336
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,050
I was just making a joke

337
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,930
to have a laugh.

338
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
To have a laugh?

339
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,980
Is life and death funny to you?

340
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,400
Is it?

341
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,150
There are things
you should and shouldn't say.

342
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,650
How dare you
say something like that to her?

343
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,240
"How dare you"?

344
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,410
Darn it.

345
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,990
That's how you've thought of me all along?

346
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,830
So you're saying

347
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,250
a mother of a thief like me

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,710
shouldn't dare to speak that way

349
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,590
to a mother of a prosecutor?

350
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,880
Tell me!

351
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,380
Is that what you're saying?

352
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,470
-You must be drunk. Stop it.
-Don't! I'm not drunk!

353
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,680
What do you know anyway?

354
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,470
A mother like you with a smart son
has no idea what it's like!

355
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,940
Kang-ho got all the attention

356
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,190
for being smart and getting good grades.

357
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,360
And now he's getting all the attention

358
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,940
because he's become an idiot.

359
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,610
Hey, do you even know

360
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,660
how much derision I suffered

361
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,750
because people compared your son to mine?

362
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,160
Have you gone insane?

363
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,710
What's wrong with you?

364
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,960
-Come here! Let's go home.
-Darn it. Let go!

365
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll walk out on my own!

366
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,340
-Let's go! Cut it out!
-Let go of me!

367
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,920
-I don't care if he's a prosecutor.
-That's enough!

368
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,970
-You can't do this to me.
-Stop it!

369
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,800
-Darn it.
-That's enough!

370
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,680
Good grief!

371
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,020
Good grief!

372
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,440
-I can't deal with this!
-Where are you going?

373
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,940
Good grief!

374
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,230
Goodness.

375
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,280
No, it's all right.

376
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,070
Goodness, it's all right. Don't cry.

377
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,070
My babies, don't cry.

378
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,620
Why are you acting so childish?

379
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,620
-Goodness me.
-Sung-ae.

380
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,580
I need to talk to you.

381
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,960
Hear me out!

382
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,500
Forget it, you brat.

383
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,460
You're out of my life for good,

384
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,470
so just have fun
humoring Young-soon all the time

385
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,090
-and have a great life!
-Enough.

386
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,300
Goodbye.

387
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,760
Young-soon

388
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,470
is dying.

389
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,230
She has stage four stomach cancer.

390
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,570
No surgery or medicine

391
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,730
can make her better.

392
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,410
That brat must've gone crazy.

393
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,160
What kind of nonsense is that?

394
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,200
I honestly wish I was just insane.

395
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,540
I really want this to be nonsense.

396
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,670
How can this…

397
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,550
How can… What will she…

398
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,520
Jin Young-soon!

399
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,020
Come out!

400
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,450
Sung-ae.

401
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,130
You.

402
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,260
How could you do this to me?

403
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,430
How could you do this to me
to the very end?

404
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,390
You turned me into this crazy woman.

405
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,980
You can't go anywhere.

406
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,060
Stop this nonsense!

407
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,270
I won't accept this.

408
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,110
There is no terminal illness
in this day and age.

409
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,660
There's no illness that's incurable!

410
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,830
So,

411
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,910
go get yourself treated right now!

412
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,330
You can't go anywhere.

413
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,960
You need to stay by my side

414
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,130
and fight with me for the rest of my life.

415
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,550
You brat.

416
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,340
Go get treated now.

417
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,260
Go get treated, you brat.

418
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,180
Good grief!

419
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,060
I hate you.

420
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,230
You damned brat.

421
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,070
You need to live to see Sam-sik succeed.

422
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,900
You must live to envy me

423
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,530
and be mean to me out of jealousy.

424
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,160
You must live
to throw a fit at me, you brat.

425
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,290
Sung-ae,

426
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,500
I always envied you.

427
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,630
You have a wonderful husband
by your side that loves you

428
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,380
and a son who's healthy and amiable.

429
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,060
I was always jealous.

430
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,850
Goodness, what are we going to do?

431
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,060
You poor brat.

432
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,190
What do we do with you?

433
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,480
You poor thing…

434
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,990
-Thank you.
-I had a good trip thanks to you.

435
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,070
And this.

436
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,330
This is fresh abalone.

437
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,370
Please have it with your mother.

438
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,660
Goodness, abalone?

439
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,500
They're her favorite. Thank you.

440
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,500
I'll see you soon.

441
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,630
Okay, sir.

442
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,840
Let me know whenever you need my help.

443
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,800
I will.

444
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,530
-Investigation Officer.
-Yes?

445
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,490
This phone belonged to Park Cheol-su.

446
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,530
He was the defendant in the Woobyeok
construction site case two years ago.

447
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,080
Can you run a digital forensic on this?

448
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,670
But he abandoned the appeal,
and the case has been closed.

449
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,580
I know.

450
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,420
But there's new evidence,
so we must uncover the truth, even now.

451
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,010
Anything that would
help take down Woobyeok Group would do,

452
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,100
so please take a look.

453
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,680
Are you really

454
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,640
going to take down Woobyeok?

455
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,100
Well…

456
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,110
The higher-ups colluded

457
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,650
to destroy all the evidence,

458
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,400
-so it won't be easy.
-It's not that.

459
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,780
To be honest,

460
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,740
I'm not sure if you're
Woobyeok's enemy or ally.

461
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,960
Mr. Park Cheol-su's wife visited me
and told me about this phone.

462
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,040
She made a scene saying
you destroyed the only evidence

463
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,000
and then got dragged out.

464
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,170
The same goes for Yoon Jae-min's case.

465
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,340
Last time, your mother came
and got into a huge fight

466
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,800
with Jung Jong-gu's mother
who was protesting.

467
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,890
That day

468
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,270
was the first time
I felt like quitting my job.

469
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,440
Your mother

470
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,440
yelled at her saying that her son
wouldn't have done something so terrible,

471
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,190
but I couldn't side with her.

472
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,830
I've stood by your side
and assisted you for the longest time.

473
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,160
But to be honest,

474
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,750
I'm not sure what you're really like.

475
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,220
Thank you

476
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,390
for not quitting your job.

477
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,140
Sorry?

478
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,560
I finally have a chance to show you
what I'm really like.

479
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,730
I can't guarantee…

480
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,530
that I'll succeed.

481
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,650
But for the longest time,

482
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,120
you've worked tirelessly to support me,

483
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,120
so I'll make sure
you won't regret your efforts.

484
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,460
Can you really

485
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,220
keep that promise?

486
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,600
Then I'll do it.

487
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,600
We have to do that to Choi Kang-ho?

488
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,560
I always wondered

489
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,020
why Oh Tae-soo
was so desperate to kill Kang-ho.

490
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,190
And it turns out, it wasn't Kang-ho
who killed Hwang Soo-hyun.

491
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,030
I knew it.

492
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,610
Kang-ho isn't the type of guy

493
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,370
to let go once he's onto something.

494
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,410
However,

495
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,660
Oh Tae-soo got wind of it

496
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,460
and acted first.

497
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,420
He killed

498
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,380
Hwang Soo-hyun and the baby,

499
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,260
then framed Choi Kang-ho as the father

500
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,430
and the prime suspect in the murder.

501
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,050
So,

502
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,310
what if the baby's body is found

503
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,640
or Choi Kang-ho regains his memories?

504
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,020
What will happen then?

505
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,820
Now, before any of that happens,

506
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,530
we'd have to get rid of him, right?

507
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,330
How long do we have to stay like this?

508
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,120
Why isn't that punk leaving?

509
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,630
This won't do.

510
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,260
The hospital will close
before that punk leaves.

511
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,470
-Let's begin.
-Sam-sik.

512
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,680
Wait.

513
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,180
Why don't you do it instead?

514
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,680
This is killing me.

515
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,220
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

516
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,310
What do you think Oh Ha-young will do
when she sees me?

517
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,310
This may be killing you

518
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,310
but I'll really be dead if she catches me.

519
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,480
Okay, give me a second.

520
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,200
Look at me. Wear this and the mask.

521
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,620
Gosh, you look so smart.

522
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,450
You look very clever.

523
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,750
You can do this. You got it, Mi-joo!

524
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,540
No, I can't!

525
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,000
I really can't do this. Sam-sik, please.

526
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,500
I don't have a choice then.

527
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,050
-I must help you.
-How?

528
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,050
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

529
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,610
What is it?

530
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,650
I'm here to see the patient.

531
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,110
A doctor was just here.

532
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,030
The doctor who just came by called.

533
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,450
The patient has
a severely unstable state of mind,

534
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,990
so she requires counseling.

535
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,040
I'll go back if she doesn't need me.

536
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,160
Wait.

537
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,630
"Joo Gwang-cheol"?

538
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,220
Such a masculine name, right?

539
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,510
My parents gave me this name
hoping to have a son next.

540
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Aren't we all sick and tired
of this preference for boys?

541
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,400
The counseling will take some time.

542
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,910
Ms. Oh Ha-young?

543
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,670
Get out.

544
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,840
May I have a word with you?

545
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,210
Get out of here.

546
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,880
Yes, exactly.

547
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,550
Let's get out of here together.

548
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,600
You know Choi Kang-ho, right?

549
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,190
If you scream now,

550
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,450
you'll never get out of this room.

551
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,330
Do you remember
what you asked of me a while ago?

552
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,040
I'll find the evidence.

553
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
So until then,

554
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,460
you must stay alive in here.

555
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,800
Find out the license plate number
of the car

556
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,720
and recover the dashcam footage
no matter what.

557
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,260
I have that footage.

558
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,240
You should cut your nails once you're out.

559
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I got this only a month ago.

560
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,460
Who are you?

561
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,050
Why are you doing this?

562
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,590
What about you?

563
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,930
Why did you do that to Kang-ho?

564
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,430
What did I do?

565
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,810
Aren't you the least bit sorry?

566
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,310
He was once

567
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,610
someone you loved, wasn't he?

568
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,030
He betrayed me first.

569
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,950
He betrayed me before he betrayed you.

570
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,240
But I didn't try to kill him.

571
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,990
Let's get out.

572
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,540
You must confess everything.

573
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
No!

574
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,790
Why not?

575
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,540
Because of your dad?

576
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,420
He's capable of killing his own child.

577
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,170
He already did.

578
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,090
He killed your sibling, a newborn baby.

579
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,180
And what about you?

580
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,350
Look what he's done to you.

581
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,970
Do you think this is living?

582
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,270
He put you up to killing a man

583
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,600
and locked you up in here
as a mental patient.

584
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,070
Even beasts wouldn't do that to their own.

585
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,900
And now,

586
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,450
he wants to be a president of a country?

587
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,370
No, I can't condone it.

588
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,040
If you don't do it, I'll stop him.

589
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,250
Then he'll kill you too.

590
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,580
I'm sure.

591
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,800
He's a man who would destroy
anything that gets in his way.

592
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,970
Just recently,

593
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,630
he tried to kill Kang-ho again.

594
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,640
As if killing his father wasn't enough,

595
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,520
this time, he locked him up
with his mother in the farm

596
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,980
and set it on fire.

597
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,440
This is

598
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,070
your last chance at redemption.

599
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,190
At this rate,

600
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,400
Kang-ho may really die.

601
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,030
If you ignore it,
you'll become an accomplice again.

602
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,240
But of course,

603
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,240
you won't go to jail.

604
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,370
Because…

605
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,960
the moment something happens to Kang-ho,

606
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,460
you'll die at my hands.

607
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,970
Let's say I do get out of here.

608
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,430
Then what?

609
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,890
Report my dad to the police?

610
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,230
His influence runs deep.

611
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,230
That includes the police
and the prosecution.

612
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,940
Everywhere,

613
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,110
but one.

614
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,240
Choi Kang-ho.

615
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,830
It's been over an hour.

616
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,540
-Move aside!
-What?

617
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,210
She's in hypovolemic shock!

618
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,420
Hype what?

619
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,750
Hypovolemic shock!

620
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,130
It's an emergency!

621
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,170
-Wait! Just one call!
-It's an emergency!

622
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,380
Sam-sik!

623
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,260
-Mi-joo!
-Sam-sik! Come on!

624
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,890
-Sam-sik, let's go!
-Let's go.

625
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,510
-Are you okay?
-It's an emergency!

626
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,560
Get them!

627
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,020
-Goodness.
-They're coming!

628
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,310
Wait!

629
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,190
Come on.

630
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,480
No!

631
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,070
My goodness!

632
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,070
Sam-sik, hurry!

633
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,950
Wait, you're that…

634
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,990
Damn it.

635
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,950
Wait for me!

636
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,700
-Hurry!
-Come on!

637
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,870
Close the doors!

638
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,250
-Close the doors!
-Go away!

639
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,970
Take the stairs.

640
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,220
Run!

641
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,730
Mi-joo!

642
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,690
Kang-ho, catch!

643
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Mi-joo!

644
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,900
How could you do something so dangerous?
You're in for it now!

645
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,400
-Goodness.
-Go!

646
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,620
-Get in.
-Okay. Oh Ha-young too!

647
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,410
-Get in the back!
-Hurry!

648
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,950
Wait, I'm not insured with this car.

649
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,120
-Are we good?
-Go!

650
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,330
Hurry!

651
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,670
Are you all insane?

652
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,840
-Mi-joo, you.
-No.

653
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,100
We were perfect. Everyone was great.

654
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,890
It was excellent.

655
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,770
Our plan was more perfect than General
MacArthur's Incheon Landing Operation.

656
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,940
They may not have seen our faces,
but they probably got the plate number.

657
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,400
Come on. Who am I?

658
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,450
I'm Bang Sam-sik.

659
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,030
I disguised it beforehand.

660
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,830
Even ghosts wouldn't know who we are.

661
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,540
SAM-SIK'S MILL

662
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,710
What now? Even ghosts wouldn't know?

663
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,130
-Let go of me.
-That's enough, Mi-joo.

664
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,250
What's wrong?

665
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,460
Is something going on?

666
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,170
It'll be too dangerous
to return to the village.

667
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,380
Let's find a different place.

668
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,090
Can't we just report this to the police?

669
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,390
-No.
-No.

670
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,890
We abducted her.

671
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,310
Who are we going to report?

672
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,350
We didn't abduct anyone.

673
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,230
We rescued her.

674
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,770
Who would believe that?

675
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,020
Would you?

676
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,400
Man, what's with my life?

677
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,940
I'm a thief,

678
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,570
a blackmailer, and now an abductor?

679
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,740
Darn it.

680
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,160
What did I get myself into
while trying to help a friend?

681
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Wait.

682
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,950
Friend?

683
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,290
Who's my friend?

684
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,000
Come to think of it, this is absurd.

685
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,420
Why in the world
am I helping you, Kang-ho?

686
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,800
I begged you to help me,

687
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,350
but you didn't even flinch
and locked me up in prison.

688
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,640
You're nitpicking over that now?

689
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,270
-It's okay.
-I didn't have an opportunity before.

690
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,270
He's only just regained his senses!

691
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
All right.

692
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,270
First off,

693
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,150
Ha-young participated in the escape,
so this isn't abduction.

694
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,700
The security cameras would've caught it,
so they can't report us.

695
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,620
But we also can't report them.

696
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,330
We can't let anybody find out
until we're thoroughly prepared.

697
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,870
Okay, Mi-joo?

698
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,590
A place where nobody can find us.

699
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,550
Man, I do know this very secretive place.

700
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,760
Where are we?

701
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,850
A place that isn't open to just anybody.

702
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,850
However, it's also a place
that's hard to leave.

703
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,230
If we go inside, I can't guarantee
that we'll make it out alive.

704
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,360
DO NOT ENTER

705
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,110
-He's coming out!
-What?

706
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,320
Hey! Goodness.

707
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,820
Good grief.

708
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,780
-What?
-What are they doing?

709
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,070
Why are they so scary?

710
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,700
Kang-ho, listen carefully.

711
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,790
I'm risking my life bringing you here.

712
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,170
Because we're friends.

713
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,710
Hey, where are you going?

714
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,460
You crazy punk! Where are you going?

715
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,390
Mom, mom, come here

716
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,890
And look at this

717
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,180
Look at this.

718
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,900
You've been ignoring my calls.

719
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,900
I never imagined you would

720
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,860
Show up on your own

721
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,820
So?

722
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,950
Did you bring what you promised?

723
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,330
It's not ready yet.

724
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,330
Instead,

725
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,750
I brought my best friend.

726
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,470
Your friend?

727
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,270
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

728
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,480
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

729
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,270
-Please sit.
-Sir, this way.

730
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,280
May my officers sit too?

731
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,860
Of course. Come this way.

732
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,950
-Please.
-Sure.

733
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,330
You've illegally purchased,

734
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,960
renovated, and sailed a ship,

735
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,170
and even operated a gambling house.

736
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,960
Also, you failed to pay your employees,

737
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,130
blackmailed, confined,
resorted to violence,

738
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,260
and made
an illegal organ trading contract.

739
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,100
It seems that your business
should be discussed with me, a prosecutor.

740
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,350
But apparently, you have business
with my dear friend, Sam-sik.

741
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,640
No, sir. I have no idea
what you're saying.

742
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,850
Sam-sik, do I have

743
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,320
any business with you?

744
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,650
You wanted 100 million won from me.

745
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,490
Gosh.

746
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,820
Did you really take it that way?

747
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,030
There must be a misunderstanding.

748
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,500
Sam-sik and I were very close

749
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,040
since our schooldays.

750
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,410
We weren't.

751
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,790
Sam-sik and I attended the same school.

752
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,670
Not that school.

753
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,550
Prosecutor Choi,
you already know what I mean.

754
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,220
I closed the gambling house ages ago,

755
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,300
and look at my staff.

756
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,310
They don't look like they'd blackmail,
confine, or hurt anyone.

757
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,770
Come on, smile.

758
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,100
Aren't they cute?

759
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,940
Something like that
has never happened around here.

760
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,190
I see.

761
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,990
But I heard this hotel
was a private gambling den

762
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,450
open for members only.

763
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,280
Goodness, that's absurd.

764
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,330
This is simply my home.

765
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,790
My house of joy. Home sweet home.

766
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,300
In that case,

767
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,550
may my officers stay here for a few days

768
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,760
and investigate?

769
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,260
Sorry?

770
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,390
Of course.

771
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,560
Of course, this is just my home.

772
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,480
You can just live here.

773
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,650
If anything happens to my officers

774
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,150
or to my dear friend Sam-sik…

775
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,240
It'll be my fault, obviously.

776
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,820
I'll make sure they don't get hurt.

777
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,910
Goodness.

778
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,450
Look at that mess.

779
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,710
Once they burn all those shady ledgers,

780
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,580
they'll be wetting their beds tonight.

781
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,590
What's that?

782
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,680
What?

783
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,760
Fireworks?

784
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,600
My gosh, that's pretty.

785
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,850
-Did you prepare this?
-How did you know?

786
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,690
My gosh.

787
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,990
Aren't you cold?

788
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,370
I am. It's a bit chilly by the sea.

789
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,160
I told you to stay inside.

790
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,540
Why did you come out?

791
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,830
I figured the two of them

792
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,670
needed some time alone.

793
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:26,970
How pretty.

794
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,850
I know it wasn't an easy decision.

795
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,690
Thank you.

796
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,610
I'm not doing this for you. It's for me.

797
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,070
My life will be a living hell
if I don't do this.

798
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,870
And I'm the cause of that hell.

799
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,370
You were innocent,
but I dragged you into this.

800
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,790
I hurt you deeply.

801
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,170
I'm sorry.

802
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,210
Did you…

803
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,550
ever love me?

804
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,760
I was in love

805
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,550
with someone else.

806
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,270
I thought so.

807
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,440
You always seemed to yearn for someone.

808
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,070
I hated that

809
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,610
and it made me jealous.

810
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,820
That must be why I fell
for my dad's lie when he said

811
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,450
Hwang Soo-hyun was your woman.

812
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,700
The person you love…

813
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,040
is Lee Mi-joo, right?

814
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,880
Yes.

815
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,380
It's Lee Mi-joo.

816
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,180
What's taking you so long
to pick up your jacket?

817
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,070
I'm sure they're after us.

818
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,780
So don't leave the hotel, okay?

819
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,200
Where are you going?

820
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,490
I found Ha-young thanks to you two.

821
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,120
I need to find evidence on Song Woo-byeok.

822
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,490
Song Woo-byeok?

823
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,540
How are you going to find that?

824
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,580
I thought the evidence you had
were all destroyed.

825
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,130
There's one last evidence left.

826
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,500
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

827
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,550
It's not dangerous, is it?

828
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,130
I'm going there
to make sure there's no further danger.

829
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,350
My dear friend, Bang Sam-sik.

830
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,480
Please keep them safe.

831
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,730
I'll be back.

832
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,360
Okay.

833
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,990
Hey, Mi-joo!

834
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,300
I told you, didn't I?

835
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,930
That if you saved my life once again,

836
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,930
I'd let you marry me.

837
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,730
You saved me from choking on candy

838
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,810
and from the motorcycle accident.

839
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,150
Do you know
the last thing you did to save me?

840
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,070
Our children.

841
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,940
You weren't by our side,

842
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,490
but I was always with you.

843
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,830
So make sure you come back.

844
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,840
Come back and live with us
for the rest of your life, okay?

845
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,260
Thanks, Mi-joo.

846
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,720
I'll make sure I do that.

847
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,690
I'll be back.

848
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,030
Hey.

849
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,990
A little lower and my lips are right here.

850
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,450
Was it too far down?

851
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,490
Was it too far for you to reach down?

852
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,540
Was it?

853
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:52,820
Goodness.

854
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,120
You always came over with a stomachache,

855
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,830
but it never dawned on me
that you had to see a doctor.

856
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,950
I shouldn't be the village head.

857
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,000
How is that your fault?

858
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,040
You told me to see a doctor
time and time again,

859
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,750
but I never listened.

860
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,220
You had to suffer all alone.

861
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,430
We spent our time in this village
like a family.

862
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,260
Why didn't you tell me?

863
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,350
How could you let me hear this

864
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,440
from a detective
who's a complete stranger?

865
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,730
Detective?

866
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,360
Yes.

867
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,690
Some detectives came in the afternoon
and asked me about Kang-ho,

868
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,190
regarding a murder case.

869
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,660
No, it wasn't Kang-ho.

870
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,990
Goodness, of course, it wasn't.

871
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,740
Young-soon.

872
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,620
I know it's hard for you,

873
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,420
but I need to know what's going on
to help you.

874
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,380
So tell me everything.

875
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,510
What on earth is happening to Kang-ho?

876
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,350
Please stop crying.

877
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,730
You'll break Young-soon's heart even more.

878
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,310
Goodness.

879
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,400
Sung-ae, please stop crying.

880
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,610
Goodness.

881
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:16,700
By the way, why do you have
those spoons on your eyes?

882
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,410
I can't open my eyes from crying so much.

883
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,870
Why is everyone crying?

884
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:28,460
Everyone is crying,
so it's making me cry too.

885
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,590
Goodness.

886
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,760
Goodness.

887
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,970
Not you kids as well.

888
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,550
Don't cry.

889
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,760
Goodness, don't cry, my babies.

890
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,390
Don't cry.

891
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,640
Your mom.

892
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,480
Let's call your mom.

893
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,980
Mi-joo, it's me.

894
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,780
Can you pick up the kids

895
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,820
from Kang-ho's place on your way home?

896
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,490
Mom, I was actually going to call you.

897
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,910
I won't be home tonight.

898
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:05,660
I actually won't be home for a few days.

899
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,330
What do you mean?

900
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,130
Where are you? Why can't you come home?

901
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,300
Well, my friend's father passed,

902
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,590
so I'm at a wake.

903
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,220
Mi-joo, the food is here. Come.

904
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,470
Wait.

905
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,680
That voice.

906
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,680
Isn't that Sam-sik?

907
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,350
Are you with him?

908
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,850
Yes, she's a mutual acquaintance.

909
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,020
Your jjajangmyeon is getting soggy. Come.

910
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,650
-Jjajangmyeon?
-Hurry.

911
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,730
So you eat jjajangmyeon at a wake?

912
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,650
You brat. Where are you?

913
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,990
Mom, the thing is…

914
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,990
What are you doing with Sam-sik
that you can't come home?

915
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,120
Have you

916
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,030
moved on from Kang-ho
to Sam-sik, of all people?

917
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,540
It's nothing like that.

918
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,210
Anyway, I can't tell you now.

919
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,790
What do you mean?

920
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,420
Why can't you tell me?

921
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,460
Wait.

922
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,800
Mi-joo.

923
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,960
Something is going on, right?

924
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,300
I heard Sam-sik took his parents' minivan.

925
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,550
Are you in trouble right now?

926
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,180
Tell me if that's the case.

927
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,560
I'll call the police right away.

928
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,930
No, Mom. Don't.

929
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,850
-Not the police.
-Not the police?

930
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,560
Goodness, so something
is going on with you.

931
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,900
Sam-sik, that punk. That son of a gun!

932
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,940
Mom, please. Calm down.

933
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,940
How can I calm down right now?

934
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,900
How? I'm hanging up.

935
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,160
-I have to call the police--
-Mom, please!

936
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,830
The thing is,

937
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,540
it's not about me.

938
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,460
It's Kang-ho.

939
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,920
What? Who?

940
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,840
Kang-ho?

941
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,840
Yes.

942
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,590
So I have to help him for a few days.

943
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,640
But he's in the hospital.

944
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,890
Are you staying out

945
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,560
to look after him?

946
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,230
I will explain everything later.

947
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,730
You brat!

948
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,310
You cursed brat.
You're still out of your senses.

949
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,020
I know

950
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,650
you tried to run into the farm

951
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,110
to save Kang-ho when it was on fire.

952
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,830
You gave everything you had
to support him through everything,

953
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,620
yet he abandoned you.

954
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,790
So why are you still hung up on him
and looking after him?

955
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,080
Why do you keep acting like an idiot?

956
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,000
Because I take after you.

957
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,250
What?

958
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,380
You lived like that.

959
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,510
Dad always put you through so much,

960
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,680
but you only loved him and waited for him.

961
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,640
You know better than anyone
how painful that is.

962
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,190
That's why you're angry at me. Right?

963
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,440
But Mom,

964
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,360
you can also understand me
better than anyone right now.

965
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,570
You know I'll never get over Kang-ho,

966
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,790
that I'll never leave him,

967
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,250
and that in the end,

968
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,540
I'll go back to him.

969
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,840
You know, right?

970
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,670
You're…

971
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,090
my mom,

972
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,130
so you know that.

973
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,260
Thank you.

974
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,810
I've always wanted to tell you that.

975
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,230
You never abandoned Dad…

976
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,610
even though you went through so much.

977
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,320
That you let me…

978
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,870
have a dad.

979
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,920
I also want to be a mother like you
to Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

980
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,540
So help me do that, Mom.

981
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,720
You awful brat.

982
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,600
Why the hell do you want to
live your life like me?

983
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,640
Fine, you brat!

984
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,270
It's your darned life,
so do whatever the hell you want.

985
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,110
But don't you dare
come back to me crying with regret, okay?

986
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,860
Mom.

987
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,490
I'm hanging up!

988
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,240
I can't believe her.

989
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,450
How could she use that against me?

990
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,130
It's all…

991
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,800
your fault, Lee Choon-gil!

992
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,300
If Mi-joo becomes unhappy,

993
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,880
I'll seriously kill you.

994
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,680
Wait.

995
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,100
You're already dead.

996
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,140
Who is it?

997
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,480
Who's there?

998
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,230
Young-soon.

999
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,400
My gosh, Young-soon.

1000
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,950
Goodness, poor Young-soon.

1001
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,710
It sounds like Choi Kang-ho
is with Lee Mi-joo and Bang Sam-sik.

1002
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,960
What now?

1003
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,750
Over there.

1004
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,880
Get that license plate.

1005
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,810
-Three, eight--
-Three, eight, three, five.

1006
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,440
It followed us from Seoul.

1007
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,480
Who?

1008
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,320
Us? Why?

1009
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,030
Let's find out.

1010
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,310
Go slowly so they don't notice.

1011
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,520
Okay.

1012
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,500
FAIRY BREWERY, FAIRY REAL ESTATE,
FAIRY FORTUNE TELLING

1013
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,220
Find them.

1014
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,580
I see a few familiar faces.

1015
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,330
Chairman Song must've sent you here.

1016
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:01,740
Why?

1017
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:04,040
Did he tell you to get rid of us
after we kill Kang-ho?

1018
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,500
Of course.

1019
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,210
We do know a little too much about
Chairman Song.

1020
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,170
What?

1021
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,710
I'm only an assistant,
so I don't know that much.

1022
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:18,300
But you did learn
how to dig and bury things

1023
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,890
while cultivating that lettuce field.

1024
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,270
Which one should I bury first?

1025
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,070
-Nice!
-What are you doing? Get in!

1026
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,860
Okay!

1027
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,010
-Let go!
-You punks!

1028
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,550
-My goodness!
-Hey!

1029
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,630
-Who are you thieves?
-You're all dead!

1030
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,090
And we know one more thing!

1031
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,970
What Mr. Yang trusts more than his deity

1032
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,600
is an anti-theft system.

1033
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,020
-Come quickly!
-Faster!

1034
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,100
These thieves.

1035
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,690
-Round them up!
-You punks!

1036
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,190
-Goodness.
-My goodness.

1037
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,020
Gosh, this could've gone badly.

1038
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,110
-How dare you break in?
-Get them away!

1039
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,030
-Take them!
-Round them up!

1040
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,650
-Darn you.
-Hurry up.

1041
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,030
-Hey, Kang-ho.
-Is everything all right?

1042
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:03,910
I have way too many bodyguards
for anything to happen.

1043
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,040
They're like the Avengers.

1044
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,960
What about you?

1045
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,460
Is everything going well?

1046
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,210
This is only the beginning.

1047
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,260
I'M TRAVELING THROUGH A STAR CALLED SEA

1048
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,440
Presidential candidate Oh Tae-Soo
of the Jeilmirae Party

1049
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,730
visited an aquarium in Ilsung-dong, Seoul,

1050
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,650
to commemorate
the second Marine Life Month today,

1051
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,360
and began his campaign
for the welfare of the people.

1052
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,700
Hello, I'm Oh Tae-soo.

1053
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,120
Hello, children.

1054
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,120
-Hello!
-Hello!

1055
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,410
Were you looking at the fish?

1056
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,370
-Yes!
-Yes!

1057
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,880
"Daddy Fish isn't lonely."

1058
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,760
"Because his babies are asleep

1059
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,470
in little circular eggs."

1060
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:05,850
"'Daddy will dance for you every day

1061
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,310
until you hatch from your eggs.'"

1062
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,680
"And then…"

1063
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,640
"Crack."

1064
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,350
Remember what I told you earlier.

1065
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,690
-"Crack, crack, crack."
-You will, right?

1066
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,650
Well done.

1067
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:23,320
"His babies finally began to hatch."

1068
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:27,740
"'Hello, my babies.
It's great to see you.'"

1069
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:31,830
"The babies began to kiss Daddy Fish."

1070
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,290
"'I love you.'"

1071
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,210
"The happy Daddy Fish

1072
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,550
danced his last dance and slowly let out

1073
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,170
his last breath."

1074
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,550
Song Min-ho.

1075
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,720
President Oh Tae-soo, let's go!

1076
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,300
-Go!
-Thank you.

1077
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,390
Goodness, don't say that.

1078
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,310
I'm not the president yet.

1079
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:55,600
But now that I've heard your support,

1080
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,520
I'm starting to get ambitious.

1081
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,190
-You'll make it!
-You will!

1082
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:01,480
Thank you for your support.

1083
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,570
The children's book you read
was very touching!

1084
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,910
Yes, I was also moved by the story.

1085
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,790
I'll be a politician

1086
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:14,870
who's just like a stickleback,
showing love to our people

1087
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,500
and making sacrifices
for the sake of our citizens!

1088
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,710
Thank you. Thank you for your support.

1089
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,920
Please shake my son's hand.

1090
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,260
Gosh, you're so adorable.

1091
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,720
Goodness, I don't have a son myself,

1092
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,050
so I'm jealous.

1093
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,220
-What's his name?
-Tae-yul.

1094
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,810
Tae-yul, thank you for coming today.

1095
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,440
It's great to meet you.

1096
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,440
Thank you. Nice to meet you too.

1097
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,610
Thank you.

1098
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,070
Goodness.

1099
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,870
-That's all for today.
-That'll be all.

1100
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,590
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1101
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:23,610
Oh Ha-young.

1102
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,440
She's with me right now.

1103
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,450
I only have one goal.
It's to catch Chairman Song.

1104
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:29,820
By the way, why are you here alone?

1105
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,620
It'll be difficult
to obtain an arrest warrant

1106
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,410
for Chairman Song's past crimes.

1107
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,870
Honey, are you watching from above?

1108
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,830
Keep me here for a little longer.

1109
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:42,250
This was the very first ring
your father-in-law got me.

1110
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,750
I'm truly blessed

1111
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:50,510
for being able to live this precious life.

1112
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,180
Our son will carry out the judgment

1113
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,930
that we failed to do.

1114
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:02,230
