1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,270
-Mom!
-My babies!

3
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,940
-My gosh! Have you been well?
-Mom!

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,860
-Oh, my!
-Mom!

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,530
-Goodness, come here.
-Mom!

6
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,570
I came for you!

7
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,870
Mommy came to get you both!

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,530
Goodness, look.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,040
Ye-jin, how are you?
Seo-jin, how about you?

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,910
-Mom!
-You've both grown so much!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,920
-My babies!
-Mom!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,420
Did you miss me?

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,050
Who could it be? Is it someone scary?

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,170
Let me check. Stay here.

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,760
Who is it?

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,660
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,450
-Happy birthday dear Kang-ho and…
-Happy birthday dear Mi-joo

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,580
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,800
What did you wish for?

20
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,310
For you to complete your training
at the top of your class.

21
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,150
And for us to live happily
for a long time.

22
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,480
What about you?

23
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,650
Me?

24
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,950
That I won't be nervous.

25
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,660
-Nervous?
-The candles are melting.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,330
-Right.
-One, two, three!

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,540
-Happy birthday, Mi-joo!
-Happy birthday, Kang-ho!

28
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,710
What is it?

29
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,380
I made it myself.

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,630
It's a limited edition, one-of-a-kind.

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,010
-Really?
-Yes.

32
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,800
You have to wear it
to your appointment ceremony, okay?

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,680
Okay, I will.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Good.

35
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,850
But what's this? Ten square root of two?

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,190
-Love.
-I see.

37
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,400
-Love.
-Love.

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,280
-Love.
-Love.

39
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,030
I ten square root of two you.

40
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,280
The gifting portion is over.

41
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,990
Let's move on to the next part.

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,620
Let's sit and wait.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,550
-Oh, my!
-Wait.

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,270
I taught myself,

45
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,310
so I'm not that good.

46
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,520
But still, listen to the end.

47
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,230
Okay.

48
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,150
Pray for me.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,660
Don't let him be nervous.

50
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,990
Don't let me be nervous.

51
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,880
A tiring day passed by

52
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,840
Two are under the moonlight

53
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,850
As one shadow

54
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,810
That distant happiness is

55
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,310
Still there seemingly within my reach

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,440
When I close my eyes

57
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,160
-Open up.
-Okay.

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,210
You're back!

59
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,550
What took you so long to tell me that?

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Am I your first love?

61
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,930
Yes.

62
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,850
You're my first love, Yeong-min.

63
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,070
-You have to brush vertically.
-What?

64
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,440
Careful.

65
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,400
-You're bleeding.
-What?

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,450
Got you.

67
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,910
-Gosh, your hair is long.
-Okay, I'll stay still.

68
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,290
You're so good.

69
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,960
Is there anything you can't do?

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,580
One more coat, and we're done.

71
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,940
Eat up.

72
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,150
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
What a cute couple.

74
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,720
What is it?

75
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,690
I'm home.

76
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,280
-Hey.
-Hey.

77
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,940
How have you been?

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,950
KANG-HO'S VISIT

79
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,950
Of course, I should come.

80
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,700
You're beautiful.

81
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,290
-Am I? I'm relieved.
-Yes.

82
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,960
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay.

83
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,400
KANG-HO'S VISIT
KANG-HO'S APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

84
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,990
Congratulations on your appointment

85
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,950
Congratulations on your appointment

86
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,870
Congratulations, my dear Kang-ho…

87
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,800
Congratulations on your appointment

88
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,680
DEAR KANG-HO
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT

89
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,530
What are you waiting for? Make a wish.

90
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,280
I did.

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,820
What did you wish for?

92
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,990
That I won't be nervous.

93
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
Tell me.

94
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,570
There's something I want to do.

95
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,700
And it's something…

96
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,910
you need to do on your own.

97
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,800
It's money I've saved up.

98
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,890
BANKBOOK

99
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,370
This is it?

100
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,250
I thought I would get much more

101
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,630
for devoting myself
to making you a prosecutor.

102
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,500
It's not as much as I thought.

103
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,050
All right.

104
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,970
In any case,

105
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,100
set me up with a colleague
or whoever else that'll take

106
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,470
the bar exam.

107
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,020
This time, someone richer.

108
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,600
You know that

109
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm good at cooking and chores.

110
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,690
Right.

111
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,610
And at giving love.

112
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,530
Who was it?

113
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,830
It was nobody. Let's go.

114
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,910
Let's go.

115
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,210
Who was it?

116
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,830
Wait…

117
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,210
There's nobody here.

118
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,810
If you wanted to find
that bouncy ball so badly,

119
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,930
you should've taken me with you.

120
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,730
It's dangerous for you
to go out alone without telling me.

121
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,940
I was really worried.

122
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,440
Where's your phone?

123
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,530
Wait.

124
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,570
Where's my phone?

125
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,320
My phone is gone, Mom.

126
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,490
Goodness.

127
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,560
Mom, are you sick?

128
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,150
Yes.

129
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,480
Because of me?

130
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,530
Yes.

131
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,790
Goodness.

132
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,670
Do you feel sad when I'm ill?

133
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,880
Yes.

134
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,380
I feel sad when you get hurt too.

135
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,800
So don't let this happen again, okay?

136
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,470
Okay.

137
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,930
-By the way, Mom.
-Yes?

138
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,640
Why am I in pain?

139
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,400
You bruised and scraped yourself
so of course, you're in pain.

140
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,320
No, not there.

141
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,320
Right here.

142
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,230
What?

143
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,490
You feel pain there? Why?
When did it start?

144
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,780
After seeing that pretty lady.

145
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,080
Pretty lady?

146
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,710
Who?

147
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,290
Someone I don't know.

148
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,420
But it hurts right here.

149
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,100
What?

150
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,560
You never know what will happen in life.

151
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,520
Who knew that would happen to him?

152
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,860
His mom was thrilled
and even threw a feast

153
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,240
saying her prosecutor son
would be an assemblyman's son-in-law.

154
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,370
Mom, is Bar Exam a bad guy?

155
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,540
Is that why he's behind bars?

156
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,950
BAR EXAM MEALS

157
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,630
Give it to me.

158
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,290
Why did you go through her things?

159
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,260
I wanted to see
if she got us anything from America.

160
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,300
Actually, Kang-ho lost
the bouncy ball she got for us.

161
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,050
You little rascal!

162
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,810
Don't refer to him like that!
He's your mom's friend!

163
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,810
What do you mean?

164
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,850
Kang-ho is Mom's friend?

165
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,520
He's our friend.

166
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,650
You rascals!

167
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,190
They keep doing this.

168
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,110
I feel bad whenever I see his mom.

169
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,450
You two.

170
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,080
Don't do that again.

171
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,580
Then what do we call him?

172
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,910
Kang-ho oppa? Uncle Kang-ho?

173
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,210
Don't call him.

174
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,010
Don't ever meet him
or play with him again.

175
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,920
Okay?

176
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,760
But…

177
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,050
Do you both understand?

178
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,220
-Yes.
-Yes.

179
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,770
That's enough.

180
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,140
They're excited to see you again
so stop scolding them.

181
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,770
Wait.

182
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,650
Why did you suddenly come home?

183
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,740
Is something wrong?

184
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,280
Goodness, nothing's wrong.

185
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,200
I just decided to stop by.

186
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,920
My babies, I have presents for you.

187
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,880
Let's see what I got for you. Where is it?

188
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,970
MY FIRST KOREAN WORDS

189
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,760
You should've bought them

190
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,430
comic books, slime, push pop,
or other things like that.

191
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,390
Then again,

192
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,390
you left as soon as you weaned them.

193
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,940
You couldn't have known.

194
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,730
Sorry.

195
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,900
I didn't get you anything.

196
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,820
This is plenty.

197
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,370
My hands never looked this fancy
in my 60 years of living.

198
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,130
You'd always look at my hands

199
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,920
and get angry saying,
"Why are your hands like this?"

200
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,390
I had to pay for your dad's dance craze,

201
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,310
and my hands were covered with dirt
from farming all the time.

202
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,560
I never even imagined
getting my nails done.

203
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,100
Back then,

204
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,900
although you were the youngest,
you were the most considerate.

205
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
You always knew

206
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,660
what was going on
just by looking at my face.

207
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,540
That's how it is
between a parent and a child.

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,630
You don't have to say a word.

209
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,420
You can tell just by
the look on their face.

210
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,470
My daughter suddenly shows up one day

211
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
and she has
the look on her face that I had

212
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,270
when my husband had an affair
and ran away,

213
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,360
creditors came and destroyed my house,

214
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,070
and my future seemed so grim.

215
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,860
So…

216
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,200
how can I not recognize it?

217
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,130
It must've been so tough for you.

218
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,480
Your children will start school soon,

219
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,650
and I'm now too old and tired
to look after them.

220
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,820
I don't know what's going on,

221
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,030
but seeing how you came back
with all your stuff,

222
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,410
it looks like you've come to stay.

223
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,040
I know it wasn't easy for you to come.

224
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,040
And it might not be easy,

225
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,340
but let's live together.

226
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,760
I once heard this singer sing on TV

227
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,220
that if you live on,

228
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,930
you can continue to live.

229
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,770
-Okay.
-All right.

230
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,480
You feel pain there? Why?

231
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,860
When did it start?

232
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,860
After seeing that pretty lady.

233
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,110
Who could it be?

234
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,160
Ms. Jin!

235
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,080
I made it according to your instructions.

236
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay. Put it there.

237
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,250
-Give it to them in there.
-Okay.

238
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,020
I know how much you care
for your own piglets.

239
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,100
But this piglet has lost its mom.

240
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,230
Please share your milk, okay?

241
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,570
Goodness.

242
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,660
You must've been hungry.

243
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,530
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

244
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,000
It was scheduled
for sawdust to arrive today,

245
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,870
but the forecast says
there is an 80% chance of rain.

246
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,590
Let's push it back then.
Ask them to come when it's dry.

247
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,500
Okay.

248
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,810
Kang-ho.

249
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,020
It's forecast to rain today.

250
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,100
We have a hospital appointment
so stay home, okay?

251
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,560
Don't go outside.

252
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,610
Okay.

253
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,740
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

254
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,470
Hello.

255
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,930
Hello.

256
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,350
You're so adorable!

257
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,260
What's its name?

258
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,390
-Tiger.
-"Tiger"?

259
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,480
That's a unique name.

260
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,940
May I hold it?

261
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,360
Here. Careful.

262
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,150
-Tiger, careful. Come here.
-There we go.

263
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,070
Hello.

264
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,780
By the way, who are you?
I've never seen you here before.

265
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,910
Ms. Jo, it's me, Mi-joo.

266
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,210
Mi-joo?

267
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,630
Goodness! Gum-ja's youngest daughter!

268
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,040
-Yes.
-Yes, it's you!

269
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,260
You've grown really old,
so I didn't recognize you.

270
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,180
I thought you were in America.
Did you come back?

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,890
-Yes.
-I see.

272
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,810
How have you been?

273
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,940
I've been busy.
Life is really busy over there.

274
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Mi-joo.

275
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,780
INTRUSION UPON HABITATION

276
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm feeling it. Wait.

277
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,000
"Criminal Act, Article 319,
Intrusion upon Habitation."

278
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,870
"A person who intrudes upon
one’s residence, guarded building,

279
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,420
structure, ship, or occupied room,
shall be punished

280
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,630
for up to three years
or by a fine under five million won."

281
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,970
"Intrusion into My Heart"!

282
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,180
When did you come in?

283
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,890
Into my heart?

284
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,520
Into my tightly shut heart?

285
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,600
It'll sound good with a bit of work.

286
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,860
Oh, my.

287
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,230
Darn it.

288
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,830
Darn it.

289
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,970
Excuse me. Outsiders can't come in here.

290
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,430
Lady, why are you here?

291
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,720
How did you…

292
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,020
I get it now. This poop-smelling truck.

293
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
This is where the poop smell comes from!

294
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,020
What will you do about this?

295
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,480
-What is that?
-My clothes.

296
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,860
They're all ruined
because of the poop smell!

297
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,900
I'm sorry if the smell caused
any inconvenience.

298
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,410
It's usually fine,

299
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,620
but when it's windy and rainy,
it gets a little worse.

300
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,490
"A little worse"?

301
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,830
No one can breathe around here.

302
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,210
We're doing our best about that.

303
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,880
We have a smell reduction system
and sprayed ozonated water,

304
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,840
but no matter how clean we keep the place,
they're still livestock.

305
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,050
It's impossible to get rid of
the smell completely.

306
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,260
If you can't get rid of the smell,

307
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,510
you should get rid of the pig farm!

308
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,140
You're ruining other people's careers
just to make a living for yourself.

309
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,850
Isn't that right?

310
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,110
What are you talking about?

311
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,690
I didn't ruin anyone's career!

312
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,650
I'm a composer. An artist.

313
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,900
But I'm unable to do anything
because of this poop smell.

314
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,490
What if I can never write songs again?

315
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,490
Are you going to provide for me?

316
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,990
I'm warning you.

317
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,410
Stop being disrespectful.

318
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,160
Or what? What will you do?

319
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,620
Then I'll stop being polite too.

320
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,380
So you're a composer?
But you can't write a song?

321
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Let me tell you why.

322
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,460
It's not because of the smell of the poop.

323
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,170
It's because you're an awful person!

324
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,090
You have no basic manners for others

325
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,760
and zero authenticity!

326
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,430
Forget it.

327
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,970
My business is legally registered,

328
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,230
and I'm operating my farm
without any legal problems.

329
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,100
So if you have any issues,

330
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,110
go file a complaint or sue me!

331
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,610
Do whatever you want.

332
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,740
I have no manners?

333
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,030
I'll show you what I'm made of.

334
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,410
You're dead.

335
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,160
Livestock Division!

336
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,330
-Livestock Division!
-How may I help you?

337
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,010
Livestock Division…

338
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,140
How may I help you, sir?

339
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,520
Is this

340
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
the Livestock Division?

341
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,020
It's the Livestock Division.

342
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,150
I thought you'd like pizza.
But you didn't even finish half.

343
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,030
It's too greasy, and it tastes bad.

344
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,650
Wait.

345
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,410
When we go to America, do we
have to eat food like this every day?

346
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,750
It's awful.

347
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,290
Can you just ask Dad to live in Korea?

348
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,710
Right, when will he come?

349
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,130
Well…

350
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,420
Things are busy at the beauty salon,
so he can't come for a while.

351
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
What a relief.

352
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,520
Right? I was scared that he might come.

353
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,480
-What?
-Look, there's a clothing store.

354
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,400
The nail salon next door?

355
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,610
It's been closed for a while.

356
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,280
They picked the wrong business.

357
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,950
Most of the customers
around here are elderly farmers.

358
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,290
Who would get their nails done
in this rural village?

359
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,410
I'm about to go bust too.

360
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,590
It's a hassle to do it every year,

361
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,340
but once we cut and dry them,

362
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,970
we can eat pumpkin seeds,
porridge, pancakes,

363
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,890
and rice cake all winter.

364
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,270
It's the best snack, isn't it?

365
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,060
I mean,

366
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,860
I always tell her
we should all come and work together.

367
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,280
How come she never shows up?

368
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,900
Don't be so harsh on her.

369
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,950
It's not easy to raise pigs.

370
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,120
I'm not talking about Young-soon!

371
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,120
Let me ask you something.

372
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,920
Mr. Son, when, where, how, and why…

373
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,840
did you meet someone like her?

374
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,470
I've never heard the story either.

375
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,720
I haven't been able to tell you
for the sake of our village's safety.

376
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,430
But I think it's finally time.

377
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,600
She was actually…

378
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,700
a daughter of a newly rising yakuza boss

379
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,990
in Japan.

380
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,240
-What?
-What?

381
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,580
Her family had to disperse
to avoid their enemies' attacks.

382
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,830
And that's how
she ended up coming to Korea.

383
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,590
She wandered around,

384
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,760
then she collapsed in a valley
at Mount Gyeryong.

385
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,180
I found her and saved her.

386
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Excuse me.

387
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,810
Hello?

388
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,100
Wake up.

389
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,440
Are you all right?

390
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,990
If her true identity is leaked,

391
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,450
there will be…

392
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,200
-Goodness!
-Goodness.

393
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,570
…bloodshed in this village.

394
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,240
So if you don't want to die…

395
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,370
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

396
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,500
Get the porridge ready.

397
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Pumpkin porridge.

398
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,840
You totally got us!

399
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,720
You scared us!

400
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,060
It's not like you to make such jokes.

401
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,930
"Get the porridge ready!"

402
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,480
-Goodness!
-My gosh!

403
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,810
Good grief!

404
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,350
You scared me!

405
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,900
I'm sorry.

406
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,900
I'm late, aren't I?

407
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,570
What?

408
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,990
Which one should I cut open first?

409
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,950
-My gosh!
-What's up with you?

410
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,790
-My gosh.
-Look at this.

411
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,500
I don't want to die.

412
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,380
Your nails are so pretty!

413
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,630
Mi-joo did it for you, right?

414
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,930
I already know you take
great care of your farm.

415
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,390
But we're civil servants,
so we must deal with complaints.

416
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,560
I'm sorry my farm
is taking up your busy schedule.

417
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,730
Don't mention it.

418
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,480
I should speak with you in person,

419
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,360
but it's foot-and-mouth disease
control period

420
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,900
so farm visits are restricted.

421
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,440
Yes, I'm well aware.

422
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,860
I'll do what I can to take care of it,
so don't worry about it.

423
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,320
Yes.

424
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,870
Okay. Goodbye.

425
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,590
Mom, look.

426
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,390
I can fully squeeze this now.

427
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
You're the best.

428
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,890
See? All the exercise
is paying off, isn't it?

429
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,060
Yes.

430
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,360
If you continue to practice walking
and treat your legs,

431
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,440
you'll be able to walk very soon.

432
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,360
Gosh.

433
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,570
Mom.

434
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,620
There's something I want.

435
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,330
-Something you want?
-Yes.

436
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,790
There's something you want?

437
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,710
Tell me. I'll buy anything for you.

438
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,880
A dog.

439
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,300
-A dog?
-Yes.

440
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,590
We have a dog at the farm. Yellow.

441
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,640
No, not like Yellow.

442
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,350
A dog that I can keep in the room
like Ms. Jo's dog.

443
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,640
A dog that I can carry in my arms.

444
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,190
No, you can't have that.

445
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,980
And in the room?

446
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,150
What about all the fur?
And who will pick up after it?

447
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,320
Who will feed and wash it?

448
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,150
I will! I'll do everything.

449
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,330
Kang-ho, who made you breakfast
this morning?

450
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,660
You did.

451
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,620
Who bathed you and helped you get dressed?

452
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,340
Goodness.

453
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,090
And you have rhinitis too.

454
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,170
So, no.

455
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,710
Come on, Mom. Please.

456
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
-Please, just this once.
-No.

457
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,640
You can't have a dog.

458
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,480
HAPPY FARM

459
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,060
We're here. Let's go.

460
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,490
Good. One second.

461
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,210
Kang-ho, great job.

462
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,080
Let's try moving your feet.

463
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,170
How…

464
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,300
can I live with this?

465
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,720
Don't get discouraged.

466
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,680
Kang-ho. Look at me.

467
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,310
You're doing great right now.
You got this.

468
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,350
You're a miracle.
A miracle in our hospital.

469
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,310
Not everyone can recover so quick--

470
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,520
-No, dog.
-Yes, dawg, you're tough!

471
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,770
Tougher than anyone!

472
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,070
No, not that!

473
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,030
That dog! I want that dog!

474
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,410
Oh, my Happy?

475
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,040
You can't have Happy. That's my dog.

476
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,210
The foot-and-mouth disease also broke out
in North Gyeongsang.

477
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,590
Quarantine authorities are doing
everything they can to prevent the spread.

478
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,510
Next story.

479
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,050
-Ms. Jin Young-soon.
-Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo

480
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,550
-Come to the endoscopy room.
-of the Jeilmirae Party

481
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,800
-Yes.
-declared candidacy

482
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,890
for the primary presidential election.

483
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,760
Park Min-hui reports.

484
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,270
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo,

485
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,980
with the highest approval ratings
as a potential candidate,

486
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,060
-held a press conference
-That's…

487
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,310
in his office in Yeouido,

488
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,150
-officially declaring
-"Oh Tae-soo…"

489
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,530
his presidential candidacy.

490
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,240
-His first schedule
-He's that prosecutor.

491
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,610
-was visiting a nearby market
-Oh, my.

492
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,490
-to encourage businesses.
-He must be running for president.

493
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,910
-The marketplace was packed
-Ms. Jin.

494
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,990
-with reporters and supporters.
-Come in.

495
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
-Okay.
-Assemblyman Oh

496
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,580
promised the revitalization
of local marketplaces

497
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,580
and took his first step for the campaign.

498
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,770
-I need to make a bathroom run.
-Okay.

499
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,750
What's this?

500
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,390
He was with another woman.

501
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,640
He even had a child with her.

502
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,860
He wanted to marry you,

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,320
so he killed her and his child.

504
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,250
I can't believe this.

505
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,470
Do you expect me to believe this?

506
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,590
Dad, what's wrong with you?

507
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,010
Fine.

508
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,430
Let's say this is true.

509
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,480
Why didn't you
report him to the police then?

510
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,450
It was 30 years ago.

511
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,450
He knew I was involved
in his father's death.

512
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,870
He's trying to use you
to take revenge on me.

513
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,170
Jujubes are said to be
natural tranquilizers.

514
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,710
You said your symptoms weren't severe,

515
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,050
so don't take any medication.

516
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,170
Just have some jujube tea before bed.

517
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,300
I went to the marketplace in the morning
to get them, so don't throw them away.

518
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,310
If I report him to the police
and an investigation is launched,

519
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,270
everything will be exposed to the world.

520
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,810
And that'll be the end of me.

521
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,940
Ha-young.

522
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,990
We should end this first.

523
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,000
If news of his
son's draft evasion breaks out,

524
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,550
people will turn their backs.

525
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,920
This is why

526
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,840
it's best to have daughters
since they're free of military service.

527
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,640
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

528
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,230
Ha-young.

529
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,020
-What happened to your hand?
-Hello.

530
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,480
Goodness.

531
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,190
I gave him the pills to kill him.

532
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,990
What are you saying?

533
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,450
-Take her upstairs.
-Please come upstairs.

534
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,490
Dad.

535
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,080
I did it.

536
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,450
-Ha-young!
-Wait.

537
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,920
I did it, Mom.

538
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,500
Dad.

539
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,920
Dad?

540
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,460
-Please come upstairs.
-I did it.

541
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,710
Dad?

542
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,300
I'm telling you, I did it.

543
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,340
Kang-ho ended up like that,

544
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,970
so he must be like a dog off its leash.

545
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,150
He needs to be squeezed tight

546
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,440
to realize who's holding his leash, right?

547
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,700
I'll find Yang Gu-man's suicide note.

548
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,360
Mr. So, that's not a card we can play.

549
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,990
Who'll believe
what's on a criminal's suicide note?

550
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,830
Even if we do find the water bottle
with Kang-ho's blood on it,

551
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,170
how are we going to prove
Ha-young did that?

552
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,170
Oh Tae-soo knows all this.

553
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,550
He was once a prosecutor.

554
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,630
So we need to secure
a hidden ace up our sleeves

555
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,930
to use in unforeseen situations.

556
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,890
Bring me that.

557
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,040
I already know you take
great care of your farm.

558
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,500
But we're civil servants,
so we must deal with complaints.

559
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,010
What are you doing there?

560
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,180
I want to see you.

561
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,010
Mom.

562
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,560
Why are you so pretty?

563
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,350
You're prettier than people on TV.

564
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,770
You're much prettier than IU, Mom.

565
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,980
I said no.

566
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,190
Why not?

567
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,950
Mi-joo likes dogs.

568
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,070
Mi-joo?

569
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,910
Oh, my.

570
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,120
Do you remember her?

571
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,990
I keep thinking of her.

572
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,290
So please, Mom.
Buy me a dog so that I can show her.

573
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:42,300
But Mi-joo is married
and lives in America now.

574
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,880
So even if you had one,
you couldn't show her.

575
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,630
No, Mi-joo lives at Ye-jin's house.

576
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,970
I'm going to go to visit our neighbor.

577
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,810
Don't go out and stay home.

578
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,850
Don't go out.

579
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,690
Yellow.

580
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,700
Come here, Yellow.

581
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,200
Good boy. Yellow.

582
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,660
All right, come here. Good boy.

583
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,950
Come here. It's all right.

584
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,120
Good boy.

585
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,790
All right. One second.

586
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,340
Stay still, Yellow.

587
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,220
-No!
-No!

588
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,060
This can't happen! Yellow!

589
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,390
-No, Yellow! Gosh.
-Kang-ho.

590
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,350
Hold this. Halt immediately!

591
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,760
FROM THE PIG FARM
PLEASE ENJOY

592
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,260
You surprised me.

593
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,640
This isn't your first time seeing me.
Why are you so surprised?

594
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,230
You're right.

595
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,440
Are you going somewhere?

596
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,980
Yes, to get my nails done.

597
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,190
I see.

598
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,240
-See you around.
-Okay.

599
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,490
Wait.

600
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,580
What kind of dog is that?

601
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,290
Canine.

602
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,670
Yes, I know that.

603
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,960
I meant the breed.

604
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,630
Bi…

605
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,090
Bickering?

606
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,310
It was something like that.

607
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,520
Bishop?

608
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,980
-Bi…
-Bichon?

609
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,480
Yes, that's right.

610
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,780
Bichon.

611
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,570
Bichon.

612
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,910
Bichon.

613
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,790
I understand what you're saying,

614
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,790
but to be precise,
the farm was in the village first.

615
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,500
You moved in after.

616
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,880
There's nothing we can do
in this situation.

617
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,630
I already spoke to the farm
and provided guidance.

618
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,670
Guidance?

619
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,140
Even a street dog could
give them this much guidance.

620
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,560
What did you say?

621
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,180
I mean, a citizen is suffering from it.

622
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,730
My rights to the pursuit of happiness
are being violated!

623
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,480
And who provides your paycheck?

624
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,230
You're paid by our tax money.

625
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,570
I'm the reason why you're making a living!

626
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,360
You're crossing the line.

627
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,450
The farm owner is a citizen too.

628
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,660
She pays taxes too.

629
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,620
Or has she done anything illegal
at the farm?

630
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,170
Why are you giving her such a hard time?

631
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,290
What's your name? Where's your name tag?

632
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,840
And why are you yelling at me?

633
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,170
I'll call the Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs

634
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,470
and make sure you get
the biggest lesson of your lifetime.

635
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,840
I'll end your life!

636
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,050
Go ahead.

637
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,430
Even the old villagers don't say anything,
and you roll in and do this?

638
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,900
"Roll in"? I'll show you how I roll.

639
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,940
I will defend
my right to pursue happiness!

640
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,690
I will defend
my right to pursue happiness!

641
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,330
Bichon.

642
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,500
Bichon.

643
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,630
Bichon.

644
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,050
Goodness.

645
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,460
How can I work with these hands?
They're so pretty.

646
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,050
Right? Goodness.

647
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,430
Forget working.
I don't even want them to get wet.

648
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,890
How can I cook?

649
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,970
Make your husband cook.

650
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,350
What are husbands for?

651
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,480
Should I do that?

652
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,520
My hands are as pretty as my maiden days,

653
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,060
so maybe he'll do it for me, right?

654
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,980
Oh, my.

655
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,030
Were your hands
as huge as a caldron lid back then?

656
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,030
-Caldron lids?
-Never mind.

657
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,240
Caldron lids are at least shiny.

658
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,330
You little…

659
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,540
-You and your mouth.
-Stop it.

660
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,870
When did he come and leave this here?

661
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,840
I don't think he came and left it.

662
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,250
It was in the drain.

663
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,470
Does this mean
we can't see Kang-ho anymore?

664
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,260
No way. We live in the same village.

665
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,310
We'll run into each other sometimes.

666
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,020
Do we pretend he's a stranger?

667
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,270
I'm sure a little nod will be fine.

668
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,520
Poor Kang-ho.

669
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,990
He must be bored without us.

670
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,490
But why do we seem more bored
than he might be?

671
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,290
Kang-ho!

672
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,750
I mean, Kang-ho oppa.

673
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,670
I mean, Uncle Kang-ho.

674
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,800
Seo-jin, Ye-jin. What brings you here?

675
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,930
This is our home,

676
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,720
so we're usually here.

677
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,720
Right.

678
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,180
Anyway, what's that?

679
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,850
My goodness.

680
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,650
Is that a pig?

681
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,610
This is my pet pig,

682
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,980
Lion!

683
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,610
A dog named Tiger

684
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,360
and a pig named Lion.

685
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,740
What an odd village.

686
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,280
May I hold the pig?

687
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,410
Sure.

688
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,420
Be careful.

689
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,550
By the way,
are there any other people in the house?

690
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,840
Other people?

691
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,550
There are lots of people.

692
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,390
Lots?

693
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,970
No, Lion!

694
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,430
-No!
-No!

695
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,390
-No!
-Lion!

696
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,310
-No!
-Catch it!

697
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,520
I have to give it to Mi-joo!

698
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,610
What?

699
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,610
Kang-ho left with a pig?

700
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,110
I deserve to die, Ms. Jin.

701
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,070
That punk.

702
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,490
HAPPY FARM, PIG FARM, OFFICE

703
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,870
-Wait, Lion!
-Hurry up!

704
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,210
-Hurry up and catch it!
-No, Lion!

705
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,210
-Lion!
-Lion!

706
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,500
Lion!

707
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,140
Choi Kang-ho!

708
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,140
-Catch it!
-Lion!

709
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,010
-Lion!
-Lion!

710
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,390
-Lion!
-Run!

711
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,150
-Lion!
-Lion!

712
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,230
Yes.

713
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,230
You said you know

714
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,190
the Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs, right?

715
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,820
How do you know him?

716
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,150
Yes, the minister has a daughter.

717
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,610
The daughter's friend? Yes.

718
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,660
And…

719
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,830
Hey, if that's the case,

720
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,160
I might be closer to him, you punk.

721
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,580
-Hey, listen.
-Lion!

722
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,170
-Lion!
-Lion!

723
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,880
-Lion!
-Where are you going?

724
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,000
-I'll really kill--
-Lion!

725
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,170
-Lion!
-Lion!

726
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,840
-Lion!
-Lion!

727
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,470
I just had an accident.

728
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,090
Yes, I was driving!

729
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,260
I'm sorry!

730
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,800
Hey, stop right there!

731
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,430
You rascals!

732
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,930
Damn it!

733
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,640
Damn it! Hey!

734
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,270
-Lion!
-Lion!

735
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,940
-No!
-I can't.

736
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,030
No!

737
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
Guys, come on.

738
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,700
I can't run anymore!

739
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,950
Yes, we're done.

740
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,710
You should go.

741
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,380
Come here.

742
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,670
If your mom catches
the three of us on that,

743
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,960
we're dead meat.

744
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,710
We're already dead because of Lion.

745
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,260
Come quickly!

746
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,180
Kang-ho!

747
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,100
-Ye-jin!
-Seo-jin!

748
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,350
-Assemble!
-Assemble!

749
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,520
Seo-jin!

750
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,560
Ye-jin!

751
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,480
-Move!
-Move!

752
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,900
-Lion!
-All right!

753
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,070
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

754
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,690
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

755
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,740
-Bye.
-Bye.

756
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,900
-See you later.
-Thanks.

757
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,950
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

758
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,240
-Bye!
-Goodbye.

759
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,580
-Mom.
-Yes?

760
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,920
Should I open a nail salon here?

761
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,960
You saw how thrilled they were.

762
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,710
Women will be women
even in a rural village.

763
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,380
They all want to be pretty.

764
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,090
What do you think?

765
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,260
Do you have

766
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,050
enough money?

767
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,640
How will you open it?

768
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,350
Just go set the table.

769
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,110
Come on, Mom.

770
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,280
Stop right there!

771
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,450
Mom, catch it!

772
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,780
-Catch Lion!
-Catch the pig!

773
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,910
-Mom, hurry!
-Mom!

774
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,990
-Catch the pig!
-Catch it, Mom!

775
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,620
-Catch the pig!
-Mom, catch it!

776
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,660
Lion!

777
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,420
Mom, catch Lion!

778
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,670
-Catch Lion!
-Mom, hurry!

779
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,590
-Lion!
-Catch it!

780
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,920
She caught it! Mom!

781
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,840
-Yes.
-What a relief.

782
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,260
What a relief.

783
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,300
Thank you.

784
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,260
Lion.

785
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,320
It's…

786
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,160
Choi Kang-ho!

787
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,330
Run! Now!

788
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,630
Stop right there!

789
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,290
-Hurry up!
-Hurry!

790
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,380
That little…

791
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,880
Darn it.

792
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,470
Hello?

793
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,930
Yes, Director.

794
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,010
Yes, regarding the dog
you asked about earlier.

795
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,060
Let me call you back right back.

796
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,520
Stop right there!

797
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,030
Mi-joo?

798
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,040
Oh, my.

799
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,750
Kang-ho really was talking about you.

800
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,830
Goodness, he mentioned Mi-joo?

801
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,460
He kept saying he had to show her a dog,

802
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,590
and I had no idea what he meant.

803
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,180
Anyway, are you back for good?
What about your husband?

804
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,720
Well, the thing is…

805
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,640
He owns a huge beauty salon in America.

806
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,640
Right.

807
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,310
She's back for the children.

808
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,230
It's just her for now.

809
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,900
I see.

810
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,360
But isn't it wonderful?

811
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Your husband is successful,
and you have adorable children.

812
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,360
Right.

813
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,530
Is Kang-ho back?

814
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,910
Yes, don't let him into the piggery.

815
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,540
I'm sorry. I have to get going.

816
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,460
-Come by for a visit.
-Okay.

817
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,300
-Bye.
-All right.

818
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,470
-Bye.
-Bye.

819
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,850
If I catch them, I'll kill them.

820
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,570
What is this? What's this water?

821
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,950
Wait a second.

822
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,830
It smells like disinfectant.

823
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,000
ALL INCOMING CARS
MUST BE DISINFECTED

824
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,710
Do you know how sensitive pigs are?

825
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,880
When one of them is infected,
they all get sick.

826
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,300
This one ran all around the village,

827
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,090
so who knows what it caught?

828
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,220
What are we going to do with it?

829
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:24,810
I'm sorry.

830
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,730
It lost its mom
and is the runt of the litter

831
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,940
that gets pushed around by other pigs.

832
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,770
I had to feed the poor thing
through a surrogate mom.

833
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,400
Mom.

834
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,440
Can I keep this one?

835
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,650
I'll feed it,

836
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,740
wash it, and put it to sleep.

837
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,950
What?

838
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,370
I have you,
but this pig doesn't have a mom.

839
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,460
I'll be its mom.

840
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,210
Nonsense.

841
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,960
How will you raise
a dirty and smelly pig at home?

842
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,720
"Everyone thinks
pigs are dirty and smelly,

843
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,430
but that's not the case."

844
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,720
"They not only
do their business in one place,

845
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,560
but they also only sleep
where it's clean."

846
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,650
"But humans started to lock them up
in tiny pigsties."

847
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,480
"Isn't that so sad?"

848
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,490
That's what you said.

849
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,620
Who could it be?

850
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,870
All right.

851
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,160
Come here.

852
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,210
Let's go inside.

853
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,790
Go in. I'll be right back.

854
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,930
Coming!

855
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,260
Who is it?

856
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Hey. Are you kidding me?

857
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:53,730
Oh, no.

858
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,270
Are you bummed about the food?

859
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,900
Then look at my car.

860
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,820
I almost totaled the car not long ago.

861
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,700
But you let out the darned pig again

862
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,530
and made me drive it into a ditch.

863
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,700
I'll have to scrap it!

864
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,490
I don't know what happened,

865
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,250
but I'll compensate you if you were harmed
in any way because of us.

866
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,580
Okay, good.
Then give me a billion won a year.

867
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,170
What?

868
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,550
I'm a composer.

869
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,340
I write at least 60 songs a year
for 10 million each,

870
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,090
so that's 600 million won.

871
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,010
Plus the royalty

872
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,430
and album sales.

873
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,100
You haven't even released
ten songs altogether.

874
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,480
And they're off the market

875
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,020
because of plagiarism.

876
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,310
You were sued for the newest song

877
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,030
because it was the same as
"Ripe Persimmon" by Na Hoon-a.

878
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,400
-What's your problem?
-Goodness.

879
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,110
Are you a detective or something?

880
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,870
-Who the heck are you?
-What's with you?

881
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,450
-Let go!
-What the…

882
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,160
-Who are you?
-Hey!

883
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,120
Hey!

884
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,500
Darn it. Hey!

885
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,630
So you're saying

886
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,380
Mr. Choi Kang-ho here attacked you first?

887
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,300
Yes.

888
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:09,890
I'm sorry.

889
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,180
I won't do that again. I'm sorry.

890
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,020
Don't apologize.

891
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,850
You didn't do anything wrong.

892
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,400
You did nothing wrong, okay?

893
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,070
I mean,

894
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,650
there's no son who would hold back
when he sees his mom

895
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,280
being grabbed and hurled on the floor.

896
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,950
I was grabbing her,

897
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,580
but he suddenly rushed at me,

898
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,170
then pushed me, so I let go of her.

899
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,830
I'm not going to settle.

900
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,290
Just arrest him.

901
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,050
All right, don't be like this.

902
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,630
Ms. Jin here is
a woman of great character,

903
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,300
and she has a great relationship
with everyone here.

904
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,890
You've become neighbors now, so--

905
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,260
"Neighbors"?

906
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,430
I'm a civil man,
so I haven't done anything,

907
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,600
but I can sue them for a lot of things.

908
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:57,810
Hey, tell them.

909
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,360
You intruded on my house,

910
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,020
and then you brought
that pig out on the road.

911
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,490
That's why I'm in this mess.
Isn't that so?

912
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:06,530
It's Lion.

913
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,240
It was a pig, you idiot!

914
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,160
Hey!

915
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,240
"Idiot"?

916
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,750
My son is much smarter
and has much better judgment than you do!

917
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,130
Then you tell me
with your better judgment.

918
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,460
Did you see me get into a car accident?

919
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,380
-Did you or did you not?
-I did!

920
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:28,970
Game over.

921
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,140
-He saw me.
-That man…

922
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:33,890
I'll really kill--

923
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,730
He saw Lion, tried to dodge it,
and then the car swerved and crashed.

924
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,940
And he said this into the phone.

925
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,230
"I just had an accident."

926
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,400
"Yes, I was driving!"

927
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,530
Then he got out of the car and fell down.

928
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,610
Hang on.

929
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,200
Hold on.

930
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,700
That means

931
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,790
you used your phone while driving.

932
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,370
Were you even wearing your seatbelt?

933
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,080
Well…

934
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,960
I mean,

935
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,630
well…

936
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:09,800
Phone use is a violation

937
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,590
of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

938
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,680
Neglect of a seatbelt is a violation

939
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,720
of Article 50, Paragraph 1
of the Road Traffic Act.

940
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,900
-I'll fold.
-Another one.

941
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,730
-Give him one.
-I'm done.

942
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,440
Hey, bring me a pack of cigarettes!

943
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,490
-Yes.
-Here we go.

944
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,830
Bet big, will you?

945
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:37,990
I'll take one.

946
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,290
Enjoy your cigarettes.

947
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,460
-Hey, a pack of cigarettes.
-Yes, sir.

948
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,510
-Goodness.
-What now?

949
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,640
Okay.

950
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,430
Good work.

951
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,350
-Gosh.
-That's your paycheck.

952
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,480
You little…

953
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,560
You bastard.

954
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,560
Let go!

955
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,320
You bastard.

956
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,110
I've been looking everywhere for you.

957
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:12,780
-Bang Sam-sik?
-Yes, that's me, you asshole.

958
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,910
You knew it was stolen, right?

959
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,280
You sent me there knowing it was stolen.

960
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,040
I rotted in prison for months
because of you!

961
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,700
Your friend is a prosecutor!

962
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,040
I thought he would get you out.

963
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,090
He was never my friend, you punk.

964
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,250
Goodness!

965
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,670
This afternoon,
a violent fight between gangs broke out

966
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,510
at an adult entertainment business
in Ilcheong-dong,

967
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,560
-resulting in 2 deaths and 17 injuries.
-Goodness.

968
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,140
It must be heartbreaking news

969
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,400
for the parents of those punks.

970
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,860
You know, Sam-sik may have quick hands,

971
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,820
but he doesn't get into fights.

972
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,320
Isn't that a relief?

973
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,070
Don't I look different today?

974
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,490
My head hurts. Oh, my.

975
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,490
Wait.

976
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,790
These fell off your nails.

977
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,920
How did those end up there?

978
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,010
No, it's all right.

979
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,760
My wife looks

980
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,970
so sexy for the first time in 40 years.

981
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,180
What's with you? Gosh.

982
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,270
Oh, my.

983
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:29,110
-Just eat your meal.
-No.

984
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,400
Oh, my.

985
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,360
Next story.

986
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,900
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo, the presidential
candidate of the Jeilmirae Party,

987
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,070
volunteered to do laundry
at the temporary shelter

988
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,120
for flood victims in Anseon,

989
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,580
now designated as a special disaster area
due to the typhoon.

990
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,370
Assemblyman Oh
made his visit with his family

991
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,420
and was surprised to see
how the situation seemed worse in person.

992
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,670
You're banned from going out
except for official occasions.

993
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,920
Don't schedule any performances
for the time being

994
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,300
and don't meet anybody.

995
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,010
Is that my next job?

996
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,720
Sure, I'll do as you say.

997
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,690
If you're still worried, take this.

998
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,980
You never know
when I'll start acting crazy again.

999
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,860
Ha-young.

1000
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,690
Listen to me carefully.

1001
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:23,080
If you ever get in my way,
I will not condone it,

1002
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,330
even if it's you.

1003
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
Dad.

1004
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,750
Don't worry.

1005
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,170
Nothing in Korea can threaten you.

1006
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,430
-Hello, Assemblyman Oh.
-Hello.

1007
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,760
-Are you doing okay?
-I'm fine.

1008
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,310
Unless…

1009
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,560
he regains his memories.

1010
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,030
Let's get rid of

1011
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,820
Choi Kang-ho.

1012
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,290
Hey, Kang-ho.

1013
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,910
Yes?

1014
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,250
Well…

1015
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,960
About what you said at the police station.

1016
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,130
You know, the Road Traffic Act.

1017
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,220
How did you remember that?

1018
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,300
Road Traffic…

1019
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,730
What? What's that?

1020
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,650
Kang-ho.

1021
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,780
You go in first.

1022
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,780
I'm going to stop by Mr. Son's place.

1023
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,040
I'll go too.

1024
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,540
No, I'll be quick.

1025
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,620
But still…

1026
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,630
Right, what about Lion?

1027
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,170
Lion didn't have dinner.
It must be hungry.

1028
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,460
Right, Lion.

1029
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,260
Okay, then. Come home quickly.

1030
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,100
-Okay.
-I'll feed Lion so come back quickly.

1031
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,360
Goodness.

1032
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,240
What kind of a jerk made a scene
and made you suffer like this?

1033
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,820
Goodness, it's okay.

1034
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,450
It's just a stomach cramp.

1035
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,870
The medicine will help me feel better.

1036
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,950
This is bad. You're sick so often.

1037
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,120
Our medicine cabinet
is empty because of you.

1038
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,670
Goodness, woman. Stop talking nonsense.

1039
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,460
You and that red face mask!

1040
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,340
I'm just saying.

1041
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,220
Don't worry about it,

1042
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,180
although it's costing us a fortune
to refill the medications.

1043
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,220
What?

1044
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,220
I'm sorry.

1045
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,440
I'll go to town and refill
your medicine cabinet tomorrow.

1046
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Goodness, no.

1047
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,810
It's all right.

1048
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,610
Anyway, if you're this sick,
shouldn't you get a checkup?

1049
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,610
I got a gastroscopy yesterday.

1050
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,360
I'll get the result next week.

1051
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,080
It's because you have
too much on your plate.

1052
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,160
I'll meet with that composer or whatever,

1053
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,040
so don't worry about him.

1054
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,170
Thank you, Mr. Son.

1055
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,550
Will you do something
about that red face thing?

1056
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,800
Take it off or turn it off!

1057
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,800
Damn it. It's yellow now.

1058
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,500
I'm relieved that Mom
is at Mr. Son's place.

1059
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,880
Gosh, Lion. What are you going to do now?

1060
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,340
You're going to get kicked out.

1061
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,930
Mom.

1062
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:10,970
Mom?

1063
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,310
No!

1064
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,480
No.

1065
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,660
Who are you?

1066
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:44,630
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1067
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,020
Promise me you won't
get into trouble like last time.

1068
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,270
-Promise.
-Mi-joo!

1069
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,440
Mi-joo!

1070
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,820
Do you know him?

1071
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,860
No, I…

1072
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,030
I don't want to see you anymore.

1073
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,740
This is the last time
I'll be helping you out.

1074
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:15,830
Mom.

1075
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,160
Please help me, sir.

1076
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:20,160
-Help me.
-Sam-sik.

1077
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:21,960
Are we friends?

1078
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,920
How dare they say that to our friend?

1079
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,050
The pig farm was kind of an inconvenience.
We can't deny that.

1080
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:31,970
And now, she'll be betrayed
by the villagers she trusted.

1081
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,970
Mom.

1082
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:41,600
