00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,340
Who are you?

3
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,840
Who are you people?

4
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,430
Kang-ho!

5
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,180
Kang-ho!

6
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,690
Ma'am, it's been a while.

7
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,650
Your late husband

8
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,070
was such a courageous man.

9
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,120
And Kang-ho takes after him.

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,580
I took care of him like my own.
What an ungrateful kid.

11
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,500
Let me see.

12
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,460
Tell me, Kang-ho.

13
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,420
What were you going to do to me?

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,670
-Mom!
-Stop it.

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Stop it.

16
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,590
Stop it!

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,800
Stop it…

18
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,720
Please…

19
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,770
Please don't do this.

20
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,520
You know he had an accident
and hurt his head.

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,110
He doesn't remember anything.

22
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,780
He can't harm you!

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,030
Who knows?

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,780
He could remember everything any day

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,410
and stab me in my back, couldn't he?

26
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,620
I heard he's gathered
tons of evidence against me

27
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,080
while working for me all these years.

28
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,130
I'm here to find it.

29
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,380
It's not here.

30
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,050
Not anymore.

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,550
Look at that.

32
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,590
I burned it all.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,930
You did? Why?

34
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,390
I knew it. So there was something, right?

35
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,480
I did it so he wouldn't
go back to his old life.

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,980
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea
after finding out who his father was.

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,780
I didn't want him
to be in any more danger.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,240
I'm telling you the truth.

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,490
He doesn't know what went on between us.

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,460
And what exactly

41
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,630
was that?

42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,800
Let me…

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,100
answer that question.

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,020
No.

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,140
No!

46
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,190
No!

47
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,940
HAPPY FARM, PIG FARM, OFFICE

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,530
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

49
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,110
Kang-ho.

50
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,160
Kang-ho.

51
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,430
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

52
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,350
EPISODE 10

53
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,720
Jeez, I'm so sick of him.

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,770
What's wrong? Was that your son?

55
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,690
Yes.

56
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,770
TO-DO LIST FOR HAPPY FARM REOPENING
100 MOTHER PIGS, DISINFECT PIGGERY…

57
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,150
…after all that his dad went through
to get him that job.

58
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,900
But he already quit
after working there for a few days.

59
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,490
-What's the reason this time?
-It's obvious.

60
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,910
He still wants to become a movie director.

61
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,870
Goodness.

62
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,710
I heard even decent directors struggle
for years without making any money.

63
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,000
Does he think
he's Bong Joon-ho or something?

64
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,750
Maybe I'm Bong Joon-ho.

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
After all, I gave birth to a parasite.

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm sick of him.

67
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,720
Gosh, it takes boys ages to mature.

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,180
They might once they
have a family of their own.

69
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,810
My son completely changed
after getting married.

70
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,100
-Is that so?
-Yes.

71
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,070
He has a loving wife
and adorable children to look after.

72
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,530
So of course he has to mature.

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,900
MARRY HIM OFF

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,320
You're going to suffer
worse symptoms soon.

75
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,530
I don't think
taking medicine will suffice.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,750
Why don't you get hospitalized
and receive treatment?

77
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,910
I can't do that.

78
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,580
What I mean is…

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,300
Later.

80
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,670
There are some things
I need to do right now.

81
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,590
Lion, look at this.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,010
"Choi Kang-ho,
Supreme Prosecutors' Office."

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Isn't it cool?

84
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,290
Lion, do I look like myself
in the picture?

85
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,170
Lion, that's it. Come here.

86
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,170
Good job.

87
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,510
Lion, come here.

88
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,340
-Gosh.
-Where are you going?

89
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,260
Goodness.

90
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,550
-Hi, Lion.
-Lion!

91
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,350
Lion has become so much stronger.

92
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,650
You're right.

93
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,940
We should build a separate house for her.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,860
Let's build her a small house

95
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,200
so she can get used to
living in an enclosed space

96
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,620
until she's ready to have piglets.

97
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,910
Then, in the future, she won't have any
problems living with other pigs.

98
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,870
-Other pigs?
-Yes.

99
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,840
We're getting new pigs next week.

100
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,090
Does that mean you're going to
run the farm again?

101
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,970
No.

102
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,970
You will.

103
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,310
From now on,
you're the owner of Happy Farm.

104
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,940
Then

105
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,850
what about my job as a prosecutor?

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,110
I won't be a prosecutor anymore?

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,530
Who told you that

108
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,440
you were a prosecutor?

109
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,570
Mr. Son, the ladies,
and the rest of the villagers.

110
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,530
They told me to get better
and be a prosecutor again.

111
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,290
Kang-ho.

112
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,040
Listen carefully.

113
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,120
You're no longer

114
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,750
a prosecutor.

115
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,840
No matter what people say,

116
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,800
deny it and tell them you don't know.

117
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,260
From now on,
you'll live a happy life running the farm.

118
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,350
I beg you.

119
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,060
Please don't remember anything
and let's just live like this, okay?

120
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,860
I know I can be a good farmer.

121
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,860
After all, you taught me everything.

122
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,740
Of course, you can. You're my son.

123
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,040
Lion.

124
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,670
Lion.

125
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,210
Lion.

126
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,340
Here you are.

127
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,010
Lion, I'm the owner now.

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,020
The owner of Happy Farm.

129
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm going to build you a new house.
Aren't you happy?

130
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,980
But it feels weird.

131
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,650
Everyone is telling me to get better
so that I can return

132
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,490
to being a prosecutor.

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,580
But not my mom.

134
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,080
She told me not to remember anything
because it'll be dangerous.

135
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,710
I wonder what happened.

136
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,590
-Kang-ho oppa!
-We're here!

137
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,180
Let's go, Lion.

138
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,810
Could you please give me
a 50,000-won discount?

139
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,140
You're unbelievable.

140
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,650
You're like the Yeouido interchange
at 6 p.m. on a weekday.

141
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,440
"Yeouido interchange"?

142
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,780
There's no getting through to you.

143
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,030
Gosh.

144
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,610
I bought it for my girlfriend

145
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
to celebrate our 1,000th day together.

146
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,540
But she cheated on me.

147
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,330
Were you happy

148
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,340
For the past 1,000 days?

149
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,050
Mi-joo

150
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,380
-Mi-joo
-All right. Quiet down.

151
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,550
I'll transfer the money right now.

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,140
You've made a wise decision.

153
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,310
I'll wrap it up right away.

154
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,150
Hello, sir. Have you been well?

155
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,120
Something strange was wired
to my bank account just now.

156
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,950
The amount should have been
200 million won,

157
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,410
but it's missing two zeros.

158
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Just like how you'll be missing

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,960
both of your kidneys soon.

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,500
I wired you the interest first.

161
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,220
I see. So that's what it is.

162
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,470
Then when will I

163
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,640
be able to receive the principal?

164
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,060
Don't take it the wrong way.

165
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm not rushing you.

166
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,650
Why would I? Right, Sam-sik?

167
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,150
Your house is worth 180 million won.

168
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,900
Your mill is worth 250 million won.

169
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,940
Right.

170
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,530
Your parents also set up

171
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,240
life insurance for you.

172
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,740
Please, sir!

173
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,540
Sam-sik's head

174
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,920
Is hanging from the eastern cottonwood

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,460
You better wire me the rest
by this weekend if you want to avoid that.

176
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,220
Don't sing.

177
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,260
Don't sing, you punk!

178
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,270
Hey.

179
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,480
What did the streetlamp sing
for you to beat it up?

180
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,650
Say hello. They're from the
Rural Development Administration.

181
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,280
The Rural Development Administration?

182
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,190
Hello.

183
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,530
We stumbled across this
while visiting some farms.

184
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,200
Gosh.

185
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,580
You did an excellent job
growing the lettuce.

186
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,750
I highly doubt
that this lousy kid grew them.

187
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,000
Where are those men?

188
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,460
-Lion!
-Lion!

189
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,710
-Lion!
-Here she is!

190
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,710
Why do you keep coming back…

191
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,470
What were you thinking
digging a hole here?!

192
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,430
Oh, dear.

193
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,640
Ms. Jin will be upset once she finds out.

194
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,810
-Are you sure you saw it?
-Of course.

195
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,310
I may not be the brightest,
but I have great eyesight.

196
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,400
Feel free to bury me
in the lettuce field if I'm wrong.

197
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,240
Where are they going?

198
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,370
They left.

199
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,540
What… No way.

200
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,080
It was…

201
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,210
It was right here.

202
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,250
Hide!

203
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,470
-I told you to stay in the truck.
-Mom.

204
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,470
-Let me carry them. They're heavy.
-It's okay.

205
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,100
-They're heavy.
-Come on, let's go.

206
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,480
Mom.

207
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,780
Can you hold Lion for a minute?

208
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,950
Don't let her run off.

209
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,700
-Lion.
-No!

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,550
Goodness, he's so strong.

211
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,510
All right.

212
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,190
Have I told you

213
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,100
that I'm going to marry you?

214
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,280
-Lion!
-Lion!

215
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,280
-No! Lion!
-Lion!

216
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,080
Hello?

217
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,250
Yes.

218
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,920
Sorry?

219
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,170
Okay.

220
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,840
We have a situation!
We need to get out right now!

221
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,670
-Hurry!
-Why?

222
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,930
What's the matter?

223
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,800
Is it…

224
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,180
-who I think it is?
-Yes.

225
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,680
Mr. Bang.

226
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,390
-What?
-They want to interview us.

227
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,270
What interview?

228
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,150
About our lettuce.
We don't have much time. We must hurry.

229
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,110
Mr. Cha.

230
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,940
Step back.

231
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,820
One, two, three!

232
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,950
That worked!

233
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,250
-We have plenty of alcohol,
-Right.

234
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,130
-so have it with some pancakes.
-Goodness.

235
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,050
Gosh, why did you cook?

236
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,340
I mean,

237
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,010
I was actually peckish.

238
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,220
-Right.
-Here.

239
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,560
-Come and have some.
-Sure.

240
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
It looks good.

241
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,850
-Here.
-Thanks.

242
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,060
-Gosh, it looks good.
-Try some.

243
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,060
How is it?

244
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,320
This is insane.

245
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,530
What a surprise. I can't believe
you're complimenting my food.

246
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,700
It's insanely bitter.

247
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,830
What in the world did you put in?

248
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,420
It tastes just fine!

249
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,760
Look at that. I knew it.

250
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,930
You said you were on a diet.

251
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,890
Have you caved in already?

252
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,470
Goodness.

253
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970
Darn it.

254
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,390
-Goodness!
-Come on.

255
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,190
Here you all are.

256
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,400
-Goodness, come join us.
-Come here.

257
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,150
-Come.
-Come sit.

258
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,270
-Sit here.
-Take a seat.

259
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,610
Sit and have some.

260
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,700
-It's still very hot.
-Here.

261
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,950
Are you sure there will be enough?

262
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,830
-How is it?
-It's good.

263
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,790
So you're telling me that this dish

264
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,580
is tasty, right?

265
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,670
Yes.

266
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,670
It would've been tastier
had it been less bitter.

267
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,380
How is this bitter?

268
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,430
It tastes just fine.

269
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,220
You must be making alcohol.

270
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,970
We need to make it now

271
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,980
for it to last the rest of the year.

272
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,810
We all need to help out.

273
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,980
Exactly.

274
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,560
If you need all the help you can get,

275
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,690
why do you always leave me out?

276
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,070
Don't take it the wrong way.

277
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,700
It's just that you've been so busy
taking care of the pigs and Kang-ho.

278
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,280
I know how considerate you've been
and I'm grateful for that.

279
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,410
But from now on,
please invite me and Kang-ho too.

280
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,620
We're all neighbors.

281
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,210
It hurts my feelings
whenever you leave us out.

282
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,880
-Gosh, we're not leaving you out.
-That's not true.

283
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,420
All right then.

284
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,340
From now on,
I want you and Kang-ho to join us.

285
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,760
You better make it every time
until Kang-ho fully recovers

286
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,760
and becomes a prosecutor again.

287
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,730
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

288
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,190
Kang-ho won't go back
to being a prosecutor.

289
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,570
He never will.

290
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,740
You don't have to be so adamant about it.

291
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,950
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

292
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,580
Remember the lady you mentioned?

293
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,830
The daughter of the family
that runs the orchard.

294
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,370
Could you set her up with Kang-ho?

295
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,670
What?

296
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,380
I want to marry him off.

297
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,630
-What?
-What?

298
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,010
You want to marry him off?

299
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,090
Yes.

300
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,340
If he meets a decent woman
and starts a family,

301
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,140
I think he'll be more stable
and happier than he is now.

302
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,230
I'd appreciate your help.

303
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,190
Okay!

304
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,860
All right!

305
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,940
As the village head of Jou-ri,

306
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,570
I'll see to it that Kang-ho gets married!

307
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,200
Let's go!

308
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,620
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

309
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,700
-Let's go!
-All right!

310
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,990
You're eating so well.

311
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,660
Are you really not going to eat?

312
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,170
No, I need to be slim
if I want to wear a pretty wedding dress.

313
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,590
What are you drawing?

314
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,760
Let me see.

315
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,800
It's a bride and a groom. Open up.

316
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,640
I'm going to have an outdoor wedding.

317
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,850
The groom is so handsome.

318
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,980
He has a small face and long legs.

319
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,650
-What is he holding?
-A rock.

320
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,110
He must be very strong too.

321
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,860
A man needs to be strong.

322
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,280
He's useless.

323
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,540
I'll open it.

324
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,590
Are you eating well?

325
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,340
Here, you have some too.

326
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,340
Eat up.

327
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,970
I'm done.

328
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,640
-Ta-da.
-Goodness.

329
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,810
That looks nice.

330
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,970
OWNER OF HAPPY FARM

331
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,470
"Happy Farm"?

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,270
Yes, Kang-ho oppa is the owner now.

333
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,360
"Owner of Happy Farm."

334
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,400
The new pigs will arrive next week.

335
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,490
Then I'll be the wife
of the owner of Happy Farm.

336
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,740
Goodness.

337
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,200
"Wife"?

338
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,490
Dream on.

339
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,700
Starting tomorrow,
he'll be looking for a match…

340
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,410
-What?
-What?

341
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,290
…to set things on fire.

342
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,000
What?

343
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,800
Gosh, it's so greasy. I need kimchi.

344
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,430
What? Why in the world would he do that?

345
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,680
What is she talking about?

346
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,900
Why did I say that
in front of my unmarried daughter?

347
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,020
I'm such a fool.

348
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,980
I'm here.

349
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,780
I'm producing an incredible song--

350
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,450
What?

351
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,910
What's going on?

352
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,370
We're done for.

353
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,540
They ran off with all the investment money

354
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,460
that we scraped using your name!

355
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,460
Hold on.

356
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,680
What is…

357
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,890
My money!

358
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,390
-Where is he?
-There he is!

359
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,640
-There he is!
-The company went under!

360
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,850
What's going on?

361
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,060
-You bastard! Give me back my money!
-You bastard!

362
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,610
-My money!
-What is this?

363
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,900
Even his hair was fake!

364
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,150
Mom.

365
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,740
Did it hurt?

366
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,700
Mom, why do I need to do this?

367
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,200
Because we need to go somewhere today.

368
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,160
Where are we going?

369
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,050
Kang-ho.

370
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,590
Look.

371
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,470
This is for your fiancée.

372
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,430
-"Fiancée"?
-Yes.

373
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,600
A friend who'll live here

374
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,070
and run the farm with you.

375
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,610
You'll care for and love each other.

376
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,440
She'll be by your side forever.

377
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,320
A friend?

378
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,240
Like Mi-joo?

379
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,080
Not her.

380
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,080
Mi-joo has people she loves,

381
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,040
so she can't be by your side.

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,040
And who are they?

383
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,800
There's Ye-jin, Seo-jin,

384
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,010
and their dad who's in the US.

385
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,180
That horrifying bastard?

386
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,260
You've never even met him.
You can't call him like that.

387
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,850
Don't worry.

388
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,940
I'll find you someone better than Mi-joo.

389
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,230
All right.

390
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,780
Okay now.

391
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,700
Let's get you dolled up.

392
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,290
Why isn't this working?

393
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,040
-Hold on.
-Mom.

394
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,620
Mom.

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,340
Step aside!

396
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,340
Mousse.

397
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,730
That's incredible.

398
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,480
-You look handsome.
-What do you say?

399
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,190
Goodness! You look so handsome.

400
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
What do you say?

401
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,110
Is it my turn now?

402
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,380
What on earth is her deal?

403
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,460
A yakuza's daughter.

404
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,840
Let's go pick out his clothes.

405
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,350
-Let's see.
-Goodness.

406
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,970
Look at her meddling with my work.

407
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,850
All right.

408
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,230
Let's pick some out.

409
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,400
Goodness.

410
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,980
-What about this one?
-Gosh.

411
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,280
Doesn't it look elegant?

412
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,190
He'll look intelligent.

413
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Okay.

414
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,530
Oh, my. This is just to my taste.

415
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,160
Let's see.

416
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,790
-What do you think?
-I love it.

417
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,540
One, zero, two?

418
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,460
Is that a zero?

419
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,550
-It looks good.
-Yes.

420
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,260
Adding cologne would be nice.

421
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,760
-Cologne?
-It's always good to smell good.

422
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,970
Oh, my.

423
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,680
She still has it.

424
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,520
It's 0.5 carats.

425
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,060
Hi, 0.5 Carats.

426
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,320
I hope you find a nice owner.

427
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,940
Hi, 0.5 Carats.

428
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,780
I wonder who your owner will be.

429
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,030
We shouldn't try these on, right?

430
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,840
Goodness.

431
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,680
You look so handsome.

432
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,180
You look great.

433
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,850
You look amazing!

434
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,600
-You look so handsome.
-He does.

435
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,440
You look so handsome.

436
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,270
My dear Kang-ho.

437
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Where are you going?

438
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,450
You're finally wearing these again.

439
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,700
Here. Try them on.

440
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,830
They fit me perfectly.

441
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,050
Of course. They're yours.

442
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,010
-Turn around.
-Goodness.

443
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,760
Oh, my!

444
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,640
Gosh, you look so handsome.

445
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,890
Goodness me.

446
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,640
Goodness.

447
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,100
-You look great.
-You look amazing.

448
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
They must be here.

449
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,940
SAM-SIK'S MILL

450
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,030
That's enough.

451
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,280
Put it down.

452
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,450
Hey.

453
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,580
Look who it is.

454
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,370
It's Choi Kang-ho,
the most eligible bachelor of Jou-ri.

455
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,330
You're right.

456
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,170
It seems like

457
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,130
he's on a blind date
to find himself a match.

458
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,970
I don't know who the lucky lady will be,

459
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,300
but she sure will be hitting the jackpot.

460
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,800
You're totally right.

461
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,790
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
CHOI KANG-HO

462
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,080
He was incredibly smart

463
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,130
ever since he was young.

464
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,590
Bubbles.

465
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,840
Okay.

466
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,090
-Bubbles.
-Right, bubbles.

467
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,800
I have a few more.

468
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,900
He's handsome, well-built,

469
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,520
and kind.

470
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,650
How many pigs
do you have at your farm again?

471
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,280
We have about--

472
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,990
They have--

473
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,410
-They have 500 pigs--
-Go!

474
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,580
-That's Kang-ho!
-Go!

475
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,750
Go?

476
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,750
Their potato field
is over 10,000 pyeong wide.

477
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,170
No, it's 1,000 pyeong.

478
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,130
Right, 1,000 pyeong.
Let me explain how big that is.

479
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,340
It could contain over 300
30-pyeong apartment units.

480
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,140
No, 30 apartment units.

481
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,100
Right?

482
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,680
And the potato field is…

483
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,890
All right.

484
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,940
This is his house.

485
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,150
-Goodness.
-Take out the pigsty.

486
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,530
The remaining land costs
700,000 won per pyeong.

487
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,570
However, the only thing is…

488
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,950
There's just one tiny catch.

489
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,580
Kang-ho, how old are you?

490
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,500
I'm seven years…

491
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,420
I mean, I'm 35.

492
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,800
Something was off
when you kept talking about pigs.

493
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,510
This isn't right.

494
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,510
I can't believe we sat down with an idiot.

495
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,010
-"Idiot"?
-Let's go.

496
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,260
-Let's go, Mom.
-Wait…

497
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,810
-"Idiot"?
-Wait.

498
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,730
-I'm so offended.
-"Idiot"?

499
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,100
-That darn…
-How dare she…

500
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,530
Mom, can't I just live with you?

501
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,570
Goodness.

502
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,580
Do this.

503
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,330
Thank you for today.

504
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,840
Don't worry too much.
He'll find his match.

505
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,470
She's right. I'll look for someone better,
so don't you worry.

506
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,220
If we can't find one,
then I'll make one for him.

507
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,310
Shall we hurry home and make one then?

508
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,180
What? You should do it
while you still can.

509
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,850
-Let's go.
-Okay.

510
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,600
Get home safely.

511
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,650
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

512
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,900
-Bye.
-Bye.

513
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,400
SAM-SIK'S MILL

514
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,820
Let's buy some paint while we're in town.

515
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,740
Mom, why don't you buy any pesticides?

516
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,210
Pesticides? What for?

517
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,260
You want to show Mi-joo
how well-dressed you are, right?

518
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,310
All right. I'll buy some paint
and go to her salon.

519
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,180
So you can go there first.

520
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,060
I'll go pick you…

521
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,860
I'll go pick you up!

522
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,400
Gosh, you come here quite often.

523
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,570
Right.

524
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,530
It may not seem like much,

525
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,740
but getting my nails done
relieves my stress.

526
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,250
It feels good

527
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,000
and smells nice too.

528
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,840
-Mi-joo, I'm off to the storage.
-Okay.

529
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,220
What do you do after work?

530
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
Why do you ask?

531
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,520
Why don't we go somewhere nice
and have a cup of coffee?

532
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,810
I also have a few questions.

533
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,400
Like what?

534
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,860
For example, I'm curious about

535
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,150
how you give hand massages.

536
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,070
There are various types of massages.

537
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,620
There's oil massage.

538
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,410
There's also outcall massage.

539
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,830
Let me show you something.

540
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
That's it.

541
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,880
Like this.

542
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,920
There's this kind of massage too.

543
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,050
-Like this?
-That's right.

544
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,510
There's also this

545
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,010
and this.

546
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,220
If you do something like this again,
I'll snap your neck right off.

547
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,060
-You little…
-No.

548
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,230
Not by me.

549
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,060
But by your wife.

550
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,860
What?

551
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
Hey!

552
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,280
What did I do?

553
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,190
You kept glancing at my breasts
and groping my hand.

554
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,780
And what? Outcall massage?

555
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,160
Don't you know who I am?

556
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,410
Of course, I do.

557
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,950
You're Lee Bong-su,
the business alliance rep,

558
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,330
who's been going around
pestering young ladies

559
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,130
at hair salons and coffee shops
like a horny dog.

560
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,710
Leave. Come out.

561
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,590
Leave. Go.

562
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,550
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of everyone,

563
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,930
Representative Lee Bong-su?

564
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,050
You little…

565
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm bleeding!

566
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,730
You crazy bitch!

567
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,020
Come here!

568
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,610
-How dare you hurt me?
-What's going on?

569
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,980
-You little…
-What's wrong?

570
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,280
I'll put you behind bars
for attempted murder!

571
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,820
-What?
-Come here, you bitch!

572
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,880
Who the hell are you?

573
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,430
Goodness!

574
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,100
What…

575
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,720
Who are you?

576
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,430
I'm…

577
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
Well…

578
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,900
He's a prosecutor.

579
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,060
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

580
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,070
-What?
-You're in trouble now.

581
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,320
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

582
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,950
He groped me, cursed at me,
and sexually harassed me.

583
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,490
Come on, be a prosecutor, babe.

584
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,910
Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office?

585
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,500
Hey, why would a prosecutor from Seoul

586
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,500
date someone like you?

587
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,000
-What did you say?
-Mi-joo.

588
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,800
Why don't you answer me?

589
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,010
Are you a prosecutor? Are you?

590
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,220
-Seriously, that…
-Mi-joo.

591
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,100
Who are you trying to fool?

592
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,350
No, I…

593
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,140
Mi-joo, I'm not a prosecutor…

594
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,940
The lucky color is yellow
for the Year of the Dragon.

595
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,530
Mi-joo!

596
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,570
Over here!

597
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,490
-This way.
-Mi-joo, don't die.

598
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,950
Oh, no! Are you okay, Mi-joo?

599
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,120
-Are you okay?
-That bastard!

600
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,750
They must be hurt.

601
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,960
What…

602
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,090
"Choi Kang-ho."

603
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,760
"Supreme Prosecutors' Office."
He is a prosecutor.

604
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,090
See! He really is a prosecutor!

605
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,090
What are you going to do?

606
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,680
You better leave.

607
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,510
-Kang-ho.
-Go or you'll get in trouble!

608
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,100
-Are you okay? Wake up.
-Go mind your own business.

609
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,940
-I'll call 911.
-Are you okay? Hang in there.

610
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,850
Are you okay?

611
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,940
You're bleeding. Get up.

612
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,230
Are you okay? Oh, no.

613
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,610
Oh, no. Are you okay?

614
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,820
This is all my fault.

615
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,410
What do I do?

616
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,330
-Oh, no.
-No, it's okay.

617
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,710
It's okay, Mi-joo.

618
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,050
I can take the exam next year.

619
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,440
HAPPY FARM

620
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,040
Kang-ho, earlier in town…

621
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,830
Kang-ho.

622
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,370
Choi Kang-ho.

623
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,290
Yes?

624
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,840
What are you painting?

625
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,510
Wait.

626
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,890
-What happened to your forehead?
-What?

627
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,230
A motorcycle?

628
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,610
Are you out of your mind?

629
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,690
Let me see.

630
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,980
Are you hurt anywhere else?

631
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,190
No, I'm okay.

632
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,120
Wait, Mom…

633
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,950
You're not okay. You also hurt your arm.

634
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,790
Kang-ho.

635
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,920
What were you thinking
running toward the motorcycle?

636
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,460
Mi-joo almost got hurt.

637
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,380
So what?

638
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,630
Did she die?

639
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:45,850
Kang-ho.

640
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,140
Why would you say that?

641
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,060
I don't know.

642
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,400
It suddenly popped into my head.

643
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,730
All right, eat up.

644
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,630
So what?

645
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,380
Did she die?

646
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,880
I must've hurt him

647
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,390
very deeply.

648
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,470
That's why he still remembers those words.

649
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,270
But he can't regain his memories just yet.

650
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,520
He needs to get married
and start a family.

651
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,690
That way,

652
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,490
he won't act recklessly

653
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,330
to avenge you…

654
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,330
even if all his memories return.

655
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,460
So I beg you.

656
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,920
Please don't let him…

657
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,050
regain his memories until then.

658
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,820
I must've been crazy.

659
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,570
I was insane.

660
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,900
Darn it.

661
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,130
Mi-joo, why do you have
a plastic bag over your head?

662
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,680
Hey.

663
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,050
Hi, Kang-ho.

664
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,600
-Hi.
-I was a bit cold.

665
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,520
-You were cold?
-Yes.

666
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,600
You look like a hermit crab.
Or a greenhouse.

667
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,100
Right, because I'm wearing this.

668
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,940
-You should get going.
-Okay.

669
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,030
Bye.

670
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,740
Bye.

671
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,460
Mi-joo.

672
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,170
Yes?

673
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,500
I can't hold back anymore.

674
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,070
Did you have seaweed again?

675
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,030
There's another one over here.

676
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,410
"Again"?

677
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,530
I smelled seaweed
when we kissed back in town.

678
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,540
And you have some on your lips right now.

679
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,080
That's because I had gimbap for lunch.

680
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,170
I see.

681
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,170
You should brush your teeth to stay clean.

682
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,090
Why are you speaking casually to me?

683
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,090
You spoke casually to me
since we first met.

684
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,090
That's right. I did.

685
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,930
But you didn't up until yesterday.

686
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,260
So why did you suddenly change?

687
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,180
Do you see me as a pushover now?

688
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,730
No, I like you.

689
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,400
Bye.

690
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,910
Kang-ho.

691
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,870
Yes?

692
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,410
Do you want some beer?

693
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,920
No, I can't drink.

694
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,580
Bye.

695
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,960
As if.

696
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,670
You used to love beer.

697
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,800
Hold on.

698
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,300
What seaweed?

699
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,110
We need to nourish the pigs

700
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,280
so that they're happy and healthy.

701
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,120
PIG FEED MANAGEMENT

702
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,460
Goodness.

703
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,580
You're doing so well.

704
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,840
I picked the perfect owner.

705
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,510
Goodness.

706
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,550
I should cut your nails.

707
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,970
It's okay. I can cut them later.

708
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,600
We can do it right now.

709
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,390
Give me your hand.

710
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,560
Mom.

711
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,020
I noticed that
the feed tube was clogged up.

712
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,400
Let me go check.

713
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,860
The pigs need to eat.

714
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,490
But…

715
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,990
It won't take long. Bang, bang, bang.

716
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,200
-Ms. Jin.
-Hey.

717
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,990
Right. Hold on.

718
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,830
From now on, the owner of Happy Farm

719
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,210
is not me but him, Mr. Choi Kang-ho.

720
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,790
Right?

721
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,800
Yes.

722
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,980
I request a consultation.

723
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,570
About what?

724
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,110
Have you found a partner for Kang-ho yet?

725
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,490
No.

726
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,290
I have a female friend in my major.

727
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,750
Would you like
to set them up on a blind date?

728
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,500
That would be great.

729
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,040
Can you set up a date?

730
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,960
Okay.

731
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,920
-As soon as possible.
-Okay.

732
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,760
You're so cute. Give me a kiss.

733
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,390
Damn it.

734
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,930
It went in my mouth!

735
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,350
Come here, you punk!

736
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,730
Come here.

737
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,650
How could you pee on me?

738
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,810
-Seriously.
-Goodness.

739
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,980
Gosh, seeing you both on all fours,

740
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,030
I can't tell which of you is the real dog.

741
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,490
Come on. That's a bit harsh.

742
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,450
Wait, what's going on?

743
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,540
Where are you going with your lipstick on?

744
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
I'm going to town to search for a bride.

745
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,710
A bride? Gosh.

746
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,380
Shouldn't I have a say in whom you pick?

747
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,880
But there's no need.

748
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,130
There's a woman
who captured my heart ages ago.

749
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,630
Right?

750
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,760
The only woman who's ever captured you

751
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,470
is a female police officer.

752
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Mom!

753
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,930
It's for Kang-ho.

754
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,520
Don't you dare go out and get in trouble.
Just stay home, okay?

755
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,440
Kang-ho?

756
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,060
Yes.

757
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,320
What's the point of
having that expensive jewelry?

758
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,070
The moment girls meet Kang-ho,

759
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,740
they have absolutely
no desire to marry him.

760
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,160
You better stay home today!

761
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,780
Okay.

762
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,870
Oh, a blind date?

763
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,710
She's Andrea's friend from college.

764
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,880
Apparently, she wants to marry a nice man
and settle down in Korea.

765
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,090
So he told her about Kang-ho,

766
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,550
and she wanted to meet him.

767
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,300
Then why isn't Kang-ho here?

768
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,770
You said she wanted to meet him.

769
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,930
Well, I'm just worried.

770
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,150
She may say she's down to meet him.

771
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,150
But what if she doesn't like him
when they actually meet?

772
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,740
I don't want Kang-ho to get hurt again.

773
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,160
Don't worry too much.

774
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,580
What could Kang-ho possibly lack?

775
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,240
Let's be frank.
He's the perfect husband material.

776
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,330
If I had another daughter,

777
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,830
I would've immediately
married her off to him.

778
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,050
So don't concern yourself
with those rude brats.

779
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,680
Let's just focus on this blind date.

780
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,800
-Yes.
-Sure.

781
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,470
Let's focus on this instead.

782
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,800
Hold on.

783
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,560
Look at me.

784
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,350
What's with your face?

785
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,650
Jeez. Hold on.

786
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,270
Do this.

787
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,230
That's it.

788
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,690
Do this. Goodness.

789
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,900
You must've been stressed lately.
You look a bit rough.

790
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,740
You should wear some lipstick.

791
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,990
-Okay.
-Come on.

792
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,000
Don't go around looking so pale
and haggard as if your days are numbered.

793
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,500
You're looking livelier already. Gosh.

794
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,040
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

795
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:38,790
He's a prosecutor.

796
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,960
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

797
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,920
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

798
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,220
You're no longer a prosecutor.

799
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,140
You're the owner of Happy Farm.

800
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,600
Kang-ho!

801
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,320
Kang-ho, let's play.

802
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,940
Have you eaten?

803
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,070
Ta-da.

804
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,490
We should celebrate
your new position as the owner

805
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,030
of Happy Farm.

806
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,700
But I can't drink.

807
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,870
You're wrong.
You're actually a good drinker.

808
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,830
So drink up. Come on.

809
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,170
I can't.

810
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,920
Choi Kang-ho, you're an adult.

811
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,630
A man should know how to drink

812
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,380
and black out every now and then.

813
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,720
Who knows?
Maybe your memories will come back.

814
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,470
Here.

815
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,550
Drink up.

816
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,850
Cheers.

817
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,600
Drink up.

818
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,600
Go on.

819
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,770
Drink up.

820
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,020
Kang-ho, you punk.

821
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,280
You're a true man. I approve.

822
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,070
-Sam-sik.
-No.

823
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,450
We're out of alcohol. We're done.

824
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,620
It's not about that.

825
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,910
How can I become a prosecutor?

826
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,370
I want to become one again.

827
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,960
You want to become a prosecutor again?

828
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:06,920
Yes.

829
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:10,550
Then I should help you as your friend.

830
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,270
A prosecutor

831
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,890
should be a jerk.

832
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,230
A jerk.

833
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,520
But don't worry. You were born as one.

834
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,270
I see. That's a relief.

835
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,230
Second.

836
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,820
Second.

837
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,650
A prosecutor…

838
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,490
Right. Handcuffs.

839
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,240
You should have a pair of handcuffs.

840
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,080
For all the criminals you catch.

841
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,080
Handcuffs? What if I don't have any?

842
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,040
Don't worry. I'll get a pair for you.

843
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,460
Will you really do that?

844
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,250
Trust me.

845
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,380
I'm Bang Sam-sik.

846
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,170
Right!

847
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,470
If I were to get you
a pair of handcuffs for free,

848
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,310
you'd probably feel indebted, right?

849
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,230
No.

850
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,310
Come on.

851
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,650
Think carefully.

852
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,020
I'm sure you will.

853
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,730
All right.

854
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:07,860
How about this?

855
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,110
We'll give each other a gift.

856
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,450
I'll get you the handcuffs.

857
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,870
As for me…

858
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,830
What do I want?

859
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,460
Right! A ring!

860
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,580
A ring?

861
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,750
I've been dying to get a ring lately.

862
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,250
-Here.
-You want a ring?

863
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,380
Like this one.

864
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,670
You get it, right?

865
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,260
A ring like this.

866
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,430
Sam-sik.

867
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,180
-Yes?
-I have this.

868
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,390
Do you?

869
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,390
Yes, I do.

870
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,930
I didn't think you'd have one,
but I guess you do.

871
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,600
-I do.
-Gosh.

872
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,400
Then I guess
you could give it to me as a gift.

873
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,730
I can't.

874
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,730
It's for my fiancée.

875
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,900
Do you even know what a fiancée is?

876
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,740
-I do.
-What is it?

877
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,740
-A friend.
-"A friend"?

878
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,660
Yes.

879
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,540
-You're right!
-See?

880
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,870
You're so smart.

881
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,250
-I am.
-Gosh.

882
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:06,040
You're right. A fiancée is a friend.

883
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,210
You and I are friends, right?

884
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,630
That means I'm your fiancée.

885
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,090
Are you now?

886
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,930
Don't you want the handcuffs?

887
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,470
Go and get your fiancée's gift.

888
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,390
Don't you want the ring?

889
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,310
I do. I desperately want it.

890
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,520
-Do you?
-Of course, I do!

891
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,900
Okay, but promise me
you'll get me the handcuffs.

892
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,610
-I'll get them right now.
-All right.

893
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,160
-Do you want the ring?
-I do!

894
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,490
Shout if you want it!

895
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,620
Once more if you want it!

896
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,240
Once more for the last time!

897
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,950
Stop!

898
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,000
Hey, have you identified the body yet?

899
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,130
Yes, according to the DNA result, it's a
36-year-old female named Hwang Soo-hyun.

900
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,760
We found a passport in her bag,

901
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,510
and it was fake.

902
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,760
A fake passport?

903
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,180
Cause of death?

904
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,140
Based on the state of her body
and the autopsy result,

905
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,940
I doubt it was a murder.

906
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,650
How would you know?

907
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,650
Sorry?

908
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,280
We found 30 million won's
worth of dollars in her bag.

909
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,190
In a zipper bag at that.

910
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,910
Do you think she committed suicide
while carrying a fake passport

911
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:19,320
and 30 million won?

912
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:21,990
-You're right.
-All right.

913
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,000
Let her family know

914
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,920
and look into stowaway ships.

915
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,500
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

916
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,340
Still no word from Mr. So?

917
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,180
No, sir.

918
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,140
This won't do.

919
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,220
I'll have to go there myself.

920
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,360
He's so handsome.

921
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,400
Kang-ho is the best-looking in this town.

922
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,620
But I heard he was unwell.

923
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,540
If you have any videos of him,

924
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,000
I'd like to watch one.

925
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,460
I do. I have a video of him.

926
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,000
Ye-jin wanted to create
her own video channel,

927
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,300
so she took all kinds of videos.

928
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:17,970
Here's Kang-ho.

929
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,680
Hello, everyone.

930
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,520
Today, we're going to meet Kang-ho oppa,
the person I love the most.

931
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,850
He's drawing right now.

932
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,520
What are you drawing?

933
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,480
-My mom.
-I see.

934
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,070
Why are you drawing her?

935
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:36,990
Because I like her.

936
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,490
What do you like so much about her?

937
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,990
She's pretty, she has a beautiful voice,
and she's also very smart.

938
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,660
-He loves his mom.
-She's friendly and cooks well.

939
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,870
Goodness.

940
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,750
I don't know.
I just can't stop thinking about her.

941
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,550
All done.

942
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,630
Ta-da.

943
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,300
You look so pretty.

944
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,050
Oh, my.

945
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,220
You look very young

946
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,770
-in this drawing.
-Let me see.

947
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:09,770
Goodness.

948
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,850
Kang-ho is so in love with his mom.

949
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,110
Goodness me.

950
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,150
He drew so well.

951
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,820
I like him.

952
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,320
He seems like a nice person.

953
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,200
Can I meet him?

954
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,870
Of course, you can.

955
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,250
Are you serious?

956
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,040
-This is great!
-Thank you!

957
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,250
Thank you!

958
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,500
-You have a call!
-This is great!

959
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,420
-I am happy
-I am happy

960
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,380
-Hello?
-I am happy

961
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,180
-I am happy
-I am happy

962
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,430
The police station?

963
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,890
What is this?

964
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,720
What's going on?

965
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,430
Why are you here again?

966
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,810
You crazy bastard. You son of a gun.

967
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,440
-You punk.
-You just can't change!

968
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,940
You just can't change,
can you, you son of a gun?

969
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,440
Our village has been crime-free
for the past 20 years,

970
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,240
so Mr. Son was going to be awarded

971
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,490
by the prime minister
at the end of this month.

972
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,200
We had just 20 days to go.

973
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,490
What have you done, Sam-sik?

974
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,000
Gosh, my 20 years.

975
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,120
My 20 years…

976
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,670
Mr. Choi Kang-ho is here.

977
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,880
CONGRATULATIONS, JOU-RI!
CRIME-FREE FOR 20 YEARS

978
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,340
Sam-sik.

979
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,260
This was reported to be stolen.

980
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,600
Is it yours?

981
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,140
-Gosh.
-Wait.

982
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,020
Why is this here?

983
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,150
Goodness, it is hers.

984
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,690
Oh, dear.

985
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:37,980
My 20 years!

986
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,860
It all went down the drain!

987
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,490
I gave this to him as a gift.

988
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,330
-What?
-What?

989
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,330
It was a gift?

990
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,330
You gave this to him?

991
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,290
Yes.

992
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,210
I gave it to him.

993
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,920
Goodness.

994
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,790
Right.

995
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,170
Kang-ho gave it to him as a gift.

996
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,840
Gosh, our dear Kang-ho.

997
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,430
How kind of you.

998
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,890
-Let's put this back up.
-Yes.

999
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,310
-Why?
-It was a gift.

1000
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,980
A gift.

1001
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,900
Why did you give this to him?

1002
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,150
Because…

1003
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,860
he's my fiancée.

1004
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,490
Right, Sam-sik?

1005
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,030
What?

1006
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,990
What did he say?

1007
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,660
You really got the handcuffs.

1008
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,000
Thank you, my fiancée.

1009
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,000
What is he talking about?

1010
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,140
Mom.

1011
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,810
I'm sorry.

1012
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,900
Don't you know what's yours

1013
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,310
and what's important?

1014
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,070
I told you not to give away
what's yours to others.

1015
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,490
Mom.

1016
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,280
I want to be a prosecutor.

1017
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,740
Kang-ho, no.

1018
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,870
You promised me.

1019
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,880
You promised to run Happy Farm

1020
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,050
-with your fiancée and--
-No.

1021
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,380
I don't want to do that.

1022
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,970
I'm going to be a prosecutor again.

1023
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,880
You're no longer a prosecutor.

1024
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,140
Yes, I am.

1025
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,470
Mi-joo said I work at Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

1026
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,440
Is she the reason
why you want to be a prosecutor?

1027
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Yes.

1028
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:44,690
That's why.

1029
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:46,820
You little…

1030
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,160
Why won't you listen to me?

1031
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,990
Why are you giving me a hard time?

1032
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,290
Say that you were wrong.

1033
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,710
Promise me that
you won't say something like that again!

1034
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,960
I did everything you told me to.

1035
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,130
I ate well.

1036
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,300
I exercised diligently
and I even moved my arms and legs.

1037
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,770
I took medicine and received acupuncture.

1038
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,230
It was really painful and exhausting.

1039
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,190
When you tossed me into the water,

1040
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,270
I was terrified.

1041
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,570
But I still endured it all.

1042
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,530
Because it made you happy.

1043
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,660
I wanted to make you happy.

1044
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,120
So why won't you
let me do what I want to do?

1045
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,920
Why do you always decide for me?

1046
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,090
Is it because

1047
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,430
you also see me as an idiot?

1048
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:03,940
WHEN NAILS COME

1049
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,530
I'm sorry for dropping in on you
like this.

1050
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,740
It's okay.

1051
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,660
Is something going on?

1052
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,540
Kang-ho is getting married soon.

1053
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,830
Sorry?

1054
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,080
He went on a blind date today,

1055
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,630
and the lady seemed to like him.

1056
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,510
She's a foreigner.

1057
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,380
But she majored in nursing in Vietnam.

1058
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,550
She also worked at a hospital
and a school for the disabled.

1059
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,890
So I think she'll understand
and take good care of him.

1060
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,100
Speaking of which,

1061
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,480
could you please help him?

1062
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,530
What do you mean?

1063
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,320
What can I do?

1064
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,070
Kang-ho…

1065
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,450
seems to like you a lot.

1066
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,710
I told him numerous times that

1067
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:08,250
you were married to someone else,

1068
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,630
but I don't think he understands.

1069
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,630
So Mi-joo,

1070
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,760
could you please talk some sense into him?

1071
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,230
Please, Mi-joo.

1072
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:28,900
The lady will be visiting us tomorrow.

1073
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,110
He needs to get married this time.

1074
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,820
I'm running out of time.

1075
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,950
So please help me.

1076
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,120
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

1077
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,750
Something's going on, right?

1078
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,460
No, nothing's going on.

1079
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,920
No, something's up.

1080
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,090
You bought herbicide last time,

1081
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,010
and Kang-ho told me
that you abandoned him.

1082
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,220
And now, you're rushing his marriage.

1083
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,180
Something's going on, right?

1084
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,350
Please tell me.

1085
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,060
That's the only way I can help.

1086
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,190
Well…

1087
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:20,320
Mi-joo.

1088
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,330
The thing is…

1089
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,290
I'm quite unwell.

1090
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,340
I'm dying soon.

1091
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,060
There's something I want to do.

1092
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,720
-Hi!
-Hi.

1093
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,430
-Hello.
-Hello.

1094
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,180
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Say hi.

1095
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,230
-This is my friend, Kim Jun-won.
-Hello.

1096
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,310
Hello.

1097
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,530
He's not bad, right?

1098
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,280
I'm sorry for not telling you this sooner.

1099
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,120
-What?
-Actually…

1100
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,030
Yes?

1101
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,870
I'm pregnant.

1102
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:49,500
What?

1103
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,370
What did you say?

1104
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,790
You're pregnant?

1105
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,800
Does he know?

1106
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,300
I didn't tell him.

1107
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,800
You idiot. You should've told him.

1108
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,550
He said there was something
he wanted to do.

1109
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,180
And that he could only do it without me.

1110
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,520
It was important enough
for him to break up with someone he loved.

1111
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,530
If I told him I was pregnant
with his babies,

1112
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,110
he would've given it up.

1113
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,080
I don't want to ruin his life anymore.

1114
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,460
Wait. "Babies"?

1115
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,750
What?

1116
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,000
What do you mean?

1117
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:41,760
Twins.

1118
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,390
I got an ultrasound.

1119
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,350
I saw two peas.

1120
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:49,810
It was so adorable!

1121
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,560
Lee Mi-joo!

1122
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,810
Are you saying
you're going to have the babies?

1123
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,980
Yes.

1124
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,110
My twins and I will wait for him.

1125
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,740
Kang-ho…

1126
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,910
will return once he's done.

1127
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,080
SUPREME COURT OF KOREA

1128
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,290
There's your mommy.

1129
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,870
What did they say?
Can you get your money back?

1130
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,750
Even if the judge orders
the landlord to pay,

1131
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,670
they can ignore it and get away with it.

1132
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,090
That's ridiculous.

1133
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,550
Didn't you say
the landlord has many houses?

1134
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,720
You should get your money even by force.

1135
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:34,390
They already put the houses
under someone else's name,

1136
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,060
so compulsory execution is not an option.

1137
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:40,400
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

1138
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,030
It's okay.

1139
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,490
I'm sorry, guys.

1140
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:50,030
I wanted you guys
to live in a bigger house.

1141
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,370
But I'm afraid we'll have to live
in Sillim-dong for now.

1142
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,210
I'm broke because I haven't been working
since giving birth.

1143
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:00,670
Sun-young.

1144
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,840
I should start working again.

1145
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,350
Let's hurry home.

1146
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:14,140
-Let's go.
-Over here.

1147
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,850
Kang-ho.

1148
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,060
Hurry.

1149
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,480
Hey, isn't that Choi Kang-ho?

1150
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,070
Hey, isn't that Choi Kang-ho?

1151
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:26,690
It is.

1152
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,990
He finally made it.

1153
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,950
Why would such a wealthy girl

1154
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,910
date someone like him?

1155
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,080
He has neither money nor connections.

1156
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,210
She's his money and connection.

1157
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:41,460
He had been following her around
ever since he was at the institute.

1158
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,590
You dedicated yourself
to supporting him while he studied,

1159
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,090
and what he wanted to do
was meet some well-off girl?

1160
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,590
What a jerk.

1161
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,680
You better hope I don't catch you.

1162
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,430
You're dead meat if I do.

1163
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,320
PETIT NAIL

1164
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,570
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

1165
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,620
What are you doing?

1166
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,460
Gosh, who is it so early in the morning?

1167
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,550
Goodness.

1168
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,640
Who are they?

1169
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,360
MOM, IT'S MI-JOO. PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF MY BABIES, YE-JIN AND SEO-JIN.

1170
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:54,910
Mi-joo.

1171
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,830
Mi-joo, come on out.

1172
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,410
Mi-joo!

1173
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,830
Mi-joo, you crazy brat!

1174
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,920
Where the hell are you?

1175
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,050
Mi-joo!

1176
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:11,130
Goodness.

1177
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:15,260
Oh, dear. What do I do?

1178
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:19,600
-What do I do?
-I should've told him that I was pregnant.

1179
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,140
Even if he was
eventually going to leave us,

1180
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,480
Kang-ho still should've known.

1181
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,400
I made a mistake

1182
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,280
to Kang-ho,

1183
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,700
Ms. Jin,

1184
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,240
my kids,

1185
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,460
and…

1186
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,710
to you, Mom.

1187
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,090
What did you say?

1188
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,300
So you're saying

1189
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,890
Kang-ho is their father?

1190
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,680
Choi Kang-ho from the pig farm?

1191
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,440
The Choi Kang-ho that we all know?

1192
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,650
Oh, dear.

1193
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,990
No.

1194
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:17,660
Why do you have to end up
with an idiot like him?

1195
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:19,490
Hang on.

1196
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,080
Who knows about this?

1197
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,500
Did you tell his mom?

1198
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,750
No.

1199
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,960
Goodness. Thank God.

1200
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,920
That's a relief.

1201
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,970
Listen to me carefully.

1202
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,760
You can't be with him.

1203
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,560
Do you know how exhausting it is
to care for someone who's unwell?

1204
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,270
You'll have to sacrifice your entire life.

1205
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,060
What will you tell the kids?

1206
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,150
Last time,

1207
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:54,860
when Seo-jin said that he wished
Kang-ho were his dad,

1208
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:58,070
didn't you see
how Ye-jin had a fit about it?

1209
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,370
Goodness.

1210
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:07,620
Goodness.

1211
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,330
Oh, dear.

1212
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,380
Oh, dear.

1213
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,010
Oh, dear.

1214
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,640
Goodness.

1215
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,470
I can't believe this.

1216
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:27,100
They say you're unlucky with your kids

1217
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,730
if you're unlucky with your husband.

1218
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,820
I can't believe this.

1219
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,040
Gosh, my poor babies…

1220
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,170
Oh, no…

1221
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,000
My poor babies…

1222
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:54,000
Why?

1223
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,170
Why do you pity us?

1224
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,600
You don't have to.

1225
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,680
There's no reason to pity us.

1226
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:23,950
Do you like them?

1227
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,990
Okay.

1228
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,290
Gosh, you're so handsome.

1229
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,460
Kang-ho.

1230
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,590
Let's eat and get ready.

1231
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,050
We'll be having a guest soon.

1232
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,560
You're upsetting me right now.

1233
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,800
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1234
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,980
I'm my mom's guardian.

1235
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,940
Hey, get away from him!

1236
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:45,030
Yes, I'm your mom.

1237
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:48,870
"DNA Test Result." It's a test result.

1238
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,660
Sam-sik, why aren't you picking up?

1239
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:55,460
No one can prove it
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

1240
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,880
Mom.

1241
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,920
-I already know.
-I'm such a bad mom.

1242
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,970
Mom, why are you so mean?

1243
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:08,300
I want to spend every minute and second
I have left being happy with you.

1244
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,520
