1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,150
-You punk.
-What the…

3
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,860
-You punk. How could you do that?
-What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,400
-How could you?
-What's with you?

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,900
-Calm down.
-I mean,

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,030
of all people,

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,870
how could you do that to Kang-ho,

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,990
that poor kid?

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,120
Why do you pity him?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,290
-What?
-He got all the attention

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,960
for being smart and getting good grades.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,670
And now he's getting all the attention
because he's become an idiot.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,090
As if his mom's love isn't enough,

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,300
even the lady next door dotes on him.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,140
You were always too busy with the mill
to make me a birthday meal,

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,760
but when Kang-ho got into SNU,

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,310
you even closed the mill
and threw him a feast!

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,190
Darn it, I'm your kid, not him.

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,480
Why do you think I did that?

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,360
I thought you'd benefit a little

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,990
if you were around a smart kid like him.

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,700
It was humiliating and frustrating,

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,660
but I still put up with everything.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,740
That's…

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,620
That's how I held out.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,340
Why are you crying?
You're breaking my heart. It's all right.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,510
Hey, you punk.
Why are you making my woman cry?

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,390
I needed some money.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,430
I wanted to work,

30
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,350
but I couldn't get a job anywhere
with my criminal record.

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,020
How much do you need?

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,480
Tell me!

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,280
-Two…
-What? Two million won?!

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,280
Two million won?!

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,950
You cursed punk! Two million won?!

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,750
Look who it is.

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,960
My love Mi-joo…

38
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,460
Mom, where are we going?

39
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,420
Where is she going this early?

40
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,100
Hello?

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,100
What?

42
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,140
Kang-ho.

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,060
Let's eat and get ready.

44
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,740
We'll be having a guest soon.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
You're upsetting me right now.

46
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,160
Mom, where are we going?

47
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,840
This is Kang-ho oppa's place.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,260
Ye-jin.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,810
Seo-jin.

50
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,710
Mom?

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,130
Mom!

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,380
Mom?

53
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,050
Mom.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Mom!

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
Mom!

56
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,100
Excuse me.

57
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,730
Is this Mr. Choi Kang-ho's place?

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Yes.

59
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,650
This is it.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,820
Don't give out
his personal information to a stranger!

61
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,200
Who are you
and why are you looking for him?

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,120
My name is Hoang.

63
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,250
I'm supposed to meet him today,

64
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,330
but I couldn't get in touch.

65
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,790
Mom.

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,920
Mi-joo, my mom…

67
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,880
-What?
-Mom…

68
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,970
What's going on?

69
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,260
Mom.

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,810
Ms. Jin!

71
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,430
-Mom, please.
-Ms. Jin, wake up.

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,020
-Mom.
-Ms. Jin!

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,560
-Oh, no.
-No…

74
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,900
-Don't shake her like that. Please move.
-Sorry?

75
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,020
Okay.

76
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,620
She's in hypovolemic shock.

77
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,790
Hello? I'm calling from Jou-ri.

78
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,250
We have a medical emergency.

79
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,130
Kang-ho, bring me a thick blanket
and pillows.

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,960
Okay, a blanket and pillows.

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,880
-A blanket…
-How long will it take?

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,760
It's an emergency.

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,260
Please come quickly.

84
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,800
-Yes.
-Lift up her legs so the blood

85
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,470
-can get to her heart.
-Legs.

86
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,970
-Higher.
-Higher.

87
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,180
-Okay.
-You two go wait at home.

88
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,390
Is Ms. Jin dead?

89
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,650
No. Don't worry.

90
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,110
Seo-jin, go home with Ye-jin.

91
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,150
Okay?

92
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,740
Good. Get home safely.

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,450
Ms. Hoang.

94
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,490
-Can you stay with her for 20 minutes?
-Yes, of course.

95
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,580
Kang-ho, where's the car key?

96
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,580
The car key?

97
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,830
HAPPY FARM

98
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,170
License plate 6169, pink truck.

99
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,090
Pull over to the right. You're speeding.

100
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,890
License plate 6169, pull over!

101
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,140
-Pull up next to them.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,270
What are you doing?

103
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,770
-Pull over.
-Can't you hear me?

104
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,230
You're speeding!

105
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Sir! Please help us!

106
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,610
-What?
-My mom just collapsed.

107
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,820
It's hy…

108
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,070
Hy…

109
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,740
Hypovolemic shock.

110
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,490
Hypovolemic… What?

111
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,040
-Hypovolemic shock.
-Hype?

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,500
What are you saying?

113
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,500
Hypovolemic shock!

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,040
-What?
-She's in hypovolemic shock!

115
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,500
-Hurry up and go.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,170
We're escorting an emergency patient.

117
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,170
Please make way.

118
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,140
-Put her on IV.
-What's wrong with my mom?

119
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,470
Why is she ill?

120
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,770
I'm sorry, but please wait outside.

121
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,390
No, I want to stay here.

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,350
Let's wait outside

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,980
so that she can get treated.

124
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Thank you.

125
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,030
We arrived safely

126
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,450
thanks to your first aid.

127
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,790
I should thank you.

128
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,790
You drove her here
without waiting for the ambulance,

129
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,750
so my mother-in-law
could get treated quickly.

130
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,840
I see.

131
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,670
-Hey.
-Here.

132
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,930
You must be in shock.

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,470
We're at the hospital now,
so you can relax.

134
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,600
Thank you.

135
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,810
By the way, who are you?

136
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,650
I didn't get to introduce myself
in the midst of this chaos.

137
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,280
My name is Hoang,
and we were supposed to meet today.

138
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,950
Ms. Jin Young-soon's guardian?

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,250
-Yes?
-Yes?

140
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,710
You wanted to open
a clothing store, didn't you?

141
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,840
I'll open one for you,

142
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,010
but make a small space in a corner
for a nail salon.

143
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,800
It's not for you!

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,380
It's for Mi-joo!

145
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,260
I'll sell my garlic field
and whatever else to fund it,

146
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,180
so take Mi-joo and the twins
and look after them.

147
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,310
Your sister

148
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,230
will be ruined if she stays here.

149
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,810
Goodness.

150
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,610
Goodness, it smells rotten.

151
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,660
It smells like an old man.

152
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,030
Hoon-ah?

153
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,870
Are you here?

154
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,920
My goodness, this place reeks.

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,050
What's all this?

156
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,390
Baek Hoon-ah!

157
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,430
Goodness! What the hell are you doing?

158
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,470
Serves you right.

159
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,270
You're getting punished.

160
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,060
Right, that pig lady.

161
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,020
How's she doing these days?

162
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,940
The foot-and-mouth disease
took a toll on her,

163
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,780
but she's doing better now.

164
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,150
Not that.

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,570
Then what? Her son?

166
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,200
That woman.

167
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,160
Good grief, how frustrating!

168
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,330
What?

169
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,910
She hasn't told anybody?

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,870
She's still keeping it a secret?

171
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,380
A secret?

173
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,510
She's critically ill?

174
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,090
She has stage four stomach cancer.

175
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,760
The cancer cells have metastasized
to her peritoneum and lungs,

176
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,970
so there's…

177
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,930
Excuse me.

178
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,730
I'm sorry, Doctor,

179
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,650
but please speak with me.

180
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,030
It's tough for him to understand
what you're saying right now.

181
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,410
I'm a friend of his and--

182
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,910
No.

183
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,160
Please speak with me. I want to hear it.

184
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm…

185
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,660
I'm my mom's guardian.

186
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,550
Kang-ho, wait.

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Kang-ho!

188
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,070
Mom, get up.

189
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,990
Mom, get up. Come with me.

190
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,360
Mom, let's go home.

191
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,280
Kang-ho, don't do this.

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,490
Come home with me, Mom.

193
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,500
Mom, open your eyes!

194
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,790
Mom…

195
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,170
Mom, I'm sorry.

196
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,220
I'll do as you say from now on.

197
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,390
I won't…

198
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,140
I won't be a prosecutor anymore.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
Mom, please get up.

200
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,020
-Kang-ho, stop it.
-Mom.

201
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,440
Mom, I won't like Mi-joo anymore,
just as you wanted.

202
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,520
I won't like Mi-joo anymore.

203
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,270
Mom, so please, wake up.

204
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,950
Wake up, Mom.

205
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,500
Hey, Andrea.

206
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,210
I think

207
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,290
you set me up with the wrong guy.

208
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Is anybody…

209
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,220
up there?

210
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,600
Is anyone…

211
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,810
really up there?

212
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,520
I know you can be cruel,

213
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,610
but this is way too harsh.

214
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,650
Wasn't it enough

215
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,950
to take her husband

216
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,530
and make her son like that?

217
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,120
What did that good woman ever do?

218
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,750
Goodness.

219
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,460
How could you try to take her life too?

220
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,760
Grandma!

221
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,050
Grandma, where have you been?

222
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,810
We looked everywhere for you.

223
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,770
Ms. Jin collapsed!

224
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,020
She collapsed?

225
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,020
When?

226
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,980
This morning.

227
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,980
Mom and Kang-ho oppa
took her to the hospital.

228
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,240
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER MI-JOO

229
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,370
Gimbap with no carrots.

230
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,580
Eat some.

231
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,750
Everyone Mom made gimbap for

232
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,960
never returned home.

233
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,970
Grandma, Grandpa,

234
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,510
and Dad too.

235
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,600
That's why she never let me go
on a school picnic.

236
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,850
She was afraid I wouldn't return.

237
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,940
So my mom isn't a bad person.

238
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,610
You're right.

239
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,530
She's not a bad person.

240
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,490
Then why is she ill?

241
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,670
I'm getting punished
because I'm a bad person.

242
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,250
But why is my mom being punished?

243
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,960
No, Kang-ho.

244
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,010
Neither of you

245
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,100
is getting punished.

246
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,720
This is…

247
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,810
something that nobody wants,

248
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,440
but something that can happen to anybody.

249
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,190
Just as Ms. Jin was there for you

250
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,400
when you were unwell,

251
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,490
it's your turn

252
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,990
to stay strong by her side.

253
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
Okay?

254
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,170
She's going to be fine.

255
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,050
She'll be okay.

256
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,050
Hey!

257
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,390
Hey, get away from him!

258
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,060
What are you two doing in broad daylight?

259
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,190
Mom.

260
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,770
Hello.

261
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,690
I'm afraid I don't have time
to exchange greetings.

262
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,110
Where's your mom?

263
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,860
I'll stay here.

264
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,450
You should go home
and look after your kids.

265
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,660
Listen, Mom.

266
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,120
Go home.

267
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,210
You darn brat.

268
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,130
You crazy bitch.

269
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,670
I ought to…

270
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,170
Lead the way.

271
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,940
Ma'am, what are you doing?

272
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,770
You can't do this.

273
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,980
Let go of me!

274
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,610
Doctor.

275
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,400
Will I live if I get this IV shot?

276
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,990
Will I live if I stay in bed?

277
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,740
If not, let me go.

278
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,660
Help me make the best use

279
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,120
of the time I have left.

280
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,880
I have…

281
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,040
I have no time to be here.

282
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,510
I was supposed to meet
my son's future bride today.

283
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,130
What time is it right now?

284
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,720
Goodness.

285
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,930
Oh, no.

286
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
My goodness.

287
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,350
Goodness.

288
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,850
My goodness, why is this happening?

289
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,810
My goodness.

290
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,400
My goodness.

291
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,440
My goodness. Oh, no.

292
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,740
My goodness.

293
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,360
Things were finally beginning to
look up for you.

294
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,330
Do you see the tear here?

295
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,960
And you dare sell this
as an authentic item?

296
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,040
I thought of reporting you
but decided to refrain.

297
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,880
I want a refund.

298
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,550
I'm so sorry,

299
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,130
but how do I know if there was
something wrong with the stitch work

300
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,550
because of what I did

301
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,930
-or what you--
-I'll report it.

302
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,850
I'm not looking to nitpick over that.

303
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,480
I need cash to give you a refund,

304
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,270
but as you can see, I don't have…

305
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,730
You have exactly two million.

306
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,940
Sorry?

307
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,900
BALANCE 2,000,000 WON

308
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,280
PARK SUNG-AE

309
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,870
I'm busy. What do you want?

310
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,580
Why did you deposit money
without my permission?

311
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,670
-Pay it back.
-Okay.

312
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,250
Mom, while you're at it,
can you lend me some more?

313
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,720
Gosh, my mom can be so cool.

314
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,480
It looks brand new.

315
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,310
Who did this to the bag?

316
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,770
What is this?

317
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,690
What the…

318
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,530
What is this?

319
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,910
"DNA Test Result"?

320
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,030
Hello, Ms. Hoang.

321
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,200
It's me, Kang-ho's mom.

322
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,660
I didn't have my phone with me
so I couldn't call you.

323
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,500
I'm so sorry about this morning.

324
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,790
I heard from my son
that you came to the hospital with him.

325
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,090
Sorry?

326
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,760
What do you mean?

327
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,630
Nonsense.

328
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,300
It's a misunderstanding.

329
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,430
Mi-joo is just a childhood friend.

330
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,140
Don't be like that. Let's meet.

331
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,100
Let's talk in person.

332
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,690
Ms. Hoang?

333
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,440
Ms. Hoang?

334
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,200
Mom, where are you going?

335
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,830
Stay here.

336
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,880
No, Mom. You're very ill right now.

337
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,090
Yes.

338
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,090
You heard it from the doctor, right?

339
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,180
I'm very ill right now.

340
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,970
So please,

341
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,720
just stay here.

342
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,400
Did you tell him?

343
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,320
What?

344
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,070
Didn't you go to tell him
that he's Ye-jin and Seo-jin's father?

345
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
I did.

346
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,950
At the very least,
I thought Ms. Jin should know.

347
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,660
Goodness.

348
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,750
This is bad.

349
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,870
But…

350
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,380
I couldn't tell her

351
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,090
because she collapsed.

352
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,170
You couldn't?

353
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
Wait.

354
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,510
You didn't tell her?

355
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
Goodness gracious.

356
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,970
Thank you, deities of heaven and earth.

357
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,350
What a relief.

358
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,730
You should

359
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,060
take the kids
and go live with your eldest sister.

360
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,900
I talked to her, and she agreed.

361
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
You can open up a nail salon there.

362
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Listen.

363
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,950
It's not just Kang-ho anymore.
His mom is unwell too.

364
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,960
Do you want to waste your life
looking after people?

365
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,790
-Mom, come on!
-Yes.

366
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,080
I'm your mom.

367
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,630
And my daughter is about to ruin her life,
so what wouldn't I say to stop you?

368
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,670
Mom.

369
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,380
You must be mistaken.

370
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,300
Listen carefully.

371
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,300
I'm

372
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,390
never getting back with him.

373
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,890
What you're imagining right now
will never happen.

374
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,850
Yes.

375
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,770
I plan to live happily with my kids.

376
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,820
Right?

377
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,530
You will, right?

378
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,570
But…

379
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,070
I won't run away either.

380
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,410
Why should I?

381
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,580
Why should Ye-jin and Seo-jin do that?

382
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
Mi-joo.

383
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,960
Mi-joo, are you there?

384
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,250
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

385
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,550
Do you remember that young lady
who came to the hospital?

386
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,720
Yes. Ms. Hoang, right?

387
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
Yes, that's her.

388
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,390
She's going to

389
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,560
marry Kang-ho.

390
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,230
Yes, I know.

391
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,640
You do?

392
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,980
You already knew?

393
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,690
Then why did you do that?

394
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,990
Sorry? What did I do?

395
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,280
I mean,

396
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,200
what did you do to make her say

397
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,040
she won't marry him because of you?

398
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Mi-joo.

399
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,000
I asked you to help me.

400
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,460
I told you about my situation

401
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,380
and asked you to help me.

402
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,460
Then you shouldn't have ruined this.

403
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,920
Why do you

404
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,760
always ruin Kang-ho's future?

405
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,810
Who's ruining whose future?

406
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,850
Mom.

407
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,940
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

408
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,270
How could you torment my kid
for the sake of your kid?

409
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,190
Mom, stop it.

410
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
You also did that

411
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,740
when she got into that accident!

412
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,450
How was it her fault

413
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,330
that Kang-ho didn't take the exam?

414
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,950
She was hurt badly!

415
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,330
Why do you blame everything on my child?

416
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,500
But I still put up with you

417
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,380
because I knew
what you went through raising him.

418
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,460
Yet you're going this far?

419
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,090
Do you have any idea

420
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,340
-who ruined whose future?
-Mom! Stop!

421
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,930
Go back inside. Please!

422
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,760
-Darn it.
-Go inside.

423
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,770
Go.

424
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,650
Go inside.

425
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,770
Take a good look.
Don't you remember this bag?

426
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,030
I don't know.

427
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,610
Hey, sit back down.

428
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,120
Don't be so half-hearted again. Goodness.

429
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,830
You gave this bag to your mom

430
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,410
on the day you brought
your fiancée to introduce to her.

431
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,700
Assemblyman Oh's daughter.

432
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,420
Why do you have the bag
I bought for my mom?

433
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,880
Did you steal this too?

434
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,790
Of course not.

435
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,010
Your mom gave it to my mom.

436
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm serious!

437
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,970
You don't trust me?

438
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,890
-Should I call my mom?
-So what is it that you want to say?

439
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,260
Yes, right.

440
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,680
What I wanted to say was…

441
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,940
Do you know what this is?

442
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,560
Take a good look.

443
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,070
I do.

444
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,190
-Do you know whose this is?
-No.

445
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,030
Right, you don't.

446
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,030
Well, while we're on the subject…

447
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,740
Ta-da!

448
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,160
We're about to look at this together.

449
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,370
Why should I do that with you?

450
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,670
Well, because…

451
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,840
Kang-ho, you said
you wanted to be a prosecutor.

452
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,800
Take a look.

453
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,630
"DNA Test Result."

454
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,850
It's a test result.

455
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,560
It's a test that shows if you have the DNA

456
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,020
to be a prosecutor.

457
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,640
And the result is right in here. Got it?

458
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,480
I'm not going to be a prosecutor anymore.

459
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,150
-My mom doesn't approve.
-Darn it.

460
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,780
Yes, right.

461
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,740
You won't, right?

462
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,360
So let's find out if your DNA says
you don't have to be a prosecutor.

463
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,030
Please just do the damn thing.

464
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
When I click this file here,

465
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,120
I have to type in a password.

466
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,170
-Do you know it?
-Zero, nine, zero, seven.

467
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,370
Zero, nine, zero, seven?

468
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,630
I didn't expect it'd go so smoothly…

469
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,420
I knew it, you punk.

470
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,880
-That's not it.
-Zero, three, one, two.

471
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,550
Zero, three… Okay, zero, three, one, two.

472
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,550
I have a good feeling…

473
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,470
ENTER PASSWORD

474
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
…about nothing.

475
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,020
Damn it, that's not it either.

476
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,140
Get it together!

477
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,480
Think again. Hurry.

478
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,860
CAPTAIN BAE

479
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,570
Keep trying.

480
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,240
Goodness, sir.

481
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,950
I was about to give you a call just now.

482
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,540
I'll let you talk alone then.

483
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,400
ENTER PASSWORD:
DKQJWL

484
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,940
Darn it, what the heck?

485
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,570
Move aside.

486
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,950
Sam-sik, look.

487
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,030
What?

488
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,200
-No way! You opened it?
-I…

489
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,790
My gosh, Kang-ho! My dear Kang-ho!

490
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,370
My smart fiancée.

491
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,330
Good.

492
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,540
All right, let's take a look.

493
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,010
Before we do that,

494
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,590
we should get rid of everything

495
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,930
-that can hurt us.
-What?

496
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,760
It's a voice recording, not a video.

497
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,140
Will you get rid of the original
DNA test result in front of me?

498
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,100
-Come on. Getting rid of that paper
-This guy.

499
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,810
-won't change anything.
-Who's this?

500
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,100
This guy.

501
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,730
He'll get rid of them
as if they never existed.

502
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,570
My son will do that.

503
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,190
Right?

504
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,780
I'll take care of it.

505
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,280
That's your voice, Kang-ho. Right?

506
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,830
I'll let you talk alone then.

507
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,920
Is that all?

508
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,130
Are you suggesting that
we kill Hwang Soo-hyun?

509
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,050
We can't just get rid of the mother.

510
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,430
The kid must go too.

511
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,600
This won't cause trouble, right?

512
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,890
The mighty Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
is scared of something like this?

513
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,440
Don't worry.

514
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,440
Even if it does cause trouble later,

515
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,730
Kang-ho will take the fall.

516
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,400
That's why I keep him around.

517
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,530
Then I'll be counting on you,
Chairman Song.

518
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,120
Sure.

519
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,950
What are they talking about?

520
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,080
So this

521
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,590
belongs to Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo?

522
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,630
Yes!

523
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,920
This is it.

524
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,180
Sam-sik.

525
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,840
What is this?

526
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,760
Who are they? Why am I talking about
this stuff with them?

527
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,770
I already told you.

528
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,890
You were going to marry

529
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

530
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,190
Then who's Hwang Soo-hyun?

531
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,110
Did I do something to her?

532
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,070
You said you'd take care of her.

533
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,200
So what did you do to her?

534
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,200
You didn't

535
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,120
kill her or anything, right?

536
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,590
Hey.

537
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,710
What are you doing?

538
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,710
-This is mine.
-So what will you do?

539
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,340
I don't know.

540
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,640
But I feel like
I need to find out what this is.

541
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,430
-My mom might know.
-No.

542
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,440
Hey, you idiot. Are you stupid?

543
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,270
If your mom knew about this,

544
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,730
would she have given this bag to my mom?

545
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,200
I understand how you feel.

546
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,910
Of course, you'd want to know.

547
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,870
Okay.

548
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,490
Let's do this.

549
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,910
I'll find out for you.

550
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,170
-You will?
-Yes.

551
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,670
I'll meet and ask them myself.

552
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,550
Think about it.

553
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,050
There's a possibility
that you really did something very bad.

554
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,010
And if you did and your mom finds out,
she'll be greatly shocked.

555
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,140
Don't you think so?

556
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,770
-What are you doing?
-Listen up.

557
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,770
I have to know what this is.

558
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,610
So if you deceive me
and do something weird again,

559
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,110
I won't let it slide, okay?

560
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,320
Okay.

561
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,160
Here's the password.

562
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,620
Okay.

563
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,630
D, K, Q…

564
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,840
That spells "father."

565
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,720
Mom is ill.

566
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,730
By the way, Dad,

567
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,560
who are you?

568
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,700
Why was I reminded of you

569
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,620
when I heard those scary words?

570
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,790
I've never even met you.

571
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,420
So why do I miss you?

572
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,800
Why does my heart…

573
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,390
ache so much?

574
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,290
Who are you, Dad?

575
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,130
And who am I?

576
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,550
What do I have to do?

577
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,200
There you were, Kang-ho.

578
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,540
How are you?

579
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,670
Are you happy?

580
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,180
Your dad was really in love with me.

581
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,850
What? It's true.

582
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,350
He used to follow me around

583
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,520
asking me to hug and kiss him.

584
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,270
Gosh, it was so bothersome.

585
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,980
He'd never spend a second away from me.

586
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,910
Just like you, Kang-ho.

587
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,910
Come to think about it,
you take after your dad a lot.

588
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,670
Your stubbornness

589
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,170
and strong determination
all come from him.

590
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,380
But your dad

591
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,800
wasn't always that strong.

592
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,590
He cried very easily.

593
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,140
He'd always

594
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,140
rub my big belly while you were in my womb

595
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,270
and cry saying he missed you,

596
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,770
that he loved you,

597
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,650
and that he was sorry.

598
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,400
Then you'd begin to kick in there.

599
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,410
"Mom, Dad, I'm here."

600
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,160
"I can see everything from here!"

601
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,580
It was as if you were answering.

602
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,590
I wanted to

603
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,550
grow old together with him.

604
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,970
But our time was cut very short.

605
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,650
Kang-ho.

606
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,730
Later on,

607
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,400
when I die, please bury me
next to your dad.

608
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,030
I want to be with him for a long time.

609
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,700
-Mom.
-Kang-ho.

610
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,500
When you get married and have kids,
will you visit us with them?

611
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm sure they'll be adorable.

612
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,010
Your child will grow up,
go to school, and get married.

613
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,180
And you'll grow older
and become a dad, and then a grandpa.

614
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,600
Mom and Dad

615
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,560
will watch over you

616
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,230
from this round mound.

617
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,230
No, we'll protect you.

618
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,360
So Kang-ho,

619
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,700
don't feel lonely even when I'm gone.

620
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,080
You aren't alone.

621
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,830
Okay?

622
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,000
Mom, why are you so mean?

623
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,470
I know, Mom.

624
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,140
I know everything.

625
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,480
But do you have to say that?

626
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,190
Just say,

627
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,440
"It's all right. This is nothing."

628
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,230
"I can fight this and win.
I'll get better."

629
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,740
Why can't you just say that?

630
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,620
Why do you always…

631
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,620
Why…

632
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,000
Why do you always say things
that hurt me right here?

633
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,420
Why do you always make me do tough things?

634
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,010
Why do you always do everything your way?

635
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,600
Cooking, doing the laundry,

636
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,180
farming, and banking.

637
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,600
After you teach me everything
like a mother pig,

638
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,350
you'll go somewhere nice without me.

639
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,520
I don't want that!

640
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,650
No!

641
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,030
Then I won't do anything.

642
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,620
No, I'd rather not know
how to do anything.

643
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,450
I'm just going to
live my life like an idiot.

644
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,960
So Mom, you can't leave me!

645
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,010
Mom, please.

646
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,890
Please don't leave me, Mom.

647
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,890
Mom.

648
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,350
Mom, just…

649
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,190
Just a little…

650
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,150
Just stay a little longer.

651
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,530
Mom…

652
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,990
Okay.

653
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,750
I'll take my time.

654
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,040
I will leave…

655
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,290
very, very slowly.

656
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,050
So let's not be sad

657
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,090
and let's not cry.

658
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,760
Let's not be like that.

659
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,180
I want to spend
every minute and second I have left

660
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,060
being happy with you.

661
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,690
Okay?

662
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,990
Who is it?

663
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,930
Gum-ja.

664
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,010
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,520
I felt sorry for Kang-ho
for growing up without a dad.

666
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,360
I didn't want him
to feel his dad's absence,

667
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,110
so I've been selfish.

668
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,030
After he became the way he is,

669
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,160
I finally realized
my love for him was misguided.

670
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,790
But I haven't really changed.

671
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,620
You were right.

672
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,170
Your child is as precious as mine.

673
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,840
I've hurt Mi-joo…

674
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,470
very deeply.

675
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,640
Even after everything you've done for me.

676
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm sorry for hurting you.

677
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,480
Please forgive me.

678
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,360
Goodness.

679
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,570
There's no need to kneel.

680
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,700
You aren't even well.

681
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,330
Get up.

682
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,950
Stand up.

683
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,250
Stand up already.

684
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,370
Get up.

685
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,580
Gum-ja.

686
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,250
Am I really going to die?

687
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm scared.

688
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,670
What do I do?

689
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,760
What do I do, Gum-ja?

690
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,220
Please let me live.

691
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,970
Please let me live.

692
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,480
Please help me live.

693
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,600
Goodness, you poor thing.

694
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,570
Please let me live.

695
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,490
Please let me live.

696
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,540
One day, you're going to die by my hands.

697
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,080
I'll probably die of anxiety before then.

698
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,540
-Goodness!
-Hey!

699
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,340
-This is amazing!
-Excuse me.

700
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,090
Please give the brewery

701
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,340
-a lot of time on air.
-Are you wearing makeup?

702
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,470
I heard you need to put on makeup
to be on TV.

703
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,850
We've never had
such a joyous occasion before.

704
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,270
I can't believe our village will be on TV!

705
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,310
I'm sorry to say this,

706
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
but I don't think we can be seen on TV.

707
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,440
See?

708
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,400
I knew it. I was right, wasn't I?

709
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,490
I was suspicious of you
from the moment we met.

710
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,950
They're here to hide
because they did something bad.

711
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,450
What the hell is wrong with you?

712
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,460
Don't say something so dreadful
about these wonderful men

713
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,830
who brought honor to Jou-ri.

714
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,540
Look at them.

715
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,960
Does he look like someone
who's up to no good?

716
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,760
His eyes are so kind, just like cow eyes.

717
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,390
And his last name also means cow.

718
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,350
See? He's just like a cow.

719
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,770
Anyway, we don't have a particular secret.

720
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,900
All we ever did was water them.

721
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,110
Right?

722
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,020
We didn't…

723
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,440
just water them.

724
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,740
"As makgeolli ferments,
the soil becomes aerobic

725
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,450
and grows many beneficial bacteria
and prevents diseases."

726
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,040
You were so cool.
How did you come up with that?

727
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,250
Just pack up.

728
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,790
We have to beg the chairman
for forgiveness

729
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,340
before the program goes on air.

730
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,510
Otherwise, we'll become manure
for the lettuce.

731
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,010
Let's go

732
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,850
Let's go to Seoul

733
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,720
Just go.

734
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,140
Just drive by.

735
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,730
Just go.

736
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,730
Just go.

737
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,980
Just go!

738
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,860
Mr. Cha!

739
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,450
We'll look suspicious if we just go.

740
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,870
Let's say bye before we go.

741
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,660
Hello.

742
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,870
So and Cha, where are you going?

743
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,420
We have to go to Seoul for business.

744
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,630
-Seoul?
-Yes.

745
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,300
Should I play some music?

746
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
Sorry, sir.

747
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,680
I was on my way to Seoul too.

748
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,050
Isn't this great?

749
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,100
Do you know where Seongbuk-dong is?

750
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,770
I know it rather well.
Are you headed there?

751
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,350
Yes, to Assemblyman Oh's place.

752
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,400
What's wrong with you?

753
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,530
You scared me.

754
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,650
Why are you going there?

755
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,910
I'm a huge fan and supporter,

756
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,080
so I wanted to show him my support.

757
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,250
Right here. This is where I'm going.

758
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,260
Hey, fiancée.

759
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,060
What happened? Did you meet him?

760
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,430
Yes, I just met him.

761
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,100
I'll call you once I'm done.

762
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,100
Sam-sik.

763
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,110
You better not screw it up.

764
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,060
I won't.

765
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,000
Congratulations on your wedding tomorrow.

766
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,520
Help!

767
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,480
Are you all right?

768
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,860
-I'm sorry.
-Help!

769
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,450
-Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
-Goodness.

770
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,950
Should I call an ambulance?

771
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,240
DNA TEST RESULT

772
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,410
This is going to scar.

773
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,290
My mom never let
anything like this happen to me.

774
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,540
What's this?

775
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,170
It says it right there.

776
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,630
"DNA Test Result."

777
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,090
Even an idiot can read it.

778
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,850
Exactly.

779
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,220
So what is this?

780
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,140
I'm about to let you listen to
what this is all about.

781
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,780
Will you get rid of the original
DNA test result in front of me?

782
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,080
She's using earphones,
so I cannot confirm the content.

783
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,380
I was torn
between giving this to your father

784
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,500
and handing it over to Bareun Hanguk Party

785
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,960
who's dying to take him down.

786
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,010
I pondered it deeply.

787
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,760
But I decided to give you

788
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,050
a chance to be a good daughter
right before your wedding.

789
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,520
Hey.

790
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,730
What are you trying to pull?

791
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,820
What are you doing? That's mine!

792
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,820
You just said it was my dad's.

793
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,790
Choi Kang-ho had this.

794
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:34,370
A prosecutor like him
wouldn't keep a fake, would he?

795
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,500
What the hell do you want?

796
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,180
So I had to mention him
to get your attention.

797
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
I want 200 million.

798
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,310
Right, I have to pay Mom back.

799
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:54,850
And two million.

800
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,650
I want 202 million won in cash.

801
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,450
You know what will happen
if you have another copy, right?

802
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,820
I'll probably be found dead

803
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,030
in some mountains.

804
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,120
I'll see you here in an hour.

805
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,890
Hey, fiancée.

806
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,440
I just talked to her.

807
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,020
She was taken aback at your name.

808
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,520
There's definitely something going on.

809
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,940
I'll look more into this and call…

810
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,530
Damn it.

811
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,860
Okay, Sam-sik.

812
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,740
Okay, bye.

813
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,240
What are you doing?

814
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,490
Sam-sik.

815
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,410
Sam-sik?

816
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,250
Mom. I'll do it.

817
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,540
Let me.

818
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,580
Okay.

819
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,130
Mom, I'll do it.

820
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,760
Mom!

821
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,680
Mom, I'll do it.

822
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,770
What's the number?

823
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:16,810
All right.

824
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,350
You said you wouldn't do anything.

825
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,150
But you're unwell.

826
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,520
Don't worry. I'm fine.

827
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,440
Ms. Jin!

828
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,860
Ms. Jin!

829
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,410
You're here. I was about to call you.

830
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,870
What did the vet say?

831
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,160
Those are signs of MMA.

832
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,370
Give them these anti-inflammatory shots,

833
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,870
and the prospects are that
they will get well in a couple of days.

834
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,040
-That's a relief.
-Mom.

835
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,750
Give it to me. I'll do it.

836
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,380
But you're afraid of giving shots.

837
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,470
I'll just grit my teeth
and stick it in at once.

838
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,840
I'll go with you.

839
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,770
Excuse me.

840
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,480
Have you seen the man
who was sitting there?

841
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,990
No, I haven't.

842
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,830
Please don't hit me!

843
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,950
RECENTS
FIANCÉE

844
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,370
I didn't hit you.

845
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,210
Oh, you didn't?

846
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,330
I'm…

847
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,380
I'm sorry.

848
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,550
So Choi Kang-ho had this?

849
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,880
Yes.

850
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,470
That idiot wouldn't have sent you here.

851
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,560
Who was it?

852
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,350
Who sent you here?

853
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,440
You must be Woobyeok.

854
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,520
No, sir.

855
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,690
I'm Sam-sik.

856
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:46,980
Samsik?

857
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,320
Hey, what's Samsik?

858
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,780
Look it up.

859
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,120
No, sir.

860
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,780
My name is Sam-sik.

861
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:58,910
Bang Sam-sik.

862
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,120
So you will keep your mouth shut?

863
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,800
Okay, take it to the grave.

864
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,550
-Sir.
-Get rid of him.

865
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,680
I just opened my mouth! What do I…

866
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,800
Knife!

867
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,870
So…

868
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,950
So and Cha?

869
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,300
What the hell?

870
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,470
What the…

871
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,890
Darn it!

872
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,990
So and Cha?

873
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,660
Damn it.

874
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,380
Drop the weapons.

875
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,720
Drop the weapons!

876
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,450
Damn it.

877
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,540
Are you okay?

878
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,670
Damn it.

879
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,500
Damn it.

880
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,220
Damn it!

881
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,020
My goodness.

882
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,190
I'm sorry you're hurt because of me.

883
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,570
Why did those damned bastards
have to use knives?

884
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,400
I was scared to death.

885
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,700
I almost wet myself.

886
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,290
Goodness, speaking of which,
let me go take a leak.

887
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,370
Kang-ho will take the fall.

888
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,170
That's why I keep him around.

889
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,050
Are you sure it was Song Woo-byeok?

890
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,010
Yes, sir.

891
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,810
I saw Mr. So.

892
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,560
That wicked old snake.

893
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,820
Where's Ha-young?

894
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:34,670
What's that?

895
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,890
I won't make excuses.

896
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,850
It was a mistake.

897
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,310
Killing an innocent woman
and her baby was a mistake?

898
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,440
Choi Kang-ho did that.

899
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,520
You put him up to it.

900
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,820
You're a terrifying person.

901
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,440
You kill and get rid of everyone
who gets in your way.

902
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,400
And Kang-ho…

903
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,580
He ended up like that
after being used by you.

904
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,540
Ha-young, you must be quite scared.

905
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,960
Yes, of course, you are.

906
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,920
Since you slipped Kang-ho sleeping pills
and tried to kill him.

907
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,600
-That was--
-Are you going to say

908
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,140
that I put you up to that too?

909
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,140
No.

910
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,310
You took

911
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,770
revenge on him because you felt betrayed

912
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,520
when you found out
he was using you to take me down.

913
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,320
It was your decision

914
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,480
to do it.

915
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,290
But Ha-young,

916
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,370
it's all in the past.

917
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,790
Besides,

918
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,000
the evidence that could be used against me
is now in my hands.

919
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,050
With Kang-ho in that state,

920
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,220
no one can prove it

921
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,840
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

922
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,180
Do you understand?

923
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,610
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

924
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,900
You came.

925
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,610
Thank you for coming.

926
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,700
Goodness, congratulations.

927
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,790
You came. I didn't invite you
thinking it'd be uncomfortable for you.

928
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,040
Right?

929
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,250
If you texted me the wedding invitation,

930
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,170
I would've just wired you
the congratulatory money.

931
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,470
I didn't know how else to give it to you,
so I brought it here myself.

932
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,640
The husband is quite
tall and handsome, isn't he?

933
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,810
So do you like
your future son-in-law this time?

934
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,940
Yes.

935
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,810
Good, you should.

936
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,360
That way they can live happily

937
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,280
without getting into
an unexpected accident, right?

938
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:10,370
I'll be heading inside now.

939
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,120
The steak here is amazing.

940
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,790
You must know that.

941
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,870
-Hello.
-Hello.

942
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,040
Thank you for coming.

943
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,670
The bride looks so stiff.

944
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,920
Please relax and smile a little.

945
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,170
Come on, smile.

946
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,050
Here comes the groom.

947
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,350
-Congrats!
-Looking good!

948
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,770
Congrats!

949
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,850
Next,

950
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:40,480
please welcome the beautiful bride.

951
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,560
Here comes the bride!

952
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,700
Excuse me!

953
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,870
When will you serve the steak?

954
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,420
Goodness gracious.

955
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,770
Ha-young, here.

956
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:17,850
Oh my, Ji-u.

957
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,810
Is this for me?

958
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,230
Thank you so much.

959
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,230
It's not from me. It's from that man over…

960
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,150
What? Where did he go?

961
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,070
The bride is gone.

962
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,660
I'll look for her once again.

963
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,880
Are you ready?

964
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,050
I just need to get dressed.

965
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,510
By the way, where are we going?

966
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
On a date.

967
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,390
-A date?
-Yes.

968
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,730
So you need to look your best.

969
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,310
-My best.
-Yes.

970
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,080
Ma'am?

971
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,660
-Yes?
-Your payment went through.

972
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,790
-Okay.
-Thank you.

973
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,800
Please leave your message after the beep

974
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,720
and press the asterisk once you're done.

975
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,980
Sam-sik, why aren't you picking up?

976
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,940
Is something going on?

977
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,480
Give me a call, okay? I'll be waiting.

978
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,960
What's this?

979
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,940
Kang-ho.

980
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,310
Mom, you look…

981
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,110
What do you think? Don't I look pretty?

982
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:15,780
Yes.

983
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,400
Very pretty.

984
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,700
It's cold.

985
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,280
-I'm fine.
-It's not fine.

986
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,450
You have to keep warm.

987
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,620
Like this.

988
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,130
All set. Let's go.

989
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,340
Did you want to go on a date with me?

990
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,520
I realized

991
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,480
I never had a chance to eat out with you.

992
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,440
We've never been to the movies,

993
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,570
a karaoke room,

994
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,150
or on a trip.

995
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,030
So we're going to do everything now.

996
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,450
Look.

997
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,330
I made a list

998
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,750
of everything I want to do.

999
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,000
THINGS TO DO WITH MY SON

1000
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,080
What do you think?

1001
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,790
Will you do them with me?

1002
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,340
Yes, I'll do everything.

1003
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,510
Okay.

1004
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,090
Excuse me!

1005
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,550
Give us two more servings

1006
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,140
of your best ribeye please.

1007
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,930
And also a bottle of makgeolli please.

1008
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:28,890
What?

1009
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,230
Come on, Mom.

1010
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,690
I'm an adult.

1011
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,940
I'm your guardian.

1012
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,360
But you can't drink.

1013
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,360
Never.

1014
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,700
Okay.

1015
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,860
Yes, you're my guardian

1016
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,870
and an adult.

1017
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,780
-Yes.
-Gosh.

1018
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,700
We'll take a large bottle of makgeolli.

1019
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,250
Then just one glass
with the large bottle please.

1020
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,210
-I want some too.
-No, just have the meat.

1021
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,130
Kim Min-jeong reports.

1022
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,550
The body discovered by Lee,
who was fishing at night

1023
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,600
on Jemyeon Island on the 8th,
was highly decomposed and…

1024
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,720
Honey!

1025
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,810
Honey, wait!

1026
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,650
You damn brat.

1027
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,490
Stop it!

1028
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,410
Stop it!

1029
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:27,080
-Have you gone insane?
-That bitch is the insane one!

1030
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,080
How dare you tarnish my reputation?

1031
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,420
Get in here!

1032
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,920
Lock her up in a hospital

1033
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,050
and keep her there
until the election is over!

1034
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,170
Yes, sir.

1035
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,800
-Sir.
-Yes?

1036
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,260
We checked,

1037
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,520
and it was Hwang Soo-hyun.

1038
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,350
The police began the investigation

1039
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,730
as a possible murder case.

1040
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,570
Damn it!

1041
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,670
-Hey.
-Yes.

1042
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,050
We need to do something.

1043
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,050
FIANCÉE

1044
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:34,390
Your call could not be completed
and will be transferred to…

1045
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,980
I was a fool to trust him.

1046
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,900
Darn it.

1047
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,150
Mom?

1048
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,400
I want to sleep here tonight.

1049
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,990
I have to protect you.

1050
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,030
I'd love that.

1051
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,490
Come on in, Mr. Guardian.

1052
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,210
Mr. Guardian.

1053
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,040
Yes?

1054
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,840
Thank you for our date today.

1055
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,220
It made me very happy.

1056
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,810
Your wish is my command.

1057
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,310
I'll do everything for you.

1058
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:17,850
Really?

1059
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,400
Yes.

1060
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,190
In that case,

1061
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,400
sing for me.

1062
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:28,990
Sing?

1063
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:30,410
Yes.

1064
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,330
But I can't sing.

1065
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,040
I can't.

1066
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,540
What? You said you'd do anything for me.

1067
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,420
It was always my wish to hear my son sing.

1068
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,260
Sing for me.

1069
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,430
Please sing for me.

1070
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,980
-Okay.
-Please.

1071
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,100
Okay.

1072
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,910
A tiring day passed by

1073
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:16,330
Two are under the moonlight

1074
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,540
As one shadow

1075
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,090
That distant happiness is

1076
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,800
Still there seemingly within my reach

1077
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,550
When I

1078
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:36,470
Close my eyes

1079
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,810
-My wounded heart…
-My wounded heart

1080
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,770
May cast a shadow

1081
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,820
Upon your dream

1082
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,280
Please remember…

1083
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:00,040
Why are you singing
such a heartbreaking song?

1084
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,460
You're not asleep?

1085
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:05,210
Let me check your fever.

1086
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,420
What a relief. It went down a little.

1087
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,420
I'm sorry.

1088
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,180
It must be because
I brought you out in the cold

1089
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,260
before I dried your hair properly.

1090
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,930
-Mom.
-Yes?

1091
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,060
I already know.

1092
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,940
About what?

1093
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,400
About Dad.

1094
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,860
-Dad?
-Yes.

1095
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,740
So you can be honest with me.

1096
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:37,240
Did you hear something?

1097
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,450
I don't have to hear it to know.
It's obvious to me.

1098
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,660
Ye-jin.

1099
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,920
Well, the thing is…

1100
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,250
Dad

1101
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,630
had an affair, right?

1102
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,210
What?

1103
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,970
This is why a married couple
shouldn't live apart.

1104
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:57,470
What are you talking about?

1105
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,640
It's nothing like that.

1106
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,980
It is.

1107
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,890
He's never called us once

1108
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,480
since that brief visit.

1109
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,230
Doesn't he miss us at all?

1110
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,820
Ye-jin.

1111
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,190
That's because…

1112
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,280
But you know,

1113
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,700
I don't miss him that much either.

1114
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,240
What?

1115
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,620
Maybe it's because
we've been apart for so long.

1116
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,500
He feels like a stranger.

1117
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,960
I don't feel attached to him.

1118
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,250
So I wanted you to know that

1119
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:35,510
you don't have to put up with him
because of us.

1120
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,680
Just get a divorce.

1121
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,180
Being divorced is not a big deal nowadays.

1122
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,350
There are three divorced families

1123
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,480
in my kindergarten.

1124
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,900
At first, they threw a fit
and even refused to eat,

1125
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,150
but now they run about happier than ever.

1126
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:55,110
It's such a mess.

1127
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,030
So,

1128
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,200
stop worrying about us

1129
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:04,790
and start living your own life.

1130
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,000
If there's one thing
I learned in all my years,

1131
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,670
it's that there isn't much to life.

1132
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,420
You just have to live happily

1133
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,720
with the people you love, right?

1134
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,850
You love us.

1135
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,930
And we love you too.

1136
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,310
So please,

1137
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,560
let's just live happily by ourselves.

1138
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,690
I'll marry Kang-ho oppa in the future

1139
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,320
and take good care of you.

1140
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,660
Come here, my baby.

1141
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,580
Goodness, come here.

1142
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,500
You little thing.

1143
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,300
You must've been worried sick.

1144
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,130
It must've been so hard for you.

1145
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,880
I'm sorry.

1146
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,640
I'm…

1147
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:05,260
such a bad mom.

1148
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,190
I'm such a bad mom.

1149
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,440
You're crying again.

1150
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,810
-What?
-You haven't smiled once

1151
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,190
since you've come back here.

1152
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,650
I want to see you smile.

1153
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,410
Because you're not a bad mom,

1154
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,290
but a pretty mom.

1155
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:45,640
Hello?

1156
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
What?

1157
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,520
There's smoke coming from the farm?

1158
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:54,810
Yes, okay.

1159
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,070
Yes, I'll check now.

1160
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,660
Kang-ho.

1161
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,870
Kang-ho, wake up.

1162
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,580
There's smoke coming from the farm.

1163
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,380
Mom.

1164
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,220
Oh, no!

1165
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:25,640
-Mom.
-Our pigs!

1166
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,930
Guys, wake up!

1167
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,270
We need to leave.

1168
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,980
-We have to get out.
-No.

1169
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,310
We have to get out!

1170
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,560
-Mom, no.
-Our pigs.

1171
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:37,980
-Mom, we have to go!
-Let go!

1172
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:39,320
-We have to go!
-Let go!

1173
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,700
-No!
-We have to go now!

1174
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,200
No!

1175
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,040
Mom.

1176
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,170
-No!
-It won't open.

1177
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,340
Why won't it open?

1178
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,360
Mom.

1179
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,490
Mom, come here. This way.

1180
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:28,030
Mom, we have to get out of here.

1181
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,580
-Mom, get out of here. Now.
-No.

1182
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,620
-Mom, we have to leave now!
-No.

1183
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:34,210
Come on.

1184
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,210
Mom!

1185
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,920
Kang-ho, you go first.

1186
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,500
-You go…
-No, Mom.

1187
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:42,380
You have to get out first. Mom!

1188
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,800
You have to leave first.
I'll follow you out, okay?

1189
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,050
Come on.

1190
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,140
Hurry.

1191
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:52,430
Mom.

1192
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,770
Mom.

1193
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,180
Yong-yong, have you been well?

1194
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,760
Yong-yong.

1195
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,640
Do you copy, Yong-yong?

1196
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,270
Do you remember Daddy's voice?

1197
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,810
What are you up to?

1198
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,690
Are you still asleep?

1199
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,270
It's time to get up.

1200
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,360
Wake up and play with me.

1201
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,650
My dear son,

1202
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,700
it's time to wake up.

1203
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,680
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1204
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,910
Fire!

1205
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,990
Are you saying Kang-ho is in there?

1206
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,580
Was it you? Were you the girl
he wrote about in his journal?

1207
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,290
Sam-sik, you know something, don't you?

1208
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,000
I really need to see Ha-young.

1209
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,420
Did you have that much fun with her?

1210
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:53,260
Mr. Choi, you're under arrest on suspicion
of murdering Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun.

1211
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,060
I'm going to protect Kang-ho.

1212
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:00,350
Kang-ho was only able to endure
those lonely and painful years

1213
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,020
because of you.

1214
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,850
Do you think she's really here?

1215
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,270
She has to be. For Kang-ho's sake.

1216
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:12,570
