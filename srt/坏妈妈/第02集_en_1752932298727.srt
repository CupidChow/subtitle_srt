00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,910
I told you. I'm not a churchgoer.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,490
My son became a prosecutor
because I prayed

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,660
to a shaman.

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,210
Goodness. A shaman?

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,710
Ma'am, that's just superstition.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,130
Your descendants will suffer
bad luck if you stand on a threshold.

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,130
But that's also a superstition, right?

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,380
In that case,

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,600
-I'll just leave a Sunday bulletin.
-Okay.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,560
-I wish you well.
-Thank you.

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,900

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,790
Unbeknownst to me,
these articles are making headlines.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,380
I wonder what
tomorrow's headline will bring.

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,260
I'll find out who's behind this.

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,090
No need for that. It's obvious.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,970
What's the first thing politicians do

27
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,510
when they gain power?

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,760
They go after companies like mine.

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,730
What can I do?
The presidential election is coming up.

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,230
They have to create a distraction
if they want to save themselves.

31
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,190
Still, they crossed the line.
Don't you think?

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,030
Why did they use
such an unflattering photo of me?

33
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,030
Darn it.

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,950
Look at that double chin.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,990
Jeez.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,250
Don't worry, sir.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,790
I'll take care of it.

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,090
Right. And…

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,180
This is my husband's old phone.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,760
There's a recording of a call
he had with Woobyeok Construction.

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,850
Do you want to be my son?

42
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,360
Sorry?

43
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,280
I'd really love that.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,780
How great would it be
if I had a reliable son like you?

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,200
Then I'd hand over my business to you,

46
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,380
move to a place like Hawaii,
and fish every day.

47
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,300
But my one and only grandson is a hellion.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,420
Oh, right.

49
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,800
What do you mean
things will get troublesome?

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,760
Right. Well…

51
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,640
Due to the extreme public outrage,

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm afraid Mr. Park won't be able
to get a reduced sentence.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,940
That's what it was?

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,980
Don't worry about that.

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,650
I was going to get rid of him
after this stint.

56
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,360
Thank you for all your hard work.

57
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,240
Let me know if you need anything.

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Do you want another new car?

59
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,950
Oh, that reminds me.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,080
How's your new house? Do you like it?

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,170
It was a very generous gift.

62
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,380
Thank you so much.

63
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,840
I'll work even harder.

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,170
Forget it. Just keep up the good work.

65
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,800
Do better, and you'll make me go broke.

66
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,770
I'll get going then.

67
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,820
Hold on.

68
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,570
You seemed to have forgotten something.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Put that down.

70
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,920
People laugh when I tell them
I play baseball.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,470
They think it's ridiculous
when I can't even run.

72
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
But it's simple.

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,550
If I hit a home run, I don't need to run.

74
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,730
Or I can strike out.

75
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,390
That's how I've lived my life.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,940
Hit a home run or strikeout.

77
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,150
So that was the secret.

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,490
That was how you grew

79
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,450
Yongra Construction
into Woobyeok Group so quickly.

80
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,280
I'll keep that in mind.

81
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,200
"Hit a home run

82
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
or strikeout."

83
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,010
Gosh, that hurt.

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,760
Jeez, you've improved a lot.
You weren't so good not too long ago.

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,090
I practiced a lot.

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,930
To be honest, I've always liked baseball.

87
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,770
But I could neither play with my friends
nor watch them on TV.

88
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,190
Why not?

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
-Because I wanted to meet you.
-What?

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,160
How would I ever have met you
had I not become a prosecutor?

91
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,320
I feel the same way.

92
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,950
It'd be wonderful
if I had a reliable father like you.

93
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,920
All right.

94
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,470
You can address me
as your father from now on.

95
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,800
May I really do that?

96
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,310
Look at you.

97
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,810
I've never seen you smile
from ear to ear before.

98
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,150
Then could we go to a sauna together?

99
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,940
A sauna?

100
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,200
It was my lifelong dream
to scrub my father's back.

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
"Father"?

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,910
So this is how it feels.

103
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,040
I love it.

104
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,710
All right.

105
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,130
I'll let my son scrub my back!

106
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,090
"Hit a home run or a strikeout."

107
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,780
Hey!

108
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,170
Please identify the source

109
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,590
and look into the related articles,
organizations, and victims.

110
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
Sir.

112
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,600
This is truly unfair!

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,850
My son would never kill anyone!

114
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,190
That wealthy chairman's grandson

115
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,650
framed my son!

116
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,610
-You know that!
-Sir!

117
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,200
All you need to say

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,200
is that my son isn't the murderer!

119
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,370
-Please stop--
-Sir!

120
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,580
Please, I beg you!

121
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,830
-Please!
-Please let go, sir.

122
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,210
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

123
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,540
You impudent bastard!

124
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,210
Don't you have a father?

125
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,640
No, I don't.

126
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,810
But…

127
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,320
does having one change anything?

128
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,320
You can't even help your son.
You're powerless and incompetent.

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,200
What did you say?

130
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,790
Oh, dear…

131
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
JOU-RI

132
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,460
Goodness…

133
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,550
Your call could not be completed
and will be transferred to…

134
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,420
He must be busy.

135
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,180
Of course. You can't slack off
when you're doing important work.

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,280
Right. The ribs.

137
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,670
The seasoned vegetables,

138
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,250
stir-fried glass noodles, pancakes, and…

139
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,050
All done, right?

140
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,470
Gosh, I can't reach it.

141
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,330
How did you hurt your back?

142
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,960
Those pain relief patches only smell.

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,630
When you've hurt your back,

144
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,130
the best remedy is acupuncture.

145
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,880
No, I'm okay.

146
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,140
These pain relief patches
will work just fine.

147
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
A long time ago,
my uncle fell down the stairs once.

148
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,100
He thought he would be fine
just applying pain relief patches.

149
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,730
Then he became paralyzed and bedridden.

150
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,860
He developed bedsores
that made his flesh rot.

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,780
It was terrible.

152
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,070
Why would you say something like that?

153
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,370
I'm just saying.

154
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,540
How does your stomach feel?

155
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,040
Do you feel nauseous?

156
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,370
Or does it feel as if you've been stabbed?

157
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,050
How would she know
how it feels to be stabbed?

158
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,340
Wouldn't she know?

159
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,890
I think it's just indigestion
from tasting all the food while cooking.

160
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,850
This will do the trick.

161
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
A long time ago,

162
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,600
my aunt kept downing that drink
whenever she had indigestion.

163
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,020
She passed away
after getting a hole in her stomach.

164
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,900
They opened her up,
and her organs had all melted.

165
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,780
What the hell is the matter with you?

166
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,240
Why do you keep rambling nonsense?

167
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,910
I'm just saying.

168
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,910
Don't worry.

169
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,960
My baby.

170
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,340
Right.

171
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,510
I'm thinking of naming our puppy Kang-ho.

172
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,550
What?

173
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,920
Why that name?

174
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,300
If you think about it,

175
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,640
everyone with that name seems to prosper.

176
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,180
There's Song Kang-ho
and there's Choi Kang-ho.

177
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,730
I want our puppy to prosper too.

178
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,070
A prosperous dog will still be a dog.
It won't turn into a tiger.

179
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,610
A tiger?

180
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,110
Oh, my.

181
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,860
Let's name our dog Tiger.

182
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,660
Then it'll become a tiger, won't it?

183
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,200
Tiger, roar for me.

184
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,290
Roar for me.

185
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,670
Don't mind her.

186
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,300
So tell me. How's our prosecutor doing?

187
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,930
He's never visited
ever since moving to Seoul.

188
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,810
He actually called in the afternoon
and said he'd come visit.

189
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,980
But I dissuaded him.

190
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,560
He has trials lined up back to back,

191
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,610
so I told him to just rest on the weekend.

192
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,610
I see.

193
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,110
I tracked down the IP address of the posts

194
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
that were posted on the media sites.

195
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,660
This is footage from an internet cafe
in Sangdo-dong.

196
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,580
I believe they're exposing
Woobyeok Group's corruption to the press.

197
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,460
HA-YOUNG

198
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,090
Did he reject your call again?

199
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,300
Yes.

200
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,680
Should I call one more time?

201
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,890
Hey.

202
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Forget it. Just end it.

203
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,650
I get that he's busy,
but he's been ignoring you for days.

204
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,940
I'm pretty sure he's seeing someone else.

205
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,110
Hey--

206
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,450
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

207
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,910
Hey, are you okay?

208
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,320
-Here--
-Oh, no.

209
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,330
Goodness, what's wrong?

210
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,830
My goodness!

211
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,750
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

212
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm so sorry.

213
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Hurry up and apologize.

214
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,590
I'm so sorry.

215
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,750
Do you not know what I do?

216
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,340
Sorry?

217
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm a ballerina.

218
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,220
Is that the best apology
after almost cutting off my toe?

219
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,350
Right.

220
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,390
I'm really sorry.

221
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,110
This is so annoying.

222
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,650
Let's go.

223
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,410
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,330
Are you okay?

225
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,000
Wait.

226
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,130
It's your turn now.

227
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,800
What?

228
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,590
Please apologize for kicking me.

229
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,140
Mi-joo, what's with you?

230
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,760
If you're that sensitive about your feet,
you shouldn't have come here.

231
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,140
-Have you gone crazy?
-No, ma'am.

232
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,140
Not yet.

233
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,610
But I will go crazy
if you don't apologize.

234
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,410
I won't apologize.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,910
There.

236
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,660
What'll you do now?

237
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,580
What?

238
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,210
What?

239
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,460
I see.

240
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,220
In that case, it can't be helped.

241
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,730
She didn't hit you.

242
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

243
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,490
The last time I felt this satisfied

244
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,160
was when I got my first Brazilian waxing.

245
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,410
She shouldn't have provoked me.

246
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,290
But what are you going to do now?

247
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,460
-I won't vote for him.
-What do you mean?

248
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,420
Vote for whom?

249
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,010
Her dad will be running for president.

250
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,340
He'll never get my vote.

251
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,760
Sure. That's the worst you could do.

252
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm going to open a small salon

253
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,900
with the money I've saved up.

254
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,360
-A salon?
-Yes.

255
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,070
I wanted to save up for two more years
and open up a big one in Seoul.

256
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,620
But I should look outside the city
or a shop-in-shop.

257
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,290
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

258
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,250
Me too. I want in.

259
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,170
-I'll chip in.
-Seriously?

260
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,630
I'll chip in so we can look
for a place on the outskirts of Seoul.

261
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,670
What do you say?

262
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,720
Sun-young, I would love that!

263
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,090
-Really?
-Yes!

264
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,050
Okay!

265
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,890
Then you can be the owner.

266
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,810
-What?
-I'll be the CEO.

267
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,980
What?

268
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,560
That's ridiculous.

269
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,360
-All right then.
-Okay.

270
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,940
I look forward to it, ma'am.

271
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,900
I'll do my best, Ms. CEO.

272
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,650
-Let me.
-You can speak casually.

273
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
MOM

274
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,570
Please excuse me for a minute, Ms. CEO.

275
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,490
-Sure, go take the call.
-Thank you.

276
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,330
Hi, Mom.

277
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm not your mom.

278
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,290
Who told you
you could use grandma's phone?

279
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,130
Grandma is dead.

280
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,970
What? What are you saying?

281
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,930
Why is she dead?

282
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,100
She ran out.

283
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,260
"Ran out"?

284
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,350
Yes.

285
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,520
Goodness.

286
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,810
She ran out of cards,

287
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,190
so she lost the match and all her money.

288
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,440
She's as good as dead for this round.

289
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,690
Hey!

290
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,990
You startled me!

291
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,070
-Who's that?
-Mom.

292
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Mom?

293
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,870
Do you mean

294
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,040
Mi-joo?

295
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,830
Your youngest daughter who's in the US?

296
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,210
Give that to me.

297
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,250
Hello?

298
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,710
Mom, didn't I tell you
not to play cards with the kids around?

299
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,670
What?

300
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,090
You want to send me money?

301
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,180
Gosh, you don't need to send me
your hard-earned money.

302
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,720
Jeez, seems like Mi-joo is trying to
send you money. How lucky.

303
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,890
Her daughter sends her money

304
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,940
while we work like dogs
to buy food for our incarcerated son.

305
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,520
Why is my life so miserable?

306
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,030
I'm not sending you any money.

307
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,990
-Would you like me to read your fortune?
-And I won't be

308
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,200
sending you any money for the time being.

309
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,120
I'm opening a nail salon.

310
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,070
What?

311
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,200
Your husband is opening
a nail salon for you?

312
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,080
Goodness. That's great.

313
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,040
What?

314
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,500
Good job.

315
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,790
"Nail"? What's a "nail salon"?

316
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,460
Why did you call?

317
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,050
Ye-jin is the one who called.

318
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,090
I told you not to give them your phone.

319
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,510
Watching videos
will worsen their eyesight.

320
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,100
If you're that concerned,
you can raise them instead.

321
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,060
Right. What happened to that bastard?

322
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,430
What bastard?

323
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,890
The father of your children!

324
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,900
Goodness.

325
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,150
Have you found him?

326
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,530
Didn't we agree
not to talk about that anymore?

327
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,360
And I chose not to look for him.

328
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,820
It's over between us.

329
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,120
What are you talking about?

330
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,080
What will you say to the people here?

331
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,000
What will you tell your kids?

332
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,040
They think you're working hard in the US

333
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,630
and will send for them.

334
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,340
So why did you have to lie to them?

335
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,010
Whatever. Just say that I got divorced.

336
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,340
You want me to tell them that you,
alongside Jin-joo and Seon-joo,

337
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,470
are divorced as well?

338
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,020
Is our family cursed or something?

339
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,060
Goodness. Do you know
how embarrassing it is?

340
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,690
You're the one who started it all.

341
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,440
I never got a divorce.

342
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,400
But he left you for another woman.

343
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,200
At least I was married when I had kids!

344
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,280
-Hang up!
-Hang up!

345
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
This damned brat.

346
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,830
Why does her life
have to be so miserable like mine?

347
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,170
Goodness, you startled me.

348
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,790
Who had kids out of wedlock?

349
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,340
We were talking about a drama.

350
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,300
Sam-sik will be discharged soon, right?

351
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,640
What should I do?

352
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,430
Should we carry out a ritual
when he gets discharged?

353
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,060
Just pack up and leave.

354
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,520
There's absolutely no ritual
that could fix this.

355
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,770
There's no deity who can change his fate.

356
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,030
So just leave.

357
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,320
-Let me.
-It's okay.

358
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,070
Look who's here!

359
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,570
It's the woman
who's been blessed with everything.

360
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,950
Prosecutor Choi's mother is here!

361
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,250
-Goodness.
-Hello.

362
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,330
-Gosh, you didn't have to.
-Hello.

363
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,460
-Come on in.
-It's okay.

364
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,710
I have to leave for Seoul.

365
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,550
I made geotjeori
and a few side dishes. Enjoy.

366
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,130
-So that's why you're all dolled up.
-Goodness.

367
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,590
-You're going to see your son.
-Yes.

368
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,220
What's wrong with your arm?

369
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,310
You seemed to be limping too.

370
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,940
I fell in the kitchen yesterday,
but I'm okay.

371
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,480
You're such a doting mother.

372
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,770
A successful prosecutor like him

373
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,530
must have good
and expensive food all the time.

374
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,700
Still, it's his birthday.

375
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,240
-Is it? Then you should go.
-Yes.

376
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,950
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

377
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,370
Please enjoy the food.

378
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,120
Ye-jin and Seo-jin, eat lots.

379
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
-Okay, goodbye.
-Okay, goodbye.

380
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,750
-Goodbye.
-Have a safe trip.

381
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,040
-Bye.
-Gosh.

382
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,170
How can I enjoy her food
when it looks like that?

383
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,590
It's tasty.

384
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,420
Try some.

385
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,380
Here.

386
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm on a diet.

387
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,300
Hold on.

388
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,560
If it's Kang-ho's birthday,
then it's Mi-joo's birthday too.

389
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,850
You're right.

390
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,190
Goodness.

391
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,240
You brat. You should've told me
it's your birthday today!

392
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,030
What's your bank account number?

393
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,580
So which building and unit is it?

394
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,540
I'm calling him right now.

395
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,450
Why isn't he picking up?

396
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,040
Sir, it's me.

397
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm at the address you sent me.
But which building and unit is it?

398
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,920
Sorry?

399
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,590
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

400
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,970
What are you doing?

401
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,970
Pull up over there.

402
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,930
-Pull up.
-Okay.

403
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,270
One minute please.

404
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,270
You have a call from the lobby.

405
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,610
Yes?

406
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,410
Hello, sir. This is the security office.

407
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,410
Your mother is here.

408
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,040
Tell her I'm not home.

409
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,990
Sorry?

410
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,250
Tell her you're not home?

411
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,630
But she brought a bunch of food.

412
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,550
Hello?

413
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,060
You see, Mr. Choi is…

414
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,600
What is it? Is he not home yet?

415
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,730
I understand. He's one of
the top prosecutors in this country.

416
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,610
Of course he's busy.

417
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,650
I should've called in advance.

418
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,400
In that case,

419
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,410
could you please give him these for me?

420
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,740
Goodness.

421
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,160
-Thank you.
-No problem.

422
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,620
Sir.

423
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,080
Do you see him at times?

424
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,290
Yes, every now and then.

425
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,300
How is he? Does he look okay?

426
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,970
Does he look healthy?

427
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,930
Yes. He's such a handsome man

428
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,300
who takes great care of himself.

429
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,520
Has he ever gotten drunk
and looked depressed?

430
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,690
No, I don't think so.

431
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,190
That's good. Goodbye.

432
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,230
Goodbye.

433
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,150
One minute.

434
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,070
Sorry?

435
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,530
If anything seems off,

436
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,540
please give me a call.

437
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,080
-Okay.
-Thank you.

438
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,670
-No problem.
-Goodbye.

439
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,130
I wonder if she's eaten.

440
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,130
She seems to be in pain.

441
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,680
So what if he's a prosecutor?

442
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,510
He's so impudent.

443
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,020
CHOCO PIE

444
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,910
He's just busy. That's all.

445
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,050
With a 33% approval rate,

446
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,880
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
defeated Park Gil-ung,

447
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,720
former chairman of Bareun Hanguk Party and
a leading candidate of the opposing camp,

448
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,220
and established himself
as the next presidential candidate.

449
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,720
Assemblyman Oh, who led
the ruling party to a landslide victory

450
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,560
as former committee chairman
of the Jeilmirae Party,

451
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,810
emerged as a leading
presidential candidate

452
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,810
through his election
and the party's victory.

453
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,690
BECOME A PASSIONATE JUDICIAL OFFICER

454
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,400
Do you know why people bad-mouth
judicial officers of this country?

455
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,110
Because all they know is to study.

456
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,870
But studying is merely a talent

457
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,740
just like singing or drawing.

458
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,080
It doesn't make you superior to others.

459
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,540
Perhaps, those who only know
how to study could be the most inferior.

460
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,500
Let's be honest.

461
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,300
You don't have friends.

462
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,010
Aren't you all outcasts?

463
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,800
But those idiots
act as if being a prosecutor or a judge

464
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,020
is the most powerful right
a human could have.

465
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,980
That's why people bash them.

466
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,900
A true judicial officer must be able
to both think and feel.

467
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,320
Those with no friends
or empathy toward others

468
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,150
studied hard to prosecute, defend,

469
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,740
and judge others?

470
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,240
No wonder the world
has turned out this way.

471
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,080
No wonder only the weak
and the innocent are victimized.

472
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,000
Let me ask you
future judicial officers for a favor

473
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,210
as an old, former judicial officer.

474
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,380
We've been overworking our brains
for far too long.

475
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,380
So from now on, let's stop doing that

476
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,850
and use our passionate hearts
to guide us instead.

477
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,310
OH TAE-SOO

478
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,690
That's enough. Get going now.

479
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,150
Tae-soo, this is Choi Kang-ho.

480
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,440
He entered the institute
at the top of his class.

481
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,570
He's a talent who's always
placed first in his class.

482
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,990
Is that so?

483
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,410
-Are we alumni?
-Yes.

484
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,120
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

485
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,790
With your grades, it'll only be
a matter of time until you become a judge.

486
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,960
I actually aspire to become a prosecutor.

487
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,840
You're his role model.

488
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,420
He's an avid fan of yours
who has memorized

489
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,260
all your books and theses.

490
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,300
Is that so?

491
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
I'm honored.

492
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,720
Not at all.

493
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,230
Goodbye, sir.

494
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,400
Have we met before?

495
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,950
You look familiar.

496
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,660
No, sir. We've never met.

497
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,330
But…

498
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,870
Actually,

499
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,330
-you've met my father--
-Dad.

500
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,500
We're late. Let's go.

501
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,880
Okay.

502
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,800
I need to go.

503
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,420
See you next time.

504
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,090
Yes, sir. I'll make sure we meet again.

505
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,180
She's so pretty.

506
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,140
You're so pretty.

507
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,250
I'm not interested, so get lost.

508
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,720
You'll be interested soon.

509
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,440
Have you gone insane?

510
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,850
I didn't do any drugs.

511
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,560
Do you have proof?

512
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,730
This is driving me crazy.

513
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,070
You're going to regret this.

514
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,330
I won't let this slide.

515
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,450
I'll get all of you sacked.

516
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,290
You can take your time with that.

517
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,580
What's this?

518
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,840
It's just medicine.

519
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,130
Exactly. What kind of medicine?

520
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,220
Please answer.

521
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,020
It's for my panic disorder.

522
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,140
You have panic disorder?

523
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,810
It's not serious.

524
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,190
Wait! What are you doing?

525
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,820
Hey! What are you doing?

526
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,990
-Hey!
-Stay still.

527
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,200
-You lunatic!
-Stay still.

528
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,610
Wait! No!

529
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,410
Do you know how expensive that is?

530
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,200
No! That's a limited edition!

531
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,990
-They don't sell it anymore.
-Stay still!

532
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,790
-Please!
-The urinalysis came out.

533
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,250
They all tested negative.

534
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,220
I believe there was a mistake
in the report we received.

535
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,260
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,260
You're sorry?

537
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,350
Are you?

538
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,810
That's all you can say after ruining this?

539
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,270
I'll compensate for that.

540
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,740
My dad was a former prosecutor
so I know how much you make.

541
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,660
Don't be ridiculous.

542
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,990
This is more expensive than your life.

543
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,420
Let's go.

544
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,460
Will it be okay?

545
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,340
It hurts, but I'm okay.

546
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,180
No, I'm talking about us.

547
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,890
It says here that she's the daughter
of Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo,

548
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,270
a former chief prosecutor.

549
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,230
What?

550
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,230
How may we help you?

551
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,990
I shouldn't have hit you.

552
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,820
That's okay.

553
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,070
It's all right. He deserved it.

554
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,370
But by any chance,
will my time here be recorded?

555
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,040
You won't call my parents, will you?

556
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,460
It was my first time clubbing.

557
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,430
Make that the second or third.

558
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,390
As for my panic disorder,

559
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,890
it's really not that bad.

560
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,930
I just…

561
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,060
have trouble sleeping.

562
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,390
I'm just taking it
to prevent it from worsening.

563
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,940
So let's pretend today never happened.

564
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,610
You don't need
to compensate for the bag either.

565
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,240
I'm sick of it,
so I was going to throw it away anyway.

566
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,870
Then I'll assume that you understand.

567
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,870
I'll go now.

568
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,990
Goodbye.

569
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,460
THE HOUSE OF LOVE SHARING, CULTURE DAY
WITH ASSEMBLYMAN OH TAE-SOO

570
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,130
You and me

571
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,130
We should be friends

572
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,100
And get along

573
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,390
Pinky promise

574
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,350
Promise me

575
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,310
Friends

576
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,150
Don't fight

577
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,570
Let's love each other

578
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,700
Pinky promise

579
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,950
Promise me

580
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,870
Come here. Hurry up.

581
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,380
Are you crazy?

582
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,710
How could you come here?

583
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,720
We agreed to forget about it.

584
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,180
I got you a new bag.

585
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
What?

586
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,270
What is this?

587
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,770
You actually got a new one?
It was a limited edition.

588
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,820
What?

589
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,860
Are you serious?

590
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,320
No way.

591
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,870
What's this?

592
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,740
Where's the bag? This is just a dust bag…

593
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,830
Sir.

594
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,500
You do know how well-respected
your father is, right?

595
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,710
The people trust and support him
due to his humility.

596
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,880
So should you carry such an expensive bag

597
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,470
and go clubbing with your wealthy friends?

598
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,850
Stop tainting his reputation
and carry that from now on.

599
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,180
Who are you to tell me what to do?

600
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,650
What is this?

601
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,660
Jujubes are said to be
natural tranquilizers.

602
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,580
You said your symptoms weren't severe,

603
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
so don't take any medication.

604
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,710
Just have some jujube tea before bed.

605
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,170
I went to the marketplace in the morning
to get them, so don't throw them away.

606
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,170
What the…

607
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,390
Dad.

608
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,650
-Happy birthday to you.
-Thanks.

609
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,570
I'm glad my daughter--

610
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,070
Who is he?

611
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,160
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho.

612
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,160
You must be surprised.

613
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,370
He's your birthday gift.

614
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,210
Your future son-in-law.

615
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,210
What?

616
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,230
You brat.

617
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,730
What took you so long
to introduce such a fine, young man?

618
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,570
All right. Have a seat.

619
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,320
That's right.

620
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,030
Judicial Research and Training Institute.

621
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,620
No wonder you seemed familiar.

622
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,000
It must've been hard

623
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,830
to grow up without a father.

624
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,090
But he grew up so well
and became a competent prosecutor.

625
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,380
Even I'm proud of you.

626
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,470
I still have a long way to go.
I hope to learn from you.

627
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,510
All right.

628
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,010
I hope we get along.

629
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,760
Yes, sir.

630
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,010
It's getting late.

631
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,430
How about you ladies give us some privacy?

632
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,230
Why?

633
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,560
What will you talk about without us?

634
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,190
Men have things
to talk about among themselves.

635
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,820
-Right?
-Yes, you're right.

636
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,990
Exactly.

637
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,870
Don't make him drink too much.

638
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,490
-It's okay.
-Look at that.

639
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,830
A daughter will always
put her boyfriend first.

640
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,370
Honey, take her.

641
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,370
-Call me when you get home.
-I will.

642
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,670
See you again, ma'am.

643
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,630
Bye, Dad.

644
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,960
Bye.

645
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,400
So what will it be?

646
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,230
Sorry?

647
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,030
The reason for your breakup.

648
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,110
Another woman?

649
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,410
Or do you want to be sent abroad for work?

650
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,120
Or I could make you a corrupt prosecutor
and send you to prison.

651
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,580
I can't suddenly kill you off.

652
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,050
You reek of something.

653
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,550
Ever since we first met.

654
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,590
What could it be?

655
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,720
Is it the smell of dirt

656
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,510
since you came from the bottom up?

657
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,770
-Father.
-"Father"?

658
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,730
You're funny.

659
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,820
Listen carefully.

660
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,370
You two will break up within a week.

661
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,210
And Ha-young will marry into Dosang Group
as I had planned.

662
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,380
"Father"?

663
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,010
Someone like you can never call me Father.

664
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,970
Though you must not understand
since you don't have a father.

665
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Kang-ho.

666
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,240
What's all this?

667
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,870
Don't tell me you're seeing another woman.

668
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,200
Hold on! My foot.

669
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,210
I hurt my toe today.

670
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,250
Let me in for just a minute.

671
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,840
Kang-ho. It's not true, right?

672
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,970
Ta-da.

673
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,980
I even got you a birthday gift.

674
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,350
-Go home.
-How are you so heartless?

675
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,190
Are you really ending it with me?

676
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,980
I'm doing this not to do that.

677
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,950
But if you keep doing this,
it'll hinder my plan.

678
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,490
Your plan?

679
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,870
What is it?

680
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,080
DNA TEST RESULT

681
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,670
Corporate sales, which were to be reduced
to the global economic downturn,

682
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,670
have actually increased
by 21.5% compared to last year.

683
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,090
Here are the documents
I told you about on…

684
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,140
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.9%

685
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,190
Home run!

686
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,650
This is a true home run.

687
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,240
A walk-off grand slam with two outs.

688
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,240
So you're saying

689
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,040
that Hwang Soo-hyun gave birth
to Oh Tae-soo's baby?

690
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,080
Correct.

691
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,210
That idiot.

692
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,460
He had no idea what was coming

693
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,290
when he betrayed me for Dosang Group.

694
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,750
So what if he steals a base?

695
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,380
He just hit into a double play.

696
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,010
He doesn't know about the child yet.

697
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,770
She was afraid that he'd harm her
and the child if he found out.

698
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,270
So she quit and hid as soon as
she found out about her pregnancy.

699
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,690
A secret about him that
he doesn't even know exists.

700
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,660
This is…

701
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,410
very valuable information.

702
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,410
Right?

703
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,120
By the way, why are you giving me this?

704
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,460
Isn't that why you took me in?

705
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,880
If you have the future president
in your hands,

706
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,090
Woobyeok Group will be invincible.

707
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,300
However,

708
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,050
this isn't the original paper.

709
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,430
You must want a favor from me.

710
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,730
Please take me in as your real son.

711
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,730
What did you say?

712
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,820
I want to become your legal son.

713
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,780
Then as your son,

714
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,950
I will marry Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

715
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,580
You'll have Oh Tae-soo.

716
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,250
Oh Tae-soo will have me.

717
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,210
And I'll have a father.

718
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,800
None of us will be able
to betray one another.

719
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,130
We'll become a true family.

720
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,850
What if I refuse?

721
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,400
What can a son
who's been abandoned by his father do?

722
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,150
I'll have to find a new father.

723
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,250
A father never abandons his child.

724
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,670
She was a smart secretary of mine
who knew how the company worked.

725
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,050
I entrusted you with her

726
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,220
so you'd find a way to save my company.

727
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,850
But instead, you knocked her up.

728
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,430
Where's Hwang Soo-hyun?

729
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,150
How will you lead the country
if you're this slow?

730
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,190
Hwang Soo-hyun isn't
the one you should meet.

731
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,940
It's Choi Kang-ho.

732
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,320
If that kid takes this information

733
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,990
and sides with the Bareun Hanguk Party,

734
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,790
it'll be the end for both of us.

735
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's be honest.

736
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,750
You and I have gotten our hands dirty
for the past 30 years.

737
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,170
Don't you agree?

738
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,010
Judging by

739
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,340
how he even found out about
Hwang Soo-hyun,

740
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,260
he must have many cards up his sleeve.

741
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,730
I heard you opposed his relationship
with your daughter.

742
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,360
It seems to have hurt his pride greatly.

743
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,610
I believe that's when he started
digging up dirt on you.

744
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,660
How about we let them
get back together first?

745
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,490
As for the parts you believe he lacks,

746
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,080
I'll fill them in.

747
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,620
What do you mean?

748
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm going to

749
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,630
adopt Choi Kang-ho as my son

750
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,460
who will have the right
to inherit my business.

751
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,890
Will you get rid of the original copy
of the DNA test result in front of me?

752
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,560
Come on. Getting rid of that paper
won't change anything.

753
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,520
Right?

754
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,320
He'll get rid of them
as if they never existed.

755
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,150
My son will do that.

756
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,160
Right?

757
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,130
You'll be safer there than in Korea.

758
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,510
No one will be able to find you.

759
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,020
Don't worry too much. It'll all work out.

760
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,140
Thank you for the drink.

761
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,660
I took care of it.

762
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,830
We finally have our own nail salon!

763
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,130
NAIL & NAIL

764
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,090
Sun-young…

765
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,470
Why are you crying?

766
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,060
Why would you cry
on such a delightful day?

767
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,020
You're the one who cried first.

768
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,690
You know what?

769
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,650
I'm going to make a ton of money

770
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,490
and bring my kids back.

771
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,580
I'm going to buy them

772
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,460
whatever food they want

773
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,040
and dress them in all the pretty clothes.

774
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,170
I will.

775
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,390
It's not smelly, right?

776
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,470
It's thanks to our homemade doenjang.

777
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,220
Have some aged kimchi too. It's tasty.

778
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,110
It would've been perfect
if there was skate.

779
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,110
Skate and celebrations go hand in hand.

780
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,150
I'm sure someone will bring some.

781
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,860
Gosh, do you hear those two kids?

782
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,280
Kids these days learn so quickly.

783
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,580
They learn too quickly.

784
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,120
I suddenly miss my late mother.

785
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,670
-It'll be fun
-This is too salty.

786
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,960
to hit a ball with this.

787
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,130
This is too bland.

788
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,050
Do you want some?

789
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,850
Even a dog doesn't want it.

790
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,230
Goodness. Young-soon is so lucky.

791
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:22,360
She went through so much
to raise her son by herself.

792
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,900
And now, he's a prosecutor
and an assemblyman's son-in-law.

793
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,070
Things are looking up for her.

794
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,320
It's more than just that.

795
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,540
Her social status will change.

796
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,790
Social status, my foot.

797
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,750
And if that's the case,
she should've hired a catering service.

798
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,630
Look at this.

799
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,460
How will we feed
all those people with that much meat?

800
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,090
We can slaughter a pig if need be.

801
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,140
There's no need to worry about that
when she has a pig farm.

802
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,310
Nice one.

803
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,600
You must be tired.

804
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,520
-Hello.
-Let me do it.

805
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,690
Gosh, you reek.

806
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,440
Go wash up.

807
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,730
Yes, leave this up to us.

808
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,190
Go get dressed up.

809
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,150
Will you greet the assemblyman's daughter
while looking like that?

810
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
You little…

811
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,990
I told you not to tell anyone.

812
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,540
She also told me to keep it a secret.

813
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,700
Right.

814
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,830
Well, it's good news, so…

815
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,210
By the way, who's the assemblyman?

816
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,720
My son's colleague told me the news,

817
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,090
but I don't know who it is exactly.

818
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,640
Anyway, please don't say these things
in front of Kang-ho.

819
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,560
-Okay?
-Of course.

820
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,140
It's great that he's marrying
an assemblyman's daughter.

821
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,900
But honestly, it's not great news for us.

822
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,860
To be honest,
we didn't benefit from Kang-ho

823
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,990
going to law school
and becoming a prosecutor, did we?

824
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,070
Darn it.

825
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,540
We could've gotten that done at a mill.

826
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,960
Look at that old man overworking himself.

827
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,080
At that age, he…

828
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,840
Never mind. Keep going.

829
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,210
You weren't talking about me, were you?

830
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,550
Hey, Sung-ae!

831
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,180
-Go ahead and hit.
-She's bitter about

832
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,890
how Sam-sik was incarcerated for theft.

833
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,810
She begged Kang-ho
not to put her son behind bars,

834
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,060
but he refused to listen.

835
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,230
She's still bitter about that.

836
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:30,570
Just let her be.

837
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,610
Okay.

838
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,330
What's the big deal about marrying
an assemblyman's daughter?

839
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,580
I should go home.

840
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,880
My dog hasn't been eating much
due to her labor pains.

841
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,880
When's the date?

842
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,090
Seeing how she's spotting,
it'll be today or tomorrow.

843
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,220
No, I'm talking about Sam-sik.

844
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,350
I'm going to ask Kang-ho to help him
get a job when he comes today.

845
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,400
Where are the mung beans? There they are.

846
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:11,650
Move.

847
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,740
I know Kang-ho likes mung bean pancakes.

848
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,580
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

849
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,670
REJECT

850
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,600
My head hurts.

851
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,900
You didn't have to come.

852
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,990
I should meet her at least once.

853
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,530
After all, she's your mother.

854
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,660
And I can drive when you feel tired.

855
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,830
Oh, right.

856
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,250
I'm just going to get
a five-carat diamond ring.

857
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,540
Smaller ones are trendier nowadays.

858
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,260
Only those who want to come off as wealthy

859
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,800
go for big rings.

860
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,260
And my dad's presidential election
is coming up as well.

861
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,440
Darn it.

862
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,900
What?

863
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,740
You got 0.5 carats?

864
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,200
Only big department stores
in Seoul have them.

865
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,450
-There's a warranty in there too.
-A warranty?

866
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,330
In there. Underneath.

867
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,170
Come on. Stay still.

868
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,800
The gem sure looks huge.

869
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,510
Goodness. 0.5 carats?

870
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,670
Wait. Don't touch it.

871
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,840
-I wasn't going to.
-You look nice.

872
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,230
It would've been wonderful
had Kang-ho and Mi-joo ended up together.

873
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,600
Remember?

874
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,230
When they were kids,

875
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,940
we promised to become in-laws.

876
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,240
Your daughter
is happily married in the US.

877
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,860
What are you saying?

878
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,570
I'm just saying.

879
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,370
By the way,

880
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,370
why did you get this
when they haven't set a date yet?

881
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,670
I also got a ring before I got married.

882
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,050
He brought a pig with the ring
around its neck when he proposed.

883
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,260
Gosh.

884
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,350
He would've been delighted
had he been alive.

885
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,310
You're all done.

886
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,700
You look like Brooke Shields.

887
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,160
No wonder Sam-sik is dexterous.
He takes after his mother.

888
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,290
Why are you bringing up
his dexterity right now?

889
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,840
What is this?
Is it a backhanded compliment?

890
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,880
What are you talking about?

891
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,340
It's only natural for your child
to take after you.

892
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:26,890
Sure, but we're talking about Sam-sik.

893
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:28,930
What do you think?

894
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,890
This is a set.

895
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,690
Goodness, you look gorgeous.

896
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,240
You look like a forsythia.

897
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,110
-Do I look okay?
-Yes.

898
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,160
She has a good eye
for picking out the right colors.

899
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,280
Tell me about it.

900
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,830
How did you think of picking such a color?

901
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:54,830
Vivid colors are on trend nowadays.

902
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,580
I don't want her to think that

903
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,090
I'm a hillbilly with no fashion sense.

904
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,550
How dare a woman
look down on her mother-in-law?

905
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,050
Who cares who her father is?

906
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,890
Reject her if you don't like her.

907
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,470
-Goodness.
-She's right.

908
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,310
I'm telling you,
whoever and whatever it may be,

909
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,940
you need to show them
who's boss from the get-go.

910
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,110
That way, they won't cause problems.

911
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,150
Be confident. Okay?

912
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,190
Okay.

913
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,200
Young-soon, come out!

914
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,490
I can't seem to find the drinks.

915
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,660
Coming!

916
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,330
Doesn't she look like a pickled radish?

917
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,920
She's gone.

918
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,960
Her hair looks great though.

919
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,420
I think she'll be looked down on.

920
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,590
Right?

921
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,680
-Pickled radish!
-Pickled radish!

922
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,600
-Pickled radish!
-Pickled radish!

923
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,020
-Goodness. We have no pickled radish.
-Kids always tell the truth.

924
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,350
Drink slowly.

925
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,810
Young-soon.

926
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,600
Come and have a drink with us.

927
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:00,770
Come sit.

928
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:04,150
I'll eat after I meet Kang-ho's fiancée.

929
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,900
Right.

930
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,820
It's your first time meeting her, right?

931
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,700
-Yes.
-Gosh.

932
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,620
Kang-ho shouldn't
be like this to his mother.

933
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,450
It's understandable.

934
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,960
His mother worked so hard to raise him,

935
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,710
so how could he only now
introduce his fiancée to her?

936
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,380
-He's very busy.
-Right.

937
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:32,600
To be honest,
I'm elated that he's visiting us today.

938
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,720
Of course.

939
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,180
-Hold on.
-What?

940
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,690
Do you think he's coming here

941
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,940
to take Young-soon to Seoul?

942
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,060
Seoul?

943
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,530
Think about it. Jong-ho did that too.

944
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,610
He took his parents to Seoul
before getting married.

945
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,740
-You're right.
-You're right.

946
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,870
That could happen.
So she's going to Seoul?

947
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,950
It makes sense.

948
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,910
After all, his future father-in-law
is an assemblyman.

949
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,040
Kang-ho wouldn't let his mother
keep living here all by herself.

950
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,130
What now?

951
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,340
Is this goodbye for us?

952
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,420
This is great.

953
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,380
What will happen to your farm then?

954
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,680
Leave your potato farm to me.

955
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,470
Oh, dear. Hold on.

956
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,810
Goodness.

957
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,850
You'll still help Sam-sik
get a job, right?

958
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,400
You will, right?

959
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,980
-Young-soon.
-Sung-ae.

960
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,360
Oh, no. Is this farewell?

961
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,570
He's here!

962
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,490
Kang-ho has arrived from Seoul!

963
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,700
-He's here.
-Kang-ho? He's here!

964
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,950
-Kang-ho!
-Hurry up!

965
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,580
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

966
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,290
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

967
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,750
-Goodness. Kang-ho!
-Goodness.

968
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:44,710
Goodness.

969
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,460
-Oh, my!
-Goodness!

970
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,840
She's so pretty.

971
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,420
How pretty.

972
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,470
You're here.

973
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,140
I'm the village head.

974
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,310
Hello.

975
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,610
We sincerely welcome you two to Jou-ri,

976
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:10,400
a village with clear water

977
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,240
and good-hearted people.

978
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,490
There's no body of water here.

979
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:19,620
And why do you sound like an AI?

980
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,000
You're unbelievable.

981
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,250
Everyone, this is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho

982
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,880
and her fiancée,
an assemblyman's daughter.

983
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,300
Let's all bow… No.

984
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,670
Give them a round of applause.

985
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,090
I told you not to mention her father.

986
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,140
It must've been a long trip.

987
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,560
Come on in.

988
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,350
-Come on.
-Go in.

989
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,310
-Goodness.
-Hello.

990
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:46,060
-She's pretty.
-Behave.

991
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,480
Come on.

992
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,820
You must be hungry.

993
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,230
Let's eat first.

994
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,570
-I have something to tell you.
-Gosh.

995
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,320
What's the rush?

996
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,280
Let's eat first and talk later.

997
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,620
-Come here.
-Ma'am.

998
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,830
You're so beautiful.

999
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,670
-How about you sing a song?
-That's a good idea.

1000
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,540
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1001
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,500
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1002
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,460
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1003
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,130
-Sing for us!
-Sir.

1004
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,010
You can't get married if you can't sing

1005
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,470
-You're so mean
-Gosh, this is embarrassing.

1006
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,520
-So mean!
-If you can't get married

1007
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,640
-Kang-ho.
-You can't…

1008
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,020
I have something to say!

1009
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,690
-Goodness.
-Go inside.

1010
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,360
Come in. Goodness.

1011
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,370
Last night,

1012
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,370
your father visited me in my dreams.

1013
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,080
Have a seat.

1014
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:54,460
He was silent
and glared at me as if he was upset.

1015
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,970
I thought long and hard about
why he was sulking so much.

1016
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,100
He must've been jealous that
I would be the only one to witness this.

1017
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,890
Gosh, you're beautiful.

1018
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,100
How old are you?

1019
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,310
I'm 27.

1020
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,230
You have the perfect age gap.

1021
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,650
Hold on.

1022
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,330
I got this at the biggest
jewelry shop in town.

1023
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,300
They're diamonds.

1024
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,630
I see.

1025
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,550
Can you wait outside?

1026
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,760
Okay.

1027
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,510
Why?

1028
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,900
I know that brand.

1029
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,900
You know…

1030
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,070
Vutton!

1031
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,030
-It's a luxury handbag.
-I see.

1032
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,950
What are those boxes?

1033
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,460
It says "fur…"

1034
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,170
As in animal fur?

1035
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,670
Animal fur? Maybe it's a mink coat.

1036
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,840
It could be.

1037
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,220
I heard they skin minks alive.

1038
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,340
Don't say something so horrific.

1039
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,760
By the way, what are those boxes?

1040
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:30,770
Do you think they're for us?

1041
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,270
What are you doing there?

1042
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:47,080
Goodness.

1043
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:52,750
Come to think of it, your fiancée
was born in the Year of the Pig.

1044
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,960
It must be destiny.

1045
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,710
Who am I? I'm a pig farmer.

1046
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,880
She was destined to marry
into our family, right?

1047
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,390
What is this?

1048
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,030
"Adoption Agreement"?

1049
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,240
What is this?

1050
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,080
Are you going to adopt a child?

1051
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,410
Why?

1052
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,830
Can she not get pregnant?

1053
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:35,670
I will be adopted by Chairman Song
who has been raising me all along.

1054
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,630
Please stamp your seal there.

1055
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:45,680
-What?
-Be quiet.

1056
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,350
What…

1057
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,850
What are you saying?

1058
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,480
Who raised you? Who's adopting you?

1059
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,980
I'm your mom.

1060
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,650
I gave birth to you.

1061
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,740
What are you talking about?

1062
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,900
I'm going to become Chairman Song's son,

1063
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,120
inherit his business,
and become an assemblyman's son-in-law.

1064
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,120
Wait.

1065
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,870
Wait, Kang-ho. What are you talking about?

1066
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,040
I get that money and power are great.

1067
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,300
But you can't cut ties with your mom.

1068
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,340
Isn't this what you wanted?

1069
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,260
What…

1070
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,650
CONSENTING PARTY: JIN YOUNG-SOON
SIGNATURE OR SEAL

1071
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,640
All right.

1072
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,230
I'll always be your mom.

1073
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,280
This piece of paper won't matter.

1074
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,160
I'm happy as long as you are.

1075
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,420
Let me ask you one question.

1076
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,430
Did you propose the idea?

1077
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,390
You didn't, right?

1078
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,350
He did, right?

1079
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,560
You didn't want to, but he forced you
because he needs you, right?

1080
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,600
Am I right?

1081
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,630
Wait.

1082
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,840
Kang-ho.

1083
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,640
I can't let you go like this.

1084
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,350
Have some food before you go.

1085
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:43,650
Food?

1086
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,480
You're inviting me to eat

1087
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,030
when I've never been able
to enjoy a meal with you?

1088
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:01,620
Then take this.

1089
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,790
Take this with you.

1090
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,210
Why won't you take this?

1091
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,220
I get that you're embarrassed by me
since I'm a poor hillbilly.

1092
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,680
But why won't you take this?

1093
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,300
These are all brand new.

1094
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,260
They sell these
at big department stores in Seoul.

1095
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:19,140
There's a warranty too. Kang--

1096
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:20,930
Kang-ho…

1097
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,190
-Does this make sense?
-I don't know.

1098
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,690
Goodness.

1099
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,660
Wait. Kang-ho.

1100
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:38,160
Kang-ho.

1101
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,880
Kang-ho.

1102
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,840
Wait.

1103
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,840
They're mung bean pancakes, your favorite.

1104
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,430
Have some on your way, okay?

1105
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,810
Kang-ho!

1106
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,980
What an impudent punk!

1107
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,900
Goodness.

1108
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,990
Look at this handbag.

1109
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:21,290
She must have good taste
because she lives in Seoul.

1110
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,660
Goodness. This is very light.

1111
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,120
I can barely feel it.

1112
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,210
By the way,

1113
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,920
if Chairman Song adopts him,

1114
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
does that mean he'll be Song Kang-ho now?

1115
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,510
Don't worry about me.

1116
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:42,930
Gosh.

1117
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,100
I've been running on an empty stomach.
I'm hungry now.

1118
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,730
Why are you out here?

1119
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,770
We have lots of food inside. Go inside.

1120
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,940
Go inside.

1121
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,530
-Okay.
-Gosh.

1122
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:56,400
Go away, kids.

1123
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,490
Kids, go play.

1124
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:00,990
Go.

1125
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,590
The smell is making me carsick.

1126
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,970
Are we really taking that home?

1127
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,520
I hope my clothes won't reek of it.

1128
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,280
Kang-ho.

1129
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:39,990
Kang-ho.

1130
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,700
Kang-ho…

1131
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,020
Kang-ho.

1132
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,660
Should I drive instead?

1133
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,870
Okay. I'm sorry.

1134
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,880
Kang-ho.

1135
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,880
Are you okay?

1136
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,060
It still reeks.

1137
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,820
Kang-ho.

1138
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,190
No.

1139
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,110
Kang-ho, no…

1140
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,200
No!

1141
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,540
Kang-ho!

1142
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,870
Kang-ho!

1143
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,480
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1144
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,660
My son won't die.

1145
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,000
I won't let him die.

1146
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,870
What? Kang-ho?

1147
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,920
-I'm telling you.
-Then what will happen to Kang-ho?

1148
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,050
Just watch and see.

1149
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,720
Our son will walk out of that room.

1150
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,180
He'll stand here and look at you.

1151
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,470
I'll make sure he does.

1152
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:53,770
I hope you learn English quickly
so we can live together.

1153
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,640
That was the worst sin you could commit.

1154
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,020
Letting others use you.

1155
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,440
My son woke up!

1156
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,480
It's me, Mom.

1157
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,690
Do you recognize me?

1158
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:10,570
