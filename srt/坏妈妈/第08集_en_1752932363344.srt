1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,980
Mom, no.

3
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,360
No, Mom.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,860
Mom…

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,820
No, Mom.

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,870
Kang-ho…

7
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,870
Kang-ho.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,160
Kang-ho, you're…

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,500
You're…

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,630
Kang-ho…

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,350
You just

12
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,230
stood up, right?

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,980
Honey…

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,530
Our son… Thank you.

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,570
Thank you.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,650
Thank you.

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,030
Kang-ho, do it again.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,830
Stand up again.

19
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,470
Kang-ho, that was…

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,220
Kang-ho.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,810
Kang-ho.

22
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,350
Kang-ho.

23
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,020
Kang-ho!

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,940
Kang-ho.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,780
Kang-ho!

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,740
Kang-ho!

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,030
Kang-ho!

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,870
Kang-ho!

29
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,410
EPISODE 8

30
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,580
Let me see your fingernail.

31
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,390
I fixed it for now

32
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,220
but it could chip again.

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,020
Here.

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,690
I'll mark it with this nail polish,

35
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,480
so be careful with this fingernail, okay?

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,150
My mom abandoned me.

37
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,700
She took me to an unfamiliar place

38
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,290
and left without me to go somewhere nice.

39
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
Your mom

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,210
would never abandon you.

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
However,

42
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,010
if she really

43
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,880
did such a thing,

44
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,760
I'm sure she had a reason.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,850
A reason?

46
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,270
Yes.

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,690
She may not be able to tell you now,

48
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,900
but one day, you'll understand everything.

49
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,160
Mi-joo, how do you know that?

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,750
Because I was abandoned too.

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,080
You were?

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,880
Why?

53
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,130
I'm not sure.

54
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,010
I also really want to know

55
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,060
why I was abandoned.

56
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,730
But I'll never know.

57
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,190
Kang-ho!

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,490
Kang-ho.

59
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,180
Kang-ho.

60
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,970
About what happened--

61
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,270
What's the reason?

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
What?

63
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,150
Why did you abandon me?

64
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,690
Mi-joo told me

65
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,740
that there must be a reason for that.

66
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,490
Kang-ho.

67
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,580
I never

68
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,410
abandoned you.

69
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,300
Kang-ho, look at me.

70
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,760
Look at me. Please?

71
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,020
I'll be honest.

72
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,270
Kang-ho, the thing is…

73
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm actually

74
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,610
a bit unwell.

75
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,330
You are?

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,950
Where?

77
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,250
Here.

78
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,000
My stomach hurts a bit.

79
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,760
Because I'm unwell, I need to
take medicine and go to the hospital.

80
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,640
Someone needs to cook,
do the laundry, and look after me.

81
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,310
But…

82
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,600
I didn't want to burden you.

83
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,060
That's why.

84
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,360
Was I a burden to you…

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,240
because I'm unwell?

86
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,580
What?

87
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,960
You fed me medicine
and took me to the hospital.

88
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,790
You cooked and did my laundry too.

89
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,420
To me, you're just my mom.

90
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,300
But I must've been a burden to you.

91
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,230
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,270
I was wrong.

93
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,780
You're right.

94
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,650
I'm your mom,

95
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,240
and you're my son.

96
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,950
I was so stupid to think that way.

97
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,130
Besides, you're no longer unwell.

98
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,960
You definitely stood up earlier.

99
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,340
And soon enough,

100
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,470
you'll be able to walk and run.

101
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,550
And…

102
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,140
you'll be able to take care of me.

103
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,850
That's right.

104
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,690
I also have a guardian now, don't I?

105
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,600
"Guardian"?

106
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,770
Yes.

107
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,650
You're my guardian now.

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,320
Your guardian.

109
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,170
So Kang-ho,

110
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,920
try to stand up

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,260
like you did earlier.

112
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,360
It's okay. You can do it.

113
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,650
Take your time and try it again.

114
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,660
Okay.

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,380
Don't give up. You're almost there.

116
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,340
A bit more.

117
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,090
I can't do it.

118
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,760
No, you did. You already did.

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,970
Get up, Kang-ho.

120
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,890
Get up.

121
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,270
Don't leave me, Mom.

122
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,910
Mom, where are we going?

123
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,830
No. I don't want to go.

124
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,170
Can't I just live with you? Please?

125
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,210
Mom.

126
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Mom.

127
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,630
Mom!

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,970
Mom!

129
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,470
Mom!

130
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,480
Mom!

131
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,140
Mom! Save me!

132
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,230
Do you want to live?

133
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,020
Do you?

134
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,320
-Mom!
-Then get up.

135
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,320
Stand up like you did earlier!

136
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,530
-Mom!
-Get up!

137
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,870
-Kang-ho, look!
-Mom!

138
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,330
If you stand up,

139
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,540
the water will be only knee-deep!

140
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,040
-Mom.
-So get up!

141
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,080
Stand up!

142
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,130
Mom.

143
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,170
Mom!

144
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,050
The wheelchair is gone.

145
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,390
So get up.

146
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,140
Get up and walk!

147
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,810
I can't…

148
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,360
It's not that you can't. You just won't.

149
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,900
That's not true.

150
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,280
I can't do it, Mom.

151
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
-Really?
-Mom!

152
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,780
Really?

153
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,990
Mom!

154
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,700
-Get up.
-Mom!

155
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,830
-Mom!
-Get up!

156
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,330
-Mom!
-Get up and walk!

157
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,130
Mom!

158
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,130
Get up!

159
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,760
Mom…

160
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,390
Hold him by his pelvis…

161
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,690
Mom…

162
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,230
Get up.

163
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,730
All right.

164
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,110
It's okay. You can do it.

165
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
Get up.

166
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,410
-You're doing well.
-A bit more. Your left foot.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,130
That's it.

168
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,090
Your legs.

169
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,800
Move your legs!

170
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,260
I can't move them.

171
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,430
Slowly. Good.

172
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,190
Well done.

173
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,230
-Well done.
-You're doing well.

174
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,940
Slowly.

175
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,900
Gosh!

176
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,250
-Move them.
-Mom.

177
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,210
I can move them, Mom.

178
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,750
Mom.

179
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,340
Well done. More.

180
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,860
-I don't want to!
-Oh Tae-soo of Jeilmirae Party

181
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,320
-Come here.
-received the highest votes

182
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,910
-Kang-ho!
-in the preliminary elections.

183
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,820
Mr. Son!

184
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,560
Come here, Kang-ho.

185
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,020
Kang-ho.

186
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,380
She's already been through
so much hardship.

187
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,800
With her son in that state

188
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,090
and now her farm in ruins,

189
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,340
she must be in so much distress.

190
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,850
I can't believe I made such a fuss

191
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,270
trying to get rid of her pig farm.

192
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,060
I deserve to die.

193
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,060
That's true.

194
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,150
What?

195
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,230
Don't say that.

196
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,820
We're all to blame.

197
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,610
No one here is innocent.

198
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,290
I should visit and console her,

199
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,370
but I feel too shameful to do that.

200
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,130
Speaking of which,

201
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,790
as her neighbors,

202
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,170
we should be doing something to help her.

203
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Then should we all pitch in
some money for her?

204
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,680
You know her. She'd never accept it.

205
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,930
I agree. Instead of giving her money,

206
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,730
how about we give her a gift?

207
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,320
Perhaps, some nice sheet masks,
clothes, or a luxury bag.

208
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,360
She's been giving away
everything she owns.

209
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,690
I doubt she'll be happy.

210
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,820
What is she giving away?

211
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,620
Did she give you something?

212
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,660
-Did she give you something?
-No.

213
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,370
That's not it.

214
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,500
What I mean is that

215
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,710
she's not the type

216
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,130
to want nice clothes or bags.

217
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,340
Her only desire
is to dote on her one and only son.

218
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,810
Why don't we get Kang-ho a gift instead?

219
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,100
Goodness, that's a great idea.

220
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,060
Right.

221
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,520
Then what about a new wheelchair?

222
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,780
I saw that she had thrown out
his broken wheelchair a few days ago.

223
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,030
Then don't you think
she would've bought a new one already?

224
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,530
-Right.
-You think so?

225
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,740
Since he can't go anywhere without it.

226
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,830
That's true.

227
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,120
Then how about
we get him a mobility scooter?

228
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,170
It won't break since it's sturdy.

229
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,260
The roads here are very rough.

230
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,840
It's perfect!

231
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,890
You sure are an early adopter.

232
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,930
I'm all for it.

233
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,100
-Me too!
-We all are!

234
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,980
-Then let's get one already.
-Okay.

235
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,730
JIN YOUNG-SOON
CHOI KANG-HO'S MOTHER

236
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,230
JUNG GUM-JA, LEE MI-JOO

237
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,230
PIGSTY
OFFICE

238
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,110
Mr. So.

239
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,030
You startled me.

240
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,040
You jerk. I told you
not to barge in like that.

241
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,960
-We finally have it.
-What?

242
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
Are you serious?

243
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,010
Where?

244
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,970
Where is it?

245
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,010
Look at this.

246
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,140
We finally have…

247
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,480
a lettuce leaf.

248
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,150
So…

249
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
you didn't mean evidence.

250
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,860
You meant lettuce leaves.

251
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,620
Oh, the evidence?

252
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,620
But sir, look. We went through
the effort of planting them.

253
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,210
At times, we forgot
to water them or spray pesticides.

254
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,880
But look how they've grown.

255
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,880
So,

256
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,920
you're elated.

257
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,130
Right?

258
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,090
Yes, sir. I'm very happy.

259
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,010
It's the first time
I've planted something and seen it grow.

260
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,220
-Take a closer look.
-Don't come near me.

261
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,430
Don't!

262
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,680
Get out!

263
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,440
Go!

264
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,940
You punk!

265
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,020
Leave!

266
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,570
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,110
We're not qualified?

268
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,950
We're young, healthy men
who decided to farm in the countryside.

269
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,450
We've completed the required course too.

270
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,740
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,790
But both of the applicants
are employed in a conglomerate

272
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,630
and covered by social insurance,
therefore are not eligible for this loan.

273
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,840
What on earth are you talking about?

274
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,090
Then what about me?

275
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,260
What should I do?

276
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,170
Sorry?

277
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,140
What are you…

278
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,550
I'll die if I don't pay them back soon.

279
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,510
And it'll be messy.

280
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,430
They'll tear out my liver, kidneys, eyes,

281
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,190
lungs, intestines, duodenum,
and everything else

282
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,690
piece by piece
and that's how I'll end up--

283
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,320
I should just die.

284
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,280
I should just die.

285
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,330
I should just die.

286
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,330
I should just die.

287
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,580
I should just die.

288
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,250
What are you looking for?

289
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,090
Are there any pesticides?

290
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,130
I want to kill myself.

291
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,470
It's down there.

292
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,550
What?

293
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,680
Mix two tablespoons of this
in one mal of water.

294
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Okay.

295
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,020
This one too.

296
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,400
Here's your insecticide.

297
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,200
-Thank you.
-Sure.

298
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,950
-Bye.
-Bye.

299
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,160
Goodness.

300
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,790
What is this? Is this for me?

301
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
Are you senile?

302
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,460
What? What's wrong with me?

303
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,630
Is looking for romance at my age so wrong?

304
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,010
Jeez.

305
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,050
This countryside has been teeming
with old ladies.

306
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,060
-All the men around here are excited
-Does it hurt?

307
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,730
to see such a young, pretty lady.

308
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,980
Mi-joo has been treating everyone

309
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,610
in this village well.

310
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,990
Thanks to her, I have more customers now.

311
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,740
She's my lucky charm.

312
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,780
Hey, young lady.

313
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,160
Are you interested in opening a nail salon

314
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,710
in a bigger and cleaner place?

315
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,080
I could easily get you

316
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,880
the best spot in this area.

317
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,880
What do you say?

318
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,800
Thank you for the offer,
but I like this place.

319
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,800
I have many regulars,
and the owners here are so lovely.

320
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,890
Did you hear that?

321
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,850
Don't you even dream
of stealing her from me.

322
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,520
Shouldn't you get going?

323
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,530
Excuse me.

324
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,650
Hi, Mom.

325
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,070
Mom, Dad is here.

326
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,280
What? What are you talking about?
Why would he be here?

327
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,540
-I'm working, so call me later.
-I'm not lying. I know his face.

328
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,250
He drove a Banz here.

329
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,790
I'm certain it's him.

330
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Stop here please.

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,960
Mom!

332
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,090
Mom!

333
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,800
Mom, hurry!

334
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,720
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

335
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,430
You need to hurry!

336
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,480
Grandma is beating Dad up right now!

337
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,520
He's getting beaten up!

338
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,270
You darn son of a gun!

339
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,980
I know it's you! Stop lying!

340
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,190
-What's wrong?
-You're the guy

341
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,150
who abandoned my daughter!

342
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,280
That's not me.

343
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Don't you dare lie!

344
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,950
You don't think I know your face?

345
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,160
I set a picture of you

346
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,080
as the wallpaper on my phone.

347
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,550
I wanted to make sure to recognize you
so I can beat you up.

348
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,920
I only took that because she asked me to.

349
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,970
Stop lying!

350
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,090
Darn it. And that's not even the US.

351
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,600
We took that in Seoul.

352
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,600
Be quiet.

353
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,600
The kids will hear.

354
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,060
-Dad!
-Dad!

355
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,780
The kids think you're their dad.

356
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,400
You can't show up like this.

357
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,450
Pay me back.

358
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,910
-Sun-young borrowed that money.
-I don't want to hear it.

359
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,160
You have until the end of the month.

360
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,080
If you don't,

361
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,540
I'll tell those ladies
who are dying to find you

362
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,750
that you're here.

363
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,230
What? What's wrong?

364
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,270
Where's Dad?

365
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,610
Dad?

366
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,820
He left.

367
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,570
He left?

368
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,610
Where did he go?

369
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,110
To the US.

370
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
The US?

371
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,830
Something urgent came up, so he had to.

372
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,200
He said he was sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye

373
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,040
-and that when he returns--
-I hate you both.

374
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,170
I won't go to kindergarten anymore.

375
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,550
Ye-jin.

376
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,220
There's this boy named Park Jun-seo
at our kindergarten.

377
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,760
He always teases her for not having a dad,

378
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,720
so they always get into fights.

379
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,100
So we were going to
bring Dad along tomorrow

380
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,810
and teach him a lesson.

381
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,650
But not anymore.

382
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,650
Seo-jin.

383
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,690
It's me.

384
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,070
The hen I told you to prepare,
I don't need it anymore.

385
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,120
Darn it.

386
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,630
The kids kept saying that
they wanted to see their dad.

387
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,220
So I asked my friend's boyfriend
to video-call them a few times.

388
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,140
Mom.

389
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,890
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,060
Don't be.

391
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,690
It's not like I've been
a model parent to you anyway.

392
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,030
I'm the one who started all this,

393
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,860
so you don't have to apologize to me.

394
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,030
It's just that

395
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,570
those kids

396
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,530
will be going to school soon.

397
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,750
Once they see the family register
and find out they don't have a dad,

398
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,500
they'll be so heartbroken.

399
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,050
I thought of telling them
that you guys got a divorce

400
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,090
or that he died of an illness.

401
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,680
I thought long and hard too.

402
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
But…

403
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,680
I just can't do it.

404
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,060
I can't bear the thought
of making them cry.

405
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,770
Both of them will bawl.
How can I possibly watch that?

406
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,070
They must be so heartbroken right now

407
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,490
and bawling their eyes out.

408
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,200
My babies…

409
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,790
-No way!
-No way!

410
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,410
Is this for Kang-ho?

411
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,960
Yes, what do you think?

412
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,420
Isn't it incredible?

413
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,880
It's a bit small for three.

414
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,760
What are you talking about?

415
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,340
You shouldn't ride it!

416
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,380
It's just for him!

417
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,390
Don't raise your voice at them.

418
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,850
-They could get hurt.
-He's right. You could get hurt.

419
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,640
Kids, this is very expensive.

420
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,560
So you shouldn't ride it, okay?

421
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,020
-Okay.
-Good boy.

422
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,230
The wheels are huge,
and it looks so sturdy.

423
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,610
Kang-ho will love it.

424
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,400
-Right.
-Of course.

425
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,490
This will save Young-soon the hassle too.

426
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,530
I'm glad we got it.

427
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,160
-Right.
-Hey, it's Mi-joo.

428
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,950
-Hi, Mi-joo.
-Gosh.

429
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,290
Look who's here. It's Mi-joo.

430
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,120
Did you close your salon today for this?

431
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,160
Sorry?

432
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,790
Goodness, you must be busy
with so many customers.

433
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,000
How considerate of you.

434
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,300
But then again,
she's always cared for Kang-ho

435
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,760
-since they were kids.
-That's true.

436
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,800
And Sam-sik always bullied Kang-ho.

437
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,810
What…

438
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,890
What on earth are you talking about?

439
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,690
Sam-sik never bullied Kang-ho.

440
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,480
He did. Be quiet.

441
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,480
Anyway, now that
everyone's here, let's go.

442
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,030
-All right.
-Let's go.

443
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,610
-Move aside.
-Let's go!

444
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,570
-You're going to hurt yourself!
-Go.

445
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,200
All right.

446
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,410
-Look at him.
-Goodness!

447
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,200
I need to go back to the salon now.

448
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,330
After they complimented you?

449
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,750
-What?
-Be quiet and follow me.

450
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Mom…

451
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,840
We can't make any mistakes this time.

452
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,090
Do something stupid once again,

453
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,640
and you'll see lettuce roots

454
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,930
instead of leaves.

455
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,140
Roots?

456
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,600
But the roots are underground…

457
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,690
Yes, sir.

458
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,790
Hey, hide!

459
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,090
Over there!

460
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,760
Where in the world are they
after screwing me over?

461
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,600
And why aren't they picking up?

462
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,810
Darn it.

463
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,520
All right.

464
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,730
Gosh, it's so fascinating.

465
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,190
-Be careful! You'll trip and fall!
-Make way!

466
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,520
-Make way!
-Make way!

467
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,190
Make way!

468
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,980
Hey!

469
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,780
All right.

470
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,200
-Make way!
-Make way!

471
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,990
-Let's go!
-Come on, let's go!

472
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,290
Wait, why am I hiding?

473
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,140
I'll ask her to open the gates.

474
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,600
Why aren't you picking up?

475
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,100
-Hey--
-Wait.

476
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,850
-What is it?
-Hold on.

477
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,020
Don't you think it'd be too boring

478
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,110
to just hand it over to him?

479
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,530
-Boring?
-What do you mean?

480
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,820
-Yes.
-How about

481
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,870
you all line up in two rows?

482
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,330
-Both ways?
-Yes.

483
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,660
-Like a wedding.
-I see.

484
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,000
-Go on.
-Like this?

485
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,210
I'll be hiding in that corner, okay?

486
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,970
Once Kang-ho comes out,

487
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,130
I want you to shout out his name.

488
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,550
That'll be my cue.

489
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,810
-Then I'll appear with this scooter.
-What are they doing?

490
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,690
-I love it.
-Great.

491
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,350
You sure are the brains around here.

492
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,190
You're flattering me.

493
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,820
Anyway, give me my cue.

494
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,490
All right. "Kang-ho!"

495
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,700
Jeez, they're so over the top.

496
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,330
Young-soon!

497
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,830
Are you home?

498
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,910
Young-soon!

499
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,040
Young-soon.

500
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,290
I'm coming.

501
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,590
What brings all of you here?

502
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,390
Goodness.

503
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,100
Mr. Son.

504
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,180
It must've been so tough for you.

505
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,560
As the old saying goes,

506
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,400
"Neighbors are worth a thousand homes."

507
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,320
But none of us are well-off enough

508
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,360
to help you out.

509
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,120
We also thought you'd need some time
to cope with your loss.

510
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,280
It may sound like an excuse,

511
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,290
but we finally mustered up
the courage to see you.

512
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,000
We're truly

513
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,920
sorry.

514
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,250
Don't say that.

515
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,550
I'm the one who should be sorry
for inconveniencing the village.

516
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,510
-I'm sorry.
-Not at all.

517
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,550
-We're sorry.
-Enough.

518
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,470
We apologized,
and you accepted our apology.

519
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,480
We're good now, okay?

520
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,520
Sure.

521
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,060
Where's Kang-ho?

522
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,190
We haven't seen him in a while.

523
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,570
We miss him.

524
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,150
-Kang-ho?
-Yes.

525
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,400
One minute.

526
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,820
Kang-ho.

527
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,570
Kang-ho, come on out.

528
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,490
All right now.

529
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,660
-Should we go get him?
-We should.

530
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,950
No, stay here.

531
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

532
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,540
Goodness.

533
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,830
-Goodness…
-This is great.

534
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,420
I'm so happy for you!

535
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,670
Goodness!

536
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,010
-Goodness…
-This is unbelievable.

537
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,800
Kang-ho!

538
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,180
I'm coming!

539
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,680
Goodness.

540
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,350
Goodness, this is amazing.

541
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm so grateful.

542
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,020
Goodness…

543
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,230
-Goodness!
-Hey!

544
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,810
Mr. Bang!

545
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,400
Dad!

546
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,440
-Dad!
-No! Move aside!

547
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,400
Honey, where does it hurt?

548
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,660
Where?

549
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,110
-My legs!
-Your legs?

550
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,370
Are you okay?

551
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,830
-Goodness.
-What do I do?

552
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,950
-Hi, Sam-sik.
-Are my legs okay?

553
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,790
Hold on. No.

554
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,620
-Call 911!
-Call 911!

555
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,170
-Call 911!
-Hurry!

556
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,130
They say sunshine comes after the rain.

557
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,010
God must've been moved
by your mom's perseverance and love.

558
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,260
That's why He's given you this miracle.

559
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,260
I agree.

560
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,180
And He's given me this mobility scooter.

561
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,140
You should be grateful for it.
That was a close call.

562
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,530
You two from Seoul, eat up.

563
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,570
Thank you.

564
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,820
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

565
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,740
Hey.

566
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,740
Focus and look around carefully.

567
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,120
We didn't come here to drink makgeolli.

568
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,460
Yes, sir.

569
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,380
A little bird told me that

570
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,590
you work at a conglomerate.

571
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,600
How did you know
we work for Woobyeok Group?

572
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,560
What?

573
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,930
I didn't know that.

574
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
Jeez, you work for Woobyeok Group?

575
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,570
Then you should've told me sooner.

576
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,610
Hold on.

577
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,200
If that's the case,

578
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,240
why do you want to farm?

579
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,330
We've retired.

580
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,790
Did you?

581
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,910
I see.

582
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,290
Don't you usually receive severance pay?

583
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,460
You see, I have
a really great business idea.

584
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,170
Listen up.

585
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,810
Look who's here.

586
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,890
It's Mi-joo, my love.

587
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,230
Say hello.

588
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,690
These two are my future business partners.

589
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,690
And she'll be my future--

590
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,110
Can't you see everyone is working?
Go get some makgeolli from the kitchen.

591
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,990
Enjoy.

592
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,450
That's her charm.

593
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,950
The straightforwardness and jabs.

594
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,490
I'll invite you to our wedding,
so make sure you come.

595
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,540
-We'll talk about our business later.
-Okay.

596
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,160
I'll give them to the kids.

597
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,880
Kids, there's more.

598
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,750
Eat up.

599
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,350
Wait.

600
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,600
Look.

601
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,810
I'm all better now.

602
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,690
You're right.

603
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,570
You're all better now. I'm glad.

604
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,820
Wait.

605
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,700
My mom said that

606
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,370
she didn't abandon me.

607
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,370
So I'm sure

608
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,250
that person didn't abandon you either.

609
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,350
Here you go.

610
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,730
We used to be similar in height.

611
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,860
But you're much taller now.

612
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,190
Tell me about it. You're like an adult.

613
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,030
Here.

614
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,450
If I do this, you're taller than me.

615
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,200
All right.

616
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,870
What is this? Why do I have butterflies?

617
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,500
Me too. Lift me up too.

618
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,040
Should I?

619
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,670
Come here, Seo-jin.

620
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,960
Here we go.

621
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,670
-Get a good look at the view, Seo-jin.
-And again.

622
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,840
Good boy.

623
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,260
You got a good view.

624
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,470
Sam-sik.

625
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,550
Come and eat.

626
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,680
Congratulations, Young-soon.

627
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,480
Now that Kang-ho can walk again,

628
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,190
I'm sure only good things
will come your way now.

629
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,810
That's right.

630
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,320
Once you open the farm again,
Kang-ho will help out. This is just great.

631
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,990
It's so fascinating.

632
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,950
Her pigs have been around
for the past 30 years,

633
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,120
and now that I don't smell them,

634
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,580
a part of me feels empty and strange.

635
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,170
I'll be honest. She used to give us
free meat every now and then.

636
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,840
We also got manure for free. It was nice.

637
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,010
Of course.

638
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,760
A pig farm is far better

639
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,970
than some trot concert hall.

640
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,020
Look at those despicable humans.

641
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,400
By the way,
I haven't seen Hoon-ah around lately.

642
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,530
You're right.

643
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,040
We grilled some meat.

644
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,460
So what? Are you rubbing it in my face?

645
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,880
If you haven't eaten yet,

646
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,550
you should come over and eat with us.

647
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,220
The villagers are all there.

648
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,390
No.

649
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,220
I'm allergic to pork.

650
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,310
It's beef.

651
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,560
These darn flies.

652
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,600
I hate them!

653
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,310
Go.

654
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,150
-Darn it.
-Sir.

655
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,280
I won't be alive for long.

656
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,400
I have terminal cancer.

657
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,950
Since I won't be running
the farm for long,

658
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,160
I told my lawyer
to hand it over to you after I die.

659
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,370
But…

660
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,290
my son can walk again now.

661
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,500
That pig farm

662
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,880
is the only thing I can leave him.

663
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,720
It's also the only thing I can teach him.

664
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,560
So please.

665
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,850
Please…

666
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,480
don't take it away from us.

667
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,410
I knew you wouldn't join us,
so I brought some meat.

668
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,490
Here.

669
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,950
Please keep my illness

670
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,290
a secret from the villagers.

671
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,290
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

672
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,420
The meat just melts in my mouth.

673
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,130
-It's like ice cream.
-It's tasty.

674
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,380
Everything's so good.

675
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,380
Gosh.

676
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,800
-I need to use the bathroom.
-It's so tender.

677
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,220
Gosh.

678
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,350
The vegetables are good too.

679
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,770
Hey, don't drag your feet. It's so dusty.
Where are your table manners?

680
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,020
-Where's the bathroom?
-There's dust everywhere!

681
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Is this it?

682
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,370
This isn't it.

683
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,760
It's here.

684
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,260
Thank you.

685
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,720
-Gosh, thank you.
-It's so good.

686
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,840
-Use both hands.
-Just eat this.

687
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,890
Come on.

688
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,930
We finally have it.

689
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,390
What is it this time?

690
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,190
-Poop?
-No.

691
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,400
The evidence.

692
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,520
All his files and belongings
are in the shed back there.

693
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,940
What?

694
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,690
Are you serious?

695
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,150
-Let's go.
-All right.

696
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,570
Right!

697
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,080
I finally remember who you are.

698
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,240
Damn it.

699
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,580
We met before, right?

700
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,210
You were hiding in my closet,

701
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,830
and then came out and started fighting
with a knife with a guy.

702
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,880
What? With a knife?

703
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,630
-Yes.
-Are you thieves?

704
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,300
Why were you hiding in their closet?

705
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,300
What are you talking about?

706
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,430
They're my business partners.

707
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,890
Then they are thieves.

708
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,850
Hey!

709
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,390
-Wait.
-Come on.

710
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,140
You're wrong.

711
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,310
They recently moved here
from the city to farm.

712
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,820
-Remember my cornfield?
-Yes.

713
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,280
They bought it.

714
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,320
They're growing lettuce with Sam-sik now.

715
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,570
-Is that so?
-Yes.

716
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,030
Then come here
and have some makgeolli with us.

717
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,830
-You won't be driving.
-Come.

718
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,830
I'm afraid we need to leave.

719
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,290
We need to water the lettuce.

720
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,210
Right. We should.

721
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,420
-Excuse us.
-Bye.

722
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,340
-They're so hardworking.
-Wait.

723
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,300
Make sure you let the water run first.

724
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,430
The water in the hose is lukewarm,
so it'll kill the lettuce.

725
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,510
-How cute.
-Lion, come here.

726
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,930
Lion, come here.

727
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,390
Lion.

728
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,930
Sit down, Lion.

729
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,190
Over here.

730
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,650
Now I can play soccer

731
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,860
and hopscotch with you.

732
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,030
Right, Kang-ho?

733
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,280
Don't call him like that.

734
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,070
He's all grown up now.

735
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,240
Right, Kang-ho oppa?

736
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,410
It's okay. We're friends.

737
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,040
You're an adult so we need to
treat you like one, okay?

738
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,540
Then do we need to use honorifics too?

739
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,710
All right. I got it.

740
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,760
I actually always thought you should.

741
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,220
Is it tasty, Lion?

742
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,220
They look like one happy family.

743
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,310
Goodness, I'm sorry.

744
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,480
I can wrap up here.

745
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,820
You should go home with your kids.

746
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,820
Ms. Jin.

747
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,070
I stayed behind
because I had something to ask you.

748
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,450
Do you remember

749
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,870
when we met by the pond
when it was raining?

750
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,450
Kang-ho said something…

751
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,080
I won't do it again.

752
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,670
Never again.

753
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,970
Okay.

754
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,840
Then I won't worry anymore.

755
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,640
Thanks.

756
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,430
Likewise.

757
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,390
-"I love you"
-"I love you"

758
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,270
-Is such
-Is such

759
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,650
-A great thing to say
-A great thing to say

760
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:18,030
-I really like
-I really like

761
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,740
-These three words
-These three words

762
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:27,000
-I love you
-I love you

763
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,120
-I love you.
-I love you, Mom and Dad.

764
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,380
I'm sorry about getting mad earlier.

765
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,710
I guess Dad must've been very busy

766
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,470
if he had to leave without saying goodbye.

767
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,220
I'm sure he'll come
to our elementary entrance ceremony.

768
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,600
I can teach Park Jun-seo a lesson then.

769
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,980
But tell Dad to look good that day.

770
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,610
I don't know
if he was dressed the way Americans do,

771
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,570
but he looked quite shabby,
and I didn't like it.

772
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,700
I agree. Kang-ho looked great today.

773
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,370
He was tall and strong.

774
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,580
What if we pretend that
Kang-ho is our dad?

775
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,540
-No!
-No.

776
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,710
Goodness. All right.

777
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,000
You guys didn't have to get all worked up.

778
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,670
You. I told you
not to treat him like a friend.

779
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,090
-Treat him like an adult!
-Mom!

780
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,130
-Stop it.
-Hello.

781
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,640
My babies.

782
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,560
It's Mr. Sam-sik.

783
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,560
Why do you call me "Mr. Sam-sik"
and Kang-ho "oppa"?

784
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,650
Come here.

785
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,030
What are you doing? Put me down.

786
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,280
I'm scared of heights.

787
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,150
-Don't do that!
-All of a sudden?

788
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,870
You liked it when Kang-ho lifted you up.

789
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:46,990
Baby.

790
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,620
Answer me, will you?

791
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,460
You reek of alcohol.

792
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,210
That's enough. Go inside and wash up.

793
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,630
-Let's go!
-No.

794
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,130
My babies!

795
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,840
Goodness. You should go home
and sleep if you're drunk.

796
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,420
You're embarrassing yourself.

797
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,840
Go home.

798
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:04,760
Mi-joo.

799
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,640
What is it?

800
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,810
I'm going to be

801
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,230
straightforward with you.

802
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,560
Okay.

803
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,190
Do you like Kang-ho?

804
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,480
What?

805
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,110
Does seeing him walk

806
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,940
stir up your emotions?

807
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,950
Is that why you didn't go to work today

808
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,070
and stayed behind
and helped them clean up?

809
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,700
Just go home.

810
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,290
Why can't you say you don't?

811
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,920
I don't. I don't like him.

812
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,880
Happy?

813
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,090
If that's true,

814
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,340
let's get married.

815
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,220
Let's live a happy life

816
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,390
and raise the kids together.

817
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,350
Let's do that.

818
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,190
They need a dad.

819
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,020
I promise to make you guys happy.

820
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,280
Should we?

821
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,740
What? What did you say?

822
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,700
Are you serious?

823
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,660
-You'll marry me?
-Yes.

824
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,540
Let's do it.

825
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,330
But you know I'm broke, right?

826
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,960
I have a ton of debt too.

827
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,800
A creditor came by today as well.

828
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,630
We can struggle together every single day

829
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,260
to pay off our debts.

830
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,640
We'll get chased around pathetically.

831
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,810
But amid all that,
let's live happily together.

832
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,640
Sure.

833
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,230
"Stir up my emotions"? "Get married"?

834
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,150
I work like a dog every day
to pay off my debt bit by bit.

835
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,530
It's tough to make ends meet
while taking care of my family.

836
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,950
I can't afford to have
my head in the clouds like you.

837
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,160
Bye.

838
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,380
Is the debt the only issue then?

839
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,670
Mi-joo, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

840
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,680
I will be back.

841
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,310
This used to be your room.

842
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,770
You'll be sleeping here from now on.

843
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,980
But I don't want to be alone.

844
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,060
No.

845
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,400
You need to learn to be independent.

846
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,980
That's how you become an adult.

847
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,030
I'll teach you one step at a time. Okay?

848
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,160
Okay.

849
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,410
Who is this?

850
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,290
Hello?

851
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,510
Excuse me.

852
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,890
I'm Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho's…

853
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,940
Goodness, you're here. Please come in.

854
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,270
This way.

855
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,480
-Have this.
-Thank you.

856
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,490
On the day
you dropped off the side dishes,

857
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,700
Prosecutor Choi came by late at night.

858
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,670
If my mother comes by

859
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,500
to pick up my belongings
when I'm not here,

860
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,880
please give her this.

861
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,630
TO MY MOTHER

862
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,470
Are you moving?

863
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,260
No.

864
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,390
But I might have to.

865
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:45,560
Please give it to her and nobody else.

866
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,820
Please.

867
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,940
But I was off duty that day,

868
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,320
so I didn't even know that he had moved.

869
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,030
Fortunately, you gave me
your number last time,

870
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,740
so I'm finally giving it to you.

871
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,580
Sorry it's so late.

872
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,420
To my mother whom I miss dearly.

873
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,250
Are you healthy and well?

874
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,670
I got the side dishes
that you left at the security office.

875
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,800
I had always missed
your home-cooked meals.

876
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,180
I had a lovely dinner
for the first time in a long time.

877
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,650
I'm sorry that my work keeps me

878
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,070
from calling or visiting you often.

879
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,570
But Mother,

880
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,820
I want you to know this.

881
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,950
We may be apart,

882
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,620
but I still live

883
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,660
in the memories
I shared with you and Father.

884
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,210
I'll see you next week on your birthday.

885
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,300
"September 7.
From your beloved son, Kang-ho."

886
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,180
"Kang-ho"?

887
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,680
Did I write this?

888
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,760
It's just so odd.

889
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:06,190
You've never spoken to me
in this manner before.

890
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,520
Why did you leave this
with the security guard?

891
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,400
How did you know
I'd be packing your stuff without you?

892
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,530
Tell me.

893
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,580
Did you know you'd end up this way?

894
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,420
Were you trying
to tell me something with this letter?

895
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,540
You were, right?

896
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,380
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

897
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,720
And then…

898
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,180
Again.

899
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,720
Again.

900
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,220
Again.

901
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,390
INVESTIGATION OFFICER

902
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,690
Hello?

903
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,560
It's me, ma'am. You called.

904
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,770
I was attending a trial earlier.

905
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,070
I see. One minute.

906
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,200
Fill it out, and when they call number 25,

907
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,700
go hand them the bankbook and the seal.

908
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,160
What's the password again?

909
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,700
The password is

910
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,210
zero, nine--

911
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,500
Zero, nine, zero, seven. My birthday.

912
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,920
That's right.

913
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,090
I'm sorry.

914
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,170
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo?

915
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,550
Do you mean

916
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,470
the assemblyman
who's running for president?

917
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,980
The former prosecutor?

918
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,190
Correct.

919
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:32,690
Prosecutor Choi was engaged
to his daughter.

920
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,520
You didn't know?

921
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,650
Goodness.

922
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,990
How could this be?

923
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,320
That's a relief.

924
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,080
I've been acquainted with Assembly Oh.

925
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,580
Could you give me his number please?

926
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,540
Sorry?

927
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,120
His daughter's number
would be even better.

928
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,960
I have a few things to check about my son.

929
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,220
And I think she'd know best

930
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,680
since they were engaged.

931
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,680
Gosh.

932
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Ma'am.

933
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,680
There's no way for me
to know their numbers.

934
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,890
And she's getting married soon.

935
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,600
I think it'd be best
if you didn't call them.

936
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,270
Here comes the bride.

937
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,860
Where's the groom?

938
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,320
He's taking a call outside.

939
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,040
Where's the groom?

940
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,710
He's taking a call inside.

941
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,550
Is he serious?

942
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,050
He's in the room next door.

943
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,720
Make sure the baby is dressed warmly.
It's pretty windy near the sea.

944
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,690
I'll pick you up at 8 p.m.

945
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,230
Kang-ho.

946
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,400
What baby?

947
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,150
It's nothing.

948
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,110
Are you done?

949
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,280
I was going to surprise you
with a grand appearance.

950
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,160
Is the other one better?
Or is something fancier better?

951
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,870
You already look pretty enough.

952
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,710
Whatever.

953
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,330
You do. Let's go.

954
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,130
Kang-ho.

955
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,170
We're visiting your mother tomorrow.
Do you really have to go out tonight?

956
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,430
It's work-related. I won't be long.

957
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,260
You're such a workaholic.

958
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,180
Let's stop by the department store.

959
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,690
We need to make a move first.

960
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,270
I heard about your daughter's wedding.

961
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,440
You'll become in-laws with Dosang Group.

962
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,070
Yes, that's right.

963
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,110
What can I do? Our children are in love.

964
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,240
I understand.

965
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,740
Parents are always bound
to give in to their children.

966
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,790
Though there are parents who kill them.

967
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:52,830
Mr. Song!

968
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,000
Gosh, you startled me.

969
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,380
It's about time you dropped it.

970
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,920
It's all in the past.

971
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,250
I believe

972
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,300
my men found something in Kang-ho's house.

973
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,350
Do you mean
the original copy of the DNA test result?

974
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,940
As you said, it's just a piece of paper.

975
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,360
What if I claim that you colluded
with Bareun Hanguk Party

976
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,360
and fabricated it to take me down?

977
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,570
Then how will you prove its authenticity?

978
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,070
So why did you have to take it so far

979
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,540
as to kill the poor woman and her child?

980
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,750
What did you say?

981
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,330
I hope we never see each other again.

982
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,540
Goodbye then.

983
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,630
Right.

984
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,510
I expected nothing less from him.

985
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,440
How did it go?

986
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,940
We finally located the file.

987
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,700
In two days,

988
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,320
Oh Tae-soo will become in-laws
with Dosang Group.

989
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,490
And you just managed to locate it?

990
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,790
-Are you kidding me right--
-Choi Kang-ho

991
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:19,210
is walking again.

992
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,210
What do you mean?

993
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,640
See? What did I tell you?

994
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,310
I told you he'd walk again.

995
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,770
Where should you record
the pig feed that you purchased?

996
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,980
Pig feed.

997
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,520
Pig feed…

998
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,320
Here. "Pig Feed Management."

999
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,280
Good.

1000
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,320
What about their medicine and injections?

1001
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,820
Medicine

1002
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,410
and injections…

1003
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,870
Here.

1004
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,040
Well done.

1005
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,910
You're so smart.

1006
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,210
You need to check
and record them every day, okay?

1007
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,920
Okay.

1008
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,590
What am I learning tomorrow?

1009
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,630
Tomorrow?

1010
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,050
COPIED DOCUMENTS

1011
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,140
-Are these all mine?
-Yes, they're all yours.

1012
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,890
Mom, this too?

1013
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,730
Yes.

1014
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,890
Awesome.

1015
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,150
I'm going to show it
to Seo-jin and Ye-jin.

1016
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:25,320
Found it.

1017
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,320
Kang-ho oppa!

1018
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,530
Hello, you cuties.

1019
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,990
You must be here
to hang out with Uncle Kang-ho.

1020
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,000
But we need to go into town.

1021
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,370
It's okay.

1022
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,710
Ye-jin only came to congratulate him
on walking again.

1023
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,170
She brought a flower.

1024
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,510
Go on.

1025
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:54,180
They said yellow was your lucky color.

1026
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,680
Thanks, Ye-jin. It's so pretty.

1027
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,980
But of course, you're prettier.

1028
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,410
We'll be back.

1029
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,590
I'm going to beat up anyone
who tells me to wash my hands.

1030
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,460
Did you see how we were
wearing matching colors?

1031
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,920
This is fate.

1032
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,050
I'm going to marry him.

1033
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,850
One, two, three.

1034
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,060
Okay, it's all done.

1035
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,480
Please wait in the waiting room
while it gets printed.

1036
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,650
-Okay.
-Okay.

1037
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:56,070
Excuse me, but could I take one alone?

1038
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,620
Sure. Please sit in the middle.

1039
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,200
Is it for your passport or ID?

1040
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,960
I need a photo much bigger than those.

1041
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,920
Those who come to pay
their condolences will see it,

1042
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,670
so please make sure to take it well.

1043
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,260
"Condolences"?

1044
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,220
Yes.

1045
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,590
Okay, ma'am.

1046
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,510
One minute please.

1047
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,360
All right. Let's try it again.

1048
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,990
Mom.

1049
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,580
Why are we doing this?

1050
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,210
Do it.

1051
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,830
Now.

1052
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,130
Goodness.

1053
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,090
Go on.

1054
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,590
I don't want to. I'm scared.

1055
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,770
There's nothing to be scared about.

1056
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,640
Kang-ho.

1057
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:10,770
I'm just teaching you
things you don't know.

1058
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,360
Just like teaching you how to cook
and what to do at the bank.

1059
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,990
I'm teaching you things that
you'll need to know in life.

1060
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,860
When will I need to do this?

1061
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,700
Later.

1062
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,910
Much later.

1063
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,870
So let's try it.

1064
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,880
Goodness.

1065
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,630
Goodness.

1066
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,970
Goodness.

1067
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:48,730
Goodness.

1068
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,860
Goodness.

1069
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,880
What did I tell you to do?

1070
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,150
You need to get up too.

1071
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,120
You must be heartbroken.

1072
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,130
You must be heartbroken.

1073
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,130
-Mom.
-You must be heartbroken.

1074
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,430
Thank you for coming here
and offering your condolences.

1075
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,230
Did she have an illness?

1076
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,270
"She had cancer."

1077
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,650
She had cancer.

1078
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,250
Well done, my son.

1079
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,840
-Done.
-Done.

1080
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:50,600
Let's put him in there too.

1081
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,270
What? Who?

1082
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,890
Dad.

1083
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,480
Dad?

1084
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Yes.

1085
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,940
Just like that photo,
let's add him to the new photo too.

1086
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,740
Then we'll be together.

1087
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,910
Sure, let's do that.

1088
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,830
But I still live

1089
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:17,790
in the memories
I shared with you and Father.

1090
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,560
"In the memories."

1091
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,270
Inside?

1092
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:42,980
Mom, what's wrong?

1093
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:11,550
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1094
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,160
I want to find out the reason why

1095
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,910
I had to attend law school.

1096
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,830
Beg him, or you'll go to jail!

1097
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,540
Once you study hard
and become a prosecutor,

1098
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,000
no one will be able to
look down on you or bully you.

1099
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,590
That's true power.

1100
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:49,840
You want me to become a cowardly snob
who'd do anything to get my way.
