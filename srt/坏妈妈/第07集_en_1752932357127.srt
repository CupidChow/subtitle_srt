00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,230
Pull yourself together.

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,480
You need to be strong.

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,530
Get up.

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,400
You're a mom.

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,910
Your piglets are all looking for you.

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,540
You need to get up, feed them,
and look after them.

8
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,010
So is Young-soon doing better?

9
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,470
You didn't have to…

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,720
get in my way.

11
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,560
These darn flies.

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,900
She worked through the night
to deliver those piglets.

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,400
It's fortunate that
someone was there to help out.

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,320
It would've been really tough.

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,360
By the way, who were they
and what were they doing at the pig farm?

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,370
They came to buy your field.

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,700
What?

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,740
They bought our cornfield?

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,790
SIGNED BY PARK SUNG-AE

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,880
Goodness.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,090
You're paying for it with cash?

22
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,140
Oh, my.

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,850
My goodness!

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,310
Something smells good.

25
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,520
Hi, Sam-sik.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
-Hello.
-Hey.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,270
Who are they?

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,110
These men?

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,400
Well, they are…

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,190
You know, they're here

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,240
because they're moving

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,660
to our village soon.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,990
They came to order rice cakes
to present as gifts.

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,910
I see.

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,000
How many mals would you like?

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,830
Well, I'm not sure.

37
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,670
About three maris will do.

38
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,300
Three "maris"?

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Oh, right.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,050
-There are more people than that.
-Right?

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,350
-Exactly.
-Then I'll go big.

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,470
Thirty maris will do.

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,020
-Goodness.
-Thirty…

44
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,770
-Well, that's quite a lot of rice cakes.
-What is this?

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,690
Something seems odd.

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,620
Are you sure you came for rice cake?

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,530
Yes, of course.

48
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,080
-Let's make it three.
-Okay.

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
By the way,

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,370
your seated height
seems taller than normal today.

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,670
-What?
-What do you mean?

52
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,500
Hey, I heard we sold our cornfield!

53
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,300
What?

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,640
Damn it, you…

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,640

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,320
What a pretty face you have

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,660
It's just like an apple

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,990
Your eyes shine

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,530
Your nose shines

60
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,580
And this knife shines too

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Grab him.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,330
Come here.

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,590
You're eating so well.

64
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,840
-If you choose to, surgery is possible.
-Paw.

65
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,800
-However, with the aggressive metastases,
-Paw. Good job.

66
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,680
-it may not be very effective.
-Good job.

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,470
Great job.

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,520
You'll want to get your affairs in order.

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,620
That's hot!

70
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,420
Mom, are you okay?

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,750
Yes.

72
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
I'm fine.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm all right.

74
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,760
You must be hungry.

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,310
It's almost ready. Just a moment.

76
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,640

When you're hungry…

83
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,930
I…

84
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,060
I can't die.

85
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,650
You wish to leave the farm to your son?

86
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,360
And if anything happens to me,

87
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,530
he'll have to make a living by himself.

88
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,790
You don't need to
worry about that already.

89
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,790
You never know what will happen in life.

90
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,500
But as you know,

91
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,710
my son isn't well,
so I wonder if he'll manage.

92
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,420
In that case,

93
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,220
you should hire
a trustworthy farm manager.

94
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,560
And I can help him
with medicines and vaccinations,

95
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,430
so don't worry about that.

96
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,770
Thank you so much.

97
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,640
-Thank you.
-Goodness.

98
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm counting on you.

99
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,820
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

100
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,440
I haven't even retired yet.

101
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,400
My mom is acting weird.

102
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,030
All moms are weird.

103
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,370
They're always getting angry.

104
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,490
That's because you bought

105
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,870
200,000 won worth of items
for a game on her phone.

106
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,500
Kids can sometimes make mistakes.

107
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,460
What about Ms. Jin?

108
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,710
How is she weird?

109
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,930
Hey! How is she weird?

110
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,600
Don't you hear me?

111
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,970
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,850
Goodness.

113
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,270
You can't do this.

114
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,360
Mi-joo doesn't like us hanging out.

115
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,230
How is this hanging out?

116
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,780
We just met by chance.

117
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,990
Isn't that right?

118
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,910
It happens pretty often
in a tiny village like this one.

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,370
But…

120
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,410
Don't worry.

121
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,710
Mom went into town.

122
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,830
Town?

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,750
When? Did she take her wallet?

124
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,290
That's not what's important.

125
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,550
So how is Ms. Jin weird?

126
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,340
She doesn't talk as much.

127
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,470
She doesn't talk as much?

128
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,890
Shouldn't you be glad then?
She won't nag at you as much.

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,940
She's low on energy
and doesn't smile anymore.

130
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,440
Kang-ho!

131
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,690
Kang-ho!

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,240
Kang-ho, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,650
Hi, Ye-jin and Seo-jin. You're here too.

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,200
What's this?

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,740
Your new toy?

136
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,790
Good for you. It must be from your mom.

137
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,450
Is your grandma well too?
Please say hi to her for me.

138
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,420
Uncle Kang-ho has an appointment.
We'll be going now.

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,630
All right, let's go!

140
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,800
Didn't he say she's not talking as much?

141
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,220
You're back.

142
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,560
You said you'd return.

143
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,600
I didn't sell these just in case.

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,850
I'm actually looking for boots today.

145
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,230
Oh, not those?

146
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,940
These are a bit short.

147
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,280
Is there anything higher?

148
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,440
I have ones that go to the waist.
One second.

149
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,150
They don't need to be that high.

150
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,620
WOMEN'S SHOES 15,000 WON
DRESS SHOES 15,000 WON

151
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,540
It's Tiger.

152
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,120
Tiger.

153
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,870
Tiger!

154
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,250
Tiger.

155
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,670
Uri!

156
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,050
Excuse me.

157
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,680
Isn't this Tiger?

158
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,350
What?

159
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,390
Tiger?

160
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,060
It looked just like Tiger,
so I thought it was him.

161
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,400
-Hi.
-What's with him?

162
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,070
Goodness, it's all right.

163
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,660
Where did he go?

164
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,450
Kang-ho…

165
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,950
Kang-ho.

166
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,410
Kang-ho!

167
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
-Not bad, right?
-Are you selling it?

168
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,830
I barely managed to get it.

169
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,500
This was the last pack.

170
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,920
It's in here.

171
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,180
No, I put it in here.

172
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,100
There it is.

173
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,810
You punks.

174
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,770
What the hell?

175
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,310
You're too young to smoke.

176
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,270
Here.

177
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,440
Don't smoke, okay?

178
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,320
Hey, wait.

179
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,200
I gave you 50,000 won.

180
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,370
You gave me 5,000 won.

181
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,960
That's bullshit.
I definitely gave you 50,000 won.

182
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
That's bullshit.

183
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,130
Give him back his money, you idiot.

184
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,130
-Seriously.
-Darn it.

185
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm not an idiot.

186
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,840
I just went back to my childhood.

187
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,510
This is a chance given from above.

188
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,010
That's one hell of a stupid chance.

189
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,850
You're not going to give me my money?

190
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,140
You leave us no choice then.

191
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,640
-Search him.
-No, stop it.

192
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,190
-Pull them down.
-Come on.

193
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,190
You're dead.

194
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,520
I'm telling my mom.

195
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,020
Wait, is that a gift?

196
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,400
Give it to me.

197
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,030
It's not a gift. It's a phone, idiot.

198
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,820
I know that, idiot.

199
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,160
-You're the idiot, idiot.
-Give it to me, you…

200
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,490
You damned bastards!

201
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,450
-What the…
-Darn it.

202
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,710
Hey, run!

203
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,710
You…

204
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,330
-Run!
-Stop right there!

205
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,090
You son of a bitch!

206
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,340
You son of a bitch!

207
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,840
Repeat after me!

208
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,220
You son of a bitch.

209
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,810
You son of a bitch.

210
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,970
Louder!

211
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,890
You son of a bitch!

212
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,890
That's it.

213
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,060
Good.

214
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,320
If anyone calls you an idiot or a cripple,

215
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,150
tell them, "You son of a bitch!" Got it?

216
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,990
-But I'm not allowed to--
-You are!

217
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,420
Here.

218
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,590
From now on, these are all yours.

219
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,210
Mine?

220
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,630
These are all very important,

221
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,050
so don't show them to anyone, okay?

222
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
"Kang-ho, let's exchange this for that."

223
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,600
"Kang-ho, stamp your seal here."

224
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,350
"Kang-ho, can you stand surety for me?"

225
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,560
"Kang-ho, let me borrow your house deed."

226
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,770
What do you say then?

227
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,400
-What should you say?
-You son of a bitch!

228
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,150
Good.

229
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,030
Very good.

230
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,240
Also,

231
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,200
this is a bank account
your dad set up for you

232
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,960
and I've been saving up
to give to you when you get married.

233
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,750
This is very important,

234
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,540
so I'll hide it here.

235
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,210
Don't tell or show anybody, okay?

236
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,130
Okay.

237
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,800
Like my lunch money.

238
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,260
What?

239
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,550
You hid it in my bag.

240
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,010
"Don't lose your lunch money."

241
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,390
This is your lunch money.

242
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,560
You could lose it or get it stolen,

243
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,150
so keep it safe
until you give it to your teacher.

244
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,150
Okay.

245
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,490
Yes, you're right.

246
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,910
I hid it in the bottom of your bag, right?

247
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,950
Yes.

248
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,290
What a smart boy.

249
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,370
Yes.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
You're doing well.

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,380
You can slowly regain your memory
and learn one thing at a time.

252
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,550
-Okay?
-Okay.

253
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,470
You must be hungry.

254
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,140
Let's go eat.

255
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Okay.

256
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,980
Aren't we going to eat?

257
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,270
We will.

258
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,020
But if we want to eat, we need rice.

259
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,320
To buy rice, we need money.
And for money, we raise pigs.

260
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,240
And now, I'll teach you how to do that.

261
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,740
Twice a day, morning and night.

262
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,500
When you're hungry,

263
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,790
come to the farm before you eat

264
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,340
and check if the pigs are eating well.

265
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,090
If the feed gets wet

266
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,760
or freezes in cold weather,

267
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,090
it clumps and clogs the feed tube.

268
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,470
When that happens,

269
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,470
tap here a few times.

270
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,310
Bang, bang, bang.

271
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,850
You must always keep it
neat and disinfected

272
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,940
so our pigs don't get sick, okay?

273
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,900
Make sure

274
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,740
the pigs are happy at our farm.

275
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,030
Yes, Happy Farm.

276
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,410
You can take pig manure

277
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,370
and use it as fertilizer
for the potato field.

278
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,790
Okay.

279
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,170
First, spread the manure over the field,

280
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,920
then cover it with plastic
to block weeds from growing.

281
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,880
And then,

282
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,840
make holes in the plastic
to plant seed potatoes.

283
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,760
Like this.

284
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,030
Nice shot.

285
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,370
Choi Kang-ho! Focus.

286
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,380
When the humidity reads over 60,
it means it's too humid.

287
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
Use this app

288
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,220
to turn the fans on.

289
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,800
If the pigs

290
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,310
develop a cough, get diarrhea,

291
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,230
or collapse for no reason…

292
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,310
"Hello, I'm calling
from Happy Farm in Jou-ri."

293
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,860
"My pigs are coughing or having diarrhea,

294
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,360
so please come quickly."

295
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,400
But if the vet can't come because
of an outbreak of infectious disease?

296
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,200
Then you need to buy
the medicine yourself and inject them.

297
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,290
If you don't, the contagion will spread.

298
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,420
I don't want to. Shots are scary.

299
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,250
-I can't do this.
-No.

300
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,710
It's easy.

301
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,960
Just stab it like this.

302
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,050
Mom, you're the best. That's so cool.

303
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,560
When mother pigs have piglets,

304
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,350
she feeds them and licks them.

305
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,900
She teaches them everything,
where to eat and poop,

306
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,610
how to scratch an itch,

307
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,570
and how to grunt when they're angry.

308
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,700
Then after 25 nights, you wean them.

309
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,410
I'd like the newly released
knit gel polishes,

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,420
a set of semicircular pearls in all sizes,

311
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,210
and a box of nail tinctures.

312
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,500
And ten bottles of
moisturizing cream as well.

313
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,670
Yes.

314
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,340
Tomorrow's the grand opening
so I need them by 9 a.m.

315
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,550
Yes, okay. That would be great.

316
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,140
Thank you. Bye.

317
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,400
The charms came off.

318
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,440
You're going to open a nail salon
in the agricultural chemicals shop?

319
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,440
Yes.

320
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,900
The rent is cheap,

321
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,610
and there's lots of foot traffic
so I think it'll be great.

322
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,280
That's not a bad idea.

323
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,080
People may come to buy pesticides
to take their own life,

324
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,040
then get their nails done and feel better.

325
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,920
What if they come to get their nails done

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,670
and see pesticides
and want to take their own life?

327
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,970
I was just joking. Don't mind me.

328
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,890
A nail salon in a shop
that sells agricultural chemicals.

329
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,180
That's kind of novel.

330
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,900
So from now on,

331
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,690
don't come here
and ask her to do this for free.

332
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,110
Go to her nail salon.

333
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,700
Where's Sung-ae?

334
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,700
She left in a hurry to go to the bank.

335
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,830
The bank?

336
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,240
Wait.

337
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,710
Is she borrowing money
to settle Sam-sik's trouble again?

338
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,340
It's time for us to say goodbye

339
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,130
Until we meet again

340
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,840
Get 100 million won ready.

341
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,010
If you fail to do that,

342
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,260
you will end up…

343
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,560
donating your organs…

344
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,980
WAIVER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

345
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,520
…to many who are about to die.

346
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,190
Okay?

347
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,910
MI-JOO

348
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,750
Hello…

349
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,460
honey?

350
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,380
Where are you?

351
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,210
What do you mean, where am I?

352
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,130
I'm obviously out in the Pacific.

353
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,180
Right?

354
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,180
You haven't returned
and gotten in trouble, have you?

355
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,850
Don't say that to someone
who's turned over a fresh leaf

356
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,810
and working hard catching fish.

357
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,020
Hey, Mr. Kim!

358
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,360
Can you pull on the nets?

359
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,070
I'm practically made for this job.

360
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,400
I even caught a mermaid yesterday.

361
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,820
Where are you?

362
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,830
You aren't drinking alone
after getting fired, right?

363
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,200
Fired?

364
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,500
I'm opening up my own nail salon.

365
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,750
I finished decorating the place today.

366
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,080
Really?

367
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,250
I knew it, Mi-joo.

368
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,170
You got back on your feet
after that tough ordeal.

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,340
I felt really bad
when you said you wanted to give up

370
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,600
and go back to our hometown.

371
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,230
You're too talented
to lurk in the countryside.

372
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,310
You should do nails for rich ladies in…

373
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,230
Hello?

374
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,490
Let me call you back.

375
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,860
Okay, sure.

376
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,450
What was that?

377
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,910
Lee Mi-joo?

378
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,080
Wait.

379
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,540
Sam-sik!

380
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,380
Hey, Bang Sam-sik!

381
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Is that you?

382
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,130
When did you get back?

383
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,680
When did you come back?

384
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,060
You said you'd surprise me
when we met again,

385
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,720
and you were right.

386
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,270
Did you get beaten up
by the mermaid you caught?

387
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,770
You see, out there in the Pacific,

388
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,940
there's a world of men that
you don't know about.

389
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,780
-Jeez.
-What do you know

390
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,990
About a man's heart?

391
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,410
-What's with you?
-Sorry.

392
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,750
You must be insane.

393
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,630
What about you? You're doing nails
for country ladies, not rich ladies?

394
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,500
What do you know

395
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,460
About a woman's heart?

396
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,260
What are you doing?

397
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Right.

398
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,930
Since we both ended up here,

399
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,270
let's try not to judge each other.

400
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,770
Who are we to criticize one another?

401
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,860
We both messed up.

402
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,450
But still, we're better off than Kang-ho.

403
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,950
He used to be so haughty
like he owned the world.

404
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,530
Did you see? He became an idiot.

405
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,910
-Hey!
-Goodness, you startled me.

406
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,370
How could you say such a thing about
someone who's unwell?

407
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,540
The anger is bringing out your dialect.

408
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,300
That's my Mi-joo.
You're so cute, as always.

409
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,170
Gosh, you idiot.

410
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,880
All right.

411
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,470
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,100
You didn't have to get so worked up.

413
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,680
Hold on.

414
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,770
Do you still like Kang-ho?

415
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,440
-You're insane.
-Do you?

416
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,820
Gosh, move!

417
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,360
You're suddenly dodging my question.

418
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,360
You do.

419
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,950
You still do.

420
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,830
People avoid poop

421
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,580
not because it's dirty

422
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,620
but because it's scary.

423
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,800
You're scared of poop?

424
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,090
Mi-joo, why?

425
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,470
Why are you scared of it?

426
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,520
Seo-jin, what's wrong?

427
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,230
What is it? Why are you crying?

428
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,730
Did you hit him again?

429
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,820
-Come here.
-I didn't hit him.

430
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,400
He's crying because he doesn't want to
go to the public bath.

431
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,450
-What?
-Mom.

432
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,410
Do I have to go to the public bath?

433
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,790
I really hate going to the women's bath

434
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,170
with Grandma and Ye-jin.

435
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,880
Last week, he ran into Yun-ji and Da-hyeon
from kindergarten.

436
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,260
Stop crying! It's not your fault.

437
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,680
You're allowed in the women's bath
until you turn four years old.

438
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,220
Mom.

439
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,560
-Yes?
-I want to go to the men's bath

440
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,810
with my dad like other boys.

441
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,230
Can you tell him to come back?

442
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,070
Can you?

443
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,360
Please.

444
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,910
Seo-jin, come here. Stop crying.

445
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,450
There, there. Is that why you're upset?

446
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,690
Mom.

447
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,980
Mom.

448
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,700
Mom, let's go.

449
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,110
What?

450
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,780
-Where?
-I'm hungry.

451
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,620
When I'm hungry,

452
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
I should feed the pigs
before I eat, right?

453
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,620
Yes.

454
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,250
-I'll be outside.
-Okay.

455
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,630
Ultimately, it's better for us.

456
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,840
Now that we own that cornfield,
we won't look out of place here.

457
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,100
The problem is our house.

458
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,140
Do you really think

459
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,640
our problem is getting a house?

460
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,100
Oh, right.

461
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,650
Come to your senses!

462
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,990
If we don't find anything
by the end of the election,

463
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,450
we're both doomed.

464
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,450
Yes, sir.

465
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,830
It's not in the farm.

466
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,540
It must be somewhere in her house.

467
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,170
Let's first find out if anybody is inside.

468
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay.

469
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,000
Hey.

470
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,220
A couple of guys who don't even know
the measurement unit for rice

471
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,890
suddenly turn up at a country village

472
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,150
and pay twice the price for land,
in cash, to start farming.

473
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,650
There are only two reasons for that.

474
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,110
One, because you're severely ill.

475
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,490
Two, because you're mentally ill.

476
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,490
Or you could be running away from trouble
or planning to cause trouble.

477
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,620
Excuse me.

478
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,950
You said there are only two reasons,
but you listed four.

479
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,620
Right.

480
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,750
There must be a misunderstanding.

481
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,460
We just want to farm, that's all.

482
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,920
Okay then. Let's do this.

483
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,050
I'll help you find a house,

484
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,670
and provide consulting services

485
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,140
from choosing crops
to learning farming techniques.

486
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,050
-No, you don't have to--
-All right.

487
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,270
In that case, why don't we discuss this

488
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,180
over a glass of makgeolli?

489
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,850
There's a brewery nearby
that's been around for 35 years,

490
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,110
and it's amazing.

491
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,060
Really?

492
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,570
You must like makgeolli.

493
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,280
-Yes.
-Let's go.

494
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,740
-Wait, sir. Hey!
-It's really good.

495
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,830
Hey.

496
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,040
Let's say one mother pig
costs 300,000 won.

497
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,040
Okay.

498
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,460
But a buyer comes and says,

499
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,120
"Goodness, sir."

500
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,590
"Only summer pigs cost that much."

501
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,710
"There's an increase in supply now,
so the price has dropped a lot."

502
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,420
"I'll give you 250,000 won."

503
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,630
What should you do?

504
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,180
Hey, you thief! I'm not selling it to you!

505
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,180
Yes, good job.

506
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,560
-Next, the sawdust distributor.
-Okay.

507
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,350
The sawdust distributor

508
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,980
wants 220 won per kilogram
when it used to be 190 won per kilogram.

509
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,690
Then he says, "This was made
with red pine tree from Russia,

510
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,360
so it's much better quality."

511
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,200
"If you make compost out of this
and use it to grow potatoes,

512
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,910
they'll grow as big as watermelons."

513
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,120
Then what should you do?

514
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,670
A shameless beast like you must leave!

515
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,090
My goodness.

516
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,510
Where did you learn such words?

517
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,090
Over there.

518
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,430
HAPPY FARM MUST BE DEMOLISHED!
CAN'T STAND THE SMELL

519
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,940
PIG FECES IN OUR CLEAN JOU-RI
PIG FARM OUT!

520
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,750
-Andrea.
-Yes?

521
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,260
Please put Kang-ho in working clothes.

522
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,420
Sure.

523
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,430
I will manipulate your movements now.

524
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,640
You must put up with the inconvenience.

525
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,270
What's wrong?

526
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,190
Why are you barking so much?

527
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,230
Is there a rat?

528
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
What are you doing here

529
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,450
like a rat?

530
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,160
The people in this village
won't believe a word I say.

531
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,330
I took a video of wastewater leaking out

532
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,040
from the back.

533
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,880
That's not wastewater.

534
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,630
It's just water
dripping from the water tank.

535
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,760
As if.

536
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,050
You did this too, didn't you?

537
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,380
Yes, I did it. So what?

538
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,640
I presented the idea to the villagers
to close down this place.

539
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,730
Everyone agreed with me,
but no one showed up.

540
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,890
They're the worst!

541
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,730
Damn it.

542
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,480
Do you want to die?

543
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,570
Do I want to die?

544
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,400
Do I want to die?

545
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,870
Nobody in this world
wants to die, you bastard!

546
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,290
Why should I die?

547
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,910
Why should I die?

548
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Why?

549
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,290
-Why should I die?
-Mom!

550
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,670
-Let go!
-No, Ms. Jin!

551
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,880
-Ms. Jin!
-Hey!

552
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,300
-This behavior is improper.
-Mom.

553
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,710
-Stay away!
-You.

554
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,720
Listen carefully.

555
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,680
This farm

556
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,970
cost my husband his life.

557
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,810
No matter how much you try
to shut it down,

558
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,520
I'll never give it up.

559
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,610
If I die, my son will run it.

560
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,940
Then his son and grandson!

561
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,400
It's going to get passed on
through generations.

562
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,110
If you do something like this again,

563
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,660
then I'll kill you
no matter the consequences. Got it?

564
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,330
Darn it!

565
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,250
Ms. Jin!

566
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,750
Ms. Jin!

567
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,500
Ms. Jin!

568
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,960
This is bad.

569
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,710
We're in trouble!

570
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,920
EMERGENCY QUARANTINE
ACCESS CONTROL

571
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,130
EMERGENCY QUARANTINE
DO NOT ENTER

572
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,720
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

573
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,510
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

574
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,260
-Goodness.
-How can this happen?

575
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
What is all this?

576
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,680
PREVENTIVE CULLING OF POTENTIAL
LIVESTOCK WITH FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE

577
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,480
What on earth is happening?

578
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,100
Foot-and-mouth disease?

579
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,820
I heard Mr. Kim's goat farm
had an outbreak.

580
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,990
Why are the civil servants
headed to the pig farm?

581
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,450
If foot-and-mouth disease breaks out,
cows and pigs within a 3km radius

582
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,830
must be culled by law.

583
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,830
What?

584
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,710
Then Young-soon's pigs will be culled
even though they aren't sick?

585
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,500
That's the law.

586
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,460
Thankfully, Tiger isn't affected.

587
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,260
Damn it!

588
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,420
Who cares about the damn dog right now?

589
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,050
Then…

590
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,800
What will happen to that family?

591
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,640
For now,

592
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,560
they have to shut down the farm.

593
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,810
Those damn goats have been going around
doing all kinds of goat things

594
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
all around the village,

595
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,480
and they finally ended up causing trouble.

596
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,360
Goodness.

597
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,780
I feel so bad for Young-soon.

598
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,460
Sir, please don't.
Please don't kill our pigs!

599
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,080
Mom, do something.

600
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,250
Go stop them!

601
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,340
Andrea, please.

602
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,510
Andrea, do something.

603
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,020
Leave her alone!

604
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,310
She's feeding her piglets!

605
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,650
Just leave her there.

606
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,050
-Spread out.
-This way.

607
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,840
Be careful.

608
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,590
This way.

609
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,350
Why?

610
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,520
Why?!

611
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,650
No.

612
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,780
No!

613
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,280
No!

614
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,160
No!

615
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,530
-Mom.
-Ms. Jin.

616
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,700
-No, stop it, Mom.
-Ms. Jin.

617
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,830
No, Mom.

618
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,790
No.

619
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,750
-You can't do this to them.
-Ms. Jin.

620
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,010
They don't deserve to die like this!

621
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,800
You can't do this to them!

622
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,510
You can't!

623
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,640
No.

624
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,930
Those poor things.

625
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,390
Those poor things!

626
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,980
Those poor things!

627
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,360
No!

628
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,530
Those poor things!

629
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,200
-No!
-Don't do that!

630
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,780
-Those pigs aren't sick!
-Goodness.

631
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,240
-I can't watch.
-I'm sorry!

632
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,080
Isn't this too harsh?

633
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,960
Please be reborn as humans

634
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,080
in your next life.

635
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,210
-Goodness.
-Human? Life will be tougher.

636
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,130
-My goodness!
-Hey, Mr. Choi.

637
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,260
I'm glad you called.

638
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,550
Hello. It's me, Sam-sik.

639
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,560
No.

640
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,270
I don't have the money yet.

641
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,440
FAIRY BREWERY

642
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,480
But if you give me more time,

643
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,780
I'll pay back 200 million won
including interest.

644
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,610
Just one month. I promise you.

645
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,040
I promise, I do

646
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,210
I do

647
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,660
FAIRY BREWERY, FAIRY REAL ESTATE,
FAIRY FORTUNE TELLING

648
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,630
Darn it.

649
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,050
Who the hell drank my alcohol?

650
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,130
I got you, you punk.

651
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,590
What? It's you, Sam-sik.

652
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,550
Goodness, Mr. Yang.

653
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,850
Your security system
is still cutting-edge technology.

654
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,560
I can never steal from your place.

655
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,600
Goodness.

656
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,440
I took a few bottles of makgeolli
to drink with my friends.

657
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,560
You can put it under my dad's tab.

658
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,570
Hey, go tell him to pay his tab.

659
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,820
-Okay.
-Hey.

660
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,660
And I put aside those bottles
to use for my ritual tomorrow.

661
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,330
How could you take them?

662
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,950
-All right. Where were we?
-Goodness, that punk.

663
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,000
Yes, farming funds.

664
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,250
Call the agricultural technology center
to apply for the fund.

665
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,880
-Once you call--
-And listen.

666
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,670
Do you know
Kang-ho's family is in big trouble?

667
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,130
It's worse than big trouble.

668
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,850
That genius became an idiot overnight.

669
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,760
You punk.

670
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,680
Not Kang-ho. I'm talking about the farm.

671
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,140
The poor pigs were all culled

672
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,230
because of the outbreak
of the foot-and-mouth disease.

673
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,230
-What?
-Foot-and-mouth disease?

674
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,690
They sacrificed all those pigs

675
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,860
who were squealing
and struggling to survive.

676
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,620
It was painful for me to watch.

677
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,740
Imagine how she felt.

678
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,750
She fed and raised them
like they were her own.

679
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,710
She must be heartbroken.

680
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,500
What about Lion?

681
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,630
Is Lion dead too?

682
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,840
Kang-ho's house

683
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,090
is over 3km away from the goat farm,

684
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,380
so Lion is still alive.

685
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,970
-What a relief.
-What a relief.

686
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,470
What's a relief?

687
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,180
This is absurd.

688
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,600
Some had to die

689
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,480
while others lived

690
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,900
by a matter of a few meters.

691
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,610
Goodness.

692
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,990
Thankfully, this one must've survived.

693
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,580
But what's the point?
She lost all the other pigs.

694
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,910
She must be very shocked.

695
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,790
She hasn't returned from the farm.

696
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Shut up.

697
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,210
And start searching.

698
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,630
Yes, sir.

699
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,100
I don't think it's in here.

700
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,220
I don't see any files.
There are just clothes and shoes.

701
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,690
Look, more clothes and shoes.

702
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,360
Mr. So.

703
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,790
Thank you for coming to the family meeting

704
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,710
for our children's wedding
despite your busy schedule.

705
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,960
It's to prepare my dearest daughter
and a great man like him

706
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,880
for their new journey together.

707
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,140
I'd rather miss out on a campaign.

708
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,940
Thank you for considering
my humble son a great man.

709
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,850
I'm very grateful.

710
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,320
We can tell a lot about a person
by their parents.

711
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,150
Think of who you are, sir.

712
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,530
You were born into a poor farm,
then later founded Dosang Group,

713
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,780
the top corporation that is
the backbone of our country's economy.

714
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,080
People often tease me,
calling me a rags-to-riches story.

715
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,750
Sir.

716
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,580
That is why I wish
to become the president.

717
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,300
A world where one can rise
from the bottom up.

718
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,380
Nowadays, social injustice
seems permanent,

719
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,510
and wealth and poverty are inherited.

720
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,510
Hence, no one can rise from the bottom up.

721
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,890
That's why the disadvantaged
do not make an effort to grow

722
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,350
and continue to just live
in this hopeless society.

723
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,850
I will

724
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,440
make Korea a place where one can rise.

725
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,240
And

726
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,280
the future of my politics

727
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,410
is you, sir.

728
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Mom.

729
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,720
We should go now.

730
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,730
Yes.

731
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,860
We should go.

732
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,200
UNGRYEOL AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS

733
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,080
WHEN NAILS COME

734
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,660
Have you heard the news?

735
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,660
About Jou-ri.

736
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,910
I heard it's a huge mess
after the disease outbreak.

737
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,540
Goodness, I heard.

738
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,710
I can feel her pain.

739
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,090
We're not talking just one or two pigs.

740
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,510
Where did they bury all those pigs?

741
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,930
The goats were buried
in the yard of the farm,

742
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,720
and the pigs were buried
in the potato field.

743
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,350
The potato field?

744
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,310
Then she can't grow potatoes either.

745
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,270
Goodness.

746
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,690
Potatoes?

747
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,350
Wait.

748
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,110
Then why did she buy herbicide?

749
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,110
What?

750
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,820
Herbicide?

751
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,820
Yes.

752
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,070
When did she come by to buy it?

753
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,280
As soon as I opened today.

754
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,660
You haven't finished my nails yet!

755
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,870
What…

756
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,620
UNGRYEOL AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS

757
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,260
Kang-ho.

758
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,430
Say hi to your dad.

759
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,150
Dad…

760
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,230
Hello.

761
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,410
Honey.

762
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,620
I brought Kang-ho with me.

763
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,330
I wanted to bring him to you

764
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,590
after he starts walking again, but…

765
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,800
I'm sorry.

766
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,760
I'm sorry.

767
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,850
HERE RESTS CHOI HAE-SIK

768
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,310
Mom.

769
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,110
Have we picnicked here in the past?

770
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,110
I don't remember.

771
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,820
This is a picnic, right?

772
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,450
No, it's not. We need gimbap for a picnic.

773
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,590
My son, this bad mother of yours

774
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,260
never let you go on a picnic
like everyone else.

775
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,590
Long ago,

776
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,640
my mom and dad…

777
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,680
I mean,

778
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,480
your grandma, grandpa,

779
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,020
and uncle…

780
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,030
went on a picnic
with gimbap I made for them

781
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,030
and passed away.

782
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,750
And your dad

783
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,670
also went out with the gimbap I made

784
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,790
and never came back.

785
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,510
I was scared of that.

786
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,340
That's why I never let you go.

787
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,260
I was scared by the thought…

788
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,890
of becoming alone again.

789
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,330
Mom.

790
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,340
I'll open it for you.

791
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,840
In return, after we drink this,
we have to go down and eat.

792
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,350
I'm hungry.

793
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,930
And what do we do before we eat?

794
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,770
Feed the pigs first.

795
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,270
We have to feed Lion.

796
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,900
Lion will grow up,

797
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,110
have piglets, more piglets,

798
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,480
and more.

799
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,780
Then we'll be able to run
our pig farm again, right?

800
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,740
I'll help you out a lot, Mom.

801
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,920
Ms. Jin!

802
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,210
Kang-ho!

803
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,170
Are you home?

804
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,710
Ms. Jin!

805
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,010
Look at this. I knew it.

806
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,140
You're here to see Kang-ho because
you heard about the outbreak, right?

807
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,800
Have you seen Ms. Jin and Kang-ho?

808
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:25,850
They aren't home?

809
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,810
Their farm is closed off now.
Where did they go?

810
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,020
Ms. Jin!

811
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,190
-Kang-ho!
-Hey.

812
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,730
-There they are.
-What?

813
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,690
Hello, Ms. Jin.

814
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,570
I was worried after hearing the news.

815
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,200
You must be heartbroken.

816
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,410
UNGRYEOL AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS

817
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,130
This.

818
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,130
I should take the herbicide
to my mom at the garlic field, right?

819
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,180
Right?

820
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,760
Yes.

821
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,560
Goodbye then.

822
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,270
Kang-ho.

823
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,320
Yes?

824
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,030
Can you go to the public bath
with Seo-jin tomorrow?

825
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,650
Sam-sik will go too.

826
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,070
Me?

827
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,490
Why would I…

828
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,950
I should go, right? Of course.

829
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,200
Sounds great. I'd love to.

830
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,460
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

831
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,580
Goodbye, ma'am.

832
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,760
I'll get going too then.

833
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,350
What's going on?

834
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,390
Tell me. What is it?
Why do I have to go bathe with Seo-jin?

835
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,980
Wait. Are you crying?

836
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,530
Something serious must be going on.

837
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,360
What is it?

838
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,320
Tell me now!

839
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,200
Nothing's going on.

840
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,790
It's just a bath.

841
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,540
Everyone should bathe!

842
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,500
Don't you wash up?

843
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,840
I'll wash up!

844
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,050
I will.

845
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,090
Her son

846
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,890
must have told her
that he wants to bathe with his dad,

847
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,470
and it must've broken her heart.

848
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,430
Goodness.

849
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,310
I see she was too shy to tell me,

850
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,440
so she dragged that idiot in
to make me go.

851
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,690
At any rate,

852
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,150
you were cute today, as always, Mi-joo!

853
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,130
Young-soon.

854
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,840
Young-soon, are you home?

855
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,380
It's heartbreaking.

856
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,890
What are those?

857
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,560
Please take this.

858
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,810
What is this?

859
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,190
Wait, this is from that time.

860
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,020
-You're right.
-Why are you giving these to us?

861
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,400
Thanks to you two,

862
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,740
I was able to get through
some difficult times.

863
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,540
I know this is nowhere enough
to show my gratitude,

864
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,040
but please take it.

865
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,710
What are you doing?

866
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,580
-Are you crazy?
-You must be.

867
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,590
This is wrong. Don't do this.

868
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,800
I mean, Kang-ho's fiancée brought--

869
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,920
Hey.

870
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,680
Oh, no. Never mind.

871
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,220
You're right.

872
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,600
That's why I feel awful

873
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,140
whenever I see these.

874
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,770
But

875
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,480
if you don't want them,
I'll throw them out--

876
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,530
It'd be such a waste to throw them out.

877
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,950
Seo-jin! Ye-jin!

878
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,080
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

879
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,200
Let's go to the bath.

880
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,330
Over here!

881
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,170
Hey, didn't you bring any toiletries?

882
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,550
They have everything there.

883
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,630
What do you know

884
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,010
About men's baths?

885
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,050
Good grief.

886
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,350
You must be the famous twins.

887
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,720
Nice to meet you.

888
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,560
I'll be your father…

889
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,100
That hurts!

890
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,810
That hurts.

891
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,110
He really is in pain.

892
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,190
He is.

893
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,610
I don't know who he is,
but he's quite a guy.

894
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,360
He's my friend, Sam-sik.

895
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,700
Sam-sik?

896
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,740
The famous thief?

897
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,990
No, let's go.

898
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,790
We'll return safely.

899
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay.

900
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,250
Go get yourself washed up
and have a good time.

901
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,630
Okay.

902
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,460
Okay, time to go!

903
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,590
-You don't want to end up like him.
-Let's go.

904
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,130
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

905
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,050
-That punk.
-Sorry, Sam-sik!

906
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,800
His memories must have come back.

907
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,260
Goodbye.

908
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,020
Wait up!

909
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,850
CERTIFIED COPY OF REGISTRY

910
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,940
My health will worsen by the day,

911
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,320
and I might die any day.

912
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:36,530
I'll only end up
becoming a burden to my unwell son.

913
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,040
Have you found
a rehabilitation center for your son?

914
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,160
Yes.

915
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,000
The fee will be deducted
from this bank account every month.

916
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,090
If my son ever returns to normal,

917
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,130
please grant him the rest.

918
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,100
If that never happens,

919
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,020
please handle everything
according to my will.

920
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,530
So are you saying Choi Kang-ho was the one

921
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,280
who's been exposing Woobyeok?

922
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,530
Look how pretty the wig is.

923
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,790
And those shoes are so cute.

924
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,580
Do these fit him?

925
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,920
Why don't we just get rid of Choi Kang-ho?

926
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,330
What do you mean?

927
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,420
If he returns to normal,
he may pose a threat to you.

928
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,630
Threat?

929
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,300
Hey, look.

930
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,010
Kang-ho exposed everything himself,

931
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,970
then went around patching it up.

932
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,100
Why do you think he did that?

933
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,770
That poor kid without any connections

934
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,440
worked desperately
to make some kind of a tie.

935
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,360
In a wig like this, no less.

936
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:00,530
This is what a man should be like
when he has ambition in his heart.

937
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,290
Mr. So, you just pitched

938
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:11,420
a four-seam fastball.

939
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,250
But something's not right.

940
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,170
Don't you think so?

941
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,300
Don't bring something on me

942
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,760
but on him.

943
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,810
Okay?

944
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,810
Kim Ju-hui reports.

945
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,900
Candidate Oh gave his first speech
in the most heated election battleground,

946
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:34,070
insisting he's the best candidate
who can bring about change.

947
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,370
Move aside. How dare you?

948
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,620
Come this way.

949
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,950
That's my job.

950
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,460
Let me do it.

951
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,250
Yes, I'll keep it short.

952
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,170
A world where one can rise
from the bottom up.

953
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,510
And rise to the very top!

954
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,760
I, Oh Tae-soo,

955
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,640
-"You reek of something."
-will create that world!

956
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,430
-What?
-I, Oh Tae-soo,

957
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,980
-I do? Of what?
-will make it happen!

958
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,690
Your hair is sparkling clean.

959
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,940
-I'll turn Korea into a place
-No?

960
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,610
where everyone can dream!

961
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,950
I will do it!

962
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,700
-"Is it the smell of dirt
-Thank you!

963
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,620
since you came from the bottom up?"

964
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,200
Thank you, everyone!

965
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,080
ASSEMBLYMAN OH, "A WORLD WHERE
ONE CAN RISE FROM THE BOTTOM UP"

966
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,960
Please give me your trust!

967
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,460
Give me your trust!

968
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,760
Ye-jin, did you have a good bath?
Seo-jin, what about you?

969
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,470
It's Mom!

970
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,220
-Hello, Ms. Jin.
-Seo-jin, come here.

971
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,470
-Mom.
-Give me your hand.

972
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,270
It must've been tough to help
both Seo-jin and Kang-ho bathe.

973
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:51,060
No, it's no trouble at all.

974
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,940
What do you know?
I'm the one who helped them.

975
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,060
You're right. Thank you, Sam-sik.

976
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,190
Kang-ho and I have an appointment.
We'll be on our way.

977
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,490
Kang-ho, say bye.

978
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,280
Thanks.

979
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,540
Thank you.

980
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Bye, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

981
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,630
Let's come together next week too!

982
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,420
Okay, let's do that.

983
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,590
Bye.

984
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,260
-Goodbye.
-Bye!

985
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,220
GEUMJA PUBLIC BATH

986
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,930
Guys, say goodbye.

987
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,430
-Bye!
-Bye!

988
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,600
-Bye!
-Bye!

989
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,350
Let's come again!

990
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,610
Okay!

991
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,150
-Bye!
-Bye!

992
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,320
-Bye!
-Bye!

993
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,240
Okay, the paperwork is all complete.

994
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,250
We'll take care of your son from now on.

995
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,960
Please don't worry.

996
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,420
It's close to your home too.
Isn't this great?

997
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,500
Please come by often.

998
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,670
Okay.

999
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,560
Kang-ho.

1000
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,020
Yes?

1001
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,570
You will

1002
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,410
live here and receive treatment
from now on.

1003
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,370
There are great doctors here

1004
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,290
as well as wonderful
rehabilitation equipment.

1005
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,330
So they'll help you walk again

1006
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,380
very soon.

1007
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,050
I have to live here now?

1008
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,430
Yes.

1009
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,390
With you?

1010
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,060
No.

1011
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,650
I can't live with you.

1012
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,280
You can't?

1013
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,240
Why not?

1014
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:08,660
Because…

1015
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,750
You know what?

1016
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,880
If you listen to the doctors

1017
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,800
and become healthy enough to walk again,

1018
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,050
I'll come back for…

1019
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,810
I'll come back…

1020
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,230
Mom.

1021
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,440
Yes?

1022
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,570
Are you going somewhere nice?

1023
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,530
What?

1024
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,160
Are you?

1025
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,500
Are you going somewhere nice by yourself?

1026
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,920
Mom…

1027
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,550
Mom.

1028
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:12,430
Mom, I'm sorry.

1029
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,060
I'll never do anything bad again.

1030
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,060
Mom.

1031
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,100
I'll listen to everything you say,

1032
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,190
and…

1033
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,690
I'll stay put, I'll exercise a lot,

1034
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,110
and I won't ask for a dog again.

1035
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,900
Mom, please don't go.

1036
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,160
Take me with you.

1037
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,080
Mom, take me with you.

1038
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,790
Take me with you.

1039
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,920
Mom!

1040
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,420
Mom.

1041
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,520
ONSOMANG REHABILITATION CARE CENTER

1042
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,560
ONSOMANG REHABILITATION CARE CENTER

1043
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,940
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be transferred to…

1044
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,780
She must have turned her phone off.
What should we do?

1045
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,940
Why didn't you watch him?

1046
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,410
This is his first day!

1047
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,990
-Call the police first.
-Okay.

1048
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,400
Hi, Juni, directions to home.

1049
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,190
Starting navigation.

1050
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,070
TO MY DEAR KANG-HO

1051
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,530
TO EVERYONE IN JOU-RI VILLAGE

1052
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,140
HYOEUM-RO 573

1053
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,950
It's not an easy job to bathe a kid.

1054
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,000
It must've been tough for Sam-sik.

1055
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,500
It was Kang-ho.

1056
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,710
What? Kang-ho?

1057
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,670
Yes, he scrubbed me and washed my hair.

1058
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,300
He's really good.

1059
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,050
He was like Dad.

1060
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,350
Hey! You take that back right now!

1061
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,640
That hurts! Let go of me!

1062
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:14,310
How dare you compare Kang-ho with Dad?

1063
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,480
How can that idiot be our dad?

1064
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,820
Lee Ye-jin!

1065
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,230
Get over here.

1066
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,030
You brat.

1067
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,160
How dare you pull out your brother's hair?

1068
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,320
That's enough!

1069
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,870
Our dad is really cool,

1070
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:31,700
really rich, and really smart.

1071
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,080
He has to be!

1072
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,460
You don't know anything.

1073
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,090
I hate you, Mom!

1074
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:23,840
TO MY DEAR KANG-HO
TO EVERYONE IN JOU-RI VILLAGE

1075
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,000
Mom!

1076
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,250
Mom!

1077
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,550
Mom!

1078
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:13,930
Mom!

1079
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:15,980
Mom!

1080
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:17,890
Mom!

1081
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:23,520
Mom.

1082
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,820
Mom.

1083
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,570
Mom, no.

1084
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,870
Mom.

1085
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,090
Mom, no.

1086
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,470
Mom.

1087
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,390
Mom.

1088
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:58,020
Mom.

1089
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,020
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1090
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,370
My mom abandoned me.

1091
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,120
Can't I just live with you?

1092
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,580
Was I a burden to you…

1093
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,210
because I'm unwell?

1094
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,880
So get up.

1095
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,840
Get up and walk!

1096
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,630
I also really want to know

1097
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,930
why I was abandoned.

1098
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,220
Mom, Dad is here.

1099
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,770
Mi-joo, let's get married.

1100
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,270
I'm going to marry Kang-ho oppa.

1101
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,940
-Okay?
-Are you home?

1102
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:46,860
Please keep my illness
a secret from the villagers.

1103
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,190
It's here. The evidence.

1104
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,490
To my mother whom I miss dearly.

1105
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,700
Are you healthy and well?

1106
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:58,620
