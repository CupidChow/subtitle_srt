THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,180
What the hell is this?

3
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,140
Damn it.

4
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,810
-Hurry up and find it.
-Yes, sir.

5
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,490
Be quiet.

6
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,050
Lion.

7
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,510
Hide in there!

8
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,230
Lion.

9
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,060
I'm here!

10
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,570
Oh, no!

11
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,320
Lion…

12
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,990
Lion!

13
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,700
What have you…

14
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,790
How did you open that?

15
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,790
That's my mom's favorite…

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,300
Stop pooping,
or we'll both get kicked out!

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,630
Come here.

18
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,840
Come here, Choi Lion.

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,010
Come here.

20
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,390
All right.

21
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,600
My mom is going to get mad.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Wait.

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,350
Sit, Lion.

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,770
What's all this?

25
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,860
What did you eat so much, you idiot?

26
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,610
All right.

27
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,280
Should we go out now?

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,990
-What if his mother comes too?
-Stay still.

29
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,700
What did you have for dinner?

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,870
Skate.

31
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,870
Wait there. Gosh.

32
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,380
Don't come out.

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,770
I can't believe this.

34
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,150
Lion isn't that tall.

35
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,820
That was close.

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,580
I should put this…

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,500
in the closet.

38
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm sure it was…

39
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,680
That can't be.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,470
Come out.

41
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,350
I know you're in there.

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,320
I knew it.

43
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,990
It was Lion.

44
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,530
You're dead meat.

45
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,660
My mom is going to kill you.

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,160
This…

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,960
All right.

48
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,840
Done.

49
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,390
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

50
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,730
EPISODE 6

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,230
I'm relieved that Mom
is at Mr. Son's place.

52
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,490
Gosh, Lion. What are you going to do now?

53
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,070
You're going to get kicked out.

54
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,540
Mom.

55
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,580
Mom?

56
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,920
No!

57
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,670
No.

58
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,690
Who are you?

59
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,040
-Are you okay, sir?
-No, I'm not!

60
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,670
Get him!

61
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,300
Get him!

62
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,230
-Go get the car!
-Yes, sir.

63
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,380
Step on it!

64
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,220
Pass that car!

65
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,200
No, don't follow him. Go straight.

66
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,160
Go straight!

67
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,800
Turn now!

68
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,350
It's me, sir.

69
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,890
There were people hiding inside.

70
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,060
I'm sorry--

71
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,090
Damn it!

72
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,350
SONG WOO-BYEOK
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CANDIDACY

73
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,850
Mom…

74
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,100
-What's all this mess?
-It's…

75
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,730
Some scary men suddenly barged in
and made a mess.

76
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,150
At this hour? Who came from where?

77
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,780
I don't know either.

78
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,370
They were inside the closet.

79
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,580
And another guy came in from that door.

80
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
I saw it.

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,420
-So you're saying some scary men
-Yes.

82
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,300
-came out of the closet
-Yes.

83
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,460
and they made a mess

84
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,170
and pooped in here, right?

85
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes. It's the truth.

86
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
He…

87
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,970
He even had a knife.

88
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,890
This guy had a knife,
and these guys suddenly came out.

89
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,140
He was going to stab me,
but these guys lunged at him.

90
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,480
Then he lunged back at them.

91
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,020
They crashed and everything.

92
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,690
They fought in this small room?

93
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,770
Yes.

94
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,190
Clean up right now.

95
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,990
Or I'll kick you and Lion out.

96
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,700
It's the truth, Mom!

97
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,200
Clean it up!

98
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,870
So what happened?

99
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,160
He disappeared at the hospital.

100
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,960
I wasn't asking about him.

101
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,920
We're still looking for it.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,010
But it's such a small village,
and it's hard to avoid the neighbors.

103
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,090
It's difficult to be inconspicuous.

104
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,480
I'll find it at all costs!

105
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,610
That's right.

106
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,320
That's the right answer.

107
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,070
I told you that

108
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,580
Oh Tae-soo would betray me.

109
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,080
He'll get more desperate
as the election nears.

110
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,040
He'll get rid of everyone
who gets in his way!

111
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,000
Who do you think
will be next after Kang-ho?

112
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,590
Make sure Kang-ho is safe

113
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,880
until we find the original copy.

114
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,890
Understand?

115
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,300
Yes, sir.

116
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,770
Splash, splash

117
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,440
Throw the bottle

118
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Throw the bottle

119
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,520
When the coastal guard isn't watching

120
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,480
Throw the bottle

121
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,900
Okay?

122
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,200
I'll throw this too.

123
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
And this net.

124
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,620
And I'll throw you too.

125
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,950
You shouldn't throw trash
into this beautiful sea.

126
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,090
I've calculated your wages, incentives,

127
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,920
and severance pay.

128
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,390
Minus the destruction of property,
the compensation I gave to the customers,

129
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,720
and the money I lost because I had to
close the business last night.

130
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,020
And you just need to pay me
100 million won.

131
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,230
-A hundred million?
-Why?

132
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,360
Do you not have the money?

133
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm an idiot! I didn't think that far.

134
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,700
What do we do then?

135
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,450
In that case,

136
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,330
how about I give you a good beating first?

137
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,990
Sorry? No.

138
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
Beat him up.

139
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,670
Come here.

140
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,000
You bastard.

141
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,550
-Okay!
-What are you saying?

142
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,130
-What the…
-Come here!

143
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,130
-Come down.
-Come down.

144
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,680
-I'll call the cops!
-Come here.

145
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,260
-Let me go!
-You won't die.

146
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,800
-Don't worry.
-Don't touch me!

147
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,140
Come down.

148
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,640
What the…

149
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,770
Hey!

150
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,480
Sam-sik, it's cold out there!

151
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,900
Is he a seal or something?

152
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,990
All right.

153
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,700
See you again, Sam-sik!

154
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,350
Phone use is a violation

155
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,690
of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

156
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,610
Neglect of a seatbelt is a violation

157
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,820
of Article 50, Paragraph 1
of the Road Traffic Act.

158
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,130
It's okay.

159
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,090
You can take your time.

160
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,720
But promise me

161
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,720
you'll come back.

162
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,570
Is anyone home?

163
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,150
Coming.

164
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,950
Who are you?

165
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,920
Gosh.

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
I told you not to go out like that.

167
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,590
Anyway, who are you?

168
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,210
I'm Baek Hoon-ah.

169
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,340
I'm from Seoul.

170
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,880
I see.

171
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,760
"Baek Hoon-ah"?

172
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,270
The name sounds familiar.

173
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,350
Hoon-ah?

174
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,520
Weren't you the Nightingale of Jou-ri?

175
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,150
Do you know me?

176
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,570
It's me, Son Yong-rak!

177
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,900
We went to the same elementary school.

178
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,830
Let's see. You were in second grade
when you moved to Seoul.

179
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,950
-You were probably nine.
-Right.

180
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,830
You were always good at singing.

181
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,790
No wonder you became a composer.

182
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,630
Shouldn't he have become a singer
if he was good at singing?

183
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,920
Perhaps his looks got in the way.

184
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,350
You can go rest if you're done with that.

185
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,850
I'm not done yet.

186
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,270
I'll eat the peel as well.

187
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,520
Okay.

188
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,330
If you're going to live in this village,

189
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,740
it's best not to listen to what she says.

190
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,080
Come on. I lived in Seoul for a long time.

191
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,420
I've been downright ignoring her.

192
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.

193
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,220
Are you here for good?

194
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
Well, you see…

195
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,100
Yong-rak.

196
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,180
Yong-rak.

197
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,940
The foot-and-mouth disease has spread
throughout North and South Jeolla Province

198
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,810
as well as South Chungcheong Province.

199
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,360
The Ministry of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs has decided

200
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,900
to cull 3,000 pigs at the farm
where the disease was detected

201
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,120
and take preventive measures
at eight farms within a 3km radius--

202
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,080
Why are they tormenting the pigs?

203
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,630
They're not tormenting them.
It's because they're sick.

204
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,170
One sick pig could transmit disease
to the entire farm

205
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,260
and it could spread to other nearby farms.

206
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,170
So they must kill them.

207
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,720
Kill them?

208
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,850
Then will our pigs get killed too?

209
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,810
No.

210
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,810
Our pigs have been vaccinated,

211
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,520
and there are no farms nearby.

212
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,020
So you don't need to worry.

213
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
But

214
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,820
you need to keep Lion
on the farm from now on.

215
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,980
Okay?

216
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,990
It can't catch a disease.

217
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,400
Okay.

218
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,200
The market is opening today
so I'll be going into town.

219
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,870
I'll see you later then.

220
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,200
What's gotten into you?

221
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,210
You always begged me to take you with me.

222
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,750
Well…

223
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,790
The place will be crowded with people.

224
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
It won't be easy to get around
in my wheelchair, so I'll stay home.

225
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
I'll eat and exercise.

226
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,140
I know you just want to play
with Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

227
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,060
Promise me you won't
get into trouble like last time.

228
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,730
Okay. I won't.

229
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,690
I promise.

230
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,400
Promise.

231
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,490
Here.

232
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,490
Pick up herbicide for the garlic field.

233
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,530
Okay. Do you need anything else?

234
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,000
Use this to start your shop.

235
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,170
I saved up to give this to you
on your wedding day.

236
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Make sure you look for a good place.

237
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,800
Mom…

238
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,470
This is the last time
I'll be helping you out. Got that?

239
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,390
-Gosh.
-Mom.

240
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,350
Thank you so much.

241
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,980
I'll work really hard
and pay you back handsomely. Okay?

242
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,900
Get it together, okay?

243
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,690
-Go.
-Okay.

244
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,320
I'll see you later.

245
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
Ye-jin. Seo-jin.

246
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,240
Hi, Juni.

247
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,910
Give me the bus schedule
for Jou-ri to Uri-myeon.

248
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,830
Okay. It is scheduled to arrive soon.

249
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,140
Gosh.

250
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,810
Mi-joo!

251
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,190
Oh, no.

252
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,580
Taxi.

253
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,590
Taxi!

254
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,500
Taxi!

255
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,760
Hello.

256
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,760
I wanted to ask you something.

257
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,680
About that old lady who's protesting
in front of the Prosecutors' Office…

258
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,060
Jung Jong-gu's mother.

259
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,890
What are the contents?

260
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,480
It's red chili powder, sesame seeds,

261
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,070
a few potatoes, sesame oil,
and perilla oil.

262
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,030
Please deliver them safely.

263
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,410
BANDO REAL ESTATE

264
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,250
-Hello.
-Come on in.

265
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,720
Please give me this pair in 275mm.

266
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,510
All right, one minute.

267
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,150
You have a keen eye.

268
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,230
Those shoes were newly released.

269
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,980
They're comfortable and don't smell.

270
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,650
There's this air cushion back here,

271
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,370
so they're great
for jogging or working out.

272
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,450
They lessen the stress
on your knees, calves, and cartilage.

273
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm wearing them right now.

274
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,120
Do you want to see a pair in 275mm?

275
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,500
No, it's okay.

276
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,250
Then just this one.

277
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,380
Yes, please.

278
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,710
-How much is it?
-It's 15,000 won, but just give me 10,000.

279
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,010
-Thank you. Come again.
-Thank you.

280
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,100
But later…

281
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,680
Someday…

282
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,150
I'm going to come back for those shoes.

283
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,230
Just wait and see.

284
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
All right.

285
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,950
Baek Hoon-ah, the Nightingale of Jou-ri?

286
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,110
That's right.

287
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,410
Goodness. It's been ages.

288
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,370
Gum-ja.

289
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,830
So you still live here.

290
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,830
I was wondering who it was
that moved here from Seoul.

291
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,630
I'm so glad to see you.

292
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,000
Are you here for good?

293
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,100
Goodness.

294
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,470
What's wrong?

295
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,600
Goodness.

296
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,390
Goodness.

297
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,600
The rent is pretty high
despite it being a rural area.

298
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,230
This is the only town around here.

299
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,020
The land value has soared

300
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,570
because a semiconductor company
will be moving here.

301
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,530
I see.

302
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,160
Anyway, thank you. I'll call you later.

303
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,200
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,130
Are these supplements the best ones?

306
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,380
Of course.

307
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,470
-I'd like eight boxes.
-Okay.

308
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,970
And do you have any medicine

309
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,350
for indigestion or stomach cramps?

310
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,890
Do you want three days' worth?

311
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,440
A bit more than that please.

312
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,070
I'd like three months' worth.

313
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,360
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,490
I like looking at these fish.

320
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,580
What's great about staring at fish
that are about to die?

321
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,700
Exactly.

322
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,460
They might die any moment now,

323
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,960
but no matter how painful or scary it is,

324
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,550
they're unable to cry or scream.

325
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,340
I think judicial officers
must be like that.

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,190
-We have eggs. Fresh eggs.
-Mi-joo.

-Eggs that we collected
-Mi-joo!

328
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,410
-before they even touched the nest.
-Mi-joo!

No, I have the bankbook.
I must've dropped my wallet somewhere.

334
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,940
Mom, I'll put him on the phone.
You talk to him.

335
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,400
-Here.
-Okay.

336
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,440
Hello?

337
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,900
I see. It's Ms. Jung from Jou-ri.

338
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,610
Herbicide for your garlic field?

339
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,450
All right. Bye.

340
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,370
-Okay.
-Right.

341
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,710
I'll go get it from the storage.

342
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,210
-Wait here.
-Okay.

343
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,170
All right.

344
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,550
Gosh, that hurts.

345
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,890
You're still in pain.

346
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,890
You should see a doctor.

347
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,720
Does your finger hurt?

348
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,220
Well…

349
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,060
I think it's irritation
from pesticides or grass.

350
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,440
Let me take a look. Hold on.

351
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,440
What?

352
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,190
Let me see.

353
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,740
One minute.

354
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,190
You have an ingrown nail.

355
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,860
Don't cut your nails too close or round.

356
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,650
But cut it so that it's a square shape.

357
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,030
Old people don't know about that.

358
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,070
We're not particular
about cutting our nails.

359
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,580
If it's too hard to do it,
you can go to a nail salon.

360
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Isn't that where
you get your nails colored?

361
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,330
They do that,

362
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,000
but they also help fix problematic nails.

363
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,420
He's back with the herbicide.

364
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,130
Ma'am, how's your finger now?

365
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,300
Goodness, it feels much better.

366
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,220
Nail salon, was it?

367
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,600
Is there a nail salon in town?

368
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,560
There was one,
but it closed down a few months ago.

369
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,190
Goodness.

370
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,520
Living in a rural area is so inconvenient.

371
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,690
By the way, why don't you
open up a nail salon?

372
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,860
You'd be so good at it.

373
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,110
I've been looking into it,

374
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,240
but the rent is too high.

375
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,120
I can't find a decent shop-in-shop either.

376
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,160
What is a "shop-in-shop"?

377
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,380
It's opening up another small shop
inside a shop.

378
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,630
That's why it's called a shop-in-shop.

379
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,880
Then open one here.

380
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,430
Lots of people frequent this place
all year round.

381
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,430
Most of us need hand care

382
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,060
and often wait around
like this for the bus.

383
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,810
-That'd be great.
-Come on.

384
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,350
Who would open up a nail shop
in a place like this?

385
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,350
Jeez.

386
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,610
My wife would be glad
to hear that news though.

387
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,280
She's been sulking about
the nail salon closing down.

388
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,280
Can I really do that?

389
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,320
How much would the rent be?

390
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,410
What rent?

391
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,200
That corner has always been empty.

392
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,120
She's right.

393
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,290
We'll convince everyone to buy seeds,
fertilizer, and everything else here.

394
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,880
-So let her have it.
-Seriously?

395
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,590
I have a truck driver's license too.

396
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,300
I can fetch products from the storage
when you're busy

397
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,720
and deliver them too.

398
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,140
-Seriously?
-Yes.

399
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,800
In that case…

400
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,600
Then…

401
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,180
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

402
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,600
-A big welcome.
-Thank you.

403
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,020
-Gladly.
-Thank you.

404
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,900
-Thank you.
-Good for you.

405
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,840
Let's see.

406
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,970
That's Mi-joo's!

407
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,030
-That little…
-Darn it.

408
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,320
Move!

409
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,750
Out!

410
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,920
Hit a home run or strikeout.

411
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,550
Hit a home run…

412
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,710
Or strikeout.

413
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,840
…or strikeout.

414
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,850
Catch that thief!

415
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,230
You thief!

416
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,390
You punk.

417
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,400
-How dare you steal this?
-No, I didn't steal it.

418
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,860
This is from our shop.

419
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,070
-I didn't steal it.
-How dare you?

420
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,150
-Then why do you have our item?
-Sorry?

421
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,700
I saw it. Why do you have it?

422
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,360
I just tried it on.

423
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,030
-Don't lie.
-It's the truth.

424
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,950
-How dare you?
-Wait--

425
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,290
What's going on?

426
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,830
What's the matter?

427
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,580
It's Mi-joo!

428
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,170
-Do you know him?
-Yes, I do.

429
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,000
No, I…

430
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,250
No.

431
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Anyway, he's unwell.

432
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,300
Please let go of him.

433
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm telling you, he stole this.

434
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,640
-What?
-He stole our apple too.

435
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,550
Goodness.

436
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,890
We'll have to throw all of this away.
What'll you do?

437
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,430
I…

438
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,060
The thing is…

439
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,650
Someone stole this, so…

440
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,530
Why do you have that?

441
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,820
"Hi, Juni."

442
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,110
"Give me the bus schedule
for Jou-ri to Uri-myeon."

443
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,530
You dropped it while you said that.

444
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,790
I'm so sorry.

445
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,250
I'll compensate you for everything.
I'm sorry.

446
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,000
What do I do?

447
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,010
-I'm sorry.
-Kang-ho.

448
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,640
Goodness.

449
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,890
How did you come all the way here?

450
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,560
You don't even know the way.

451
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,690
You can't buy anything
if you don't have your wallet.

452
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,400
But still, there are many cars,
so it could've been dangerous.

453
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,030
If you pick up anything from now on,
give it to me or Mr. Son, okay?

454
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,320
Okay.

455
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,500
And no matter what,
you shouldn't touch someone else's stuff.

456
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,210
Why did you take the bag?

457
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,210
The owner must've been startled.

458
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,750
Bar Exam Meals.

459
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
What?

460
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,300
What did you say?

461
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,840
-Put him behind bars?
-What?

462
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,640
-No.
-You…

463
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,140
-You need to get scolded!
-No, I…

464
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,350
How dare you say that about an elder?

465
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,810
-Mi-joo.
-Gosh!

466
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,850
How dare you!

467
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,350
-You impudent brat!
-That hurts! Mi-joo!

468
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,770
-Bye, Mi-joo.
-Thank you for the ride.

469
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,150
Mi-joo, wait.

470
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,070
Yes?

471
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,160
These are supplements.
Give them to your mom.

472
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,080
And tell her I'm sorry that
Kang-ho ruined her field.

473
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,460
I'm the one who should be sorry.

474
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,630
Ye-jin just lost her grip on the pig.

475
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,010
You must've been surprised.

476
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,600
I was.

477
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,770
We could've lost the pig.

478
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,390
No.

479
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,810
I mean Kang-ho.

480
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,690
Sorry?

481
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,200
I couldn't talk to you
with him in the truck.

482
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,030
But you looked quite upset.

483
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,620
That's not why.

484
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,250
Mi-joo.

485
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,000
I treated you harshly back then,

486
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,420
blaming you for Kang-ho
not taking his CSAT.

487
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,130
I even refused
to tell you his contact information.

488
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,880
I'm really sorry about that.

489
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,850
I think I'm being punished right now

490
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,220
because of what I did to you back then.

491
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,440
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

492
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,940
Ms. Jin, don't be like this.

493
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,730
Don't apologize.

494
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,780
I'm happy

495
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,860
that I got to see him again.

496
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,610
But…

497
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,290
You know very well how strong he is.

498
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,750
Just wait.

499
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,800
He won't give up that easily.

500
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,340
He'll walk again.

501
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,920
Thanks.

502
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,430
Thanks, Mi-joo.

503
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,440
Hoon-ah.

504
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,360
Are you really

505
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,280
Hoon-ah?

506
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,700
Won-hyung, you bedwetter.
You've grown so much.

507
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,080
-Gosh.
-Hoon-ah.

508
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,250
Sing me a song.

509
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,120
-What song?
-The song you used to sing back then

510
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,330
about a magpie.

511
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,880
Should I?

512
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,760
Whom

513
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,670
Does the magpie

514
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,050
Play with?

515
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,890
They play among themselves

516
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,600
In the field

517
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,320
Whom does Won-hyung the Bedwetter

518
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,240
Play with?

519
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,410
Won-hyung the Bedwetter

520
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,790
Plays with Hoon-ah

521
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,380
Let's get rid of the pig farm.

522
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,790
But…

523
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,420
-Come on. That's absurd.
-What's he saying?

524
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,420
I love you with all my heart,

525
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,630
but I'm against that!

526
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,970
-Me too.
-Now, now.

527
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,430
Hear me out.

528
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,680
If you help me out,

529
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,310
I promise

530
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,020
to replace the pig farm
with the biggest trot concert hall

531
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,070
in this country.

532
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,860
-I will.
-A concert hall?

533
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,610
-A trot concert hall?
-A trot concert hall?

534
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,530
Look. Korea's in the grip
of trot music fever.

535
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,540
I'll bring Young-woong,
Young-tak, and Dong-won

536
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,000
and hold a concert every week.

537
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Think about it.

538
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,710
People will swarm into this village.

539
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,880
Then…

540
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,670
Gosh, it'll be so noisy and chaotic.

541
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,960
Goodness. It'll be so hectic.

542
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,880
Right.

543
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,090
If the biggest trot concert hall
is built here,

544
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,810
we'll need security.

545
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,180
Who should be in charge?

546
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,940
-Me?
-No.

547
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,350
Sam-sik.

548
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,520
-Sam-sik?
-Not him.

549
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,780
Hold on. What will Sam-sik do again?

550
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,360
No one

551
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,700
is more well-versed in security than him.

552
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,200
That's true.

553
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,450
When it comes to security,

554
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,500
-he's like an FBI agent.
-That is true.

555
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,830
Was it when he was in fifth grade?

556
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,750
He went to a police station

557
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,710
-and stole a pair of handcuffs.
-Right.

558
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,420
Must we ignore such a hidden gem?

559
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,550
It'll be a waste of talent.

560
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,890
Goodness.

561
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,100
-I wouldn't say he's a hidden gem.
-On top of that,

562
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,470
the singers will need someone

563
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,020
to do their hair and makeup.

564
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,560
And as it happens,

565
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,480
we have a professional in this village.

566
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,900
-Who?
-Who?

567
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,240
Mi-joo?

568
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,240
What will all those people
want to do here? They'll want to eat.

569
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,740
We'll serve various cuisines.

570
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,870
What will they do
during their waiting time?

571
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,080
Coffee, right?

572
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
I'm talking about a cafe.

573
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,330
-A cafe?
-A cafe?

574
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,210
Someone will manage the parking space,

575
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,040
clean, and run a bed and breakfast.

576
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,880
-I have the biggest house around here.
-Right.

577
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,050
That's right!

578
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,550
And each room has a bathroom.

579
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,090
-Not every room.
-Do you still

580
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,760
not get the big picture?

581
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,720
Mr. Son Yong-rak,

582
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,980
the town head?

583
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,390
-Gosh.
-He's a village head.

584
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,020
I'm a village head.

585
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,310
People will gather here,

586
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,820
and the village will grow.

587
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,780
There will be more residents.

588
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,820
Then the village
will become a town in no time.

589
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,580
Better yet, should I call you
a governor instead?

590
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,040
I'd like to introduce you to our governor,

591
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,460
Mr. Son Yong-rak!

592
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,750
-A governor?
-He's a governor!

593
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,250
-That's great!
-You just got promoted!

594
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,790
A round of applause!

595
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,250
Hi, Juni. Show me the direction
to my house.

596
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,090
Starting navigation.

597
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,630
-It works. Look, Mom.
-Right.

598
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,010
If you ever lose your way home,
you can use that.

599
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,100
No.

600
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,770
You shouldn't be in a situation where you
lose your way home to begin with.

601
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,850
Got it?

602
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,440
Okay.

603
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,940
Mr. Son.

604
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,530
Mr. Son?

605
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,320
Mr. Son?

606
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,330
Mr. Son.

607
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,750
Mr. Son.

608
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,250
That's strange. Where's everyone?

609
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,220
Hi, Juni. Where's everyone?

610
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,970
I can't think of an answer.

611
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,140
Hey, Andrea.

612
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,560
Really? Okay, I'll be there soon.

613
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,230
Kang-ho, one of our pigs
is about to give birth.

614
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,990
Give this one to Mr. Kim
who runs the goat farm.

615
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,660
This is for the persimmon tree house,
this is for Ms. Choi.

616
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,160
And these two are for Ms. Park.

617
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,370
-Ms. Park.
-Yes.

618
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,420
Also,

619
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,130
I won't be home until tomorrow morning
because I have to be there for the birth.

620
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,340
So make sure you feed Lion.

621
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,220
There's rice in the rice cooker
and side dishes in the fridge for you.

622
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Exercise for an hour

623
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,970
before going to bed.

624
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,310
Can you do that?

625
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,850
Yes.

626
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,100
But come home as soon as possible

627
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,440
because those scary men might come back.

628
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,570
Let's not call those scary men ever again.

629
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,110
Okay? Bye.

630
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,740
I didn't call them.

631
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,460
Hi, Juni. Find the goat farm for me.

632
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,500
I found 70 goat farms.

633
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,050
What?

634
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,760
JOU-RI CAFE

635
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,640
There they were.

636
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,940
I wrote up a petition.

637
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,150
Let's gather in front of
the pig farm tomorrow

638
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,360
and shout, "We're against it!"

639
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,110
We should protest.

640
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,620
The pig farm was kind of an inconvenience.
We can't deny that.

641
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,990
Right.

642
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,620
Especially in the summer,
more bugs gather there

643
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,790
and the smell worsens.

644
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,790
But most of all,
I'm worried about Young-soon.

645
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,340
I mean, she's unwell.

646
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't think
she should be running the farm.

647
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,840
Darn it.

648
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,890
What's your take on this?

649
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,480
Let's fight for a clean

650
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,900
And fresh Jou-ri

651
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,530
Fight

652
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,070
Fight

653
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,780
Fight

654
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,370
Let's fight for it!

655
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,130
I know it hurts a lot.

656
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,390
But your piglets
will only stay strong if you do.

657
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,560
So hang in there
just a little longer, okay?

658
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,140
I'll do the same.

659
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,900
All right.

660
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,110
All done.

661
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,480
SAM-SIK'S MILL

662
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,560
This is the last time
I will help you as your senior colleague.

663
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,690
Just go there
and return with what they give you.

664
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,110
It's a cakewalk.

665
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,650
Okay?

666
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,990
Okay. I got it.

667
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,120
All right. Let's celebrate
Mr. Lee Jae-gyu's promotion

668
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,420
-to assistant chief prosecutor
-He's being so loud.

669
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,830
-and clink our glasses.
-What?

670
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,170
-All right.
-Choi Kang-ho?

671
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,250
Cheers to

672
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,460
Assistant Chief Prosecutor Lee!

673
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,170
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

674
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,430
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

675
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,680
Hey. It's you, isn't it?

676
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,180
Hello.

677
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,230
Jeez, you really became a prosecutor.

678
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,940
It's me, Sam-sik. Your childhood friend.

679
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,230
We're childhood friends.

680
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,320
Gosh, you look really good.

681
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,610
Goodness, you're even wearing cologne.

682
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,330
Remember how kids used to make fun of you
because you reeked like your pig farm?

683
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,250
Jeez, they'd bawl
if they had to sit next to you.

684
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,040
Those jerks.

685
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,620
Let's talk outside.

686
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,830
-Please excuse us.
-What?

687
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,790
-Let's talk outside.
-You punk.

688
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,380
You hated pigs,
but you're having pork rinds?

689
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,840
Hey.

690
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,010
My friend is a prosecutor now.

691
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,010
By the way, did you get plastic surgery?

692
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,390
You look even better than you used to.

693
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,980
I'm considering it too.

694
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,020
So how have you been?

695
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,240
What's this for?

696
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,450
Wait. What is this?

697
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,120
Isn't this why you approached me?

698
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,040
You little…

699
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,380
Thanks, my friend.

700
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,710
How much did you give me?

701
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,380
300,000 won?

702
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,970
Hey, thanks!

703
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,010
Thanks!

704
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,930
Kang-ho.

705
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,230
All I did was do as I was told

706
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,570
and sell what I got as my payment.

707
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,740
I had no idea they were stolen
from an assemblyman's house.

708
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,780
So could you talk to
the prosecutor in charge?

709
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,370
You have that power, don't you?

710
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,040
Kang-ho.

711
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,670
It's me, Sam-sik. Your friend.

712
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,960
-Sam-sik.
-Yes?

713
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,800
We're no longer friends.

714
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,020
All right.

715
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,560
I was wrong.

716
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,440
I sincerely apologize

717
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,860
for all the things

718
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,740
I did and said to you back then.

719
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,740
So please help me out this once.

720
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,200
If you do, I promise to start fresh.

721
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,160
Please?

722
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,990
It's over for me if I go to jail again.

723
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,370
Please help me this once
for my poor mother's sake.

724
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,340
No, wait. Please help me, sir.

725
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,880
Please help me.

726
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,880
Sam-sik.

727
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,430
I can't help you.

728
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,720
Kang-ho.

729
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,770
Please help me.

730
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,190
Please…

731
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,610
Can you please be quiet and leave?

732
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,340
Look who it is.

733
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,090
It's Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho.

734
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,470
Oh, dear. You must've hurt your legs.

735
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,180
Who are you?

736
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,260
Who am I?

737
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,810
Unbelievable.

738
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,100
Fine, I get it.
You don't want to associate with me.

739
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,310
But too bad

740
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,400
because I know you very well.

741
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,650
No matter how hard I tried to forget you,

742
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,700
I just couldn't.

743
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,580
So tell me.

744
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,080
How did it feel to keep me
behind bars for months,

745
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,250
my friend?

746
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,500
"Friend"?

747
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,580
Are we friends?

748
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,130
Sorry. Jeez, my bad.

749
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,720
How dare a petty thief

750
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,180
try to befriend a great prosecutor?

751
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:34,980
Be quiet.

752
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,560
What? "Be quiet"?

753
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,570
I see.

754
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,780
Shut up, you jerk.

755
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,070
"I didn't know they were stolen goods.
All I did was do as I was told."

756
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,740
"So please help me this once."

757
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,330
I begged on my knees, but you said,

758
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,200
"We're no longer friends."

759
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,750
"Can you please be quiet and leave?"

760
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,710
You haven't changed.

761
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,840
You haven't changed one bit.

762
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,840
How dare you have the audacity
to face me, you son of a bitch?

763
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,050
"Son of a bitch"?

764
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,050
Yes, you son of a bitch.

765
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,600
-"Son of a bitch"?!
-Yes, you son of a bitch!

766
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:15,970
You!

767
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,680
You just cursed.

768
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,810
I'm going to tell my mom.

769
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,440
Right. She's tending to the pigs.

770
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,610
Right. You!

771
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,950
I'm going to tell Ye-jin's dad.

772
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,110
You have no idea how scary he is.

773
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,280
He's a horrifying bastard!

774
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,870
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

775
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,330
Ye-jin!

776
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,250
Seo-jin!

777
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,050
Hi, Kang-ho.

778
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,550
I mean, Kang-ho oppa.

779
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,220
I mean, Uncle Kang-ho.

780
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,640
I need your dad's help.

781
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,050
You don't need him as much as we do.

782
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,680
But what for?

783
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,230
A stranger called me a son of a bitch.

784
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,980
What? How dare they
say that to our friend?

785
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,440
What are you doing?

786
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,280
I told you to wash your hands and--

787
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,070
Someone cursed at Kang-ho.

788
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,990
I won't let this slide.

789
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,360
All right, let's go!

790
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,700
You're not going anywhere. Come here.

791
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,750
It's almost dinnertime, so go home.
Your mom will be worried.

792
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,330
She's not home.

793
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,960
One of our pigs is giving birth,

794
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,380
so she won't be coming home tonight.

795
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,920
What? Then what about dinner?

796
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,590
I can have rice

797
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,380
with the side dishes in the fridge.

798
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,930
Why don't you just eat with us?

799
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,970
We already have the table set.

800
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,020
Ye-jin.

801
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,180
No, Mom.

802
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,020
-Seo-jin, what are you doing?
-No.

803
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,810
-But…
-What are you doing?

804
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,520
Let's go.

805
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,610
Goodness, he left them there.

806
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,740
SAM-SIK'S MILL

807
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,110
By the way,

808
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,870
I don't know if we should do this to her

809
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,120
as fellow parents.

810
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,460
As fellow parents,

811
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,630
let's do this for our Sam-sik.

812
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,510
He'll become head of security

813
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,340
at the biggest concert hall in Korea.

814
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,260
You're right.

815
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,810
Our son is struggling to land a job
as an ex-convict.

816
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,480
He should be our top priority.

817
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,310
-Exactly.
-Right.

818
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,110
Why is our gate open?

819
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,190
Beats me.

820
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,040
Could it be a thief?

821
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,500
A thief robbing a fellow thief's house?

822
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,130
In that case…

823
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,320
You darn thief!

824
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,320
You thief!

825
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,160
Mom!

826
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,740
It's me, Sam-sik!

827
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,040
-Sam-sik?
-What?

828
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,580
Goodness!

829
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,000
It really is you!

830
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,170
It really was a thief.

831
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,590
Goodness, Sam-sik.

832
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,970
-Goodness. Oh, no.
-Blood.

833
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,300
What?

834
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,560
It's true.

835
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,020
How is that possible?

836
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,520
I know it's unbelievable, but it's true.

837
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,060
Jeez.

838
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,070
I had no idea
and gave him an earful today.

839
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:57,450
Who knew such a smart kid
would end up like that?

840
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,660
I feel bad for Ms. Jin.

841
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,120
He's her one and only son.

842
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,620
She dedicated her entire life

843
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,290
to supporting him
by running that pig farm.

844
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,420
How dare you say that
after getting out of prison?

845
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,930
Do you think I didn't work hard
to support you?

846
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,550
You bastard.

847
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,720
Where's my discharge deposit?

848
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,310
How dare you

849
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,020
-scam your own mother?
-That hurts!

850
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,730
Dad, help me!

851
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,190
I was just about to help out.

852
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,520
Stop it! It hurts!

853
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,780
Where did you spend that money?

854
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,440
-Come here! Where's the money?
-It hurts!

855
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:38,820
-Get up!
-Gosh.

856
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,530
-Goodness. Let me see.
-What happened?

857
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,410
-It's nothing.
-Goodness!

858
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,660
Rice is a staple for Koreans,

859
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,580
but we're having bread for dinner?

860
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,170
The color reminds me of diarrhea.

861
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,220
It's called tomato stew.

862
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,090
She learned the recipe to cook it for us.

863
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,260
Just eat it.

864
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,520
Where did she learn
this ridiculous recipe?

865
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,730
Anyway, doesn't it
feel like we're a family

866
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,690
since we're eating together?

867
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,240
Dad.

868
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,870
Mom.

869
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,950
Seo-jin, stop that nonsense and eat.

870
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,700
I'm done.

871
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,120
You didn't eat the carrots.

872
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,420
I don't like carrots.

873
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,790
Eat them if you want to be healthy.

874
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,840
I want Kang-ho to be healthy.

875
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,170
Here.

876
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,430
Do you want me to scold you?

877
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,820
Why are you taking them back?

878
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,820
You don't eat carrots.

879
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,530
How did you know that?

880
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,250
Were we friends too?

881
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,010
We went to school together.

882
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,930
So that's why I kept thinking of you.

883
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,650
You're done eating, right?
Then you should go.

884
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:37,560
No, I'm not done yet.

885
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,580
I'm sorry.

886
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,090
For what?

887
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,500
I couldn't catch any fish.

888
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,630
Fish?

889
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,430
You like fish.

890
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,220
So I wanted to catch one for you.

891
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,390
But someone suddenly cursed at me.

892
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,480
Where's Ye-jin and Seo-jin's dad?

893
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,480
I want to meet him.

894
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,520
I heard he's a horrifying bastard.

895
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,240
I don't like fish,
so you don't need to catch any for me.

896
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,040
And don't come back here again.

897
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,210
Don't meet my kids again.

898
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,590
I don't want to see you anymore.

899
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,380
Are you done eating?

900
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,550
Was I…

901
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,850
a bad person to you too?

902
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,310
I hope I wasn't.

903
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,860
But I guess I was.

904
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,160
Goodness, I'm so late.

905
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,580
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

906
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,460
Hello.

907
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,840
Hi. What are you doing here?

908
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:28,050
He ate with us because Ms. Jin was tending
to her pig that was giving birth.

909
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,640
Right. Who's feeding Lion?

910
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,470
Right. Lion.

911
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,810
I need to go feed him.

912
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,440
Thanks, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

913
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,940
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

914
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,570
And…

915
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,230
Mi-joo…

916
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,970
I feel bad for Young-soon.

917
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:14,390
She lost her husband,
and her son ended up like that.

918
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:21,520
And now, she'll be betrayed
by the villagers she trusted.

919
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:25,360
Don't put it that way.

920
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,990
She's not young anymore,
so we want her to have a comfortable life.

921
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:31,650
It may sound easy,

922
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,160
but running a farm singlehandedly
as a woman isn't easy at all.

923
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,620
So you all gathered together

924
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,290
and schemed to make her
close down the farm

925
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,210
so that she'd live a comfortable life?

926
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,500
My goodness.

927
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,800
You guys are really something.

928
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,930
Goodness.

929
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,150
-Check in there.
-Yes, sir.

930
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,290
All right.

931
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,840
Goodness. She gave birth to 13 piglets.

932
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,840
You displayed exceptional work

933
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,550
all night long.

934
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,220
Not at all.

935
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,220
She was the one who worked hard.

936
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,440
Well done.

937
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,990
-Good work, Andrea.
-Thank you.

938
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,700
I'll wrap up here.

939
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,820
You can go first.

940
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,410
That is not right.

941
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:00,450
It is only right for you to go home first.

942
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,750
I have to write up the daily record.

943
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,830
I need to do it, so go home first.

944
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,630
If that is what you want,

945
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,380
then I have no choice but to comply.

946
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,220
Go on.

947
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,570
Sir, the worker is headed your way.

948
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,570
Got it.

949
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,750
I want to go home

950
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
All right.

951
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,470
See you tomorrow

952
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,630
Sir.

953
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,340
It's me.

954
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:42,010
-Who's left?
-His mother probably went home

955
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,600
and the worker went home as well
so it's probably empty.

956
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,600
Good.

957
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,600
Let's go down there.

958
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,640
Yes, sir.

959
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:53,820
Let's fight for a clean

960
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,730
And fresh Jou-ri

961
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,450
Fight

962
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,240
Fight

963
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,030
"Fight"?

964
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,450
Gosh, he's so annoying.

965
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,500
I wish I could hit him in the head.

966
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,260
Let's fight for it!

967
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,720
-It's a manure facility.
-What about the other storage?

968
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,020
There's a smaller storage up there.

969
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,980
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

970
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,060
Gosh.

971
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,480
Goodness.

972
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,900
Who are you? What are you doing here?

973
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,610
-Well, we…
-We need some manure.

974
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,450
Manure?

975
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,160
So we're--

976
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,540
We're planning to start our own farm

977
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,040
and heard that pig manure
was better than fertilizers.

978
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,920
But you can't just
cover your field with it.

979
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,260
You need to add sawdust and probiotics
to turn it into an organic fertilizer.

980
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,720
I've used up what I already made.

981
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,760
I'll give you some when I make more.

982
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,180
I understand. Thank you.

983
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,810
It's really nice to hear
that young men like you want to farm.

984
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,820
This village is full of old people.

985
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,820
Where's your field?

986
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,900
It's over there.

987
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,120
That's ours.

988
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,410
We bought one behind the field
that's two fields down from that one.

989
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,290
You bought the field?

990
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,540
Ms. Park was worried
that the price was too high

991
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,920
since no one wanted it.

992
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,670
I guess she eventually sold it.

993
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,720
Yes.

994
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,550
Anyway, I'll let you know
once I get more manure.

995
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,260
Where do you live?

996
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,350
-We--
-We're about to build one.

997
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,560
I see.

998
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,690
I hope we see each other often.

999
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,230
And I'm sorry,

1000
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,240
but this is a restricted area.

1001
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,070
Especially with the disease going around.

1002
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,280
We're truly sorry. Goodbye then.

1003
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,660
Have you gone crazy?

1004
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:15,000
Now we might have to
buy a field, farm, and build a house.

1005
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,380
I was flustered
by her unexpected questions.

1006
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,630
Darn it.

1007
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,680
Mom.

1008
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,020
Mom.

1009
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,860
Mom?

1010
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:54,750
Was I a bad person to you too?

1011
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,370
I hope I wasn't.

1012
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,380
But I guess I was.

1013
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,540
You're probably worried

1014
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,750
about how you'll raise him, right?

1015
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,000
Don't worry and just follow my lead.

1016
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:44,090
I've done this before,
so I know a thing or two.

1017
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:03,020
You don't have to hold it in.

1018
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,110
I've done this before,
so I know a thing or two.

1019
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,740
Goodness.

1020
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,890
Young-soon, we're leaving.

1021
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:37,970
One minute!

1022
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,270
Mom, here.

1023
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,350
Goodness.

1024
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,150
What is this?

1025
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,020
It's Dad's first company picnic,

1026
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,690
so I made some gimbap.

1027
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,070
It'd be nice if you could come too.

1028
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,660
I know. I would go if it wasn't
for the practical test next week.

1029
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,330
Don't worry.

1030
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,700
You'll pass no matter what.

1031
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,290
I'll do my best.

1032
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,870
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

1033
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,380
-Let's go then.
-Bye.

1034
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,050
All right.

1035
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,800
I am happy

1036
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,300
-I am…
-Bye, Young-soon.

1037
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,700
Are you awake?

1038
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,070
Why am I here?

1039
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,950
You fainted at your farm,

1040
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:40,830
and two men carried you here.

1041
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,580
You need to go see the doctor now.

1042
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,170
Can you walk?

1043
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,080
Yes.

1044
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,550
She's not in the kitchen or the bathroom.

1045
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,680
And I can't go to the farm.

1046
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,100
Then I can call her, right?

1047
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,650
You just told me to, okay?

1048
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,190
MOM

1049
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,870
MY LOVELY SON

1050
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,540
Mic test. One, two, three.

1051
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,750
It's fine.

1052
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:27,670
But why are these hillbillies
running late?

1053
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:31,210
PIG FARM, OUT.
RETURN MY SENSE OF SMELL!

1054
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,130
Hey.

1055
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:34,380
Where in the world are you?

1056
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,050
As a fellow parent,

1057
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,390
I don't think this is right.

1058
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,970
-Goodness.
-Be gentle.

1059
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,100
You darn brat.

1060
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,940
Our hearts break even when our son
gets injured in the tiniest bit.

1061
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,520
So imagine how Young-soon must feel.

1062
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,650
Anyway, we won't be a part of it.

1063
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,570
I need to spray herbicide
on my garlic field. Okay?

1064
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,530
I need to thin out the cabbages.

1065
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,450
I have so much to do.

1066
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,620
I have no time to protest. Darn it.

1067
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,660
Hang up.

1068
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,960
Listen, you punk. I know you came here
after ending up dirt poor

1069
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,090
because of gambling and plagiarizing.

1070
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:13,000
And you're telling me
you're going to build

1071
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:14,630
the biggest concert hall in the country?

1072
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,420
How am I to believe that?

1073
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,380
I'm busy right now. Bye.

1074
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,680
Mr. Son!

1075
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,640
Mr. Son!

1076
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,270
Do you really not have a guardian?

1077
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,990
Husband, children,

1078
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,570
or siblings?

1079
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,070
No, I don't.

1080
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,870
Don't make me repeat myself.

1081
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,490
So just tell me.

1082
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,870
What's wrong? Is it serious?

1083
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,590
The biopsy results came out.

1084
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,800
It's stage 4 stomach cancer.

1085
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,640
We'll have to do more tests to confirm.

1086
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:06,060
But judging by this scan,

1087
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:09,140
it's metastasized to your peritoneum.

1088
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:15,940
What are you talking about?

1089
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:21,740
I only came here due to indigestion.

1090
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,330
The pain is usually unbearable
at this stage.

1091
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,580
Look.

1092
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,460
I'm really not in any pain.

1093
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,500
I just have indigestion
every now and then.

1094
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,920
But I feel better every time I tend to it.

1095
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:42,590
Anyway, I don't have cancer.

1096
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,890
Don't be absurd.

1097
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,010
Ma'am.

1098
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,270
Are you sure the result is correct?

1099
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:51,690
Is the patient's name Jin Young-soon?

1100
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,400
No.

1101
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,610
That's not important.

1102
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,610
To tell the truth,

1103
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,330
my son is quite unwell right now.

1104
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,540
So I…

1105
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,210
I…

1106
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,670
I…

1107
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,100
I can't…

1108
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,100
Doctor.

1109
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:35,270
Please save me.

1110
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:37,110
This is…

1111
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,240
This is curable
if I receive surgery, right?

1112
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:45,570
I recently saw on the news that

1113
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:49,870
they've developed medicine
to cure last-stage cancer.

1114
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,830
Doctor, I'll…

1115
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,380
I'll do as you say

1116
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,840
and receive treatment.

1117
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,090
I promise.

1118
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,930
Doctor.

1119
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,090
I can't…

1120
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,720
I can't die.

1121
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:13,520
My son…

1122
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,230
Kang-ho…

1123
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,740
Mom!

1124
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,870
Are you okay?

1125
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:39,290
Kang-ho.

1126
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,380
Get up.

1127
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,420
I…

1128
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,690
Mom.

1129
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,450
Get up.

1130
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,750
Kang-ho.

1131
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,560
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1132
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,830
My mom is acting weird.

1133
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:02,630
She's low on energy
and doesn't smile anymore.

1134
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:07,170
You can slowly regain your memory
and learn one thing at a time.

1135
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,680
Who are we to criticize one another?

1136
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,300
We both messed up.

1137
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,640
Why should I die?

1138
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,720
Why should I die?

1139
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,310
I feel so bad for Young-soon.

1140
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:21,690
What will happen to that family?

1141
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,360
Then after 25 nights,

1142
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,860
you wean them.

1143
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:31,450
I'll only end up
becoming a burden to my unwell son.

1144
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,070
Mom!

1145
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:41,370
