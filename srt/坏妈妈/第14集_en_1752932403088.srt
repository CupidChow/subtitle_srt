1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,440
OH TAE-SOO

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,940
FINALE

4
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,110
I'LL BE TAESOCRATES DISSATISFIED
RATHER THAN A PIG SATISFIED

5
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm surprised to see you.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,080
I heard you were
badly injured in an accident.

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,120
I was surprised too.

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,120
I thought it was an accident.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,210
But it turns out,

10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,540
it wasn't an accident.

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,420
Just like how your mistress
Hwang Soo-hyun's corpse was discovered.

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,260
Are you here to--

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,180
No.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,430
I wouldn't have bothered to come here
if I was coming after you.

15
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,850
If a prosecutor
were to leak damaging information,

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,690
your opposing party…

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,610
No.

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,980
This entire country would be bent

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,900
on taking you down.

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,360
Choi Kang-ho.

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,490
I'll be straightforward with you.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,280
I only have one goal.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,990
It's to catch

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,710
Chairman Song, the man who murdered
my father and also attempted

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,710
to kill my mother and me.

26
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,260
I want you to testify against him

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,880
regarding all of his crimes
and corrupt deeds

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,970
that you swept under the rug.

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,810
Then I won't disclose your crimes.

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,230
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,140
Oh Ha-young.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,190
She's with me right now.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,710
Her resentment and hatred for you
seem quite deep.

34
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,290
If you refuse to testify,

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,040
then Ha-young will take the stand instead.

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,590
I'm not asking you for a favor.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm giving you a chance.

38
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,140
So what will it be?

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,520
Will you take down Song Woo-byeok with me

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,810
and become president?

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,440
Or will you side with him

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,280
and go to hell together?

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,950
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,120
Goodness, you're working hard
night and day.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Is our food here yet?

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,790
HOTEL CAPTAIN

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,420
Why did you put it back here?

48
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,510
-What are you doing?
-My gosh, you startled me!

49
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,970
What are you doing to our food?

50
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,010
Give it to me!

51
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,560
I was just curious about

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,390
what people at the Prosecutors' Office
have for a meal.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,730
But I guess they're no different from us.

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,230
Don't tell me

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,070
you spiked our food.

56
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,030
Hey.

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,450
Do you think it's that easy to get drugs?

58
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,830
I'd rather spend that money
on buying myself supplements.

59
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,370
I haven't slept well
since you guys arrived.

60
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,080
Look at how haggard I am.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,830
Can you tell?

62
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,880
You should just quit drinking.

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Sam-sik.

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,840
By the way,

65
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,300
is this what people call
an office romance?

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,890
What are you talking about? What romance?

67
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
The prosecutor
and his investigation officer.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,230
They're on fire!

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,320
Why are you crying?

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,570
Next, tell me what you and your dad
talked about on the day of the accident.

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm not sure about this.

72
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,410
What? What do you mean?

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,710
Even if I claim that he made me do it,

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,170
I have no evidence.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,960
Then I'll end up taking all the blame.

76
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,970
I know I should pay for what I've done.

77
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,930
But I'm afraid
that I may not be of any help

78
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,680
to Kang-ho.

79
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,180
You're already helping him greatly

80
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,520
by doing this.

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,820
He said he'll find evidence,

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,610
so let's trust him and wait.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,460
Song Woo-byeok has ties
with the prosecution and the court.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So it won't be easy to get a warrant.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,170
If you attack him
without being fully prepared,

86
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,470
he'll catch on to your plan.

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,140
And that'll put everyone in danger.

88
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,310
When will you return from the US?

89
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,520
If I could,

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,690
I'd love to stay and watch
the World Series before coming back.

91
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,320
Are you saying you'll neglect
the Woobyeok Beasts this season?

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,740
You're right.

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,410
I must be getting senile.

94
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,500
My goodness.

95
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,750
What a killer view.

96
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,920
I get to see this thanks to you.

97
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,220
By the way,

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,890
why are you here alone?

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,140
Did you have to do that?

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,310
I devoted my entire life

101
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,730
to serving you, sir.

102
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,730
Did you really have to try to kill me?

103
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,650
What are you…

104
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,490
Are you crying?

105
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,870
A grown man crying is embarrassing.

106
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,580
Sir, we should get going.

107
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,000
Hey.

108
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,090
If you made it out alive,

109
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,340
you should've fled
to another country to survive.

110
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,800
Why would you come back here
and drive a nail into your coffin?

111
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,970
In any case, I want to thank you.

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,980
When I heard that you were still alive,

113
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,310
I was hesitant about
going on this business trip.

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,690
But now, I can leave at ease.

115
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,690
Goodbye, then.

116
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,490
You asked why I came alone.

117
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,080
Mr. Cha will hear
everything you just said.

118
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,040
One of us

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,290
must stay alive to expose you.

120
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,210
You son of a bitch!

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,590
You were crying all this time,

122
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,550
and you start bargaining with me

123
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,550
when it's almost time
for my flight, you bastard?

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,480
What do you want?

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,900
Tell me! You'll be dead soon enough.

126
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,690
Do you need a house? Or money?

127
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,360
Do you want me to adopt you
like I did with Kang-ho?

128
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,360
I had the opportunity to farm
thanks to you.

129
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,950
Interestingly enough,
I reaped everything that I sowed.

130
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,080
You'll also reap what you've sown.

131
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,750
How dare you?

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,500
Die, you son of a bitch!

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,710
-Chairman Song.
-What?

134
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,060
Kang-ho.

135
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,020
You're alive?

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,400
My goodness.

137
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,860
I don't care about anything else.

138
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm completely fine as long as I have you.

139
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,700
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,570
But I've only just begun.

141
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,040
Song Woo-byeok.

142
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,160
You're under arrest for special assault

143
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,580
and attempted murder.

144
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,750
What are you doing?

145
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,670
You have the right to remain silent.

146
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,880
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

147
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,170
Kang-ho.

148
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,380
Will you be okay?

149
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,140
Please don't skip your meals.

150
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,510
Take him.

151
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,950
SO

152
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,910
Hello?

153
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,410
-Hey.
-Let me talk to Choi Kang-ho.

154
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,790
Kang-ho?

155
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,250
Kang…

156
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,540
Hold on.

157
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,960
It's for you.

158
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,090
-Hello?
-Choi Kang-ho.

159
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,590
Run away.

160
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,430
It'll be difficult
to obtain an arrest warrant

161
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,840
for Chairman Song's past crimes.

162
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,560
That only leaves us with one option.

163
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,680
We need to catch him red-handed.

164
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,190
But I heard he'll be going
on a business trip to the US.

165
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,110
When is that?

166
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,820
Here's the plan.

167
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,940
Once I get to the rooftop,
I'd like for you all to accompany me

168
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,360
and carry out a search and seizure
of Woobyeok Group. Got it?

169
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,410
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,070
Now that he's back,
I'm motivated to work hard.

171
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,210
Recently, a victim claimed to have
received death threats

172
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
from Chairman Song Woo-byeok,
and thus we conducted an investigation.

173
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,920
And yesterday at 2 p.m.,

174
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,010
we arrested him at the scene

175
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,260
at Woobyeok Group's headquarters

176
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,180
after he assaulted again
and attempted to murder the victim.

177
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,060
Since the suspect attempted
to destroy the victim's phone

178
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,770
and was due to fly out to the US,

179
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,940
we deemed it likely that he might
try to destroy evidence and flee.

180
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,280
How will you carry out this investigation?

181
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,950
-Sir.
-A civil servant

182
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,490
must be impartial
when serving the country.

183
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,990
As per the Prosecutor General's words
to carry out fair investigations

184
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,120
even against the powerful,

185
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,630
we will carry out an honest, transparent,
and thorough investigation.

186
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,380
-What is the victim's current state?
-Did the suspect admit to the charges?

187
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,310
Sir.

188
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,020
It's me, Oh Tae-soo.

189
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,730
Young-soon, hurry up. It's starting.

190
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,820
Coming.

191
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,820
When did you enter my heart

192
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,950
And make me fall in love?

193
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,200
Come on.

194
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,240
-You're…
-My babies.

195
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,660
I brought you some snacks.

196
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,000
Sweet potatoes again.

197
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,540
Do you not like sweet potatoes?

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,880
Do you want mung bean pancakes?

199
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,760
-That's enough.
-Come here.

200
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,420
Can we please just watch?

201
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,090
Is that the song that Mr. Baek wrote?

202
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,430
That's right.

203
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,640
Apparently, the song is very popular now.
What was the title again?

204
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,980
-"Intrusion into My Heart."
-That's right.

205
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,610
-Come here.
-Goodness.

206
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,150
How nice!

207
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,320
You're blocking the TV.

208
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,950
This is great!

209
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,530
Let us watch the TV.

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,200
Hold on.

211
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,830
Move aside! You're blocking the TV.

212
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,330
-What?
-What is it?

213
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,250
-What is that?
-What is that?

214
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,000
Song Woo-byeok from Woobyeok Group
was arrested?

215
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,290
What?

216
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,920
Chairman Song has allegedly
engaged in assault and death threats

217
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,550
prior to this incident.

218
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,640
People are in an uproar after learning
that there have been many victims.

219
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,760
Recently, a victim claimed to have
received death threats

220
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,430
from Chairman Song Woo-byeok,
and thus we conducted an investigation.

221
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
What am I looking at?

222
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,520
Is that Kang-ho?

223
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,610
Can you slap me?

224
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,610
It's him.

225
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,160
It hurts, so that must be Kang-ho.

226
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,990
It hurts, so that is Kang-ho!

227
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,080
Our son

228
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,950
Kang-ho is back!

229
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,500
Kang-ho!

230
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,080
That's Sam-sik's best friend,

231
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,750
Kang-ho!

232
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,250
What is this?

233
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,130
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,470
Did you not trust me?

235
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,140
Answer me!

236
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,260
We're in-laws!

237
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,600
-What?
-What?

238
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,100
-"In-laws"?
-With whom?

239
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,730
With me!

240
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,560
Right, Mother?

241
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,280
How about

242
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,570
we all visit Seoul together?

243
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,490
-Sure!
-We must!

244
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,570
Let's go!

245
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,290
Is your seat belt on?

246
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,080
Do you like fish?

247
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,290
Feel free to rest your head on this.

248
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,420
Move.

249
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,670
We could've gone by ourselves.

250
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,170
Why is he here?

251
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,210
Shut it.

252
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,300
If something happens to you on the way,
he'll suspect me.

253
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,630
Easy on the brakes.

254
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,760
I just had them replaced.

255
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,060
I bought this car to drive
to the award ceremony.

256
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,270
It fits five people perfectly.

257
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,730
You're right.

258
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,900
Gum-ja must've become
a widow for this very day.

259
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,020
What did you say?

260
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,320
I'll buy a bigger car soon,

261
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,820
so let's go again another time.

262
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,320
That sounds great!

263
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,700
Your son is still considered a suspect.

264
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,660
We still have our eyes on him.

265
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,790
I don't want to hear it.

266
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,500
Just keep your eyes on the road.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,630
Honey.

269
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,590
Are you watching from above?

270
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,760
The day has finally come.

271
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,470
Our son will carry out the judgment

272
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,850
that we failed to do.

273
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,780
Please help him stay strong.

274
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,030
Please help him not to doubt, falter,

275
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,990
or be intimidated.

276
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,120
Let him stay strong.

277
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
PROSECUTOR

278
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,970
Help him look them in the eye

279
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,890
and state the truth.

280
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,680
DEFENDANT

281
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,560
Just like how you did

282
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,270
in front of them,

283
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,020
please help Kang-ho

284
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,150
remain confident

285
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,740
until the end.

286
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,530
All rise.

287
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,160
With sincerity,

288
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,790
resentment,

289
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,210
and desperation…

290
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,550
I pray to you.

291
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,050
You may be seated.

292
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,180
Case 133 of the year 2023.

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,930
We will now begin the trial.

294
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,060
The assault that occurred
in Jou-ri on January 20

295
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,560
was just a simple fight between colleagues

296
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,320
over their pecking order.

297
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,860
So Ji-seok's claim
that Chairman Song Woo-byeok

298
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,280
ordered an assault
to be carried out is completely false.

299
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,370
The recent incident transpired

300
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,870
due to Mr. So attacking Chairman Song.

301
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,250
And the latter

302
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,040
simply reacted to defend himself.

303
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,460
Did you just say
that the victim attacked the defendant?

304
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,920
Are you talking about this?

305
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,380
Please play it.

306
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,600
Mr. Cha will hear
everything you just said.

307
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,970
One of us

308
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,390
must stay alive to expose you.

309
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,650
-You son of a bitch!
-What is that?

310
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,650
You were crying all this time,

311
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,730
and you start bargaining with me

312
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,610
when it's almost time
for my flight, bastard?

313
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,030
I'll submit this as evidence.

314
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,750
I'd like to question the victim
who's also the witness to that incident.

315
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,080
After the assault in Jou-ri,
you came to me for help and claimed

316
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,590
that the defendant was trying
to murder you. Is this correct?

317
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,960
Yes.

318
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,300
Why did he want to kill you?

319
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,680
Because as his trusted secretary,

320
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,260
I had a great deal of information
about his actions.

321
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,230
The defendant spent about
30 years as the CEO

322
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,020
of Yongra Construction and Woobyeok Group.

323
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,270
He must've had many employees
who worked closely with him,

324
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,990
and they must've known
a lot of private information as well.

325
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,240
Are you telling me that they're all dead?

326
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,120
Yes.

327
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,290
Objection, Your Honor.

328
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,540
-It hasn't been verified--
-Right, so I verified his claim.

329
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,590
In the past 30 years,

330
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,010
the defendant had four other secretaries

331
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,050
who worked closely with him.

332
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,470
Two committed suicide
and one died in a car crash.

333
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,390
And the last secretary's body
was recently found near Jemyeon Island.

334
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
It was Hwang Soo-hyun.

335
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,230
Your Honor, the prosecution is referring
to a case that is irrelevant to--

336
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,020
I'm verifying the witness' statement.

337
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,440
How is that irrelevant?

338
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,240
Prosecution.

339
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,160
You may continue.

340
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,200
That's right.

341
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,160
This USB was found
at the defendant's office

342
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,370
during a search and seizure.

343
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,960
Do you know what it contains?

344
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,340
It contains confidential documents
related to Woobyeok's corrupt deeds,

345
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,550
Chairman Song's double bookkeeping,
breach of trust, and embezzlement.

346
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,090
It belonged to Hwang Soo-hyun.

347
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,300
What is he talking about?

348
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,390
Hwang Soo-hyun?

349
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,310
Could you explain this video

350
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,980
that was found on your secretary's laptop?

351
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,600
Please play it.

352
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
Don't be ridiculous.

353
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,860
I already know the hit-and-run accident
and suicide were in the contract.

354
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,830
A year ago, Chairman Song
ordered me to visit Yang Gu-man's wife

355
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,540
and retrieve his money.

356
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,000
Jeez.

357
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,420
All right. Then I'd like
to ask the defendant.

358
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,330
According to the investigation,

359
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,210
Hwang Soo-hyun was last seen
before her death

360
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,050
on October 3, 2021.

361
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,590
It's the same day
the last video on this USB was saved.

362
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,510
So why was this USB found in your desk?

363
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,270
Look.

364
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,350
How would I know anything
about the USB or that Mr. Yang

365
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,940
when he's the one who schemed everything?

366
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,530
So you're claiming
that the victim schemed everything himself

367
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,570
and that you never murdered
or abetted murder?

368
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,620
Correct.

369
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,950
That's a lie!

370
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,870
He also ordered me to kill people.

371
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,790
He ordered you to kill people?

372
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,550
Who were they?

373
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,670
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant
in the murder case

374
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,880
that Chairman Song's grandson
was involved in,

375
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,100
and Park Cheol-su, the defendant
in the Woobyeok construction site case.

376
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,850
So did you carry out your orders?

377
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,020
They were both incarcerated,

378
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,940
so I couldn't.

379
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,150
I found a few odd things
during this investigation.

380
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,610
It is the fact that

381
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,740
not only the defendant's secretaries
but also many of those

382
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,160
who raised suspicions about
the defendant or his company

383
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,620
or were involved in the trials

384
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,090
suddenly passed away or disappeared.

385
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,010
Objection, Your Honor.
The prosecution is distorting the truth

386
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,760
solely based on the victim's claims.

387
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,340
Then let me summon another witness
who can verify this.

388
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,360
Approved.

389
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,410
Witness, Mr. Oh Tae-soo,

390
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,120
please come forward.

391
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,540
Oh Tae-soo?

392
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,910
Oh Tae-soo?

393
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,100
What is this?

394
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,890
Why is he testifying?

395
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,900
"I pledge this."

396
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,410
"I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

397
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,450
and agree to receive punishment

398
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,540
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

399
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,790
"Witness, Oh Tae-soo."

400
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,370
If Song Woo-byeok gets arrested,

401
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,590
Bareun Hanguk Party, the political
and business worlds, and even the media

402
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,380
will find fault with you.

403
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,510
Because everyone knows about

404
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,890
your secret ties with him
and how far they go back.

405
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,850
But what if

406
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,850
you testify against him?

407
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,020
It'd be a perfect chance
to dispel all the suspicions

408
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,440
regarding the relationship
between you and him.

409
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,820
You have indicted Chairman Song many times

410
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,200
for 30 years since 1987.

411
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,120
-Is this true?
-Correct.

412
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,370
However, most of these indictments
were dismissed.

413
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,920
The majority of these cases,
13 in total, were dismissed

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
due to the victims' deaths.

415
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,960
That's correct.

416
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,130
Did you ever find the repeated deaths

417
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,010
of the plaintiffs or victims rather odd?

418
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,220
There was no issue
in the investigation of their deaths,

419
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,020
and the bereaved families
didn't raise any suspicion.

420
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,310
So I didn't find them particularly odd.

421
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,650
However, I found something odd

422
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,280
in this trial.

423
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,530
It is the death of Hwang Soo-hyun,

424
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,490
his secretary.

425
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,660
She worked as my secretary

426
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,290
from 2018 to 2020.

427
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,840
Then one day in 2020,

428
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
she told me that she wanted to quit.

429
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,840
The reason being…

430
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,220
that getting pregnant
had put her life in danger.

431
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,600
Her pregnancy had put her life in danger?

432
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,020
Correct.

433
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,440
She said Chairman Song was the father.

434
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,530
If you do this,

435
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,830
all the disgusting work

436
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,750
that I forced myself to put up with
will go to waste.

437
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,290
I was even willing to serve time in jail

438
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,000
to make you become president,

439
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,630
you son of a bitch!

440
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,300
Defendant, please sit down!

441
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,010
How is that baby mine?

442
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,600
As if killing that poor baby
wasn't enough,

443
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,970
are you trying to
turn him into a bastard now?

444
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,480
You even plotted

445
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,810
to kill Choi Kang-ho with your daughter!

446
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,770
-You son of a bitch!
-Defendant!

447
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,770
-How dare you utter such nonsense?
-Please calm down!

448
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,400
You son of a bitch! I'm not going down.

449
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,160
No, not yet, honey.

450
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,740
If I waver right now,
our son will waver as well.

451
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,290
Everything he's done up to now
will be ruined.

452
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,580
Please, honey.

453
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,870
Keep me here for a little longer.

454
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,130
Please…

455
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,790
Just a little longer.

456
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
Sit down!

457
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,130
-Sir. Please.
-I ought to kill you.

458
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,720
Damn it!

459
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,180
It's true.

460
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,980
I slipped

461
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,650
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho sleeping pills.

462
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We will accept the prosecutor's request.

463
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,750
We believe verifying the facts
is of the utmost importance.

464
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,960
You may cross-examine the two witnesses.

465
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,590
I was deceived into believing that
Prosecutor Choi, my then fiancée,

466
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,260
had another woman and a baby.

467
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,810
And that he even killed them

468
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,560
so he could marry me.

469
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,980
Who told you that?

470
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,860
It was my father,

471
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,400
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo.

472
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,240
It's all my fault.

473
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,870
I've been threatened by Chairman Song
ever since I decided to run for president.

474
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,040
He wanted me to protect
his corrupt company

475
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,090
and himself.

476
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,300
When I refused,
he attempted to use my daughter

477
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,390
to get rid of Prosecutor Choi.

478
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,640
Why did Chairman Song want me dead?

479
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,180
That's because 35 years ago, Chairman Song

480
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,560
murdered Prosecutor Choi's father.

481
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,940
Is that true?

482
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,450
Simply put,

483
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,580
there were two people
Chairman Song needed to get rid of.

484
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,790
Hwang Soo-hyun, his mistress,

485
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,750
and Choi Kang-ho, Choi Hae-sik's son.

486
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,330
That's why he killed her

487
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,630
and framed Prosecutor Choi for it.

488
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,630
And after that, he ordered my daughter
to kill Prosecutor Choi.

489
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,090
Stop lying.

490
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,850
It was you who wanted him dead.

491
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,640
It was also you
who killed Hwang Soo-hyun and her baby.

492
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,270
They were your mistress and son.

493
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,400
I saw the DNA test result

494
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,110
with my own eyes.

495
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,590
This is my daughter's medical record
from the mental hospital.

496
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
That's right.

497
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,470
My daughter isn't sane.

498
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
I've been hiding it

499
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,180
in fear that my dear daughter
would get caught in political mudslinging.

500
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,350
Dad!

501
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,320
Dad.

502
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,240
What happened to you?

503
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,160
Who made you like this?

504
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Dad.

505
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,710
It's me.

506
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,840
It's me, Ha-young.

507
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,380
I'm Oh Ha-young, your beloved daughter.

508
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,720
I'm so scared right now.

509
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,850
I'm in so much pain.

510
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,400
Dad.

511
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,450
Can you please stop here?

512
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,490
I beg you.

513
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,330
Please come back, Dad.

514
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,870
Please?

515
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,960
Let's stop here.

516
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,620
Please?

517
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,380
Please consider that she qualifies
as an individual with a mental disorder

518
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,970
as per Article 10, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

519
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,190
There's another reason

520
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,490
that I helped my father.

521
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,320
It was because

522
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,950
my father schemed with Chairman Song

523
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,080
and murdered Choi Hae-sik,
Choi Kang-ho's father, 35 years ago.

524
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,510
Unbelievable.

525
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,800
At that time,

526
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,350
he bribed the detective in charge

527
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,470
and fabricated the marks
on the victim's body.

528
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,350
I believe my daughter
is very unstable right now.

529
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,190
I request that you adjourn this trial.

530
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,690
Witness, please sit down.

531
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,820
The court will decide whether to adjourn.

532
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,700
Taking their testimonies
into consideration,

533
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,870
I believe the answer to this case

534
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,540
lies in the death of Hwang Soo-hyun,

535
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,550
Chairman Song's former secretary.

536
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,670
Witness Oh Tae-soo
claims the defendant, Chairman Song,

537
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,510
murdered Hwang Soo-hyun.

538
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,010
But Song Woo-byeok and Oh Ha-young
claim that Oh Tae-soo killed her.

539
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,520
In addition,

540
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,480
the police consider me,
Choi Kang-ho, as a key suspect.

541
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,270
And it is most likely

542
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,980
that the baby's father killed her.

543
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,400
Then there's only one solution.

544
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,240
We'll see if the baby's DNA…

545
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,120
matches any of ours.

546
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,830
What is he saying?

547
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,870
Prosecution.

548
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,580
You're not allowed to summon
any more witnesses.

549
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
The baby…

550
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,360
is alive.

551
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,420
Choi Kang-ho.

552
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,720
You said you'd rather be

553
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,340
Taesocrates dissatisfied
rather than a pig satisfied.

554
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,720
But you're wrong.

555
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,140
No matter how hungry a mother pig is,

556
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,650
she wouldn't move recklessly
so as not to harm her piglets.

557
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,570
Someone like you who used his child
as a murder weapon

558
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,650
and heartlessly attempted to kill them

559
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,660
could never fathom such parental love.

560
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,660
Prosecutor Choi

561
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,420
is trying to taint my reputation
before the presidential election.

562
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,000
This is a political maneuver and slander.

563
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,840
I will find out who's behind this
and hold them responsible.

564
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,090
Please sit down.

565
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,180
-I refuse to testify anymore.
-Witness.

566
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,350
Stop, or I will consider it an attempt
at destroying evidence and fleeing.

567
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,560
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho!

568
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,180
You bastard.

569
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,560
Oh Tae-soo.

570
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,480
You, and your accomplice Song Woo-byeok,

571
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,690
are under arrest for abetting the murders
of Hwang Soo-hyun and her son,

572
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,570
myself and my mother, Jin Young-soon,

573
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,320
and Choi Hae-sik who died
in the 1988 arson case in Bongu-dong.

574
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,540
You have the right to remain silent.

575
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,040
Hurray!

576
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,340
Hurray for Choi Kang-ho!

577
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,090
-Hurray for my son!
-Hurray!

578
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,380
-Hurray!
-Hurray for Choi Kang-ho!

579
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,890
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

580
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,180
-Quiet down, everyone!
-Hurray!

581
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,310
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

582
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,140
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

583
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,500
Breaking news.

584
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,750
This afternoon,
Jeilmirae Party's Candidate Oh Tae-soo

585
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,170
was arrested for abetting murders.

586
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,800
The prosecution is investigating

587
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,510
Chairman Song's slush fund worth
hundreds of billions and the embezzlement…

588
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,890
He colluded with Oh Tae-soo
and destroyed evidence.

589
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,940
And in return, monopolized the
distribution rights for hand sanitizers…

590
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,190
This is the CCTV footage of the culprit
in front of the VIP ward.

591
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,360
Suspect Yoon Jae-min was found guilty
of using drugs and rape.

592
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,450
A retrial was filed
after digital forensics results

593
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,780
revealed that the fall of Jung Min-ho
at the construction site

594
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,990
was in fact
the fault of Woobyeok Construction.

595
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,170
The public is keenly interested
in the Bongu-dong fire incident

596
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,630
and Choi Hae-sik's death.

597
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,210
-Release Assemblyman Oh!
-Release Assemblyman Oh!

598
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,400
They say you shouldn't bark
if you can't bite.

599
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,950
You'll have to resign
if you want to take me down.

600
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,030
So what'll you do?

601
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,990
You're the one who taught me,

602
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,490
"Hit a home run or strikeout."

603
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,740
Now that I've hit a home run,

604
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,080
I'll gladly take a strikeout.

605
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,800
WE BELIEVE IN YOU, ASSEMBLYMAN OH

606
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
Excuse me.

607
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,560
Ye-jin.

608
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,060
"Happy" is spelled with a "p."

609
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,610
Turn the "d" letter upright.

610
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,480
Okay? Try it.

611
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,450
-Gosh, they look so happy.
-Here.

612
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,820
-Here, let me.
-All right.

613
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,030
All right.

614
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,160
-You little brat.
-What?

615
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,410
You should've told me sooner
that he had recovered.

616
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,420
I thought you'd urge me
to marry him if you found out.

617
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,130
What do you mean?

618
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,010
I didn't want to make you look bad.

619
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,130
Goodness.

620
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,880
Hey, did you hear?

621
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,390
Kang-ho and Mi-joo--

622
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,890
You heard?

623
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
I watched it.

624
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,650
What do you mean? Watched what?

625
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,440
The JBC drama.

626
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,190
Darn it. Move aside.

627
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,280
Hey.

628
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,950
Sam-sik, let me.

629
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,740
You must be tired from the trial.

630
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,910
You should just rest.

631
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,870
Since Mr. Sam-sik never works,
he can serve the food today.

632
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,750
In other words, he's jobless.

633
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,760
Seo-jin, you…

634
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,590
Sure, laugh while you still can.

635
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,060
Once you find out who Kang-ho really is,

636
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,350
you won't be laughing anymore.

637
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,270
Hey, watch what you say to a kid.

638
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,690
-Sam-sik, why are you idling around?
-Let's go.

639
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,940
What did you say to them?

640
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,440
Goodness.

641
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,280
I don't think I've ever felt

642
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,700
this happy and proud in my life before.

643
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,910
-Prosecutor Choi.
-Yes?

644
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,040
You were absolutely amazing today.

645
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,830
"Oh Tae-soo."

646
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,590
"You're under arrest for abetting murder."

647
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,220
Now,

648
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,760
let me introduce the woman
who raised this wonderful prosecutor.

649
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,310
The star of the day!

650
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,520
I bring you

651
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,350
Ms. Jin Young-soon!

652
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,600
Mom.

653
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,150
-Come on, Mom.
-Gosh.

654
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,820
-Hurray for Jin Young-soon!
-Jin Young-soon!

655
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,030
-My mom!
-Jin Young-soon!

656
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,860
Gosh.

657
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,410
You're embarrassing me.

658
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,000
It's already been 35 years

659
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,790
since I moved here
with a single pig on my truck.

660
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,010
I had no money or knowledge.

661
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,550
I was just

662
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,470
an unwelcome pregnant woman
who suddenly barged in here.

663
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,770
But you all welcomed me with open arms.

664
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,310
No, we didn't.

665
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,690
We hated the stinky pig smell
and protested your move.

666
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,860
You even carried Sam-sik on your back.

667
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,820
It's true.

668
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,150
You're right.

669
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,200
You barged into my house

670
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,700
wielding farm tools.

671
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,450
Then I suddenly went into labor.

672
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,790
And you helped me deliver Kang-ho.

673
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,000
Me too.

674
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,540
That's right.

675
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,090
-You were born in that room.
-Yes, Mi-joo too.

676
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,470
Just like how
we can't predict when we'll be born,

677
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,300
we can't predict when we'll die either.

678
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,390
I'd like to thank you all

679
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,400
while I still have a healthy mind.

680
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,190
People might say

681
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,650
that I'm the most unfortunate woman.

682
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,990
I lost my husband as well as my parents.

683
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,620
And then my son was seriously injured,
and I have an incurable illness.

684
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,620
I doubt there's anyone
who's more unlucky than me.

685
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,210
But you know what?

686
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,640
Life is so fascinating
and makes you grateful.

687
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,560
When it takes one thing from you,

688
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,940
it always replaces it with something else.

689
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,900
Losing my parents

690
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,690
taught me to value my husband.

691
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,490
And losing my husband
taught me to value my son.

692
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,240
And when my son was unwell,

693
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,540
I learned to value myself

694
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,920
so I could take care of him.

695
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,250
And because my life was cut short,

696
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,340
I learned to value everyone here,

697
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,010
who will be in his life in my stead.

698
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,930
Not many people are lucky enough

699
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,900
to encounter all these blessings
in their lifetime.

700
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,230
I'm truly blessed

701
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,990
for being able to live this precious life.

702
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,160
Mr. Son.

703
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,370
Yes?

704
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,000
Mr. Bang.

705
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,800
And Sung-ae and Gum-ja.

706
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,840
Thanks to you,

707
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,220
I've never felt lonely

708
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,470
and lived

709
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,480
such a chaotic, happy life.

710
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,400
Later…

711
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,400
Much later in life,

712
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,610
when you move
into the neighborhood up there,

713
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,990
I'll be the one

714
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,160
hurrying out
and welcoming you with open arms.

715
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,370
Gosh.

716
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,830
Goodness.

717
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,290
Please.

718
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,750
Until then,

719
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,000
I pray that you'll be healthy

720
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,760
for a very long time.

721
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,340
All right.

722
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,890
You better welcome us with open arms.

723
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,390
Sing for us too.

724
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,390
Gosh, I'm embarrassing myself.

725
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,520
One, two, three, four.

726
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,770
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

727
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:14,530
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

728
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,740
-Happy birthday, dear Young-soon
-Happy birthday, dear Young-soon

729
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,990
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

730
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,370
Wait.

731
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,540
Make a wish first.

732
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,800
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOM

733
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,230
All right, hop on.

734
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,730
I'll make rounds for getting into college,
passing the bar exam,

735
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,110
and becoming a prosecutor.

736
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,770
-Goodness.
-Yes, Kang-ho!

737
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,030
-Come on.
-You're awesome!

738
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,280
-Oh, no!
-Gosh!

739
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,870
-Gosh!
-Oh, my!

740
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,120
-Goodness.
-You're still very healthy, Mom.

741
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,330
Do it again.

742
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,580
-You should lose some weight.
-Carry me again.

743
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,660
All right. Here.

744
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,460
-All right.
-Let's do it again.

745
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,880
This is for getting into college!

746
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,140
Here.

747
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,850
This was the very first ring
your father-in-law got me.

748
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,900
And here.

749
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,030
This was the very first ring
I got your dad.

750
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,450
People say to love
as if it's your first time.

751
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,370
But

752
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,880
I'd like you to love
as if it's your last time.

753
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,420
"These are the last words
that they're going to hear from me."

754
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,340
"This is the last image of me

755
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,760
that they'll remember."

756
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,310
That mindset will make you
think twice about how you speak

757
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,520
and act towards each other.

758
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,520
Just like how

759
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,610
I still remember
your dad's last words to this day.

760
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,910
What were his last words?

761
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,160
"See you later."

762
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,330
He hated saying bye
because it implied an end.

763
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,380
That's why he always said,
"See you later," instead.

764
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,920
"See you later."

765
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,260
"See you later."

766
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,310
Saying it over and over
gave me butterflies

767
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:55,770
because it really felt like
we were going to meet again.

768
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,030
Think of each other as gems
and treat one another preciously.

769
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,160
Take good care and love each other.

770
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,500
And live a happy life.

771
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,660
-Okay?
-Okay.

772
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,920
Okay.

773
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,510
Come to think of it, both of you were born

774
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,840
in that room on the same day and time.

775
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:29,800
Right?

776
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,350
Mi-joo, your grandma once said this.

777
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,310
"We say it's meant to be…"

778
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,310
We say it's meant to be

779
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,570
to someone whom we meet
for the first time.

780
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,570
But fate is

781
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,660
what we say to someone
who stays with us until the end.

782
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,290
Don't you think our kids
were fated to end up with each other?

783
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,510
What?

784
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,680
Why are you here?

785
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,520
Are you going to sleep here?

786
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,770
Of course.

787
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,310
I'm going to sleep
next to you until I get married.

788
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,900
Goodness.

789
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,150
I should start looking
for a venue tomorrow.

790
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,320
What?

791
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,950
Do you hate it that much?

792
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,620
It's gross. You're a grown man.

793
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,080
It's not like you're Seo-jin or Ye-jin.

794
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,500
Seo-jin's eyes and lips remind me of you

795
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,040
when you were his age.

796
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,250
And Ye-jin

797
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,550
is excellent at drawing.

798
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,970
They're definitely your kids.

799
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,930
Whatever. I'm going to sleep with you.

800
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,730
-Lie down.
-Gosh, what are you doing?

801
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,440
Just lie down. Let's sleep side by side.

802
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,730
All right.

803
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,360
-Goodness.
-Here.

804
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
There.

805
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:10,950
All right.

806
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,030
Are you tired?

807
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,080
Yes.

808
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,580
I'm a bit tired.

809
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,290
It's been

810
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,500
a long journey.

811
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,300
Right?

812
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,470
All right. Let me massage your legs.

813
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,810
Goodness.

814
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,810
That's okay.

815
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,480
Come lie down.

816
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,610
Sing me a lullaby.

817
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,320
-What?
-That song.

818
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,950
The song you sang for me

819
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,660
after our first date.

820
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,910
I want to fall asleep to that song.

821
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,040
Okay. Your wish is my command.

822
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,140
A tiring day passed by

823
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,680
Two are under the moonlight

824
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,810
As one shadow

825
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,020
That distant happiness is

826
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,900
Still there seemingly within my reach

827
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,860
When I

828
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,740
Close my eyes

829
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,790
I'm so happy.

830
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,540
Though your wounded heart

831
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,920
May cast a shadow

832
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,180
On your dream

833
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,390
But don't forget

834
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,930
That someone

835
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,560
Who loves you dearly

836
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,030
Is by your side

837
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,450
At times, this road

838
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,280
May seem endless

839
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:28,330
And you may shed tears of sadness

840
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,420
But until the day

841
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,800
We can reminisce these moments

842
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,220
Let's become

843
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,020
A place of shelter for one another

844
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,430
Even if the dreams we yearn for

845
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,970
Can't be found

846
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,440
Over the rainbow in the future

847
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,320
These moments

848
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,320
That we spend

849
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,490
Together

850
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,870
Are more important

851
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,880
Than anything else…

852
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,340
Mom…

853
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,140
Mom…

854
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,940
Mom.

855
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,860
See you later.

856
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,330
LATE JIN YOUNG-SOON

857
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,720
REST IN PEACE

858
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,490
When will I need to do this?

859
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,610
Later.

860
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,530
Much later.

861
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,280
So let's try it.

862
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,740
Goodness.

863
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,200
Goodness.

864
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:55,540
Goodness.

865
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,420
Goodness.

866
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,300
-Goodness.
-I am happy

867
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,050
I am happy

868
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,850
I am happy

869
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,390
I am very very happy

870
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,150
The long awaited day has come

871
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,690
I am

872
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,740
Happy

873
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,910
I am happy

874
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:38,380
I am happy

875
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,460
I am very very happy

876
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,510
That's right.

877
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,640
-I am happy
-I am happy

878
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,560
-I am happy
-I am happy

879
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,770
-I am happy
-I am happy

880
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:01,690
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

881
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:06,610
-I am happy
-I am happy

882
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,950
-I am happy
-I am happy

883
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:15,000
-I am happy
-I am happy

884
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,460
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

885
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,380
-I am happy
-I am happy

886
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,470
-I am happy
-I am happy

887
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,100
-I am happy
-I am happy

888
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,930
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

889
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,480
-I am happy
-I am happy

890
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,400
-I am happy
-I am happy

891
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,320
-I am happy
-I am happy

892
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,870
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

893
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,830
I am happy

894
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:59,410
I am happy

895
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,850
I told you to stop calling me.

896
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,850
What if the kids catch on to us?

897
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,900
You released another new song?

898
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,070
"The Lovely Gumja Tower"? Get out.

899
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,610
I told you not to name
your songs so obviously.

900
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,950
So tell me.

901
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,200
When will you be visiting again?

902
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,250
Visit at dawn.

903
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,550
When everyone is still fast asleep.

904
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,930
That was Grandma Jung, the crazy--

905
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:00,060
I mean, that was Grandma Jung
who's crazy in love.

906
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,440
By the way, what are you doing?

907
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,110
I'm searching for stroke symptoms.

908
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,400
Her pronunciation is off.

909
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,070
I'm happy

910
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,530
Where's Sam-sik?

911
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,660
What is it? Is something missing again?

912
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,290
He stole my brand new
cashmere long johns, socks,

913
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,540
and underwear!

914
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,710
What could he possibly use them for?

915
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,800
I'm speaking from experience.

916
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,050
Goods from outside are much better.

917
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,180
These are

918
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,760
cashmere long johns,
so they're extremely light

919
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:39,810
and warm.

920
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,560
And these socks are from a famous brand.

921
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,730
You'll look awfully stylish
if you wear these

922
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,980
under that cobalt uniform.

923
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,650
As for the underwear…

924
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:54,900
Would they be too big for you?

925
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,450
My mom does have a big butt.

926
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:02,660
Thank you.

927
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,330
Gosh, don't mention it.

928
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,710
Two years will pass

929
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,590
in the blink of an eye.

930
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,090
They will just fly by.

931
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,380
What's truly important

932
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,050
is that you and I are meant to be.

933
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,760
Meant to be.

934
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,020
Do you need anything else?

935
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,020
Do you need sesame oil?

936
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,940
Red chili powder?

937
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,110
We grew some tasty cabbage this year.

938
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,900
Would you like some?

939
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,370
-I am happy
-I am happy

940
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,000
-I am happy
-I am happy

941
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,790
-I am happy
-I am happy

942
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,340
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

943
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,460
Gosh, what's your secret?

944
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,590
You always have a bountiful harvest.

945
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:57,840
There's no secret.

946
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,140
You just reap what you sow.

947
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,350
What's with the cars
in front of Mr. Son's house?

948
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,690
No, don't come out, Tiger.

949
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,240
Honey!

950
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,320
Wait!

951
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,070
What's happening?

952
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,160
Why are you leaving out of the blue?

953
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,750
Thank you for everything you've done.

954
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,970
My father re-established
a newly-rising yakuza.

955
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,140
So I must return.

956
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,720
You irritated everyone
with your perfect Korean.

957
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,770
But now, you speak with an accent.

958
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,730
This isn't fair.

959
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,860
Then what were
all those years we spent together?

960
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,820
No.

961
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,490
What was I to you?

962
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,950
Was I just for your enjoyment?

963
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,700
I couldn't even enjoy you.

964
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,410
You know that.

965
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,750
It's time. Please get in the car.

966
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,630
Wait.

967
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,310
Pregnant?

968
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,850
What?

969
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,480
Tell Father that I am carrying
someone's child.

970
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,360
How's that possible?

971
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,830
Honey.

972
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,130
HAPPY FARM

973
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,880
There he is.

974
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,090
Mom.

975
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,130
-Jong-gu!
-Mom!

976
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,010
-Mom!
-What took you so long?

977
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,310
Mom, don't cry.

978
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,720
My poor son.

979
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,600
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

980
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,060
Mr. Jung Jong-gu.

981
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,270
I'm sorry it took so long.

982
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,240
Don't be.

983
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,160
I knew you'd come back for me.

984
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,820
Thank you.

985
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,910
Sir, here.

986
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,500
Your mother has been sending us kimchi,

987
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,340
side dishes, and red chili powder.

988
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,840
We wanted to refuse,

989
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,050
but they were so delicious.

990
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,840
So we've been accepting them
all this time.

991
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,970
Please tell her
she doesn't have to anymore

992
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,180
and that we're grateful.

993
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,110
I will.

994
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,650
Kang-ho!

995
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,530
Kang-ho!

996
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,110
Be careful.

997
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,040
Dad!

998
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,410
-Seo-jin!
-Ye-jin!

999
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,000
He's my dad? I will never accept that.

1000
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,000
How could she steal
her own daughter's man?

1001
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,050
Where are you going?

1002
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,170
Let's play together.

1003
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,180
Let's play together.

1004
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,890
Come on.

1005
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:31,010
Ye-jin.

1006
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,270
Hi.

1007
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,230
We just moved here today.

1008
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,360
Where does the village head live?

1009
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,990
The trip there will be quite rough.

1010
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,110
So let me escort you there myself.

1011
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,660
This way, Mother.

1012
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:53,870
HAPPY FARM

1013
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,040
When did you decorate all this?

1014
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,620
Where did you get the money?

1015
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,210
Do you remember this?

1016
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,670
It's the bankbook you gave me.

1017
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,140
I wanted to throw this at your face
the next time we met,

1018
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,010
so I didn't spend a single penny.

1019
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,390
But you know what?

1020
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,430
Your mom told me

1021
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,980
to think of you as a gem
and treat you preciously.

1022
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,440
-Right. Come here.
-What?

1023
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,740
PIG FARM, OFFICE
WELCOME, HAPPY FARM

1024
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,070
Take a look.

1025
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,490
Look.

1026
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,040
That's Father, and that's Mother.

1027
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,660
And I love this photo.

1028
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,960
We took this to commemorate

1029
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,050
the donation we gave
under the name of Happy Farm

1030
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,210
after receiving a prize
for our pig farm business.

1031
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,760
This was such a proud moment, wasn't it?

1032
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,130
It was.

1033
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,100
This is the cutest photo of you
taken on your first birthday.

1034
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,730
And that's a photo
of your parents' wedding.

1035
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,650
And…

1036
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:10,860
I thought long and hard about
what photo to hang next to it.

1037
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,160
And I think

1038
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,580
it'd be nice to hang
something similar to this one.

1039
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,160
If you have any good ideas, let me know.

1040
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,170
Okay?

1041
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,040
-Next to that one?
-Yes.

1042
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,170
Go get changed.

1043
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,630
Okay.

1044
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,710
To my beloved son, Kang-ho.

1045
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,050
Do you remember the very first letter
you had written to me?

1046
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,050
"We may be apart,

1047
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:19,350
but I still live

1048
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:23,270
in the memories
I shared with you and Father."

1049
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,570
By the time you read this letter,

1050
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,940
I'll be feeling the same.

1051
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,700
Kang-ho.

1052
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,660
The Chinese character for "connection"

1053
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:40,750
contains the characters
for "thread" and "pig head."

1054
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,830
The connections we build with others
are just as difficult

1055
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,840
as leading a pig with a thread.

1056
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:57,300
You and I were connected
as mother and son.

1057
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,020
It's such a precious bond

1058
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,600
so I wanted to become
the best mom for you.

1059
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,730
But you only get one life

1060
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:10,320
and it was my first time being a mom,

1061
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,150
so I'm sorry that I wasn't good enough.

1062
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,990
I made a wish before blowing out
my birthday candles.

1063
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,210
I prayed that
I'd become your mom once again.

1064
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:27,960
If that ever happens,

1065
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,590
I promise to be a better mom.

1066
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:39,350
I won't tell you not to be sad about
not having a dad.

1067
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:43,930
I won't say that your grades
are all that matters in life.

1068
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:49,310
I won't ignore your talent for drawing.

1069
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,070
I won't turn away

1070
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,530
when I know that you want to eat more.

1071
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,530
I won't hold back my tears

1072
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,280
when I see you in pain.

1073
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,710
I'll help you get up when you fall.

1074
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,080
I'll embrace you when you're afraid.

1075
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,790
I'll say, "Good job,"

1076
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,420
"thank you,"

1077
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,840
and "I love you,"

1078
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,550
every single day.

1079
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,100
And I won't

1080
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,850
leave you so soon.

1081
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,480
I love you, my son.

1082
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,070
I hope you live a long, happy life

1083
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,740
with Mi-joo, Seo-jin, and Ye-jin.

1084
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,410
And we'll meet again

1085
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,580
on the day my prayer is answered.

1086
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,950
From your bad mother.

1087
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,610
Today

1088
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,990
is the day propose to Mi-joo

1089
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,450
to ask her to live
a long and happy life with me.

1090
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,990
But you ruined everything.

1091
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,710
Please watch over me

1092
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,340
so that I won't be too nervous.

1093
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,180
No.

1094
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:45,890
Protect us.

1095
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,980
Lee Mi-joo!

1096
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,690
You're under arrest for becoming my wife!

1097
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,120
You don't have the right to remain silent.

1098
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,410
You cannot ask your mother for help
when we argue.

1099
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,790
How childish.

1100
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,830
This isn't a proposal.

1101
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:12,160
-Why not?
-What you just said

1102
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,880
might be used against you later in life.

1103
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,250
So watch out, okay?

1104
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,920
-This won't do.
-What?

1105
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:21,670
All right. I need your help.

1106
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,220
-What?
-All right.

1107
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,720
Lee Mi-joo!

1108
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,770
I saved your life three times.

1109
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,690
So even if I get so annoying,

1110
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,190
even if we argue,

1111
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:36,610
and even if I get downright childish,

1112
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:41,820
promise to live with me happily
for the rest of our lives.

1113
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,450
All right, go ahead.

1114
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,830
-Come here.
-Go to mommy.

1115
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:53,660
-No!
-Oh, no!

1116
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:35,660
-Kang-ho! Hang on, I…
-We have to look good.

1117
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,670
Come on, think of our age.

1118
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:43,010
-He is a napa cabbage flower
-Napa cabbage flower

1119
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:47,760
A new wind will blow

1120
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,800
SAM-SIK'S MILL

1121
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:51,720
I don't even eat marinated crabs

1122
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,350
because it's so good
I'd steal to eat them!

1123
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:54,560
I hate stray cats even more.

1124
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,640
They're like little thieves.

1125
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:59,190
Do you know how shocked I was

1126
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,520
when The Thieves was released?

1127
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,320
Hey!

1128
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:25,630
