00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,900
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,690
Look at that color.

4
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,280
This year's kimchi will be delicious.

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,230
Of course.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,620
It's due to these
fully-ripened red chilis.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
We couldn't sun-dry the chilis last year

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,580
because of all the rain.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm glad the weather's nice this year.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,790
Hello.

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,330
You're here.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,210
Oh, my. Look at the color
of the red chili powder.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,550
Wait.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,010
That's her, right?

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,430
You're right.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,020
Grandma!

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
That lady who came
with Kang-ho oppa last time

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,810
is getting married.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,310
-What?
-What?

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
-Oh, my.
-What are you talking about?

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
What?

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,110
-What?
-Let me see.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,900
-What?
-Oh, my. She's right.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,080
So she was
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's daughter?

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,870
Does that mean Kang-ho

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,160
almost became the president's son-in-law?

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,410
-Goodness.
-My goodness.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,540
That's not what's important right now.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,420
Goodness, that cursed brat.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,130
It hasn't been that long
since Kang-ho's accident

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,800
and she's already marrying someone else?

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,430
If it were the son of Dosang Group,
I'd get married in an instant too.

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,430
Don't say something like that
in front of your husband.

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,060
Knock on wood right now.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,430
-Knock, knock, knock.
-Knock, knock, knock.

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,850
Young-soon's already so stressed out.

37
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,850
She'll be really upset when she finds out.

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,980
What are you saying?

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,860
We can never let her find out, okay?

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,530
-Make sure you all keep it a secret!
-Okay.

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,700
I already know.

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,030
-What?
-Goodness!

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,620
Everyone has the right
to live their own life.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,240
She's right.
The living has to go on living.

45
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,450
That's enough.

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,580
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

47
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,460
Mr. Bang, may I speak with you?

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,250
Me?

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,000
-Push it in until it clicks.
-Yes.

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,090
-Then you'll see this window.
-Right.

51
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,800
Put the cursor right here.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,840
-Do you see the cursor?
-Yes.

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,640
Click twice quickly,

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,640
then you can see it like this.

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,390
Thank you so much.

56
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,730
It wasn't anything.

57
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,350
If you have any more questions,

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,650
-call me anytime.
-Okay.

59
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,980
Kang-ho, I'll be going now.

60
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,440
Okay. Thank you.

61
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,570
-My goodness.
-Oh, my back.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,280
All right.

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,490
Click here twice, right?

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,240
Click-click.

65
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,000
What's this?

66
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,540
Password.

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,370
-Password.
-Password.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,420
Password. 0907, my birthday.

69
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,630
That's for our bank account.

70
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,010
But you never know.

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,020
Zero, nine, zero, seven.

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,770
ENTER PASSWORD

73
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,100
Of course. It wouldn't be this easy.

74
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,480
What could it be?

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,860
What could it be, Kang-ho?

76
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,860
Any numbers you remember?

77
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,820
Numbers?

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,950
Numbers…

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,660
Numbers…

80
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,170
-Mom.
-Yes?

81
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,580
Isn't your birthday on March 12?

82
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,960
Oh, my.

83
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,840
Do you remember my birthday?

84
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,390
Mom, this is weird.

85
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,680
This was written on September 7,

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,220
but it says I'll see you next week
on your birthday.

87
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,390
You're right.

88
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,230
"I'll see you next week on your birthday."
Could this mean…

89
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,900
Zero, three, one, two.

90
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,780
-It's correct!
-We did it, Mom!

91
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,620
You're so smart. How did you catch that?

92
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,580
All right. Let's see what's in here.

93
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,590
Kang-ho,

94
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,300
this looks like your journal.

95
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,350
"March 3, 2008."

96
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,350
MARCH 3, 2008
I FINALLY GOT INTO SNU SCHOOL OF LAW…

97
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,180
WELCOME, FRESHMEN OF 2008
JOIN A CLUB

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,480
I finally got into SNU School of Law.

99
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,990
Choi Kang-ho, the top student
in this year's entering class.

100
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,370
Tell us why you chose law school.

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,290
Korea is a constitutional state
that protects liberal democracy.

102
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,420
Law is meant to provide public welfare

103
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,590
for the happiness
and benefit of the majority,

104
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,420
as well as justice for all…

105
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,680
As well as justice for all…

106
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,440
For what reason did your dad die?

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,400
I need to know that!

108
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
Actually,

109
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,860
I wanted to find out for myself.

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,570
What?

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,700
I want to find out the reason why

112
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,490
I had to attend law school.

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,080
That's why I'm here.

114
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,790
Kang-ho!

115
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,580
DETECTIVE UNIT 1

116
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,840
Kang-ho.

117
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,630
What…

118
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,050
What happened to you?

119
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,670
What happened to my son?

120
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,550
They got into an argument
over grades at school,

121
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,470
and Mr. Choi initiated
a physical altercation,

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,730
so he'll be booked on charges
unless they can reach a settlement.

123
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,850
Settlement?

124
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,020
I don't want to settle.

125
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,570
He didn't attend class,
take tests, or complete homework,

126
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,980
yet he's at the top of our class.

127
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,200
How could they fabricate his grades
and award him a scholarship

128
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,990
just because his mother's a judge?

129
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,070
-And at a law school at that.
-Damn it.

130
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,080
I'd like to add defamation

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,620
and dissemination of false information.

132
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,670
No, wait.

133
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,130
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,670
Let me apologize on his behalf.

135
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,420
He's always earned scholarships

136
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,340
to help out his mom who's a pig farmer

137
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,090
and was probably disappointed
not to come out as the top of the class.

138
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,010
Please.

139
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,180
Damn it.

140
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,680
Damn, I was wondering what that smell was.

141
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,400
If it seemed so unfair, why didn't you
major in livestock production?

142
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,650
Then your farmer mom
could have helped you.

143
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,900
You bastard.

144
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
Ma'am!

145
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,610
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,450
Please forgive him just once.

147
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,330
Come here and beg.

148
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,750
Tell him you were wrong.

149
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,130
Beg him, or you'll go to jail!

150
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,050
-Beg for forgiveness!
-Mom.

151
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,550
-Beg him for forgiveness!
-Mom.

152
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,300
-Do it!
-Mom!

153
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
So you're saying…

154
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,560
I have to beg this jerk?

155
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,600
You're telling me to
kneel before this son of a bitch

156
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,940
because I can't take the bar exam
if I go to jail.

157
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,270
Right.

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,030
That's what you want.

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,530
You want me to become a cowardly snob
who'd do anything to get my way.

160
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Hey.

161
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,130
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,550
I didn't know my place and got cheeky.

163
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me just this once.

164
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,760
Please let me take the bar exam.

165
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,680
Please forgive me.

166
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,140
No, please forgive me, sir.

167
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,890
-On that day,
-Just this once.

168
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,860
I realized why,

169
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,520
for what reason…

170
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,150
JUNE 18, 2009

171
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,240
…I had to attend law school,

172
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,950
and what I must do from now on.

173
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,460
Excuse me. I'm the bereaved.

174
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,930
I'd like to see my father's trial record
and the ruling.

175
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,180
SON: KANG-HO

176
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,010
FAMILY HEAD: CHOI HAE-SIK

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,560
I can only view the ruling?

178
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,140
I followed the procedure to get
his trial and witness examination records.

179
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,400
So why can't I see it?

180
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,650
Trial records
and witness examination records

181
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,190
include sensitive contents,
so we cannot release them.

182
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,450
But my father has already passed.

183
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,780
Disclosure of trial records

184
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,030
falls within the jurisdiction of the
prosecutor the case was transferred to,

185
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,080
so we cannot give them to you
if they decline.

JUDGMENT

188
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,760
THE EVIDENCE CORRESPONDING TO ARSON…

189
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,600
DEFENDANT: SONG WOO-BYEOK
PROSECUTOR: OH TAE-SOO

190
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,520
Locate the suspect
and bring him in, you punk.

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,730
What arrest warrant?

192
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,810
What?

193
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,440
Why are you still here?

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,480
Please show me.

195
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,780
According to the
Official Information Disclosure Act,

196
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,610
the bereaved family is entitled
to the investigation report.

197
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,240
This is a dereliction of duty.

198
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,580
What?

199
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,870
Dereliction of duty?

200
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,410
I can't believe this.

201
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,620
Hey, who do you think you are, you punk?

202
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,170
Are detectives a joke
just because you study law?

203
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,710
-No, that's not--
-Forget it.

204
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,550
You need to leave.

205
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,760
Take the bar exam,

206
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,470
become a prosecutor,

207
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,890
and then come arrest me
for my dereliction of duty.

208
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,010
Then I'll give you
every investigation report

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,350
from 22 years ago,
no, even from 100 years ago.

210
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,940
-Get out of here.
-Detective.

211
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,060
Get lost, you punk! I'm busy!

212
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,870
Once you study hard
and become a prosecutor,

213
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,460
no one will be able to
look down on you or bully you.

214
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,290
That's true power.

215
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,340
Do you understand?

216
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,510

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,030
Top graduate of the School of Law,
Choi Kang-ho.

220
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,070
The student has graduated
as the top student of the Class of 2013…

221
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,750
PRE-LAW AND LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION

222
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,580
I'll send money to this account monthly
from now on.

223
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,130
And find a bigger place too.

224
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,380
Okay?

225
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,050
BANKBOOK

226
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,680
That's when I met her.

227
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,440
The one who shed a ray of warm light

228
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,610
into my dark, cold, and rough life.

229
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,610

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,910
Look at that.

232
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,120
The nerdy Kang-ho
has a rather elegant hobby.

233
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,000
You're going to ballet?

234
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,790
I'm not going for the ballet.

235
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,710
It's to see Chief Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo.

236
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh Tae-soo?

237
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,170
Oh Ha-young is his daughter.

238
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,680
No matter how busy he is,
he always attends her ballet galas.

239
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,180
It's a perfect chance to see him up close.

240
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
I might even get to greet him
if I get lucky.

241
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,940
You aren't just a fanatic.
You're a stalker.

242
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,810
Guys!

243
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,980
Big news.

244
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,400
Chief Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo

245
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,030
is coming to our next special lecture!

246
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,200
Really?

247
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,240
Good for you, Kang-ho.
You were dying to meet him.

248
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,660
Hey, my mom told me

249
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,240
Chief Prosecutor Oh will resign next year

250
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,870
and run for office.

251
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,830
He is? Instead of becoming
the prosecutor general?

252
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,670
It means he has bigger plans ahead.

253
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,710
No way.

254
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,670
The presidency?

255
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,260
Bingo.

256
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,470
Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo, who was in charge
of my father's trial 28 years ago,

257
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,560
became the chief prosecutor
of the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office.

258
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,520
Have we met before?

259
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,020
You look familiar.

260
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,230
No, sir.

261
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,940
-We've never met.
-Dad.

262
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,110
We're late. Let's go.

263
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,490
Okay.

264
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,530
The newly appointed
probationary judicial officers

265
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,240
of Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office, welcome.

266
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,830
I'll debrief you on the locations
of each office and their current tasks

267
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,250
so make sure you keep up.

268
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,630
All right.

269
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,170
Penalty Enforcement Division
One and Two work over there.

270
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,090
That's the archives.

271
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,970
You'll find all files
and case records regarding a trial.

272
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,970
Next, the Criminal Department.

273
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,260
Come on, chicks.

274
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,220
-Peep, peep.
-Peep, peep.

275
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,480
-Chicks.
-Peep, peep.

276
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,520
Peep, peep.

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,060
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

278
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,110
Excuse me.

279
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,230
Hello.

280
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm Choi Kang-ho,
a probationary judicial officer

281
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,490
-of Criminal Division 8.
-Hello.

282
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,950
Pardon me,

283
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,040
but may I ask you for another case file?

284
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,960
Sure.

285
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,290
CASE 614 OF THE YEAR 1988

286
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,460

287
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,970
CASE 614 OF THE YEAR 1988

288
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,050
I finally got my father's trial record
that I always longed to see.

289
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,930
I'm sure the beginning
of my mother and my twisted fate

290
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,020
can be found in this record.

291
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,520
CHARGED WITHOUT DETENTION
CHARGED WITH ARSON

292
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,020
LIST OF EVIDENCE

293
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,780
REPORT OF TRIAL

294
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,820
Hey, it's that exam meal punk…

295
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,120
I mean, it's Bar Exam Meal.

296
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,700
Hey.

297
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,540
-Should I wait?
-I'll be out.

298
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,460
He's so devoted.

299
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,170
He doesn't miss a single day.

300
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,380
Just get married
if you two are so in love.

301
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,970
He hasn't even been appointed yet.
It's too soon to think about marriage.

302
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,090
That's it. The appointment ceremony.

303
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,350
His mother will come to Seoul that day.

304
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,930
He'll officially introduce you to her
and propose.

305
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,890
You think so?

306
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,100
Of course!

307
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,730
Darn it. He's messing up the window.

308
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,190
-Hey, wipe that off!
-Okay.

309
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,230
Sun-young, I'm off now.

310
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,570
You clean up the window!

311
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,910
Okay, Sun-young. Love you. Bye.

312
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,660
Make sure you wipe it tomorrow!

313
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,160
-Okay, bye!
-Okay.

314
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,740
I'll do it.

315
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,290
-Here.
-What is this?

316
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,080
You were curious about the food
at the Prosecutors' Office.

317
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,760
You packed all this?

318
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,590
Yes. I'm the best, right?

319
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,300
Of course, you are.

320
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,010
You stole food from the office.

321
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,310
What if they catch you red-handed
and arrest you for theft?

322
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,060
Goodness, Mi-joo. You know the law?

323
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,150
I've learned plenty being by your side.

324
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,690
Feel free to ask me
if you have any questions.

325
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,320
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,570
All right.

327
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,870
Tell me what you can
make out of this situation.

328
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,830
Sure.

329
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
-A prosecutor requested a witness
-Okay.

330
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,160
for his case.

331
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,790
And that witness

332
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,880
made a statement
against the victim in court.

333
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,290
Why did he do that?

334
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,750
Wait.

335
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,630
The prosecutor must have
called that witness

336
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,510
-to help the victim, right?
-Yes.

337
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,220
But the witness
testified against the victim?

338
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,850
That means the witness changed their mind.

339
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,890
-Exactly.
-Hey.

340
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,440
Then it's obvious.

341
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,190
The witness could've held a grudge
against the victim.

342
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,690
Or they purposely
decided to screw them over.

343
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,650
Or something must've
changed their mind before the trial.

344
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,370
For example, they could've been
threatened or bribed.

345
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,410
Right?

346
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,620
That's obviously the case, right?

347
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,040
Kwak Sang-cheol.

348
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,170
A firefighter who was close to my father

349
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,630
and often came to inspect his farm
for fire prevention.

350
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,010
But during the trial,

351
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,760
he gave a questionable testimony that
there were many problems

352
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,060
with the electrical facility
at my father's farm.

353
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,190
Excuse me.

354
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,360
Are you Mr. Kwak Sang-cheol?

355
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,400
I should've never done that to Hae-sik.

356
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,990
I'm so sorry.

357
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,330
But I thought we'd all be in danger
if I continued to resist.

358
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,790
Danger? What do you mean?

359
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,500
Mr. Kwak, you're a civil servant, right?

360
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,720
If a civil servant hinders
a state project,

361
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,220
it makes them a communist.

362
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,010
I get that it's for our country,
but how could you set his farm on fire?

363
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,810
Right? I agree with you.

364
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,940
I shouldn't have burnt his farm down.

365
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,690
If I set his house on fire,

366
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,530
we wouldn't be in so much trouble, right?

367
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,070
YONGRA

368
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,740
A fire begins without warning.

369
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,490
It can start at your house

370
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,580
or even at your mother's hospital.

371
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,750
Right?

372
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,210
Always beware of fire.

373
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,710
Let's not let down our guard!

374
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,090
You have a great place here.

375
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,170
Goodness.

376
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,100
I thought something was off
when I heard Hae-sik had passed away.

377
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,890
I had a feeling that
those men were behind it.

378
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,690
But there was absolutely no evidence
after the investigation,

379
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,560
and I had to keep my mouth shut,

380
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,440
afraid of Director Song's retaliation.

381
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,900
By Director Song, you mean…

382
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,610
You're right.

383
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,070
Director Song Woo-byeok
of Yongra Construction,

384
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
who fought against your father in court.

385
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,200
He's now Woobyeok Group's chairman.

386
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,580
WOOBYEOK'S CHAIRMAN SONG…

387
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,220
I'm home.

388
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,350
-Hey.
-Hey.

389
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,470
How have you been?

390
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,430
Fine.

391
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,150
Your mother is coming to your
appointment ceremony tomorrow, right?

392
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,530
No.

393
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,660
What?

394
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
She's not coming? Why not?

395
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,250
Did you not tell her about it?

396
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,420
Kang-ho, you shouldn't--

397
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,330
Mi-joo.

398
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,130
All right.

399
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,180
What about me?
When and where should I go tomorrow?

400
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,430
I'm sorry.

401
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I should go alone tomorrow.

402
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,150
I have to be somewhere right after.

403
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,060
-It's important.
-But…

404
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,400
All right then.

405
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,530
It'll be weird for me to go if your mother
won't be there either, right?

406
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,830
Instead, let's have
a party tomorrow night.

407
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,830
Let's do that.

408
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll wash up.

409
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,380
And now,

410
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,970
the parents and families
of new prosecutors

411
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,050
may come up and put the gown on them.

412
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,980
Please show your support by putting
the untainted black gown on them,

413
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,980
a symbol for them to maintain
fairness and impartiality

414
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,600
in their journey as prosecutors.

415
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,610
Newly appointed prosecutors shall relay
a warm regard to your parents

416
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,820
for supporting you
over a long period of time.

417
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,700
Please encourage one another.

418
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,860
Congratulations.

419
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,070
Prosecutor's oath.

420
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,490
-Our oath!
-Our oath!

421
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,410
As of this moment,
I accept the call of my country and people

422
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
and receive the honor
to serve as a prosecutor.

423
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,420
So you're a prosecutor?

424
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,340
Your mother must be quite disappointed.

425
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,840
I heard about your baby. Congratulations!

426
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,300
Hae-sik is so thrilled that
he's already wondering whether it'd be

427
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,050
a son or daughter and thinking of names.

428
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,020
I'll be happy with either a girl or a boy.

429
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,180
I just want our baby to be healthy

430
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,650
and raise them to be a painter.

431
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,570
-A painter?
-Yes.

432
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,570
I always wanted to be a painter.

433
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,490
My parents passed away
while I was preparing for art school,

434
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,950
so I had to give up.

435
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,080
I have a feeling that our baby
will take after me and be good at drawing.

436
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,130
Isn't that so?

437
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,630
I will courageously lift
the darkness of injustice.

438
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,560
I will stay warmhearted for those
who are weak and underprivileged.

439
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,150
THE 32ND
HANJU DAILY NATIONAL YOUTH ART CONTEST

440
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,320
Why are you doing this?

441
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,410
What's wrong with you?!

442
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,880
I will only follow the truth
and remain impartial.

443
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,180
I will remain strict and upright.

444
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,390
I hereby take my oath
to serve our people and nation

445
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,150
as a prosecutor, upon my honor.

446
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,330
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

447
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,040
Bring me the investigation record
for Choi Hae-sik's death in 1988.

448
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,870
INVESTIGATION RECORD
OF THE DEATH OF CHOI HAE-SIK

449
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,420
SUSPECT: SONG WOO-BYEOK
CHARGED WITHOUT DETENTION

450
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,960
That's how I finally met my father.

451
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,970
SCENE OF INCIDENT

452
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,010
PHOTOS OF VICTIM

453
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,220
There was no evidence of murder.

454
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,810
And the autopsy result showed
it was suffocation due to airway blockage.

455
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,770
It was a suicide.

456
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,610
LIGATURE MARK 4.0 CM UNDER THE CHIN
12 NAIL MARK ABRASIONS

457
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,660
Are these from the scene,

458
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,200
and are these from the autopsy?

459
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,540
Yes, that's correct.

460
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,080
Who was the detective in charge?

461
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,130
These are photos of the victim
taken at the scene.

462
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,680
Doesn't it seem odd?

463
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,550
I'm not sure.

464
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,930
Take a close look at his neck.

465
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,560
The only wound you can see

466
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,730
is the pressure from the rope,
the ligature mark.

467
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,190
It means there was no struggle

468
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,740
until the moment he suffocated to death
although his hands were free.

469
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,280
Well, that is possible.

470
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,490
There are cases where
a suicide victim dies from a broken neck

471
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,920
depending on the weight of the victim
and the height of the noose.

472
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,630
Then what do you think about this?

473
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,300
This is from his autopsy.

474
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,890
The nail marks that were absent
at the scene

475
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,470
suddenly appear clearly
during the autopsy.

476
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm not sure.

477
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,480
This is…

478
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,770
Someone must've questioned
whether it was truly a suicide.

479
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,360
Look at this.

480
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,400
Isn't this weird?

481
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,860
The scar on his neck is too smooth.

482
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,320
Even if he was determined to die,

483
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,660
there should be some trace
of struggle due to pain, right?

484
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,080
His neck was too clean
for someone who suffocated slowly

485
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,330
to his death.

486
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,670
Of course, one could have argued
he died from a broken neck.

487
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,050
Unfortunately, the victim wasn't
found at a scene

488
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,550
high enough for him to die instantly.

489
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,930
Hence,

490
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,520
there was a high possibility
the victim's suicide was staged

491
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,190
after he was murdered or made unconscious.

492
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,820
Someone was afraid
the truth might leak, so they created

493
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,530
such false resistance marks
before the autopsy.

494
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,490
Who was it?

495
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,070
Sorry?

496
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,490
Goodness.

497
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,540
I have no idea what you're talking about.

498
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,790
I noticed that you were promoted

499
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,330
right after this case was closed.

500
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,840
And you also bought a house and some land.

501
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,260
As I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

502
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,930
So you don't know?

503
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,980
I heard you'll be retiring in a month.

504
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,060
I guess I'll find out within a month

505
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,480
whether you'll retire or be dismissed.

506
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,520
What's with you?

507
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,190
It's been over 30 years!

508
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,440
Yes, it has!

509
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,320
It's been over 30 years.

510
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,450
But I still have to bring justice
to the wronged!

511
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,160
It may have been over 30 years,

512
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,620
but he's still my father.

It wasn't Song Woo-byeok.

521
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,990
It was Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo.

522
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,170
All right, we're here.

523
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,460
Let's go.

524
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,960
-I'm hungry.
-Goodness, I'm hungry,

525
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,300
and I want a drink too.

526
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,720
Let's hurry inside.

527
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,270
Do you want to know…

528
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,230
what it is that I want to do?

529
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,070
If you tell me,

530
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,940
will it change anything?

531
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,740
No.

532
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,120
Then I also say…

533
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,120
no.

534
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,550
PETIT NAIL

535
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,020
Don't ever let her find out

536
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,850
how much I loved her.

537
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,900
Don't ever let her find out

538
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,240
how much I love her.

539
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,070
And please,

540
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,160
don't ever let her find out

541
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,000
why our love must end
so painfully like this.

542
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,080
Let her loathe me and resent me

543
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,500
as she forgets me

544
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,050
and erases me from her memories.

545
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,630
Let her forget that she must forget me,

546
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,640
and let her be happy.

547
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,520
SEE YOU NEXT TIME

548
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,060
"MY DAUGHTER TEACHES ME
HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING"

549
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,560
FORMER CHIEF PROSECUTOR
OH TAE-SOO RUNNING FOR…

550
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,100
PROSECUTOR CHOI KANG-HO

551
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,240
A DANCER'S DREAM

552
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,650
I received a tip-off about drugs.

553
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,920
It was my first time clubbing.

554
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,260
I couldn't have injured my knee
at a worse time!

555
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,850
Seriously!

556
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,430
I'm so frustrated right now.

557
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,690
Kang-ho, buy me a drink.

558
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,020
Let me call you back.

559
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,520
No. Wait, don't hang--

560
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,570
DO NOT LITTER
CCTV IN OPERATION

561
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,590
YOON JAE-MIN, THE GUY
WHO ALWAYS CAME TO OUR BAR

562
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,030
-What are you doing?
-You crazy bitch.

563
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,030
Let go of me, you crazy asshole!

564
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,280
Hey! Let go!

565
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,160
Hey, get up.

566
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,170
Get up.

567
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,640
What's this?

568
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,400
The CCTVs near Woo Mi-jeong's incident
were either broken or wiped,

569
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,320
so the case was almost abandoned.

570
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,900
Thankfully, I found one nearby
installed to monitor littering.

571
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,610
So? What do you want to show me?

572
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,330
Do you see this car?

573
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,120
If you consider the time
and location of the incident,

574
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,790
there's a high chance this car's dashcam
recorded the incident.

575
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,130
It'll take a while
to process the license plate number,

576
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,170
but I'll reveal the truth soon.

577
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,470
Kang-ho, let's just let this one slide.

578
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,810
Is it because of Yoon Jae-min?

579
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,900
He might dispose of Jung Jong-gu?

580
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,150
He'll stage Jung Jong-gu's suicide
as if he did it out of guilt.

581
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,440
He'll think it's the easiest way
to tie up loose ends.

582
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,030
He'll go as far as to kill
an innocent man?

583
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,080
Don't you know what Chairman Song is like?

584
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,950
He can do much worse things.

585
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,250
Sir, let me take on this case.

586
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,010
What?

587
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,010
You're about to become
the deputy chief prosecutor.

588
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,550
You want to avoid getting tangled up
in a messy case like this.

589
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,260
Please allow

590
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,270
your junior prosecutor the opportunity
to run with this case,

591
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,890
Sir.

592
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,810
I mean, Deputy Chief.

593
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,520
I'll oversee this case with care.

594
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,280
I didn't kill Mi-jeong.

595
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,830
But even my lawyer doesn't believe me.

596
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,290
Mr. Jung,

597
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,830
you did not kill Ms. Woo.

598
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,290
I'll find the evidence.

599
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,420
So until then,

600
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,800
you must stay alive in here.

601
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,100
You must trust me and do as I say

602
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
until I find indisputable evidence.

603
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,850
I will save you at all costs, Mr. Jung.

604
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,310
Do you understand?

605
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Yes.

606
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,200
Why did Woo Mi-jeong forget her lipstick
and leave your stall in a hurry?

607
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,030
Because…

608
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,200
she was angry with me.

609
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,660
Why was she angry?

610
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,950
Because…

611
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,420
I tried to wipe
the tteokbokki sauce off of her,

612
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,750
but she suddenly hit my face.

613
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,920
You must've been offended.

614
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,090
You were just being considerate.

615
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,170
Yes.

616
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,010
I mean…

617
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,010
Despite that, you went out
to give the lipstick back to her,

618
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,890
all the way into an alley
80m away from the main road.

619
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,020
However,

620
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,650
when you saw Woo Mi-jeong
with another man,

621
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,280
you returned to your stall

622
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,570
in case you incur
a misunderstanding, correct?

623
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,660
Yes.

624
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,320
If you did not have any feelings for her,

625
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,450
you should have returned the lipstick

626
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,870
even if you saw her with another man.

627
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,080
So why did you return to your stall?

628
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,420
And why did you go back to the alley?

629
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,050
It shows the defendant didn't go out
to find Woo Mi-jeong

630
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,720
just to return the lipstick.

631
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,010
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant,

632
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,760
was assaulted by Woo Mi-jeong,
whom he liked, as he showed kindness.

633
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,230
While he was ashamed and humiliated,

634
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:13,940
he saw her with another man
and decided to commit this crime.

635
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Defendant.

636
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,820
Do you admit to the crime?

637
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,690
That's absurd!

638
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,950
Goodness!

639
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,110
Jong-gu!

640
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,620
You didn't kill her!

641
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,200
Tell him you didn't.

642
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,660
-Jong-gu!
-Tell him no!

643
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,450
-Please be quiet.
-Defendant.

644
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,460
Do you admit to the crime?

645
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,670
-Mom, I want to go home!
-Jong-gu, say it!

646
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
-Defendant, calm down!
-I want to go home!

647
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,550
-Defendant.
-That is all.

648
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,930
Sir, he's here.

649
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,190
You're here.

650
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,570
Leave this letter on my desk.

651
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,740
Goodness, thank you for coming a long way.

652
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,030
Please excuse my clothes.
Things have been hectic lately.

653
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,990
You look nice and comfortable.

654
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,620
This is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho,
who took charge of the trial.

655
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,920
It's a pleasure.

656
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,670
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho

657
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,300
with the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

658
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,970
Your grandson's name will not be mentioned
during the course of this trial.

659
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,430
Prosecutor Choi
will ensure discretion throughout it.

660
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,480
This trial, I mean.

661
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,390
Are you after money or power?

662
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,560
If I want it,

663
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,030
can you give it to me?

664
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,740
You just saved my grandson.

665
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,280
So why not?

666
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,080
In that case, both.

667
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,380
In return, from now on,

668
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,840
you'll be a part of my family.

669
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,970
Thank you.

670
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,970
Thank you.

671
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,060
Thank you very much.

672
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,850
That's enough.

673
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,850
I'll do my best, Mr. Song. Thank you!

674
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,940
Find out the license plate number
of the car

675
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,900
and recover the dashcam footage
no matter what.

676
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,740
Kang-ho.

677
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,950
How about this one?

678
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,700
You should wear this today.

679
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,240
Okay?

680
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,750
No, I'll wear the one you gave me
for our first anniversary.

681
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,790
No, that's too flashy.

682
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,170
This is perfect.

683
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,170
Let's go with this one.

684
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,260
Yes, this is perfect.

685
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,640
Dad.

686
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,890
Happy birthday to you.

687
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,100
Thanks.

688
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,020
I'm glad my daughter--

689
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,320
Who is he?

690
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,410
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho.

691
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,740
You must be surprised.

692
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,550
HA-YOUNG

693
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,350
You reek of something.

694
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,060
Ever since we first met.

695
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,940
What could it be?

696
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,190
Is it the smell of dirt
since you came from the bottom up?

697
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,450
Someone like you can never call me Father.

698
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,080
Though you must not understand
since you don't have a father.

699
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,890
Sir, it's me, Choi Kang-ho.

700
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,270
It's good.

701
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,570
Have some of this.

702
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,740
That's it. Good.

703
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,990
It's good.

704
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,490
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo used to
cover things up for Woobyeok Group.

705
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,620
Why is he suddenly
siding with Dosang Group?

706
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,960
You really don't know?

707
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,170
Hey.

708
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,670
Chairman Song used to be a thug.

709
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,220
Think about all the shady acts

710
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,550
they have committed
in their 30 years together.

711
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,390
There are rumors that
those two are behind the death

712
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,680
of the chairman of Yongra Construction,
which is now Woobyeok Group.

713
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,100
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
He's cleaning up after himself

714
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,600
before it becomes a problem.

715
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,980
But if Assemblyman Oh runs for president,

716
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,730
Chairman Song wouldn't just
sit by and watch.

717
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,110
Did you seriously think
Oh Tae-soo wasn't prepared for that

718
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,740
when he dropped this bomb?

719
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,080
If things go sour,
only Woobyeok will get destroyed.

720
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,790
That's why Chairman Song

721
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,040
is dying to take down Oh Tae-soo.

722
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,130
Anyway,

723
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,800
Chairman Song
is a tactless brute to the bone.

724
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,010
All he did was bribe
and seduce him with women.

725
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,800
A sly man like Oh Tae-soo
would never fall for such tricks.

726
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,260
I'd be a sucker for that.

727
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,850
Who are you?

728
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,150
Are you Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun?

729
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,400
Chairman Song was always anxious that

730
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,650
Oh Tae-soo might betray him.

731
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,120
Corporate sales

732
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,450
have actually increased
by 21.5% compared to last year.

733
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,080
That's why

734
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,960
he sent me to work
as Oh Tae-soo's assistant

735
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,710
to keep an eye on him.

736
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,090
At first, I was just doing my job.

737
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,220
I'll move abroad and live quietly.

738
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,680
No, can you please tell him that
we're both already dead?

739
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,260
"Both"?

740
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,610
Okay then.

741
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
Let's do this.

742
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,820
I'll keep you

743
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,830
and your baby safe.

744
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,830
I give you my word.

745
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,170
In order to do that,
I must get Oh Tae-soo under my thumb,

746
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,420
and I can only do that
through Chairman Song.

747
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,630
Can you share with me
the confidential files you have

748
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,720
regarding Woobyeok Group?

749
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,650
In return, please do as I asked you.

750
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,230
Your baby is adorable.

751
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,860
I'm going to show the DNA test result
to Chairman Song tomorrow.

752
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,490
The day has finally come.

753
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,160
The moment Oh Tae-soo finds out
about the baby,

754
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,620
you, your mother, and those around you
might be put in danger.

755
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,160
You know that, right?

756
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,580
Prosecutor Choi, please be careful.

757
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,420
Okay.

758
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,630
You have a call from the lobby.

759
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,180
Yes?

760
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,470
Hello, sir. This is the security office.

761
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,430
Your mother is here.

762
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,520
Tell her I'm not home.

763
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,950
HAPPY FARM

764
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,950
Please take me in as your real son.

765
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,040
-What did you say?
-I want to become

766
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,170
your legal son.

767
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,130
Then as your son,

768
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,300
I will marry Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

769
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,920
You'll have Oh Tae-soo.

770
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,550
Oh Tae-soo will have me.

771
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,680
And I'll have a father.

772
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,850
None of us will be able
to betray one another.

773
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,560
We'll become a true family.

774
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,690
-Hello.
-Hello.

775
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,150
Take a look at this.

776
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,070
Woobyeok Group set up this paper company
in Singapore two years ago--

777
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,450
Pack up.

778
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,410
Sorry?

779
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,380
You'll be safer there than in Korea.

780
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,510
No one will be able to find you.

781
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,220
Don't worry too much. It'll all work out.

782
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,440
Thank you for doing as I asked.

783
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,340
Ms. Hwang.

784
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,890
We're here.

785
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Over there.

786
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,160
Here.

787
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,000
He's the owner of a restaurant
I used to work at.

788
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,760
He'll take you to a stowaway ship
that will take you to the Philippines.

789
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,840
You may get seasick on the boat,

790
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,390
but hang in there for an hour.

791
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,140
The larger ship will be more stable.

792
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:15,970
Also,

793
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,430
here.

794
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,150
This is the address to your house
in the Philippines, passports,

795
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,020
and money for living expenses.

796
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:31,410
Oh Tae-soo may look for you,

797
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,490
so try to remain out of sight, okay?

798
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,330
Thank you so much.

799
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,250
Don't worry.

800
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,210
If my plan goes well,

801
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,880
you can return
and live happily with your baby.

802
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,420
I'm counting on you, sir.

803
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,050
Don't worry. I'll see her off
and get in touch with you.

804
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,180
Okay.

805
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,430
All right.

806
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,930
This way.

807
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,340
I took care of it.

808
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,940
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

809
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,830
Be polite to his mother.

810
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,330
And remember what I told you earlier.

811
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,750
Okay?

812
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,420
You must be feeling uneasy
to share difficult news with your mother.

813
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,920
The moment Chairman Song
accepted me as his son,

814
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,180
she became a stranger to me.

815
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,310
I'm only going there
to seal the legal procedure,

816
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,970
so I feel at ease.

817
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,440
We'll get going.

818
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,960
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

819
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,090
I got this at the biggest
jewelry shop in town.

820
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,930
They're diamonds.

821
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,600
Take a look.

822
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,650
Can you wait outside?

823
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,690
Okay.

824
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,440
Why?

825
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,990
May I have something to drink?

826
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,830
Sure. Give me a moment.

827
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,580
Goodness.

828
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,700
Come to think of it,

829
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,290
your fiancée was born
in the Year of the Pig.

830
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,460
It must be destiny.

831
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,500
Who am I?

832
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,340
I'm a pig farmer.

833
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,340
She was destined to marry
into our family, right?

834
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,810
What is this?

835
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,190
"Adoption Agreement"?

836
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,400
What is this?

837
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,160
Are you going to adopt a child?

838
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,490
Why?

839
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,910
Can she not get pregnant?

840
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,750
I will be adopted by Chairman Song
who has been raising me all along.

841
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,790
Please stamp your seal there.

842
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,630
I cannot fight against them
with Father's case,

843
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,430
as the statute of limitations
had already expired.

844
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,300
OCTOBER 3, 2021

845
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,520
No, perhaps

846
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:11,770
Father's case probably
didn't mean much to me from the beginning.

847
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,480
What I really wanted to avenge

848
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,110
was your life they utterly destroyed,

849
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,030
and the pain you felt

850
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,750
living as a bad mother
to your most beloved son.

851
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,920
I will now become Song Woo-byeok's son

852
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,380
and Oh Tae-soo's son-in-law

853
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,680
to destroy everything
they have ever built.

854
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,470
Since I know how difficult
and dangerous this journey will be,

855
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,850
I have to sever my ties with you.

856
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,400
Please forgive this awful son.

857
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,820
One day, when everything ends

858
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,740
and I can return to your side,

859
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,540
I wish to lie in your arms

860
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,130
and eat mung bean pancakes
just as I did when I was a little boy.

861
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,440
Don't do it.

862
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,070
Don't do it.

863
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,150
Don't do anything now.

864
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,030
Mom.

865
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,530
Mom.

866
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,700
Mom, where are you going?

867
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,410
Mom.

868
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,590
No.

869
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,480
Mom.

870
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,280
Mom, are you okay?

871
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,950
Mom, what's wrong?

872
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,990
So that's why you were so cold to me?

873
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,950
To pursue revenge by yourself?

874
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,290
To take all the risks by yourself?

875
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,720
My poor boy.

876
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,510
It must've been so tough.

877
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,600
It must've been so scary and lonely.

878
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,830
You have to stop everything.

879
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,370
Okay?

880
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,670
HAPPY FARM

881
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,510
What's that?

882
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,600
Goodness.

883
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,180
Their son is about to die any day now.

884
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,390
How long do these old geezers
want to live?

885
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,940
"Prostate Medicine"?

886
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,150
I might end up getting a sibling.

887
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,740
Good grief. I made a mess.

888
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,740
Darn it.

889
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,240
What's that?

890
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,470
My goodness.

891
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,770
Where should we meet tomorrow?

892
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,890
I don't accept credit cards.
Only wire transfer or cash.

893
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,980
Goodness!

894
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,070
Darn it.

895
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,820
Mom, what are you doing?

896
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,950
-Give it to me.
-These are mine!

897
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,490
You said these were mine!

898
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,410
Choi Kang-ho!

899
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,290
Listen very carefully.

900
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,540
These are bad things.

901
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,500
It'll put you in danger if you keep it.

902
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,380
You might end up like your dad.

903
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,380
Like Dad?

904
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,050
What happened to him?

905
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,470
We have to get rid of them.

906
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,190
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

907
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,380
If you destroy yourself in revenge,

908
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,540
that isn't revenge.

909
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,380
True revenge

910
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,680
is forgetting everything completely,
even the reason you wanted revenge,

911
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,470
and living a good life.

912
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,850
Let's forget.

913
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,140
Let's forget it all now.

914
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,310
You,

915
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,520
me,

916
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:32,730
and…

917
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,450
you too.

918
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,910
What's that?

919
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,040
Oh, my goodness!

920
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:40,550
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

921
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,860
From now on,

922
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,330
you're the owner of Happy Farm.

923
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,740
I want to be a prosecutor.

924
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,450
Goodness! You look so handsome.

925
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,000
The most eligible bachelor of Jou-ri.

926
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,590
I want to marry him off.

927
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,710
Please don't let him
regain his memories until then.

928
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,880
Tell me, Kang-ho.
What were you going to do to me?

929
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,140
Something's going on, right?

930
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,510
Please tell me.

931
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,890
Kang-ho, let's play.

932
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,600
How about this?
We'll give each other a gift.

933
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,230
It all went down the drain!

934
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,860
He's a prosecutor.

935
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,820
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

936
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,110
Mi-joo, I can't hold back anymore.

937
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,740
Kang-ho still should've known.

938
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:49,620
