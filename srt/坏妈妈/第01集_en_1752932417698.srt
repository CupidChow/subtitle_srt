00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,900
There are two animals

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,320
that are useful from their head to toe.

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,360
Do you know what they are?

5
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,450
Humans…

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,450
and pigs.

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,660
Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,250
but that's not the case.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,800
Not only do their business in one place
but they also only sleep where it's clean.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,260
They bathe often in mud to cool themselves

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,130
and get rid of bugs.

12
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,310
But humans started to lock them up
in tiny pigsties.

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,650
The pigs couldn't bathe in mud anymore,

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,650
so they began to rub their bodies
on their own excrement.

15
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,530
That's how they grew dirtier
and more aggressive.

16
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,240
Isn't that so sad?

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,830
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,800
However, what's really sad is this.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,680
Pigs are unable to lift their heads,

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,350
so they live their entire life
staring at the ground.

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,940
There is only one way for a pig
to look up at the sky.

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,030
It's…

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,070
to fall down.

24
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,080
That's right.

25
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,660
Falling down

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,670
is a way for you to see another world,
a world you have never seen before,

27
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,920
both for pigs and people.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,380
I got you!

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,470
EPISODE 1

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,140
I am happy

31
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,860
I am happy

32
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,320
I am happy

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,860
I am very very happy

JOONGANG FEED & SUPPLY

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,910
Food delivery!

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,580
You were all gathered here.

37
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,910
-Goodness!
-Hello!

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,790
You're at it by yourself again.

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,000
-Thank you.
-Sure.

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
It's too heavy for a woman.

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,630
Goodness, sir.

42
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,140
Goodness.

43
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,010
DOG FEED, COW FEED, HORSE FEED,
CHICKEN FEED, DUCK FEED, ALL FEEDS

44
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,560
Goodness. You're right.

45
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,020
It's too heavy for a woman.

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,140
Hey!

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,480
DELICIOUS FEED
FOR COWS

48
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,400
Hi.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
Young-soon!

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,740
Young-soon, take these with you.

51
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,740
DELICIOUS FEED

52
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,830
FOR POULTRY

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,250
I'll give you the rest next month.

54
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,050
Goodness.

55
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,510
-Thank you, Young-soon.
-Sure.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,430
Here. These are fresh
so it'll be delicious.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,980
-Thank you.
-Drink up.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,940
-Gosh, that's refreshing.
-Give this to your boss.

59
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,570
Mulberries?

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,320
They're great for men.

61
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,160
-Gosh, ma'am!
-Gosh.

62
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,330
JOONGANG FEED & SUPPLY

63
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,040
JOONGANG FEED & SUPPLY

64
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,460
This is nuts.

65
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,800
What's this?

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,180
That's red chili powder
made with farm-grown peppers.

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,090
Screw that.

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,010
Of course all red chili powders
are from farms.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
Then what about these?

70
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,480
Were they assembled in a factory?

71
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,520
Tell them to stop giving us
these useless things

72
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,980
and pay us what they owe.

73
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,070
I forgot.

74
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,240
There are mulberries in the car.

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,320
It's apparently great for men,

76
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,620
and Ms. Eun-ju from the goat farm
told me to make sure you receive it.

77
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,870
Ms. Eun-ju?

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,040
Why did she give me something…

79
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,790
that's good for men?

80
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,630
Mulberry, where are you?

81
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,010
Where are you?

82
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,630
Where?

83
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,300
They're both so obvious.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Seriously.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,060
Welcome.

86
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,740
Well, you must be busy.

87
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,500
I…

88
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,120
Are you going to a funeral?

89
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,540
No.

90
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, Young-soon.

91
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,920
She's pretty, isn't she?

92
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,050
She ate well this morning and…

93
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,220
Young-soon.

94
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,520
Will you marry me?

95
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,900
Do a good job. Go.

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,400
Go to her.

97
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,730
Go.

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
Come here.

99
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,650
These mulberries are sweet.

100
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,910
-Where are you going?
-No!

101
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,620
-No!
-Hey, wait!

102
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,410
-No!
-Hey!

103
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,870
-Get back here!
-Goodness.

104
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,910
-Catch it!
-Hey, piggy!

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,330
-Catch it!
-What's that?

106
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,460
-What's that?
-Goodness.

107
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,920
-It's running away!
-Stop right there!

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,130
-Hey!
-The pig!

109
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,460
Please catch the pig!

110
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,300
The pig!

111
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,470
A pig?

112
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,180
-Hey, catch it.
-Hey!

113
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,720
-Catch it!
-Hey!

114
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,970
Hey, where are you going?

115
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,560
-Come here.
-Catch it.

116
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,270
Catch it!

117
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,060
You have to catch it!

118
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,480
Go that way. Where did it go?

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,860
-Where did it go?
-Where did it go?

120
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Rice pop!

121
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,610
-That scared me!
-Are you okay?

122
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,740
Have a good one.

123
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,740
-There.
-That scared me!

124
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,200
-It was here.
-A pig.

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,620
-Where?
-It's a pig!

126
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,910
Over there!

127
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,700
-Hey, come here!
-Over here.

128
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,290
-Where are you going?
-No!

129
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,210
-Oh, no!
-Can you catch that pig?

130
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,790
This way.

131
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,250
-Goodness.
-Where?

132
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,050
One more pork belly, please.

133
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,960
Sure.

134
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,420
What's that noise?

135
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,720
-Look.
-What?

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
-What's that?
-Oh, my!

137
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,390
-Goodness!
-Wait.

138
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,350
-What's that?
-Where are you?

139
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,890
I got it!

140
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
Goodness.

141
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,810
This little…

142
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,320
I don't want it.

143
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,780
They're having pork belly. Let's leave.

144
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,910
Enjoy.

145
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,320
Let's go.

146
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,700
-What?
-Go ahead and eat.

147
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,620
-They caught it.
-They did?

148
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,210
-They did!
-We did.

149
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,790
-Good job!
-Hey.

150
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,330
Young-soon, one second.

151
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,960
It didn't go as planned,

152
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,840
but next time,
I promise I'll train the pig better

153
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,090
so that it can go
directly to you next time.

154
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,930
You're going to get married again?

155
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,890
No, I'm not.

156
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,060
What are you talking about? I…

157
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,440
What?

158
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,900
That means you'll…

159
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,660
Thank you!

160
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,070
Thank you!

161
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
Thank you!

162
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,580
No wonder you always came to our shop
when you had nothing to buy.

163
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,630
Hey, wait!

164
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,050
Does this mean you're going to quit?

165
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,300
No!

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,010
I don't approve of this marriage!

167
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,590
-What do you mean?
-It's off!

168
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,930
-It can't happen!
-Move it.

169
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,810
I'll take a picture for you.
Look over here.

170
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,180
Goodness, you two are cute.

171
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,600
One, two, say piggy!

172
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,900
The circuits look fine.
Your electrical system looks good.

173
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,200
-Really?
-Sparks are quite dangerous,

174
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,360
so make sure you dust often.

175
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,950
Be careful when you spray water.

176
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,700
All right. Thank you.

177
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,240
No need to thank me. It's my job.

178
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,370
We're busy at the fire station

179
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,290
-with frequent piggery fires.
-I see.

180
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,170
I'll stop by next time I'm on patrol.

181
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,670
Hold on.

182
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,210
Take this.

183
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,170
I heard your baby just turned one!

184
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,590
Your father told me.

185
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,840
-Buy your kid some clothes.
-Goodness, it's okay.

186
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,800
I couldn't even go to your wedding.

187
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,560
Don't say that.

188
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,310
I know you spend all your weekends
with your mother at the hospital.

189
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,190
If it bothers you that much,

190
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,070
you can come to my kid's first birthday.

191
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,940
What? That means…

192
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,070
I'm going to be a dad!

193
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,950
-Congratulations!
-My heart is racing!

194
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,200
My gosh. Isn't this great?

195
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,660
When is the baby due?

196
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,710
Next September, the Year of the Dragon.

197
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,040
It's the Year of the Double Dragon
in the year '88

198
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,630
that only comes around
once every 300 years.

199
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,170
Look at this.

200
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,720
I want to give my kid the best name,

201
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,010
so I've been studying this.

202
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,050
Kang-cheol.

203
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,220
Kang-su.

204
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,810
Kang-jun.

205
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,560
Kang is the generational syllable.

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,520
Kang-hun.

207
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Kang-sik.

208
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,770
-Kang-min.
-What if the baby's a girl?

209
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,480
Kang-hui. Kang-sun.

210
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,810
Kang-ja.

211
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,070
Kang-mi.

212
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,070
Hey, I'm prepared for everything.

213
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,780
And look at this too.

214
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,830
Ta-da.

215
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,210
I don't know if it'll be
a boy or a girl, so I got both.

216
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,670
BONGU FARM

217
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,580
The baby's not due for a while,
and you're studying names already.

218
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,040
You must be very excited.

219
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,500
Of course I am!

220
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,050
Anyway, why does it take
ten months for humans?

221
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,180
Why can't humans give birth
in four months like pigs?

222
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,090
Right?

223
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,890
I'll also think of a good name

224
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,930
-that begins with Kang.
-No, don't.

225
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,930
You don't need to.

226
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020
I'm going to do it.

227
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,150
Don't you dare name my kid, okay?

228
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,690
Thanks, Sang-cheol. Bye.

229
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,440
Bye now.

230
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,070
All right.

231
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,160
Yong-yong, my Double Dragon.

232
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,620
Daddy made this.

233
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,710
YONG-YONG

234
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,920
This is all for you.

235
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,460
Hae-sik!

236
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,920
-Hae-sik.
-Yes?

237
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,970
-I need you at the breeding house.
-Why?

238
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,800
She's doing it again.

239
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,810
-Again?
-Yes.

240
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,720
Okay. Let's go.

241
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,560
Hey, piggy. Doesn't it hurt?

242
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,020
What makes you so miserable
that you bang your head?

243
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,320
Think of the babies in your womb.

244
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,570
You shouldn't do that as a mother.

245
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,950
-Here you are.
-Hey, you're here.

246
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,330
She did it again.

247
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,210
The Ministry of Home Affairs began
environmental improvement projects

248
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,080
to take a leap into developed nations.

249
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,670
More resources have been
allocated to paving local roads

250
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,050
to complete the project
before the Seoul Olympics,

251
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,340
-hastening the process.
-It's so good.

252
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,510
Our baby is probably only tiny,

253
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
but I'm already feeling morning sickness.

254
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,640
But that mother pig carries ten piglets.

255
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,100
It must be so tough.

256
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,560
That's true.

257
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,270
But I'm worried she'll stress out

258
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,690
the other mother pigs.

259
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,360
It's a sensitive time,
and they need to stay healthy.

260
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,240
Why don't you separate them?

261
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,820
Our storage is empty.

262
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,620
Should I do that?

263
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,410
I'll make a pigsty,

264
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,790
feed it every day, and look after it.

265
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,380
Nonsense! You're in early pregnancy.

266
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,540
You need to be the most careful right now.

267
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,920
Don't strain yourself. Don't even do this.

268
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,510
I'll do everything.

269
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,970
-I'm fine.
-No.

270
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,050
It's for our Yong-yong.

271
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,550
Let's see what our baby is up to.

272
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,600
-My gosh.
-One second.

273
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,140
Yong-yong.

274
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,440
You and I are going to have a chat today.

275
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,440
Here.

276
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,690
Yong-yong, respond, over.

277
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,780
Can you say, "Daddy"?

278
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,740
Say, "Daddy."

279
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,240
I just heard our baby say it. I mean it.

280
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,950
-One second.
-I can't believe you.

281
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,000
What?

282
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,830
I see.

283
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,080
I have to do that now?

284
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,170
I have to give Mommy a big kiss?

285
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,340
Thank you.

286
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,260
Oh, my.

287
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,350
You might have another child
before that one's born.

288
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,560
Chief.

289
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,850
Is our doorbell broken?

290
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,730
-Have some of this.
-Hello.

291
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,690
-Have a mung bean pancake.
-Goodness.

292
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,310
I can get a treat like this
now that you have a wife.

293
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,150
This is really good.

294
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
Right? Isn't it great?

295
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,070
Anyway, what brings you here, Chief?

296
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,950
I have something to discuss with you.

297
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,160
-I see.
-You know

298
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,910
about the Olympics torch relay, right?

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
Yes, I know.

300
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,210
For the Seoul Olympics,

301
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,920
the relay will go through Bongu-ro
and right out front.

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,670
-Right here?
-Really?

303
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,130
What an honor.

304
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,970
Does this mean
we get to see the torch relay live?

305
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,180
That's why I thought
of gathering the villagers

306
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,970
to cheer the runners
with Korean flags and banners.

307
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,430
That sounds great.

308
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,850
That's a wonderful idea.

309
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,730
Then may I make the flags and banners?

310
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,230
I'm a good artist.

311
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,820
Honey, you shouldn't strain yourself.

312
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,070
Strain myself?
This is all for our country.

313
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,450
May I do that?

314
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,820
Of course!

315
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,030
-I'd be grateful!
-No, you can't.

316
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,200
Come on.

317
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,080
WISHING FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS
WELCOME TO BONGU-DONG

318
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,870
I will

319
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,170
Love forever

320
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,260
So what is this?

321
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,430
You're going to demolish my farm

322
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,050
because of the torch relay?

323
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,100
That's just one of the reasons.

324
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,640
The marathon will also
be held down this road.

325
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,810
Think about it.

326
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,100
The whole world will watch it on TV.

327
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,400
If the TV captures
this dirty, smelly pigsty,

328
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,900
foreigners are going to think
Korea is a backwater country.

329
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,660
-Don't you think so?
-Hey.

330
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,660
We're all doing this out of patriotism.

331
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,660
-Honey.
-Honey.

332
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,040
-Look.
-That's a good one.

333
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Who are they?

334
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,540
Nobody. Go back inside.

335
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,460
We have to get to work.

336
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,290
We're busy, so please leave.

337
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,920
-Don't push me.
-No, please go.

338
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,090
Please leave now.

339
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,720
How dare you lay a hand on me?

340
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,590
-What are you doing? Let go!
-No!

341
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,850
-Let go, you bastards!
-What are you people doing?

342
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,810
Go back inside.

343
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,140
-Who do you think you are?
-Let go!

344
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,850
Quiet down!

345
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,440
Jeez.

346
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,150
I told you to explain it to him
quietly and with respect.

347
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,280
What are you doing right now?

348
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,490
What are you doing, you punk?

349
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Darn it.

350
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,750
Goodness, I'm sorry.

351
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,290
All he's ever done is fight.

352
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,290
He's not educated.

353
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Well…

354
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,800
Take this.

355
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,930
So…

356
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,930
Have you heard of
Major League Baseball in the US?

357
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,310
DIRECTOR
SONG WOO-BYEOK

358
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,060
The best pitcher on the Boston Red Sox,

359
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,480
Roger Clemens smokes these.

360
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,610
We may be able to import Patriot missiles,

361
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,410
but these are really tough
to bring into the country.

362
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,660
Please have a smoke

363
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,660
and forgive us.

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,330
You smoke foreign cigarettes

365
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,370
and talk about patriotism?

366
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,130
I don't care if it's the torch relay
or the marathon.

367
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,460
Even at a snail's pace, our farm
will be on TV for less than 30 seconds.

368
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,090
And the smell?

369
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,970
Do TVs abroad broadcast smells?

370
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,260
We've run this farm for generations,

371
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,970
since the days of
my grandfather's grandfather.

372
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,100
I'm going to leave it to my son,

373
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,480
and to his grandson and his grandson too!

374
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,400
So I'll never sign this form!

375
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,820
Don't ever come back here.

376
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,740
Understand?

377
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,200
You must be shocked. Let's go inside.

378
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,870
Goodbye.

379
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,300
Eat up and get well soon

380
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,430
so that you'll have a healthy delivery.

381
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Yes.

382
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm glad we put her in the storage.

383
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,810
-Right.
-She's much calmer now.

384
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,730
You're right.

385
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,320
So Chief, no matter
how important the Olympics is,

386
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,570
these are lawfully our personal assets.

387
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,570
What can they do about it?
We have to hold out no matter what.

388
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,120
We should put together
an anti-demolition committee

389
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
and fight until the end, okay?

390
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,960
I won't condone this.

391
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,870
I'll meet with an attorney right away.

392
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,590
Yes, I'll call you later. Bye.

393
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,550
Goodness, look at the time.

394
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,220
-I have to feed the pigs.
-Hey.

395
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,890
Honey.

396
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,520
I already fed the pigs.

397
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,430
-You did?
-Yes.

398
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,100
Why did you do that? It's tough on you.

399
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,860
Things are tougher for you.

400
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,940
Honey.

401
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't worry about it.

402
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
You know me, right? I'll never give up.

403
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,870
I won't lose.

404
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,910
Do you know why?

405
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,710
Look, I got you right here,

406
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,960
and I got Yong-yong here too!

407
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,580
How can I lose to anybody?

408
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,340
Everything will be fine.

409
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,080
-Fire!
-Fire!

410
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,960
-Fire!
-There's a fire!

411
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,210
-Fire!
-Fire!

412
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,760
-Fire!
-Fire!

413
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,380
-Fire!
-Fire!

414
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,390
-Fire!
-Fire!

415
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,180
-Fire!
-Over there!

416
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Honey.

417
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,430
What is it?

418
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,770
Honey!

419
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,350
What? What's going on?

420
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Where's the fire?

421
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,690
Oh, no! Call the firehouse!

422
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,150
Where's the firetruck?

423
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,400
-No!
-No!

424
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,950
-You can't go in!
-No!

425
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,280
-I have to go in!
-Don't go!

426
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,490
-Let go!
-No, you can't!

427
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,030
-Goodness, no!
-Goodness!

428
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,620
-No!
-Let go!

429
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,080
My pigs are dying in there!
This isn't right!

430
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,540
Even pigs don't deserve to die like this!

431
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,670
No!

432
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,340
Honey, I'm sorry.

433
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,840
But you can't go in there.

434
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,550
I can't let you go in there.

435
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,020
Why?

436
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Why?!

437
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,360
I saw it with my own two eyes.

438
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,490
I came out to take a leak earlier,

439
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,320
and I heard the dogs barking

440
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,030
and saw some dark figures lurking around.

441
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,990
I kept watching to see who they were,

442
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,500
and they were those punks
from Yongra Construction.

443
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,170
I wondered why they were here
in the middle of the night,

444
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,920
then I suddenly saw these flames.

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,130
See?

446
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,710
-I told you it would be them.
-Are you sure?

447
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,010
-Are you sure it was them?
-Yes!

448
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,180
Honey.

449
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,260
-Honey.
-Look at this.

450
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,720
It's the American brand
that man was smoking, right?

451
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,980
EVIDENCE 1

452
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,190
You're right.

453
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,990
That's the same brand as the ones I smoke.

454
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,530
Is that a problem?

455
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,450
These cigarettes are only sold in the US,

456
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,830
and they've never been imported here.

457
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,370
Which means it's not easy
for ordinary people to buy these.

458
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,420
However, this cigarette butt was found
near the victim's farm,

459
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,630
who recently had a dispute
with the defendant over the demolition.

460
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,930
It means there is a high possibility
this cigarette belongs to the defendant.

461
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,190
Well, Mr. Kim of Daeil Real Estate.

462
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,230
Me?

463
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,900
When I first went to see you,
I gave you a cigarette, didn't I?

464
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,070
I didn't smoke it.

465
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,660
I also gave one to the radio shop owner.

466
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,280
And the village chief too.

467
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,290
Chief, you got one too.

468
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,460
I smoked it that day!

469
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,460
-Silence.
-Who knows?

470
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,340
What?

471
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you saying I started the fire?

472
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,420
I said, silence!

473
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,760
WITNESS

474
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,600
Well, yes, I did see something.

475
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,230
But come to think of it,
I'm not sure if it was a man or a boar.

476
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,020
Right, maybe a wild dog.

477
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,020
Yes, you're right.

478
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,780
We had to repaint the roof,

479
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,910
but recently it kept raining,

480
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,950
so we kept the buckets of paint
and thinner inside the farm.

481
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,080
We only had two buckets!

482
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,210
But more than five buckets
were at the scene!

483
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,620
This was clearly arson!

484
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,210
Silence!

485
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,880
There's a better chance that the cause
was a short circuit than arson.

486
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,880
Actually,

487
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,090
there were a lot of problems
with the electrical system at the farm.

488
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,260
I urged him to get it fixed,
but he never took adequate measures.

489
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,060
Hey, Sang-cheol! What's with you?

490
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,680
Silence!

491
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,600
Sang-cheol…

492
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,770
It is difficult to acknowledge
the cigarette butt as evidence

493
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,990
purely on the presumption
of the prosecution.

494
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,870
Also, no witnesses or tools of arson
were found to support the claim

495
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,330
that the defendant started the fire.

496
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,040
For such reasons,

497
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,040
the indictment is ruled as not credible.

498
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,830
The defendant is innocent.

499
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,960
That's right!

500
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,100
Hey, Sang-cheol.

501
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,310
Hae-sik.

502
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,770
I have something to say.

503
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,520
-Stay away from me.
-Sang-cheol.

504
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,320
-It's not that.
-Don't come near me!

505
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,900
Sang-cheol!

506
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,240
Sang-cheol!

507
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,750
I needed money for my mother's surgery.

508
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,960
They said no matter
how much you hold out and resist,

509
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,050
it'll be over once the state
decides to bulldoze the pig farm.

510
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,550
I'm sorry.

511
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,060
Hae-sik.

512
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm sorry.

513
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,310
They knew my daughter's home address

514
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,310
and where she works.

515
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,820
What would you have done?

516
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,820
That must've been tough.

517
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,030
This is enough evidence to file an appeal.

518
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,160
I see.

519
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,700
Prosecutor Oh, I'm meeting TV reporters

520
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,750
and international reporters tomorrow.

521
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,290
-Reporters?
-Yes.

522
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,460
I asked around,

523
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,670
and that Director Song

524
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,680
is apparently the heir
to Yongra Construction.

525
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,300
And I found many suspicious incidents.

526
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,810
There were many incidents of fire
on demolition sites

527
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,270
where Director Song was in charge.

528
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,270
Although most incidents
were concluded as short-circuit fires,

529
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,940
many details were unclear.

530
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,310
Strangely enough,

531
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,990
witnesses and investigators
all changed their testimonies.

532
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,070
Doesn't it sound similar to our case?

533
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,030
Well…

534
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,240
Prosecutor Oh.

535
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,200
Here.

536
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,580
I've been saving up some money

537
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,040
to build a new house
when our baby is born.

538
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,920
I don't want my child to be ridiculed

539
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,800
for living in a smelly house
next to a pig farm.

540
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,010
But Prosecutor Oh,

541
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,300
I would feel more shame

542
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,220
to live as a helpless father
who let those jerks have their way

543
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,520
than to stink like a pigsty.

544
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,190
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

545
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,190
Prosecutor Oh.

546
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,240
Please reveal the truth.

547
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,660
But the money--

548
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,490
Prosecutor Oh, I…

549
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,580
I understand for now.

550
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,370
Thank you.

551
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,290
3 YEARS, 10 NIGHT FIRES

552
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,510
I'm counting on you, sir.

553
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,550
Goodbye.

554
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Goodbye.

555
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,210
This is Oh Tae-soo.

556
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,250
Things have become troublesome.

557
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,920
I am happy

558
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,880
I am happy

559
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,180
I am happy

560
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,220
I am very very happy

561
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,230
Car trouble?

562
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,320
BONGU FARM

563
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,410
Excuse me, could you move?

564
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,050
Have a drink.

565
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
One for me.

566
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,200
I was watching baseball yesterday,

567
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,620
and the game was completely ridiculous.

568
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,210
I mean,

569
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,500
if the fielders got hold of the ball,

570
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,500
the runner should've stopped
at second or third base.

571
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,340
This idiot got greedy
and tried to make it to home plate.

572
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,720
And he was tagged out.

573
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Gosh, that idiot.

574
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,070
Baseball

575
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,360
is exactly like life.

576
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,910
What's important isn't running,
but knowing when to stop.

577
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,750
And you also need to know where to stop.

578
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,870
Anyway.

579
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,830
Everything

580
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,340
is in the past.

581
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,590
Mr. Choi, have a drink

582
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,630
and forget all about it.

583
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,220
All right then.

584
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,440
Here. You can eat this on your way.

585
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,730
If he stepped on the chair to get up…

586
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,650
Good, right?

587
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,160
No, it should be knocked over.

588
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,450
That looks more natural, right?

589
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,120
All done. Let's go.

590
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,750
Boys, move. Let's hurry.

591
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,620
-Grab the glass.
-Yes.

592
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,460
All right.

593
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,290
YONG-YONG

594
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,390
Honey?

595
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,780
Honey, what happened?

596
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,830
Why are you here?

597
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,210
Let's go.

598
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,710
Let's go home.

599
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,510
Let's just give them the farm.
Let's let them have it all.

600
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,010
-Let's just go home, honey.
-Ma'am.

601
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,220
-Let's go!
-Please calm down.

602
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,810
I'll give you everything.

603
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,980
I'll give you everything!

604
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,150
Please save my husband!

605
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,990
No!

606
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,160
No!

607
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,410
Please save my husband!

608
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,490
You can have everything!

609
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,760
Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo?

610
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,970
Yes?

611
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,890
I brought the car you sent for repair.

612
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,430
The trunk is fully cleaned out too.
Please check.

613
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,310
Excuse me. Hey!

614
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,630
Are you Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo?

615
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,630
Yes, hello.

616
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,420
He said he found important evidence,

617
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,550
and he was going to meet with reporters.

618
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,140
So why would he kill himself?

619
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,060
And look at this.

620
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,520
Isn't this weird?

621
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,390
The scar on his neck is too smooth.

622
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,020
Even if he was determined to die,

623
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,070
there should be some trace
of struggling due to pain, right?

624
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,830
BANKBOOK

625
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,040
After hearing what you just said,

626
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm convinced that he killed himself.

627
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,470
If he found important evidence,

628
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,800
why didn't he bring it to me?

629
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,680
Instead, he stopped by, drunk,
and said he wanted to kill himself

630
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,890
and that if anything happened to him,

631
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,600
I should give this bankbook to you.

632
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,150
He was quite drunk and persistent.

633
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,490
So I took it

634
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,610
and told him to go home.

635
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,700
I didn't know he'd end up like this.

636
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,510
Why did he do that?

637
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,720
BANKBOOK

638
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,440
How frustrated and lost must he have been
to do something like that?

639
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,030
I should've done…

640
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,530
everything I could to keep him safe.

641
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,780
I should have

642
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,330
supported him

643
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,700
and helped him better.

644
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,670
But I don't know anything,
and I don't have anything.

645
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,930
One thing I do have is…

646
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,220
I won't…

647
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,060
let this child live like us.

648
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,740
I'll live.

649
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,490
Let's live.

650
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,290
Both my baby

651
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,500
and your babies

652
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,380
must have come to save their mothers.

653
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,420
So…

654
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
let's…

655
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,010
not give up

656
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,350
and live.

657
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,140
I used to sell feed to this farm,

658
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,440
but it closed two years ago.

659
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,730
I'm only letting you know
because it's you, Young-soon.

660
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,570
It's tough to find a farm and a home
within your budget.

661
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,740
JOU-RI DOLDAM VILLAGE
WELCOME

662
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,110

BREEDING INFORMATION

664
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,560
They all look healthy.

665
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,140
All nine of them. Goodness.

666
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,190
"If the building set on fire

667
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,190
is used as a residence
at the time of the fire,

668
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,700
or if people are in…"

669
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,120
HAPPY FARM

670
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,390
Are those pigs?

671
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,640
Pigs in our pristine village?

672
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,680
Our village is clean and unspoiled!

673
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,100
Goodness, we have pigs here!

674
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,440
Why pigs?

675
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,690
Stay still. Calm down.

676
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,910
-Why are those pigs here?
-What?

677
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,250
Pigs are here!

678
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,710
-Yes, but why are they here?
-Why…

679
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,830
Look, honey.

680
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,130
Didn't I do a good job by myself?

681
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,220
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,510
Our child kicked me

683
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,550
to remind me that I'm not alone.

684
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,640
I'll raise our child well

685
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,730
to get our revenge on you for leaving us.

686
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,610
So honey, keep an eye on us from above.

687
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,730
I mean.

688
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,730
Watch over us.

689
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,410
NO TRESPASSING

690
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,120
The air was so fresh
for the last two years,

691
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,040
but we have to put up
with this nonsense again.

692
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,250
We can't just talk this out.

693
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,760
We should just wipe out the entire farm.

694
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,720
-Goodness, hey… Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

695
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,840
-Goodness, ma'am.
-Mother.

696
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,510
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

697
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,430
Ma'am, you, the kid, and the ladies should

698
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,430
all stay out of this.

699
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,850
The men will take care of everything.

700
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,070
So you were a man?

701
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,110
What have you done up to now

702
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,410
as the President
of the Young Adult Association?

703
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,160
Goodness gracious.

704
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,910
Then what have you done as
the President of the Women's Association?

705
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,040
-Tell me.
-Hey!

706
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,790
What are you doing?

707
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,550
-We can't fight among ourselves.
-He's right.

708
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,680
Last year, people
in the next village got into a fight,

709
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,760
then someone put pesticide in the well
and everyone died.

710
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,360
Why the heck are you saying
something so horrendous?

711
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,320
I'm just saying. Don't mind me.

712
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,200
Someone's there!

713
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,910
-What?
-Hey!

714
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,780
Hey! You!

715
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,080
What the heck is this?

716
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,160
Can you not hear me?

717
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,960
-Hey!
-Don't mess with my temper…

718
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,210
What? A woman?

719
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,550
Her stomach… She's pregnant too.

720
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,720
Did you bring this to shoot her?

721
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,510
No, I didn't.

722
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,760
-Darn you.
-Goodness.

723
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,850
Hey, I'm pregnant too!

724
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,810
I just gave birth to my kid too!

725
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,770
That's wonderful news!

726
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,480
Then our children will be the same age.

727
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,150
It'll be wonderful to see them grow, play,
and go to school together.

728
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,860
Hey, you're right.

729
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,320
Gum-ja, when are you due this month?

730
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,790
-Less than half a month.
-What?

731
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,790
Goodness, really?

732
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,960
I hope it's a son this time.

733
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,540
She's having a son!

734
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,460
-What?
-What?

735
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,300
I went to this famous fortune teller,

736
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,090
and this time, she's having a son.

737
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,380
-Really?
-My goodness!

738
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,680
She's really having a son?

739
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,220
-My goodness, this is wonderful!
-She is!

740
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,850
This is great news!

741
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,430
Congratulations.

742
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,600
I should butcher a pig.

743
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,400
-Sounds great!
-Yes, pork is a must for feasts!

744
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
-Yes.
-Goodness.

745
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,650
-I want some boiled pork.
-Wait!

746
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,820
We don't know if your kid
and my kid will go to school together.

747
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,070
Because you can't run a pig farm
in this village.

748
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,410
-Why not?
-Why do you think?

749
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,000
We'll keep filing civil complaints
to stop you.

750
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,710
And what if the pig catches
some contagious disease?

751
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,380
The entire village will get quarantined.

752
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,300
We can't live with this inconvenience!

753
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,590
Hey.

754
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,590
I'm the village head.

755
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,430
An unpleasant facility such as a pig farm

756
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,600
requires the understanding
and agreement of the villagers.

757
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,850
That's common sense
and it's the right thing to do.

758
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,980
Yes.

759
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,450
In that case,

760
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,320
may I file a civil complaint too?

761
00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,990
Pardon?

762
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,450
Your dogs bark all day long,
and it's so loud.

763
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,120
I can't stand it.

764
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,080
And you've occupied state-owned land
without permission, right?

765
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,210
State-owned land?

766
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,540
You dry pepper on the road!

767
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,550
It's very inconvenient,
trying to avoid stepping on it.

768
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,420
And you, the village head.
You instigated the villagers

769
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,180
to vote for a certain candidate.

770
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,890
-That's illegal campaigning.
-Well…

771
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,640
They can vote for anyone
in this democratic country.

772
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,640
That's common sense
and it's the right thing to do.

773
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,650
The plastic greenhouse in the forest
should be pulled down!

774
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,650
It blocks my view of the mountains,

775
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,770
-and it's very inconvenient!
-Goodness.

776
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,110
And you, why do you use so much pesticide?

777
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,110
What if you damage the land?

778
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,370
Why do you care if I damage
the land I own?

779
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,990
You don't own the frogs and loaches
that live there!

780
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,910
You bitch.

781
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,250
What are you doing?

782
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,790
-Let her go!
-Stop that!

783
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,420
That's my husband you're talking to!

784
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
-That's enough!
-You people started this!

785
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,840
-Let go!
-Goodness!

786
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,340
-Let go!
-No, you let go!

787
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,800
-Let go!
-Stop this!

788
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,090
What's wrong?

789
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,220
-What's wrong with her?
-What…

790
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,470
Goodness.

791
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,640
Are you all right?

792
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,230
-Let go of him!
-Let go!

793
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,730
-What are you doing?
-Let go!

794
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,640
Gum-ja!

795
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,810
-You're making my husband bald!
-Let go!

796
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,360
-Stop pulling his hair!
-Let go of her!

797
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,280
Let go!

798
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,570
One second.

799
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,240
-I think she's about to give birth.
-Goodness.

800
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,070
-Goodness.
-Oh, no.

801
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,530
Goodness, what do we do?

802
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,240
-What's that?
-Goodness.

803
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,330
-Her water broke.
-Goodness.

804
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,740
-We have to hurry.
-Wait.

805
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,330
-Yes?
-Sung-ae, go boil some water.

806
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,540
-Okay.
-Gum-ja, go to her room

807
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,880
and lay out the bedding.

808
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,500
I'll grab the tools.

809
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,630
-Tools?
-Scissors!

810
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,670
-Scissors, yes.
-Yes.

811
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,010
Move!

812
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,550
Hey, hop on!

813
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,770
I called you ages ago!
Why the heck aren't you here yet?

814
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,890
No, it's Jou-ri!

815
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,310
What do you mean, Cho Yong-pil? Darn it.

816
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,730
Hello?

817
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,070
-Please look after Jou-ri
-Hey!

818
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,650
-and the unborn child…
-You jerks!

819
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,820
Will you take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

820
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,870
Yes, you're doing well.

821
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,700
Yes, listen to me.

822
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,710
You can't clench your stomach.

823
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,960
-Don't do that.
-Right.

824
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,840
Think of this as taking a dump

825
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,210
-and flex your buttocks.
-Okay.

826
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,590
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

827
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,680
So?

828
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,470
Are the scissors ready?

829
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,720
I'm coming!

830
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,730
It's nice and sharp.

831
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,020
This is sharp enough to cut down
the wood a woodchuck would chuck.

832
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,980
Goodness.

833
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,190
I can never say that right.

834
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,030
Wood a woodchunk would chunk.

835
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,490
No, wood a woodchuck would chuck.

836
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,070
-Woond…
-A woodchunk could chunk.

837
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,780
-Would chunk.
-Can you do it?

838
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,950
A wood a woodchunk would…

839
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,460
Wood a woodchuck…

840
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,120
-Goodness.
-would chuck!

841
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,210
That's right!

842
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,800
Wood a woodchuck would chuck. You're good!

843
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,960
Goodness, quiet down.

844
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:00,880
Quiet down.

845
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,260
All of you, hold her hands.

846
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,720
-Hands.
-Right here.

847
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,970
Here we go.

848
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,180
One, two, three.

849
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,310
-Push!
-Push!

850
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,980
Push!

851
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,940
-Okay, good.
-Goodness.

852
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,110
You can't relax like this again.

853
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,820
You're giving the child
a tough time in here.

854
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,780
Think of your child

855
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,870
and think of this as the last time.

856
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,910
Let's try this one more time
with all your energy.

857
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,120
One, two, three.

858
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,210
-Push!
-Push!

859
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,090
-It's coming!
-I see the baby!

860
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,170
-I see the baby!
-More!

861
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,840
You still haven't found us?

862
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,720
It's right under the persimmon tree!

863
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,560
It's next to Gu Ja-yeong's place!

864
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,560
Hey, you punk.
Don't you know who Gu Ja-yeong is?

865
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,520
You know, his grandpa
was our middle school principal…

866
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,900
-Is the baby here?
-Yes!

867
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,450
The baby's born!
I'm hanging up, you stinking punk!

868
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,910
-The baby is here!
-The baby's here?

869
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,700
-The baby is here!
-The baby is here!

870
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,410
-It's here!
-It's here!

871
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,120
The baby is here!

872
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,710
Your mommy is here.

873
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,130
Goodness.

874
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,710
My gosh.

875
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,630
Kang-ho.

876
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,510
"Choi Kang-ho"?

877
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,560
Yes, Kang-ho.

878
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,690
A really competent and strong person.

879
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,150
I wanted him to be like that,
so that's what the name means.

880
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,860
-I love it. Kang-ho.
-Isn't it nice?

881
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,070
And Kang-ho isn't just any strong person.

882
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,910
He's the strongest one.

883
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,700
-Choi Kang-ho.
-Choi Kang-ho.

884
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,910
Look.

885
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,910
Kang-ho, it's me, your father.

886
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Choi Kang-ho.

887
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,250
You have to grow up
as a powerful and strong person.

888
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,420
Okay?

889
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,340
Okay.

890
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,460
He just said yes.

891
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,260
Honey.

892
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,300
He's our Kang-ho.

893
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,510
I'll raise him well.

894
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,680
I'll raise him

895
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,020
to be the strongest man.

896
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,570
His name is Kang-ho.

897
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,450
So?

898
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,790
So? Which is it?

899
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,580
The delivery was successful.

900
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,420
Which is it?

901
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,550
A boy.

902
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,340
-A boy!
-A boy!

903
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,590
-Goodness.
-A boy.

904
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,010
-Is he healthy?
-Of course!

905
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,390
-Why are you crying?
-Why are you crying?

906
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,930
-What?
-Why are you crying?

907
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,470
I'm practicing.

908
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,810
-What?
-I'll also have a son very soon.

909
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,690
Goodness, this guy.

910
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,310
-You surprised us.
-You startled me.

911
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,070
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

912
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,690
-Oh, my.
-What?

913
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,440
What are you doing?

914
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,490
Are you practicing too?

915
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,990
-Stop it.
-No, I have a few more days.

916
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,120
-Right?
-Yes.

917
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,620
What…

918
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,120
-Oh, my.
-What?

919
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,210
Goodness, it must be for real.

920
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,040
Mother, you need to come out!

921
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,790
-What's going on?
-What do we do?

922
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,380
I can't believe this.

923
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,130
Take this. Hurry.

924
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,180
My goodness.

925
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,640
Boil some water.

926
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,760
Go get water.

927
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,180
Goodness.

928
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,680
-No, stay with me right now.
-Hello?

929
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,690
It's the same Cho Yong-pil place.

930
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,480
I need your help.

931
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,440
On the same day, same hour,
and under the same roof.

932
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,610
Goodness.

933
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,660
What are the chances?

934
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,740
Tell me about it.

935
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,620
There have never been births like this.

936
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,460
Is this meant to be or fate?

937
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,710
That's a funny saying.

938
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,590
It'll be a huge hit
if that comes out in a movie.

939
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,590
Really?

940
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,930
Anyway, where's your husband?

941
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,930
What's wrong?

942
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,560
He went home.

943
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,350
That son of a gun.

944
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,900
Mother.

945
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,030
-Well, I…
-It's fine.

946
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:35,280
He is a son of a gun.

947
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,120
Son of a gun.

948
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,830
Good, smile.

949
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,410
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

950
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,040
-There, there.
-Goodness.

951
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,540
We say it's meant to be

952
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,840
to someone whom we meet
for the first time.

953
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,840
But fate is

954
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,890
what we say to someone
who stays with us until the end.

955
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,060
I'm not sure if this is
just meant to be or fate,

956
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,270
but I hope all these babies
who are born in Jou-ri,

957
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,480
including Sam-sik,

958
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,360
stay healthy for a very long time

959
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,530
and be good friends for a long time.

960
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,740
Sam-sik, they're like
your younger siblings.

961
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,700
-Sam-sik is--
-In that case,

962
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,830
are we not kicking out the dirty pig farm?

963
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,210
-That little…
-Are we kicking her out?

964
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,590
Cover your ears.

965
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,050
Goodness, look at them.

966
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,640
You can't go this time either?

967
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,100
I can't believe her.

968
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,770
You can't skip studying for just one day?

969
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,530
Should I ask your mom

970
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,070
to let you go to the picnic?

971
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,950
I'm sorry.

972
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,580
I didn't mean to hit you with it.

973
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,370
Now it'll reek of pig poop.

974
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,660
I'm sorry.

975
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,340
Smell this.

976
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,420
No!

977
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,630
Sam-sik, you jerk!

978
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,760
Why the heck do you keep bullying Kang-ho?

979
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,890
Why?

980
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,310
Why do you like him?

981
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,020
All that idiot does is study.

982
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,100
But then,

983
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,440
he should study hard.

984
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,310
He's a loser who doesn't have a dad!

985
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,030
You son of a bitch!

986
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,030
"Son of a bitch"?

987
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,490
Who taught you
to swear at your friend like that?

988
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,790
Where did you learn such foul language?

989
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,160
That son of a bitch made fun of me first!

990
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,790
He said I'm a loser with no dad

991
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,840
and to get lost
because I smell like pig poop!

992
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,590
Did you just say "son of a bitch" again?

993
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,680
ENCYCLOPEDIA
THE PERIODIC TABLE

994
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,340
You don't have to feel ashamed.

995
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,680
He's not entirely wrong.

996
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,970
You don't have a father

997
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,480
and a pig farm does smell like pig poop.

998
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,270
See your first birthday picture?

999
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,020
I put out a stethoscope,
money, a microphone,

1000
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:18,570
and even your favorite robot toy.

1001
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,280
But that gavel is what you picked.

1002
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,490
Let him say whatever he wants.

1003
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,240
If he insults you, let him.

1004
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,410
Once you study hard
and become a prosecutor,

1005
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,080
no one will be able to
look down on you or bully you.

1006
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,920
That's true power.

1007
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,590
Do you understand?

1008
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,590
Is that why
I can't go to the school picnic?

1009
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,010
That's right.

1010
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,470
You can never become successful

1011
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,850
without sacrifice.

1012
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,940
Stop eating if you're full.

1013
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,780
You'll get sleepy if you're too full.

1014
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,200
You got 3 wrong out of 100.

1015
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,660
Correct your mistakes
and solve the problems until page 130.

1016
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,640
AUTUMN PICNIC ANNOUNCEMENT

1017
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,600
PLEASE FILL OUT BELOW
GRADE 4

1018
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:36,560
REASON FOR ABSENCE

1019
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:47,410
BAD MOM

1020
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,700
I'm home!

1021
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,170
It's Grandma's favorite, meat pancakes!

1022
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,090
Don't touch it
before the memorial service.

1023
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,050
This one is torn.

1024
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:10,100
You can't serve a piece like this.

1025
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,520
What's wrong?

1026
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,230
Mom, are you crying?

1027
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,900
Crazy brat.

1028
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,900
I'm not crying.

1029
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,870
Darn it. The smoke is getting in my eyes.

1030
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,080
Dad!

1031
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,970
What's with you?

1032
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,930
-Come on out!
-Let go of me!

1033
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,060
Or I'll report this bar
for opening during the day.

1034
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,240
Goodness.

1035
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,200
Jennifer, you're becoming
a better dancer each day.

1036
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,710
You're flattering me.

1037
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,040
-Please sit.
-Thank you.

1038
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,880
Have some.

1039
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,170
My goodness!

1040
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,340
What are you doing here?

1041
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,340
Dad.

1042
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,180
What?

1043
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,430
Good grief.

1044
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Let go, you brat.

1045
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,190
If you don't want to die
on the same day Grandma passed,

1046
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,230
you better come out.

1047
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,900
Do you want one?

1048
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:08,590
Let's go.

1049
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,880
Mi-joo!

1050
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:13,390
I'll be home before the sun sets!

1051
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,680
Red fruit on the right,
white fruit on the left!

1052
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,430
Dried fish on the left,
sikhye on the right!

1053
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,940
Call me, call me, call, call, give a call

1054
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,900
They're so pretty!

1055
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,400
If you want my heart, I'll give it to you

1056
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:30,110
Just like this, your love is

1057
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,860
All for me

1058
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,870
I'll give you my heart

1059
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,830
Isn't it enough that Dad's out dancing?

1060
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,450
Do you have to do this nonsense?

1061
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,120
What's with you?

1062
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,250
-Stop dancing!
-Why should I?

1063
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,950
Where's this darned little brat?

1064
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:15,870
Lee Mi-joo!

1065
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,370
Hey, you brat!

1066
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,660
Why do you keep doing this to my hand?

1067
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:25,380
What's that?

1068
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,460
Is she eating gimbap?

1069
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:28,710
Oh, my.

1070
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,010
You brat! You little…

1071
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,260
That was for your school trip!

1072
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,050
Stop right there, you brat!

1073
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,260
I missed the damn shot.

1074
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,350
Hey! Pass!

1075
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,480
-Pass!
-You're so handsome!

1076
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,600
Pass!

1077
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,110
I root for the winning team!

1078
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,940
Pass!

1079
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,150
You're so good-looking!

1080
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,610
Pass.

1081
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,410
-Go!
-Let's go!

1082
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,370
Oh, my!

1083
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,120
I knew you'd be here.

1084
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,750
How did you know…

1085
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,300
You'd always disappear
during lunch and dinner,

1086
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,550
so I tailed you for a few days.

1087
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,880
Right.

1088
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,300
Here, it's your present.

1089
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,770
I mean, you've never been
on a school picnic or trip,

1090
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:26,060
so you probably never had a chance
to eat gimbap.

1091
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,190
I wondered what I should get you
for your birthday,

1092
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,730
then thought of this.

1093
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,030
-For my birthday?
-Today's your birthday.

1094
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,990
And my birthday as well.

1095
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,840
Goodbye, Choi Kang-ho.

1096
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,720
Good luck.

1097
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,770
Why are you picking out the carrots?

1098
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,770
I don't like carrots.

1099
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,190
You do?

1100
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,980
Kang-ho doesn't like carrots. Noted.

1101
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,780
Wait, what?

1102
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,790
-Why don't you have some more?
-I'm done.

1103
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,450
You only had five pieces.
What do you mean?

1104
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,370
You should have some more.

1105
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,870
No, it's okay. I can't be full.

1106
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,170
Why not?

1107
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,800
I get sleepy when I'm full.

1108
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,630
If I'm sleepy, I can't study.

1109
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,760
If I don't study,
I can't become a prosecutor.

1110
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,720
That's nonsense.

1111
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:46,600
Right? It does sound like nonsense.

1112
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,230
Like our names, zodiac signs,
and blood types,

1113
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:55,730
I thought everyone was born
under a specific job.

1114
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,110
So when I saw kids
switching dreams every semester,

1115
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,160
-I thought they were ridiculous.
-Right.

1116
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,580
But it turns out,
I was the ridiculous one.

1117
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,500
If you don't like that,
it's not too late to do what you want.

1118
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,670
What I want?

1119
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,670
Yes.

1120
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,380
What is that?

1121
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,050
Come to think about it,
I've never thought about that.

1122
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,640
Kang-ho, you poor thing.

1123
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,900
That's the bell.
Let's go for our night study.

1124
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,810
Okay.

1125
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,820
What do we do?

1126
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,570
I think it's locked.

1127
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,370
Hello?

1128
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,330
-Hello?
-Hello?

1129
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,710
-Hello? Hey!
-Hello? -We're in here.

1130
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:52,670
Hey!

1131
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:54,540
Darn it.

1132
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,920
Hey! We're in here!

1133
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,260
Is anybody out there?

1134
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,590
Hello?

1135
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,970
Kang-ho.

1136
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,550
That's enough.

1137
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,180
URI HIGH SCHOOL

1138
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,240
FOOD FOR THE BRAIN

1139
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:43,050
WE'RE ALL JOU-RI FAMILY

1140
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,970
What on earth is going on?

1141
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,970
These kids never caused any trouble.
What's happening?

1142
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,190
Was he acting differently lately?

1143
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,940
No, not at all.

1144
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,020
Oh, right.

1145
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:01,110
Mi-joo took gimbap
when she left this morning.

1146
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,320
-Gimbap?
-Yes.

1147
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,030
Maybe they went
to hang out at Bongil Stream.

1148
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,910
Tomorrow is the midterm.
He wouldn't do that.

1149
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,450
The midterm is tomorrow?

1150
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,580
Good grief, that little brat.

1151
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,790
This is bad.

1152
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,580
It won't be good if high school kids
end up having a child.

1153
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,460
Hey! Watch what you say!

1154
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,340
She's quite unwell.
Please try to understand.

1155
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:27,470
I'm unwell?

1156
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,510
Sam-sik.

1157
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,890
-Sam-sik!
-Sam-sik, are you in?

1158
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:32,970
-Sam-sik!
-Sam-sik!

1159
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,810
-The lights turned on.
-The lights.

1160
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,690
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

1161
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:39,980
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1162
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,900
Why are you here at this ungodly hour?

1163
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,990
Kang-ho and Mi-joo are missing.

1164
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,610
Kang-ho's missing?

1165
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:48,990
Mi-joo too?

1166
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,280
Wait, Mi-joo was in there too?

1167
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,790
In there? Where?

1168
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,290
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

1169
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,210
-Mom, move.
-Sam-sik!

1170
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,880
-Sam-sik!
-Hey!

1171
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,960
Where are you going?
We came down that way!

1172
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,670
No!

1173
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,270
Do we have to stay here all night?

1174
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,650
Why do they make us
turn in our cell phones?

1175
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,740
Everyone must be freaking out now.

1176
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,200
I'm hungry. Do we have food?

1177
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,410
I found candy.

1178
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:36,790
-Kang-ho, I'll give you half.
-It's okay.

1179
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,160
I don't like candy.

1180
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,670
You dislike a lot of things.

1181
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,720
It's okay.

1182
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,890
I only need you to like me.

1183
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,430
Okay?

1184
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,640
Hey! Think about it.

1185
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,230
You're locked up in this place
with a girl.

1186
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,520
All you can do is study?

1187
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,740
What about me? Pay some attention to me.

1188
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,870
"Perhaps love is as such."

1189
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,790
Love?

1190
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:22,920
"Like a rainshower, it suffocates me…

1191
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:27,170
from the head and covers me."

1192
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,640
That rainshower is a simile.

1193
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,890
It might be on the exam tomorrow.

1194
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,060
Forget it.

1195
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:49,400
I'm going to lose weight, become pretty,
and marry into a good family.

1196
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,780
I can do it.

1197
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,780
All you do is study.

1198
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,080
Who cares if you get all As?

1199
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,370
You're an F when it comes to social cues.

1200
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,210
Hey, what's wrong?

1201
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,590
Are you choking on the candy?

1202
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,180
This isn't good. Come here.

1203
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,140
Spit it out on three.

1204
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,770
One, two, three.

1205
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,310
One, two, three.

1206
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:23,640
Again. One, two, three!

1207
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,690
Three! Again.

1208
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:25,860
One, two, three!

1209
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,000
You bastard!

1210
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,160
Goodness.

1211
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,170
Sam-sik.

1212
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,790
Why did you push him so hard?

1213
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,000
Are you all right?

1214
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,340
How long have you been here?

1215
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,550
Did you miss your supplementary class?

1216
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,220
KEY POINTS OF AT THE END OF CICADA'S CRY

1217
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,190
I'm sorry for causing trouble
at this hour.

1218
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:10,980
You.

1219
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,900
I was worried sick about you.

1220
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,620
Goodness, it's all right.

1221
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,280
It's fine. Nothing bad happened.

1222
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,620
They're both clothed. Nothing happened.

1223
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:27,830
Let's go.

1224
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,540
Go get your backpack.

1225
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,010
Let's go. We'll talk at home.

1226
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,390
I…

1227
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,970
She's so intense.

1228
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,850
How could she worry about
the supplementary class in this situation?

1229
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,310
Goodness, she's a great woman.

1230
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,780
But why is she so harsh to her son?

1231
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,570
That's why Kang-ho grew up so well.

1232
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,860
He's never caused any trouble,

1233
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,410
and he's the top student in the country.

1234
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,660
Shut up.

1235
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,750
Well, I guess it'll be great

1236
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:08,210
if he studies hard and goes into law.

1237
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,460
What's so good about that?

1238
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:15,340
To be frank, people here could live
an honest life even without the law.

1239
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,550
Not everyone.

1240
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,550
Sam-sik is an exception.

1241
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,970
-Gosh.
-What?

1242
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,390
You cursed woman!

1243
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,020
-You and your mouth!
-Come on.

1244
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,150
Let's go. It's late. Come with me.

1245
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,940
How could she say that?

1246
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,520
You darn punk.

1247
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,190
How could you lock up your friends?

1248
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,240
Do you want to get expelled from school?

1249
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,700
I don't care about school,

1250
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,660
but can you cut off my hands?

1251
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,870
What have I done?

1252
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,000
You darn punk.

1253
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,550
Are you trying to
disgrace your mother and father?

1254
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,590
You have exams tomorrow,
so I didn't make seaweed soup.

1255
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:04,810
I'll make it after the exams.

1256
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,850
I had

1257
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,020
gimbap earlier.

1258
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:16,900
All right.

1259
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,240
You'll be sleepy if you're full.

1260
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,110
Finish your studies and go to bed.

1261
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,330
2007 COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM

1262
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,500
DO WELL ON THE EXAM
CONQUER YOUR EXAM

1263
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,460
Don't be nervous.

1264
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,550
Do as you've always done.

1265
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,590
Read your questions thoroughly
and manage your time well.

1266
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,680
Right.

1267
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,100
Don't eat too much for lunch.

1268
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,180
You'll get sleepy
during the listening test.

1269
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,560
Okay.

1270
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,770
-Good luck!
-You'll do well!

1271
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:53,900
Kang-ho.

1272
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,020
-Kang-ho.
-Good luck!

1273
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,570
-Kang-ho, over here.
-Please move your car.

1274
01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:00,070
-All right, I will.
-Good luck!

1275
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:03,200
-Good luck!
-Kang-ho!

1276
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,240
Kang-ho!

1277
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,330
You came? You're already admitted.

1278
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,450
I came to show support for my boyfriend.

1279
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,290
Oh, my. Did I just say boyfriend?

1280
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,380
How silly of me.

1281
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,630
Give me your hand.

1282
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,000
What?

1283
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,260
Stay still, okay?

1284
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,350
I read your horoscope today,

1285
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,970
and the lucky color is yellow
for the Year of the Dragon.

1286
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,600
So here.

1287
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,020
How pretty.

1288
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:37,770
There.

1289
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,780
I colored my nails too.

1290
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,190
And these.

1291
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,030
This is a fork so you can
pick the correct answers.

1292
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,160
And a roll of toilet paper.
You'll be on a roll.

1293
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,040
And this, a tambourine.

1294
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,460
Do well!

1295
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:54,960
Hey.

1296
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,960
And here's the highlight.

1297
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,920
Gimbap.

1298
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:02,340
After the exam,

1299
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,300
you're going to eat as much as you want.

1300
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:09,140
And you've never been to the movies
or to karaoke, so we're doing that too.

1301
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,770
You're allowed to do that today, right?

1302
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,560
-Yes.
-Good.

1303
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,360
I'll be praying for you
and I'll stick around until the end.

1304
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,150
Kang-ho, go get it!

1305
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,320
Go…

1306
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,490
-Go get it!
-Go get it!

1307
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,530
And this one too. Go now.

1308
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,410
Perfect score, Choi Kang-ho!

1309
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:34,210
I can't live without you!

1310
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,500
Perfect score…

1311
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,380
Mi-joo!

1312
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,970
Mi-joo!

1313
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:50,930
Excuse me.

1314
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,470
-What happened?
-Mi-joo.

1315
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,600
Mi-joo, are you okay?

1316
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,480
Mi-joo, wait… Mi-joo.

1317
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,270
Mi-joo, stay with me.

1318
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,270
Mi-joo!

1319
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,690
Mi-joo, stay with me.

1320
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,320
Finally, today is the day.

1321
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,280
Kang-ho

1322
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,660
has studied very hard until this day.

1323
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,830
HERE RESTS CHOI HAE-SIK

1324
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,500
You know it better than I do.

1325
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,830
Help him do well on the exam

1326
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,210
so the time he spent studying
won't be in vain.

1327
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,170
You have to help him, okay?

1328
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,560
Are you okay, Mi-joo?

1329
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,360
Why are you here?

1330
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,650
-What about the exam?
-You can't get up yet.

1331
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,030
The exam.

1332
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,860
So?

1333
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,160
I can't believe this.

1334
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,080
You're crazy.

1335
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,420
-No, Mi-joo.
-What about the exam?

1336
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,380
Mi-joo, it's okay.

1337
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:07,800
Mi-joo, it's all right.

1338
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,590
It's okay.

1339
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,550
I can take the exam next year.

1340
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,520
It's okay.

1341
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:31,450
-Get out.
-Mom.

1342
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:33,620
Do I have to pour pig poop on you?

1343
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:38,330
Were you the only one there?

1344
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:40,540
Are you her guardian?

1345
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,790
You didn't hit her.

1346
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,000
Why did you have to miss the exam?

1347
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,380
Do you not realize
how important today was?

1348
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,420
Mom.

1349
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,920
-Mi-joo got hurt.
-So what?

1350
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,720
-Did she die?
-Mom!

1351
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,640
Why should you ruin your life
because of her?

1352
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,810
Why?

1353
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,640
My life?

1354
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,690
Do I have a life?

1355
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,270
What?

1356
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,070
This is your life.

1357
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,320
I'm sick and tired of this.

1358
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,450
You're suffocating me to death!

1359
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,210
You made a decision over my life
and forced it on me.

1360
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,540
Is it my fault that Dad died like that?

1361
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,760
Yes.

1362
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,260
Exactly.

1363
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:38,060
Whose fault is it then?

1364
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,560
For what reason did your dad die?

1365
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,560
I need to know that!

1366
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,400
You're sick and tired of this?

1367
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,900
You want to run away?

1368
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,410
Then become a prosecutor.

1369
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,410
That's your only ticket out

1370
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,330
from this disgusting pigsty smell

1371
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,500
and your bad mother.

1372
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,300
You're right.

1373
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,720
You are

1374
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:16,640
a bad person.

1375
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,680
Why do I ruin my life
because of someone else?

1376
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,980
You taught me to live that way!

1377
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:26,230
You told me to become a powerful man

1378
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,400
and help those who are weak and in need!

1379
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:32,860
But no.

1380
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,900
You were just

1381
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,450
frustrated to live as the weak.

1382
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:40,410
You just wanted
to get that power through me.

1383
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:41,540
You…

1384
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:46,920
wanted to raise me into a selfish snob
just like those who killed Dad.

1385
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,590
Okay, fine.

1386
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:54,170
I'll do that.

1387
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,980
Kang-ho has a trial today.

1388
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:56,610
Please help him win again.

1389
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,530
Please.

1390
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,820
PROSECUTOR

1391
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:05,290
Prosecutor, request the sentencing.

1392
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:10,210
Jung Min-ho, the victim,
fell and passed away on December 22, 2020

1393
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:12,580
at the construction site
of Woobyeok Stay in Sua-dong

1394
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,130
due to the lack of scaffolding
of the exterior railing.

1395
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,630
He worked in the uppermost site,

1396
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,930
but there was
no safety equipment available,

1397
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:25,640
such as safety belts or nets,
which could have saved his life.

1398
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,770
Defendant Park Cheol-su,
the CEO of the subcontractor,

1399
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,310
ignored the constant request

1400
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,690
of Woobyeok Construction
for safety supervision

1401
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:38,740
and installation of safety nets
from the moment the construction began.

1402
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,910
Your Honor.

1403
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,370
The victim, Jung Min-ho,
sought a construction site

1404
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,170
to pay for his college
just before his school year began,

1405
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,500
but he passed at such a young age.

1406
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,670
Please consider this injustice

1407
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,550
and the seriousness of the crime
which the defendant has committed

1408
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,550
and sentence him to three years in prison.

1409
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,280
The defendant, Park Cheol-su,

1410
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:21,820
did not only cause damage
to the victim's assets,

1411
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:26,240
but also irrevocable damage,
that is, the death of a laborer.

1412
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:27,780
Formal adjudication.

1413
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:30,660
The defendant is sentenced
to three years in prison.

1414
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:31,830
Prosecutor Choi.

1415
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,790
I have something to say.

1416
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,750
My husband was threatened.

1417
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,550
They pressured him with the schedule
as soon as they began.

1418
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,090
That's why the construction was rushed.

1419
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,260
He demanded more safety nets
and scaffoldings again and again,

1420
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:50,640
but Woobyeok Construction ignored him,
using the cost as an excuse.

1421
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,020
And when the accident happened,

1422
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,560
they pinned the blame on him.

1423
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,450
This is my husband's old phone.

1424
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,950
There's a recording of a call
he had with Woobyeok Construction.

1425
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:12,660
Why did you bring this important evidence
to me and not to your attorney?

1426
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,290
Because the attorney

1427
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:15,790
works for Woobyeok Construction.

1428
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:21,090
But you can help him.

1429
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:22,960
Please.

1430
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,590
Please help him.

1431
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,310
Thank you for plucking up
the courage to do this.

1432
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,650
I'll be in contact.

1433
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,520
Thank you.

1434
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,980
Thank you, Prosecutor Choi.

1435
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,070
Thank you.

1436
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,590
WOOBYEOK GROUP

1437
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,970
This is Choi Kang-ho.

1438
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,220
Things have become troublesome.

1439
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,830
There you are, Prosecutor Choi.

1440
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:38,710
Hello, Chairman Song.

1441
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:00,650
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1442
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,280
Do you want to be my son?

1443
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,290
Don't you have a father?

1444
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:18,160
How's our prosecutor doing?

1445
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,210
-Tell her I'm not home.
-Tell her you're not home?

1446
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,290
I won't apologize.

1447
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,670
Someone like you can never call me Father.

1448
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,630
It's more than just that.

1449
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,890
Her social status will change.

1450
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,060
This is a true home run.

1451
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,430
Isn't this what you wanted?

1452
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:44,560
