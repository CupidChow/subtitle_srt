00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,560
-Find anything?
-Bring the cutter!

3
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,940
-Bring the cutter!
-Hurry!

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,190
-Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

5
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,070
-Did you…
-Bring it up.

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,280
Hey, come on.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,360
-Here.
-Is it burnt there?

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,820
Push it.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,160
-Done?
-Yes.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Kang-ho.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,320
Wake…

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,610
Wake up, Kang-ho.

13
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Kang-ho…

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,960
No!

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,960
No!

16
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,920
No, Kang-ho!

17
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,840
-Ma'am, calm down.
-Kang-ho!

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,840
Kang-ho!

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,010
Please save him!

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,430
My son!

21
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,770
My baby!

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,140
My baby! Please save him!

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,390
Please!

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,560
First of all,

25
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,400
we successfully stopped the hemorrhaging.

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,320
But his brain and body remain swollen.

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,070
His cervical spine was fractured

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
and he suffered
an injury to his spinal cord.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,910
Even if he gains consciousness,

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,080
I'm afraid he won't be able to return
to his normal life for some time.

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,670
Food?

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,000
You're inviting me to eat

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,210
when I've never been able
to enjoy a meal with you?

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,850
You're dozing off
because you're full and it's warm.

35
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,150
Study.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
You got it wrong again.

37
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,780
Learning Chinese characters
is mandatory for the bar exam.

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,080
Rewrite the ones you got wrong 100 times
and memorize them again.

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,420
Run!

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,710
Darn it.

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,460
What is he…

42
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,920
Mom…

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,930
You'll doze off on a full stomach.

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,980
I told you a million times.

45
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,810
Okay.

46
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,530
DOWON HOSPITAL

47
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,710
You should go eat.

48
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,050
How could she have an appetite
when her child is dying?

49
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,970
Dying?

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,430
Who's dying?

51
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,140
He's still breathing.

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,440
Both his pulse
and blood pressure are stable.

53
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,310
His hands and feet are warm.

54
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,070
His body is still functioning.

55
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,320
My son won't die.

56
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,910
No.

57
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,410
I won't…

58
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,870
I won't let him die.

59
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,790
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,050
Short! A double play!

61
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,170
Good play!

62
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,260
Yes!

63
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,510
Good throw. Nice play!

64
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,600
-Well done.
-It's all thanks to you.

65
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,890
This is how our team
made it to the Korean Series

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,850
after only two years in the league.

67
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,570
You were terrific today! Applause!

68
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,530
You were incredible!

69
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,900
Goodness. Yes?

70
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,200
Prosecutor Choi was in an accident.

71
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,570
He's in the ICU at Dowon Hospital.

72
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,080
What?

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,390
What a mess.

74
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,890
He could've just forged the document.

75
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,230
Yet he went all the way there
just to get that seal?

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,650
What about the other driver?

77
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,570
They haven't been identified yet.

78
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,860
The roads are blanketed
with CCTV cameras nowadays,

79
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,610
yet they can't find the guy?

80
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,740
The truck was a burner vehicle.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,660
Also, it was found
after it had been set on fire

82
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,660
and no fingerprints were recovered.

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,620
What?

84
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,040
A burner vehicle?

85
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,290
It was a burner vehicle?

86
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,340
Unbelievable.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
Right. Hold on.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,340
What happened to Oh Tae-soo's daughter?

89
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,830
It's okay.

90
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,340
What happened?

91
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,050
He most likely won't make it.

92
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,980
Well done.

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,900
Kang-ho.

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,140
Hold on.

95
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,970
That means…

96
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,020
he's still alive.

97
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,520
What do we do?

98
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
What if…

99
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,980
they find out?

100
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,530
CHAIRMAN SONG

101
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,330
I'll take care of that, so don't worry.

102
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,170
Just rest up for a few days.

103
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,890
Hello, Chairman Song.

104
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,400
Goodness. Thank God.

105
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,900
I heard your daughter
wasn't in the car when it happened.

106
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,610
What a relief.

107
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,030
My heart is still heavy
when I think of Prosecutor Choi.

108
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,280
Tell me about it.

109
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,330
I just saw him, and it broke my heart.

110
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,000
Anyway, both you and your daughter
must be shocked.

111
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,670
Take care of yourselves.

112
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,340
Let's catch up in person soon.

113
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
Goodbye.

114
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,220
He has a heavy heart?

115
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,890
Find that hit-and-run driver this instant.

116
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,600
Damn it! Everything's ruined!

117
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,900
Of course.

118
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,950
Everything else is fine.

119
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,780
But he hurt his leg,

120
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,080
so it'll take some time
for him to recover.

121
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,040
I asked them to find
an experienced farmhand.

122
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,540
But it's hard to hire anyone
since it's farming season.

123
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,090
Thank you in advance, Mr. Son.

124
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,130
Don't worry about the pigs,

125
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,720
and just focus on Kang-ho.

126
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,390
Yes. All right, bye.

127
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,270
What did she say?

128
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,440
How's Kang-ho?

129
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,730
He must've broken his leg.

130
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,860
-Oh, dear.
-Goodness.

131
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,190
He broke his mom's heart when he left.

132
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,990
He's being punished for it.

133
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,200
Gosh, don't say something like that
about our neighbor.

134
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,410
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

135
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,280
She's a fool.

136
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,830
She was always fixated on his studies.

137
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,080
All her hard work only made him
into such an impudent son.

138
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,080
As a parent,

139
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,300
you shouldn't bad-mouth
another parent's child.

140
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,430
To be honest,
Sam-sik is the most impudent one of all.

141
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,390
What do you mean?

142
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,770
Why are you bringing him up right now?

143
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,690
I mean, it's not like
he did anything serious.

144
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,360
Are you serious right now?

145
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,230
Let's be frank.

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,200
Raise your hand
if you've never been robbed by him.

147
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,910
From watermelons
and red peppers to rice wine…

148
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,410
I still don't get why he stole that
talisman from Mr. Son's gate.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,210
-Jeez.
-Even a talisman?

150
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,500
Have you gone insane?

151
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,510
I'm going to kill you
with my own hands today!

152
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,220
-Stop it.
-Goodness!

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,590
-Gosh!
-What are you doing?

154
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,840
Gosh, that's enough!

155
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,640
-That's enough!
-Hello.

156
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,810
Why did you bring that dog
when we're eating?

157
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,850
-Goodness.
-Jeez.

158
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,430
Is the food ready?

159
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,440
You're having the awful spicy noodles.

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,690
-What?
-What did you just say?

161
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,730
The food is what?

162
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,280
Awful.

163
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,950
What? You said the same thing.

164
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,950
You said Sung-ae couldn't cook
to save her life.

165
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,410
Don't eat it.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,160
-Don't eat it.
-What?

167
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,210
Don't eat it!

168
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,210
-Come on.
-Sung-ae.

169
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,790
-Bring it back!
-Bring it back!

170
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,130
Why are they always fighting?

171
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,300
They're setting an awful example for us.

172
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,680
At least we'll learn how to fight well.

173
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,840
Goodness me.

174
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,470
Excuse me.

175
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,930
Hello?

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,980
We're fully booked for the next two days.

177
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,360
One minute.

178
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,690
There's an opening this Friday at 8 p.m.

179
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,990
Okay. I'll reserve it for you.

180
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,780
Thank you. Goodbye.

181
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,990
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,540
You're raking in all the money
in this neighborhood.

183
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,420
I wish Bo-bae would quit her studies

184
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,380
and learn some useful skills like this.

185
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,750
She's always hanging out

186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,090
with her friends at night,
saying she's studying.

187
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,710
She needs to be more careful.

188
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,180
A rape and murder case occurred
in the next neighborhood.

189
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,140
Right. I heard.

190
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,970
He followed her knowing she lives alone

191
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,230
and attacked her
as soon as she opened the door.

192
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,980
Really? So did they catch him?

193
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,860
No. That's why everyone is panicking.

194
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,480
You guys live alone too, right?

195
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,230
You should be careful.

196
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,240
They ought to catch and ground him up.

197
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,280
That's pretty.

198
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,170
It's a miracle
that he can breathe on his own.

199
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,710
Let's move him to a general ward
and monitor him.

200
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,550
In the general ward, you're responsible
for taking care of his waste.

201
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,590
The drainage bag is connected here.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,300
This is the suppository.

203
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,600
He could get an infection
without proper care,

204
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,180
so please pay close attention.

205
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,770
Okay.

206
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,070
The number you have called does not exist.
Please check…

207
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,870
Excuse me.

208
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,330
Can I confirm her number again?

209
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,670
You've already done so three times, ma'am.

210
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,550
Then why does it say
that the number doesn't exist?

211
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,720
Maybe it doesn't.

212
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
Or maybe she changed her number.

213
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,770
Then could you give me
her home number or address?

214
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,560
Ma'am, we're not allowed to disclose
such information to strangers.

215
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,480
I'm not a stranger.

216
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,020
She's my son's fiancée
and my daughter-in-law.

217
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,610
Ma'am.

218
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,740
Mothers don't usually ask
a hospital's administration office

219
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,320
for their daughter-in-law's number.

220
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,200
-Mom!
-Mom!

221
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,500
Really?

222
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,710
Ms. Jo taught you English?

223
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,880
What did you learn?

224
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,310
Why did that woman
teach them such terrifying words?

225
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,020
Guys, don't meet her from now on.

226
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
No.

227
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,940
We need to learn English
if we want to see you soon.

228
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,650
I love the US.

229
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,200
All right.

230
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,660
I hope you learn English quickly
so we can live together.

231
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,290
By the way, who's that guy behind you?

232
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
What?

233
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,760
Stop pranking me and go to bed, okay?

234
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,970
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

235
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,860
A rape and murder case occurred

236
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,110
in the next neighborhood.

237
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,370
Mi-joo.

238
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,170
What are you doing?

239
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Mi-joo!

240
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,510
Bang Sam-sik?

241
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,970
Darn it.

242
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,560
You have all those normal clothes,
and you gave me this?

243
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,520
What? Do I?

244
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,150
You should've just gone home
after you got discharged.

245
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,860
Why did you come here?

246
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Goodness.

247
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm seriously regretting it myself.

248
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,380
Right. I'm supposed to give you tofu
since you're discharged.

249
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,380
-You already gave me something.
-What?

250
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,630
A good beating.

251
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,170
A painful one.

252
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,010
By the way, how did you know I lived here?

253
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,010
Well…

254
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,390
A long time ago,

255
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
you said that it was your dream

256
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,110
to open up your own nail salon.

257
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,070
Right.

258
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,940
You said the name would be Nail & Nail

259
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,940
and how brilliant the idea was.

260
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,660
So I looked up the name just in case.

261
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,660
And guess what? I found it.

262
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,240
You're incredible. You remembered that?

263
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,000
Of course, I did.

264
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,830
I remember watching you being born
while I was being carried

265
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,790
on my mom's back.

266
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,590
I'm the first guy who saw you naked.

267
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,050
-You lunatic.
-Goodness.

268
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,010
You were pretty.

269
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,180
Jeez.

270
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,520
I never visited you
while you were incarcerated.

271
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,520
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,730
Why would you visit me

273
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,230
when I was incarcerated
for committing a crime?

274
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,230
You didn't commit a crime.

275
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,490
You were used by those bad guys.

276
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,660
You were merely a victim.

277
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,370
Mi-joo.

278
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,410
Yes?

279
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,040
I realized being like that

280
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,870
was the worst sin you could commit.

281
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,410
What?

282
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,000
Letting others use you.

283
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,090
And

284
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,050
not being able to do anything about it
because you have no power,

285
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,510
money, or connections.

286
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,970
Just take it.

287
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,640
It's free.

288
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,690
From what I heard,

289
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,190
working on fishing vessels is hard work.

290
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,240
Take care of yourself.

291
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,280
And don't get caught
stealing things again.

292
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,740
If I ever steal anything again,

293
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,450
it's going to be your heart.

294
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,710
-Bye.
-Do you still like Kang-ho?

295
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,920
-What are you talking about? Go.
-Do you?

296
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What's with you? Go!

297
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,090
Just go. Go home safely.

298
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,180
Let's be honest,
I'm way more handsome than him.

299
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,470
Yes, you're right.

300
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,100
You're more handsome.

301
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,470
Thanks for today and this gift. Go now.

302
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,060
-You're handsome.
-But--

303
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Bye.

304
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,320
DISCHARGE

305
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,860
Goodness.

306
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,660
Goodness. Look at the size of this gem.

307
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,750
Goodness.

308
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,920
This is bigger than Mr. Son's tomatoes.

309
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,750
You're supposed to buy your parents
long johns with your first paycheck.

310
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,090
But you can't flaunt that,

311
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,220
and you like to show off.

312
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,050
I also felt bad

313
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,850
that you lost your wedding ring ages ago.

314
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,810
I never lost it.

315
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,640
I hid it in the doenjang crock

316
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,520
so you wouldn't steal it.

317
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,480
But you still found it and sold it.

318
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,650
I felt so happy back then.

319
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,820
-What?
-Because

320
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,530
I truly despised the ring
your dad had gotten for me.

321
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,540
The gem was so tiny
that it was barely visible.

322
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,750
What?

323
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,420
You had gained a lot of weight back then,

324
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,300
so the fat was covering the gem.

325
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,050
Thank you so much, Sam-sik.

326
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,130
Goodness, Sam-sik.

327
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,630
-My baby.
-What are you doing?

328
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,640
-Come here.
-What--

329
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,550
Goodness, my baby.

330
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,010
I can't believe you got me a ring.

331
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,350
-Gosh, you precious thing.
-Goodness!

332
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,400
It's nothing.

333
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,730
Just live a long life.

334
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,650
I'll make tons of money
so you can live comfortably.

335
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,780
-Gosh, my baby.
-Anyone home?

336
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,900
Let me go!

337
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,160
I didn't steal it!
I got it as my paycheck!

338
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,950
All right. Let's talk at the station.

339
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,740
Can you please just hear him out?

340
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,080
He said they gave it to him!

341
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,540
Was he going to steal things

342
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,500
to make our lives comfortable?

343
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,090
Was that it?

344
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,770
Bye.

345
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,690
-Bye.
-Dad.

346
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,280
-Hey.
-Gosh.

347
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,530
Goodness.

348
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,120
Excuse me!

349
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,620
Our son hasn't come out yet.

350
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,580
-What's his name?
-Bang Sam-sik.

351
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,920
He's…

352
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,420
not on the list.

353
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,380
-What?
-That can't be.

354
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,340
He said he needed money
for a discharge deposit,

355
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,430
so I wired it to him yesterday.

356
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,720
A discharge deposit?

357
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,640
You know,

358
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,150
it's to guarantee that
he'll behave once he's out.

359
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,230
There's no such thing.

360
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,950
Discharge deposits don't exist!

361
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,950
My goodness!

362
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,450
Do you know a Bang Sam-sik?

363
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,410
Of course, I do.

364
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,330
-He was discharged a week ago.
-What?

365
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,290
-A week ago?
-Yes.

366
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,170
I was totally speechless.

367
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,460
He stole the penitentiary's towels,
soap, and toothpaste.

368
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,550
Let's go.

369
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,050
-Darn it!
-Wait.

370
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,930
How much did you wire him?

371
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,260
Five million…

372
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:45,440
You son of a gun!

373
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,570
Then is it Ms. Jung's fault for laying out
the pesticide bottles by the road?

374
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,500
Or is it Mr. Son's fault
for running over them on his bike?

375
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,550
My son is a prosecutor at Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

376
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,890
He got the top score on the bar exam.

377
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,300
Goodness.

378
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,690
Look. My eyes aren't even.

379
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,940
Can I retrieve the land
even if it's under my brother's name?

380
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,780
-This is about your land?
-Correct.

381
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,820
She had taken out a dozen insurances.

382
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,910
-He turned out to be married.
-Oh, dear.

383
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,530
Please put in a good word for me
once he wakes up.

384
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,120
-Please.
-Okay.

385
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,790
-Thanks.
-Goodness.

386
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,210
No, I'm sorry.

387
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,710
-That's it for today.
-But--

388
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,670
Come again tomorrow.

389
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,040
What about just me?

390
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,000
Gosh.

391
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,460
She's done for the day.

392
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,970
Kang-ho.

393
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Look at this.

394
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,350
They're all waiting for you to wake up.

395
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,100
So,

396
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,020
wake up soon, okay?

397
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,540
Your fingernails have grown so much.

398
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,130
Nurse.

399
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,510
Nurse!

400
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,220
Nurse!

401
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,020
Kang-ho woke up!

402
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,440
My son woke up!

403
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Kang-ho!

404
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,240
Kang-ho. It's me, Mom.

405
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,320
Do you recognize me?

406
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,320
Kang-ho! It's me.

407
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,410
Your mom.

408
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,660
What's wrong?

409
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,330
It's me, Kang-ho.

410
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,300
As of now, we've given him
all the immediate treatments.

411
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,470
From now on,

412
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,880
the rehabilitation department
will take over

413
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,100
and monitor him.

414
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Doctor.

415
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,020
He'll be able to walk again, right?

416
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
As long as we keep up with the treatment.

417
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Right?

418
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,150
Let's hope for the best
as he receives his treatment.

419
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,450
I've seen many patients walk again
after rehabilitation.

420
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,160
-I see.
-However,

421
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,830
you need to understand
that he will be very different

422
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,080
from the person he used to be.

423
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,290
When you injure your head,

424
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,790
you sometimes lose most of the memories
prior to the accident.

425
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,300
And as for your son, he only has memories

426
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,340
of his childhood.

427
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,340
So it's like
he's become a child once again.

428
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,850
He also lacks cognitive ability right now.

429
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,770
We call that retrograde amnesia.

430
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,350
He's like…

431
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,270
a seven-year-old right now.

432
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,230
A seven-year-old?

433
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,610
Simply put, he is…

434
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,780
-Stupid?
-…stupid.

435
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,660
Well, maybe not to that extent, but…

436
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,990
Anyway, let's keep an eye on him.

437
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,000
Okay.

438
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,460
Thank you.

439
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,800
-You should go now.
-Yes, ma'am.

440
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,130
And could you keep the siren off?

441
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,300
Okay.

442
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,500
Ms. Jin?

443
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,170
Yes.

444
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,380
Hey, you're back.

445
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,430
You're back.

446
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,840
-I'm sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

447
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,720
Pour our guest a drink first.

448
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,730
I refuse to drink alcohol.

449
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
Goodness.

450
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,980
He flew in from Canada six months ago.

451
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,780
He understands Korean but can't speak it.

452
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,070
You're majoring in Korean
at Chungjin University, right?

453
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,780
You are correct.

454
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,870
-Right.
-You said

455
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,330
you needed help with your farm.

456
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,670
His father runs a pig farm back in Canada.

457
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,590
He wanted to learn about Korean pig farms

458
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:42,420
and the language itself,
so he's working part-time here.

459
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,510
Your name is Andrea, right?

460
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,630
Yes.

461
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,140
That's his name.

462
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,760
I don't know what your name means,

463
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,810
but if I had to guess, I'd say
it means something like "impolite."

464
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,520
Because you're not pouring me a drink!

465
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,850
-Pour him some.
-Pour me some.

466
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,230
It must be so tough for you all.

467
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,700
Don't regard it as a hardship.

468
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,830
What kind of bastard is teaching you
such difficult words?

469
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,450
This bastard.

470
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,750
KOREAN: DON'T REGARD IT AS A HARDSHIP

471
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,370
Jeez.

472
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,630
By the way,

473
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,380
has Kang-ho been discharged
from the hospital?

474
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,840
Yes.

475
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,090
Goodness.

476
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,140
It must've bothered him
to have treated you so harshly.

477
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,520
That's why he drove recklessly
and got into an accident.

478
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,310
I can't tell you when it'll be,

479
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,940
but when they set their date again,
make sure you're there at the wedding.

480
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,570
You must do that as his mom.

481
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,620
Okay.

482
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,330
Why did she plant so many?

483
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,370
This saves her money from buying pig feed.

484
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,880
She's always been hardworking.

485
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,170
What good is that
when she has an impudent son?

486
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,970
Jeez. There you go again.

487
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,590
But then again,
I'm in no position to bad-mouth her son.

488
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,270
-When is Sam-sik getting discharged?
-When is Mi-joo coming?

489
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,480
Let's get back to work.

490
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,770
Let's do that.

491
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,240
-I'm sorry.
-What?

492
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,070
-Goodness.
-Don't be.

493
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,780
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

494
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,490
-Long time no see.
-This is killing me.

495
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,620
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

496
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,920
Gosh, I guess it was strenuous.

497
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,830
I'm sore all over.

498
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,040
Of course.

499
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,300
-Gosh, I'm exhausted.
-Gum-ja, here.

500
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,170
Goodness. What are you doing?

501
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,550
I don't need that.

502
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,720
I'm doing this for my sake.

503
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,260
You must be insane.

504
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,970
You're making us feel bad.

505
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,440
Jeez, you're making me feel bad.

506
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,520
We didn't even visit Kang-ho
at the hospital.

507
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,690
Right. Where is he?

508
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,110
Is he here with you?

509
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Well…

510
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,820
No.

511
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,200
Why would he be here?

512
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,200
He's probably back at his own home.

513
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,080
He's a successful prosecutor.

514
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,120
He must have work piled up
after months of being at the hospital.

515
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,500
Thank goodness.

516
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,250
I was worried sick.

517
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,250
Is he all better now?

518
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,380
Yes.

519
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,260
Kang-ho, aren't you hungry?

520
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,180
Let's eat.

521
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,280
Do you remember this?

522
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,620
This was your first birthday.

523
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,210
You're holding a gavel.

524
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,830
You were destined to become a prosecutor.

525
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,790
Don't you agree?

526
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,420
And this was
your elementary school graduation.

527
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,510
We had our first heavy snow in 30 years,
so the graduation took place in the gym.

528
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,430
And this was
your middle school graduation.

529
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,970
You received an award
in front of the entire school.

530
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,100
I was on cloud nine.

531
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,350
And this was your high school graduation.

532
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,230
And this was taken at the institute
after you passed the bar exam.

533
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,780
After the ceremony,
we ate at the cafeteria there.

534
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,530
We had seasoned deodeok, bulgogi,
and winter cabbage doenjang soup.

535
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,200
You really enjoyed them.

536
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,460
Ta-da.

537
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,930
Here.

538
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,890
Open up.

539
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,360
What's the matter?

540
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,770
You're off the IV fluids,
so you need to eat.

541
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,610
Come on. Just one spoon.

542
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,150
Here.

543
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,160
What…

544
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,280
What's the matter with you?

545
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,700
Kang-ho, just one spoon.

546
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,380
Young-soon.

547
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,550
Hey.

548
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,460
You were home.

549
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,180
What brings you here?

550
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,970
You've been away for months.

551
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,140
Your kimchi must've gone bad,

552
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,470
so I brought some geotjeori.

553
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,770
This is beef bone soup.

554
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,440
You must've been sick of eating
hospital food.

555
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,030
So enjoy this hot meal.

556
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,610
Gosh.

557
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,280
You didn't have to.

558
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,410
Is someone here?

559
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,410
Sorry?

560
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,200
What do you mean?

561
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,830
There are two sets of utensils.

562
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,330
-Well…
-You're right.

563
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,330
What's going on?
Are you hiding someone in there?

564
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,540
No.

565
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,750
This smells fishy.

566
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,010
Don't tell me

567
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,090
you seduced a young doctor.

568
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,680
Of course not.

569
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,020
Wait! Hold on!

570
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,770
Who's there?

571
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,980
What? It's Kang-ho.

572
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,020
People will say that it's punishment.

573
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,520
Young-soon.

574
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,610
They'll say that it would've been better

575
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,740
had he died instead of living like that.

576
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,370
Who would say such a thing?

577
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,450
I did.

578
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,700
I thought that way when I saw
others in similar situations.

579
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,370
But you know what?

580
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,040
I was wrong.

581
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,460
Now that I'm going through it,

582
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,000
I know I was wrong.

583
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,420
I'm just…

584
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,680
so grateful that he's still alive.

585
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,930
My Kang-ho.

586
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,180
My one and only child.

587
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,850
I'm just

588
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,360
truly thankful that he survived…

589
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,030
the accident.

590
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,990
I really am.

591
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,710
What? Kang-ho?

592
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,130
I'm telling you.

593
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,130
She used to always gloat

594
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,470
that her son was a prosecutor.

595
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,890
You really never know
what can happen to you.

596
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,100
You should watch what you say.

597
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,810
When did she ever gloat?

598
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,070
It may not have been obvious, but she did.

599
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,400
I can't believe you.
What's the matter with you?

600
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,610
Whatever.

601
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,120
I'm just upset about it.

602
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,420
Jeez.

603
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,920
Either stop dieting or stop eating meat.

604
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,720
Choose one!

605
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,930
Be quiet!

606
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,100
You better not

607
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,430
run your mouth at the mill.

608
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,940
What? Run my mouth?

609
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,150
Unbelievable.

610
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,020
What do you take me for?

611
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,240
I'm not like you.

612
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,150
You have no idea how tight-lipped I am.

613
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,530
If I were born
during the Japanese colonization,

614
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,120
I would've been someone like Mr. Kim Gu.

615
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:59,500
Mr. Kim Gu once said this.

616
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:06,130
"In the end,
everything stems from yourself."

617
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,100
So you better not run your…

618
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,890
I mean, you better not
tell a soul about this.

619
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,970
Got it?

620
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,140
Anyway, this is a secret.

621
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,100
So you can't tell anyone.

622
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:22,230
Kang-ho is stupid

623
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
It's a secret

624
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,570
So you can't tell anyone

625
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,160
Kang-ho is stupid

626
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,460
What?

627
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,130
I thought he just injured his leg.

628
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,090
Did you take your evening medication
before you heard that?

629
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,420
Of course.

630
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,430
If I misheard them,

631
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,590
you can chop off my ears with a chainsaw.

632
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,180
What are you talking about?

633
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,560
And why would I do that?

634
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,730
I'd just burst your eardrums.

635
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,310
Hold on. That's not important right now.

636
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,530
Then what will happen to Kang-ho?

637
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,650
Nothing more will happen to him.

638
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,610
He's already stupid.

639
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,210
I'm sorry for keeping you out here
by yourself.

640
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,550
I just don't want you…

641
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,890
to see him

642
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,100
in that condition.

643
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,690
But…

644
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,810
you know me, right?

645
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,280
I'll never give up.

646
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,990
Everyone had lost hope.
They said he would never wake up.

647
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,530
But look.

648
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,240
He survived.

649
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,620
And since he survived,

650
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm going to make him live.

651
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,880
He'll get up, walk, and even run.

652
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,220
He's seven now.

653
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,760
He'll be eight next year
and nine the year after.

654
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,430
I'll raise him all over again.

655
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,520
Just watch and see.

656
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,730
Our son

657
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,070
will walk out of that room.

658
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,280
He'll stand here

659
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,240
and look at you.

660
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,040
I'll make sure he does.

661
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,910
No matter what.

662
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,600
CLEAN AND ODOR-FREE
KOREAN SMART PIGGERY

663
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,940
You're so handsome.

664
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,110
Did you sleep well?

665
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,580
Doesn't this look tasty?

666
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,370
Here.

667
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,620
It's tasty.

668
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,920
Cluck, cluck.

669
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
Knock, knock.

670
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,820
Lord!

671
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,030
I pray

672
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,080
-My Kang-ho…
-My son started his own business.

673
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,330
I pray that it will flourish.

674
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,080
Can you hear me?

675
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,420
-I pray to you, Lord.
-Please save my son!

676
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,010
You're a mother too.

677
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,470
So I'm sure you can empathize with me.

678
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,930
Please.

679
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,930
I pray

680
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,350
that he'll at least eat.

681
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Ta-da.

682
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,110
Here.

683
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,110
Just one bite.

684
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,370
They made pumpkin porridge for you.

685
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,290
Just one bite.

686
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,040
It's so tasty.

687
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,710
It's a fish.

688
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,640
Come on.

689
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,980
You need to eat this.

690
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,680
What is all this?

691
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,010
There's sesame oil,

692
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
rice cakes, red chili powder…

693
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,270
Where's the rice?

694
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,850
Hold this for me.

695
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,730
What is this?

696
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,070
It's dead.

697
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,410
Is it?

698
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,250
Goodness me.

699
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Damn it.

700
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,670
What kind of a lunatic
put an eel in a rice bowl

701
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,260
and put it out here?

702
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,220
It was me.

703
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,050
What?

704
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,050
Your wife caught it

705
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,720
by the stream while taking a walk.

706
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:32,100
She told me to bring it here
because it was a wild eel.

707
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,020
She scared me to death a few days ago
when she brought home

708
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,400
a wild rattlesnake.

709
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,780
Since we're here,

710
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,530
shouldn't we go inside and check on them?

711
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,620
Right, we should.

712
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,080
Gosh.

713
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,670
Young-soon.

714
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:54,830
Young-soon?

715
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,050
What are you doing there?

716
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,050
Goodness. There you were.

717
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,760
Come here.

718
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,390
We just came…

719
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,220
to give you this.

720
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,980
This tea is made with mulberry branches.
He should try it.

721
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,060
-Mulberry branches?
-Yes.

722
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,230
Apparently, this is helpful
for people who suffer from paralysis.

723
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,070
We all suffer from paralysis
at least once in our lifetime.

724
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,070
Don't you agree?

725
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,200
Right. I may not catch the flu,

726
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,740
but I get paralyzed every now and then.

727
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,000
What is that?

728
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,750
I was at a bookstore in town today.

729
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,250
This was recommended as a bestseller,

730
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,670
so I bought one.

731
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,510
You like to read.

732
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,140
I also got these.

733
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:53,020
You can watch them
when you're alone and lonely.

734
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,980
Make sure you watch them by yourself.

735
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,980
BAREFOOT KI-BONG

736
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,480
MARATHON

737
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,320
Don't do this.

738
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,160
If you keep doing this,

739
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,960
I'll become weak.

740
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,420
I'll want to rely on others.

741
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,630
But…

742
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
But I can't do that.

743
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,380
I need to stay strong.

744
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,430
So please…

745
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,280
There's a saying.

746
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,030
"A mother…

747
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,870
can replace anything in this world."

748
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,000
"But nothing…

749
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,790
can replace a mother."

750
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
We're not asking you to rely on us.

751
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,720
Yes, you should stay strong.

752
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,180
You're a mom, after all, right?

753
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,990
CHOI KANG-HO

754
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,760
YONG-YONG

755
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,010
"Mom"?

756
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,100
"Mom"?

757
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,560
Well done. "Mom."

758
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,740
Walk.

759
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,820
That's it.

760
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,490
Come here.

761
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,030
My Kang-ho. Good boy.

762
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,380
-Is this me?
-Yes.

763
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,720
Gosh, I look pretty. Thank you.

764
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,260
This is you.

765
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,720
And this is me.

766
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,520
KOREAN
MATHEMATICS

767
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,450
Well done.

768
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,880
This is a slingshot.

769
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,170
This is a ddakji.

770
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,840
This is a top.

771
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,640
Your dad bought this robot for you
before you were born.

772
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,520
You were always playing with it.

773
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,440
It was your favorite robot.

774
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,650
Do you remember?

775
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,190
Come on.

776
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,820
Are you sleeping again?

777
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,780
Kang-ho, you should eat something.

778
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,320
You haven't eaten anything for days.

779
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,290
Kang-ho.

780
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,830
Kang-ho?

781
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,040
What's wrong with you?

782
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,670
Kang-ho.

783
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,590
Kang-ho!

784
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,010
It's common for patients
who are paralyzed from the neck down.

785
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,970
They suddenly lost the ability to move.

786
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,390
They lose the will to live
because of the sense of loss.

787
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,850
Do your best to take care of him.

788
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,940
If he still doesn't improve,

789
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,530
you should consider
admitting him to a facility.

790
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,650
Can a seven-year-old

791
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,530
feel suicidal?

792
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,200
Sorry?

793
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,370
What do you mean?

794
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,450
Can a seven-year-old

795
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,370
lose the will to live
because of a sense of loss?

796
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,340
Eat.

797
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,170
Eat!

798
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:36,880
Eat.

799
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,640
Eat!

800
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,810
Eat! Why won't you eat?

801
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,730
Do you seriously want to die?

802
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,120
You get sleepy

803
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,240
when you're full.

804
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,120
And if you get sleepy,

805
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,000
you won't be able to study.

806
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,710
What?

807
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,130
You get sleepy

808
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,930
when you're full.

809
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,180
And if you get sleepy,
you won't be able to study.

810
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,980
You get sleepy

811
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,270
when you're full.

812
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,030
And if you get sleepy,
you won't be able to study.

813
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,680
Is that why…

814
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,270
Is that why you haven't been eating?

815
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,690
You get sleepy when you're full.

816
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,900
And if you get sleepy,

817
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,440
you won't be able to study.

818
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,620
No.

819
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,290
No, Kang-ho.

820
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,450
You can eat.

821
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,460
You can eat now.

822
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,790
Look.

823
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,340
Look.

824
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,840
I'm eating too, right?

825
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,130
So you can eat too.

826
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,970
You can sleep if you're sleepy.

827
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,220
You don't have to study.

828
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,030
So please eat.

829
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,280
I…

830
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,570
love you so much, Kang-ho.

831
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,660
I did that because I loved you so much.

832
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,540
I wanted you to be happy.

833
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,630
I didn't want you
to end up like me and Dad.

834
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,170
Please forgive me.

835
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,980
Thank you.

836
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,110
Thank you.

837
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,590
Look. I understand that Chairman Song
ordered you to do this.

838
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,340
But I'm on duty right now.

839
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,670
I'm also on duty.

840
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,430
Mr. Yang Gu-man.

841
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,680
Mr. Yang Gu-man.

842
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,930
Of course, he won't open it.

843
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,770
-Open it.
-Yes, sir.

844
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,520
You can't do that. That's breaking in.

845
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,650
Move.

846
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,330
Mr. Yang.

847
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,450
Mr. Yang.

848
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,830
Damn it. Open it.

849
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,170
Hurry. Damn it.

850
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,300
Mr. Yang!

851
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,920
Mr. Yang.

852
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:46,880
Damn it.

853
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,810
What? He committed suicide?

854
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,730
Yes, sir.

855
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,740
He crippled Kang-ho
who had his fate in his hands.

856
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,450
Then he killed the sole witness
and disguised it as suicide?

857
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,040
Jeez, Oh Tae-soo.

858
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,420
He must really despise joining
together as a family.

859
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,460
Oh Tae-soo?

860
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,010
DIAPER

861
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,980
The truck driver's family
lives in Yanbian, right?

862
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,180
Yes, sir.

863
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,270
Find out when and where
I should announce my presidential bid

864
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,570
to make it most effective.

865
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,980
Before you do that,

866
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,530
get rid of all businesses or people

867
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,910
who are related to Woobyeok Group.

868
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,990
Yes, sir.

869
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,290
Also, about Yang Gu-man…

870
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,250
"Yang Gu-man"?

871
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,330
Who's that?

872
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,540
The truck…

873
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,880
I'm sorry, sir.

874
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,810
What's the matter?

875
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,850
That…

876
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,310
Why is that here?

877
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:20,850
Why is that here?!

878
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,520
I found it in the trash can.

879
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,980
I washed it and put it here.

880
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:28,780
It's your favorite scarf.

881
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,740
Who? Who said it was my favorite?

882
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,200
Who said that?

883
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,210
Goodness, ma'am!

884
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,920
What's the matter with you?

885
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,250
Get rid of it this instant.

886
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,760
-Yes, ma'am.
-Ha-young!

887
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,430
Snap out of it!

888
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,010
Why aren't you taking proper care
of your traumatized daughter?

889
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,350
Throw away all her old belongings.

890
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,390
Replace everything single thing
with new ones.

891
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,560
Understand?

892
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,480
Okay.

893
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,440
Let's go out.

894
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,330
You're okay.

895
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,290
You're okay, my daughter.

896
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,290
Nothing will happen

897
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,670
to you

898
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,130
or me.

899
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,720
Kang-ho, look.

900
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,590
That man used to be paralyzed as well.

901
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,850
But he received rehabilitation
and exercised.

902
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,890
And now, he's healthy like that.
Isn't that incredible?

903
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,900
You can do it too.

904
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,610
Let's receive treatment and exercise

905
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,400
until you can move your fingers again.

906
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:53,320
Okay?

907
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,780
Jeez, your eyes are going to be sore.

908
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,000
Here.

909
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,930
Hello?

910
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,390
Yes.

911
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,190
Hello, this is
Hannuri Rehabilitation Center.

912
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,440
Did you submit an application
for Mr. Choi Kang-ho?

913
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,480
Yes, I did.

914
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,320
But we're completely full,

915
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,690
so I'm afraid
we can't admit him right now.

916
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,990
What would you like to do?
Would you like to wait?

917
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,990
How long will I have to wait?

918
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,910
I was told

919
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,920
that he should start rehab
before his bones become stiff.

920
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,420
I'm afraid I can't give you an exact date.

921
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,300
We need to wait until a spot opens up.

922
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:59,260
Then could you please give me a call
when there's an opening?

923
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,470
Please.

924
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,810
Thank you. Goodbye.

925
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,160
Kang-ho, your dinner is here.

926
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,680
I can't do it.

927
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,140
Why?

928
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,230
Why not?

929
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,480
Kang-ho, just once more.

930
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,650
Okay? Let's give it one last try.

931
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,790
-I can't do it.
-You can!

932
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,910
You did it earlier.

933
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,290
You did it.

934
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,210
All by yourself.

935
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,750
You can do it.

936
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,670
Okay. Here's the robot.

937
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,720
Push it over again.

938
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,090
-I can do it.
-That's right.

939
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,890
See? You're doing it!

940
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,850
Flex!

941
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,060
Flex!

942
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,480
Feed me!

943
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,110
Your call will be charged after the beep.

944
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,360
Why aren't you picking up?

945
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,410
Are you still unwell?

946
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,120
I made abalone porridge for you.

947
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,370
Anyway, give me a call.

948
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,410
SUN-YOUNG

949
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,300
BAR EXAM MEAL

950
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,440
-I see some light.
-Really?

951
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,770
-Where?
-There.

952
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:57,520
-Is no one here?
-What's going on?

953
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,070
Those brats must have run away.

954
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,860
They took our membership money.

955
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,650
I heard the owner changed.

956
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,610
-What do we do?
-Me?

957
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,910
There you are!

958
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,200
Yes. It's you.

959
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,290
You should pay us back
before selling the shop.

960
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,200
This is so ridiculous!

961
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,670
This isn't right. Give us our money back!

962
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,080
Give me back my money.

963
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,000
-Give it back!
-Please explain.

964
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,380
I have no idea what you're talking about.

965
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,760
I heard you sold your nail salon.

966
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,630
-That woman says she's the new owner.
-What?

967
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,140
I see. Did you run this place with her?

968
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,100
You were supposed to clean out
the shop yesterday.

969
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,480
The interior contractors
will be here soon. Open the door now.

970
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,520
Hurry up.

971
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,110
-Please wait a minute.
-Wait for what?

972
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,650
This can't be. No.

973
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,110
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

974
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,320
-I need to make a call.
-Don't go far.

975
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,860
-Okay.
-We're watching you.

976
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,030
The number you have called does not exist.

977
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,080
Please check and call…

978
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:53,910
No way.

979
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,370
TOTAL EARNINGS: 2,370,000 WON

980
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,500
Sun-young, I think we'll become rich.

981
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,540
Should we have some soju
to celebrate this?

982
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,220
You drink when it's raining.

983
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,510
You drink when you feel lonely.

984
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:11,970
You'll soon become an alcoholic
and get the shakes.

985
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,810
Then you won't be able to work.

986
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,140
-Come on. Don't be like that.
-But…

987
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:18,940
Fine.

988
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,150
I'll let you go today.

989
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,480
-Really?
-Really.

990
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,200
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

991
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,570
Then can I go home first?

992
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,950
You better go straight home.

993
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,040
All right.

994
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:37,410
I'll wire you this money later.

995
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,460
Bye.

996
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,260
Hey, little one.

997
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,300
Goodness.

998
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,510
Goodness.

999
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,520
What was the incident that just occurred?

1000
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,690
It must've been very hungry

1001
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:03,270
to jump over that.

1002
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,440
This is what I think.

1003
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:10,400
The piglet was extremely famished.

1004
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,200
You're right.

1005
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,950
It must've been very hungry. Goodness.

1006
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:22,710
All right.

1007
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,340
Here you go.

1008
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,090
-Kang-ho, aren't you hungry?
-Yes.

1009
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,300
Let's eat.

1010
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:39,980
Mom?

1011
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:43,770
-This is good.
-Mom.

1012
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,230
Mom, I…

1013
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:48,860
Mom.

1014
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,740
Mom.

1015
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,750
Why didn't you eat?

1016
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,670
You must not be hungry.

1017
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,010
No, Mom.

1018
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,010
Mom, I'm hungry.

1019
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,720
I'm hungry!

1020
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,840
Mom, I'm hungry!

1021
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:15,720
Mom!

1022
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,010
Goodness.

1023
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,390
Mom, I want to eat!

1024
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,310
Mom!

1025
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,400
Mom!

1026
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,980
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

1027
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,240
Just once more.

1028
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,910
Let me become a bad mom just once more.

1029
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,920
No.

1030
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,250
Mom, I can do it.

1031
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,050
-What a shame.
-Mom, I moved my hand.

1032
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,550
Mom, my hand… Mom.

1033
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:06,730
I moved it.

1034
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,770
Mom, I moved it.

1035
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,400
I almost did it.

1036
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,360
Mom…

1037
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,000
Sesame seeds…

1038
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,960
7 BEST MEDICINES FOR PARALYSIS

1039
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,890
Mom.

1040
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,680
Let me do it once more. I almost did it.

1041
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,060
Mom!

1042
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,650
Like this.

1043
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,740
-Like this.
-Like--

1044
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,530
Mom!

1045
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,660
-Again.
-Again.

1046
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:05,660
One…

1047
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,590
I'm a genius.

1048
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,590
Come here.

1049
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,890
Mom, wait.

1050
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:28,980
Mom!

1051
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:32,980
You're so mean!

1052
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,740
You're eating so well.

1053
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:39,200
Your mom must be so happy
to see you eating so well.

1054
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:48,620
Yes?

1055
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,170
This is Hannuri Rehabilitation Center.

1056
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,000
A spot has opened up so your son
can be admitted next week.

1057
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:54,960
Really?

1058
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,260
Does that mean he can receive
rehabilitation starting next week?

1059
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,430
Thank you.

1060
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,970
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

1061
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,680
Kang-ho.

1062
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,360
Kang-ho, you can finally…

1063
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,670
You did it.

1064
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,600
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1065
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,410
I'm not an idiot.

1066
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:09,080
-Butterfly.
-Wrong.

1067
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,080
I just returned to my childhood.

1068
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,040
This is a chance given from above.

1069
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,000
She didn't say I couldn't go out.

1070
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:16,920
Right?

1071
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,340
Kang-ho!

1072
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,300
Choi Kang-ho!

1073
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,840
What did my son do so wrong
for you to do this here?

1074
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,430
Because his hands are now also dirty.

1075
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,350
I can't believe you've never called.

1076
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,310
Where have you been, you jerk?

1077
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,900
I'll earn a lot of money
and pay off all of your debt.

1078
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,690
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!
