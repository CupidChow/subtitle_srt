1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,560
WOOBYEOK'S LEAP FORWARD
BEASTS' VICTORY

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,440
Look who it is.

4
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,360
EPISODE 12

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,410
Did you watch the news?

6
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,410
The news?

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,870
Hang on a second.

8
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,630
Are you here

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,420
to talk about Hwang Soo-hyun?

10
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,130
So that's why you're here.

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,970
I thought you
never wanted to see me again.

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,140
This is no time to be so casual.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,140
Even her bereaved family member
is so nonchalant.

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,310
-So why shouldn't I be?
-"Bereaved family"?

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,600
She was your son's mother.
That makes you her family.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,150
Are you serious right now?

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,400
You're the one who started it!

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,610
If the police
start investigating this case,

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,410
both you and I will be done for.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,450
Let's end this

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,870
by making Kang-ho the baby's father.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,620
But of course,

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,460
we'll have to take care of him
before that.

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,170
That's right.

25
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,550
This is how a president
should manage his affairs.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,550
Right.

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,520
Sometimes, you have to appease the masses

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,520
and sometimes, you have to
sacrifice some for the greater good.

29
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,730
A man like you should be the president.

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,480
But then,

31
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,320
Hwang Soo-hyun appears out of nowhere.

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,740
What a shame.

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
Right?

34
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,820
Mr. Song!

35
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,330
Did you have that much fun with her?

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,040
You son of a bitch!

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,630
Do I look like a pushover
because I worked with you?

38
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,210
Did I have fun with her?

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,840
Do you have proof?

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,130
Because I do!

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,010
I have proof that you killed Choi Hae-sik!

42
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,890
I have proof of all the dirty deeds
you committed

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,430
to turn Yongra Construction
into Woobyeok Group!

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,230
I also have proof that
you ordered Choi Kang-ho

45
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,650
to kill Hwang Soo-hyun
just to have something on me!

46
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,360
Do you get it?

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,090
As of today,

48
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm cutting ties with Dosang Group.

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,090
This country will protect

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,430
Woobyeok Group from now on.

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
There are so many boats.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,110
Wouldn't it be so beautiful
to see all of them floating out there?

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,820
They'd look like Christmas lights.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,530
Come on.

55
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,330
You've been checking your phone
all day today.

56
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,830
Are you expecting a call?

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,830
No.

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,830
You must be cold. Come here.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,170
It's okay.

60
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,880
You need it. Put it back on.

61
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,840
Listen to your guardian.

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,220
Gosh, you're scary.

63
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,350
Okay, Mr. Guardian.

64
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,060
All right.

65
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,100
Here you go.

66
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,310
-Kang-ho.
-Yes?

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,560
Look at the name of that boat.

68
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,530
It's my name.

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,570
-It's my name, Mom.
-No way.

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,820
It's "Choikangho."

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,870
Stand next to it. I'll take a photo.

72
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,030
A photo?

73
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,960
Say "piggy" on the count of three.

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,960
Piggy.

75
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,170
One, two, three.

76
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,670
Piggy.

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,010
That looks great.

78
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,130
-Take one of me too.
-Okay.

79
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,800
Unbelievable.

80
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,010
All right.

81
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,940
Hwang Soo-hyun.

82
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
What did you say?

83
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,980
What?

84
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,320
It's nothing.

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,820
I'll take it now.

86
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,030
One, two, three.

87
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,700
Piggy.

88
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,540
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

89
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,380
Hello?

90
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,090
What?

91
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,100
There's smoke coming from the farm?

92
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,430
Yes, okay.

93
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,730
Yes, I'll check now.

94
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,770
Kang-ho.

95
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,070
Kang-ho, wake up.

96
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,780
There's smoke coming from the farm.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,210
Kang-ho…

98
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,830
Shouldn't we call 911

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
if the farm is on fire?

100
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,460
It could be a prank call,
so let's check first.

101
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,550
Can you open the gate?

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Kang-ho!

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,970
Kang-ho!

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,770
Kang-ho!

105
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Kang-ho.

106
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,610
A fire?

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,830
Their farm is on fire?

108
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,120
Wait. Kang-ho.

109
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,080
-Kang-ho!
-No, Sam-sik!

110
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,000
What is it?

111
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
What's the matter?

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,380
Is Sam-sik home?

113
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,090
I don't think so.

114
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,800
I had a nightmare.

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,010
Goodness. What did he do this time?

116
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,220
-Goodness.
-What's wrong?

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,970
Did you dream that
he stole something again?

118
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,350
Where are you going?

119
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,980
You don't think he reported it, right?

120
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,560
Of course not. He lost the evidence.

121
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,610
If anything, he'd be accused
of threatening Oh Ha-young.

122
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,450
Do you think he's onto us?

123
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,030
That's why he ran away.

124
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,700
We must get him
before things get out of hand.

125
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,740
Yes, sir.

126
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,580
Kang-ho!

127
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,290
Kang-ho!

128
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,670
Wait. Isn't that Bang Sam-sik?

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,210
Get him!

130
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,300
SAM-SIK'S MILL

131
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,430
What did they just say?

132
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,050
"Threatened"? "Ran away"?

133
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,510
They couldn't have been talking
about our son, right?

134
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,310
What did that damn punk do this time?

135
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,430
Goodness.

136
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,350
That damn punk!

137
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,940
Wait for me!

138
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,570
What's going on?

139
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,240
Fire!

140
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,400
What do I do?

141
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,700
Fire!

142
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,490
Who the hell are you?

143
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,870
Did you do this?

144
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,120
Who are you?

145
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,170
-Who the hell are you?
-What's going on?

146
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,050
Damn it.

147
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,590
Hey, get them!

148
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,050
-We need to catch them!
-Help…

149
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,380
Help me…

150
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,890
-Who is that?
-What's going on?

151
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,180
-Is that a fire?
-A fire?

152
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,100
-Fire!
-Fire!

153
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,100
What?

154
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,310
Isn't that Sam-sik?

155
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,350
-Sam-sik! Goodness!
-Sam-sik!

156
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,690
Goodness, Sam-sik!

157
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,110
What do we do? There's a fire!

158
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,780
Call 911!

159
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,400
-Right, 911!
-Goodness, Sam-sik.

160
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,650
-Call 911.
-Goodness, Sam-sik.

161
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,200
What's going on? Sam-sik!

162
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,240
-Get up!
-Fire!

163
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,950
There's a fire!

164
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,120
You guys are such a loving couple.

165
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,040
Were you guys having a late-night date?

166
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,250
How romantic.

167
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,420
Romantic, my foot.

168
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,510
We were tossing and turning in bed,
so we decided to get some fresh air.

169
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,220
In this cold weather?

170
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,060
It's -10°C tonight.

171
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,810
It's already past
the season to make kimchi.

172
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,810
Why do you have all this garlic?

173
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,940
I heard black garlic is good
for your stomach,

174
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,230
so I'm going to make some.

175
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,820
For whom? Does someone have a bad stomach?

176
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,530
Look, Mr. Son.

177
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,080
Actually…

178
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,250
She just wants to
take good care of her health.

179
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,330
Black garlic is good for you.

180
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,670
Could you give us some too?

181
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,170
Sure.

182
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,680
But why? Do you guys
have a bad stomach too?

183
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,850
Our stomachs are fine,
but his area down there…

184
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,100
What?

185
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,270
It says that black garlic is good for men.

186
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,310
He may look fine, but he's very weak.

187
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,650
You darn woman.

188
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,070
Enough with that nonsense of yours.

189
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,320
-Fire!
-Fire!

190
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,360
-Fire!
-What?

191
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,990
-Fire!
-Fire?

192
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,870
What are you talking about? A fire?

193
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,450
Here you were.

194
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,830
What were you doing?

195
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,290
It's a disaster! There's a fire!

196
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,130
Where's the fire? I don't see it.

197
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,670
I was praying in the mountains

198
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,050
when I saw a fire blazing
from Kang-ho's farm.

199
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,010
What?

200
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,300
Oh, dear!

201
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,760
Goodness!

202
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,760
Goodness, Mr. Son!

203
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,890
Mr. Son! This is bad!

204
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,480
Goodness, what's going on?

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,770
-Oh, dear!
-Call 911!

206
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,690
-Okay!
-Isn't this Sam-sik?

207
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
What's wrong with him?

208
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,530
Did he set this fire?

209
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,280
Shut your mouth!

210
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,410
Where are Kang-ho and his mom?

211
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,910
Her truck is here,

212
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,370
-but she won't pick up.
-Oh, no!

213
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,700
We don't have time!

214
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,120
Let's put out the fire!

215
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,080
-Okay!
-Over there!

216
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,710
Hurry!

217
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,420
-Goodness.
-Why are you lying here?

218
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,920
-Goodness!
-Stay with him!

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,010
What about our Sam-sik?

220
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,630
Go on. Pull it out.

221
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,550
Who's that?

222
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,390
Isn't that Young-soon?

223
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,510
-Ms. Jin!
-Goodness!

224
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,810
-Goodness!
-Young-soon!

225
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,060
What's going on?

226
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,560
Goodness!

227
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,190
-Oh, dear!
-Be careful!

228
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,690
Be careful!

229
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,230
-You're okay now.
-Kang-ho.

230
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
-Where's the water?
-Kang-ho.

231
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,730
-Kang-ho?
-Kang-ho?

232
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,450
-Where is he right now?
-Kang-ho…

233
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,950
He's in there.

234
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,950
-What?
-What?

235
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,450
Are you saying he's in there?

236
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,120
-Kang-ho!
-Oh, no.

237
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,370
-No!
-Kang-ho!

238
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,750
-No!
-No!

239
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,210
-Kang-ho!
-No!

240
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,460
-Oh, dear!
-Kang-ho…

241
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,460
-Mi-joo!
-Mi-joo!

242
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,130
Stay here.

243
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,140
Sam-sik, are you okay?

244
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,600
-What?
-Mr. Yang.

245
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,770
Turn on the water.

246
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,930
-Right.
-Turn it on!

247
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,100
-Turn it on!
-Turn it on!

248
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,390
Stick it in there!

249
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,020
-Goodness!
-Hey!

250
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,810
What are you doing?

251
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,690
Goodness me!

252
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,780
Goodness!

253
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,950
You lunatic! What are you doing?

254
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,250
Spray it in my direction.

255
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,330
What?

256
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Okay.

257
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,460
-No!
-Sam-sik!

258
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,000
-Sam-sik!
-Sam-sik!

259
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,340
Sam-sik!

260
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,960
Don't go in there!

261
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,470
-Don't do it!
-Don't go in!

262
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,340
No, Sam-sik!

263
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,810
Kang-ho!

264
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,970
Sam-sik!

265
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,480
-What do we do?
-Sam-sik!

266
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,100
-Goodness!
-Sam-sik!

267
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,270
Sam-sik!

268
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,480
There they come!

269
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,820
They're here!

270
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,820
-Goodness!
-Over here!

271
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,110
Hurry up!

272
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,450
Wait!

273
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,870
Look! Someone's coming out!

274
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,870
Goodness! Sam-sik is carrying
Kang-ho on his back!

275
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,460
-Well done, Sam-sik!
-Well done!

276
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,710
-I'm so proud of--
-Sam-sik!

277
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,130
Hold on!

278
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,380
Isn't that Kang-ho?

279
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,800
-What?
-What?

280
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Kang-ho is carrying Sam-sik!

281
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,310
Kang-ho!

282
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,270
-Kang-ho!
-Sam-sik!

283
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,190
Sam-sik!

284
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,900
They're okay.

285
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,610
It's Kang-ho.

286
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,780
Sam-sik.

287
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,110
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,700
Kang-ho. Oh, dear.

289
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,540
-Oh, dear.
-My Sam-sik.

290
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,910
Wake up, Kang-ho.

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,210
Call the ambulance!

292
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,170
Are you okay?

293
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,040
Goodness, my Sam-sik.

294
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,090
Sam-sik!

295
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,070
You should be lying down. You're unwell.

296
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,200
They said his oxygen therapy went well

297
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,580
and he'll wake up soon, so don't worry.

298
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,410
You've been so busy today because of us.

299
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm sorry, Mi-joo.

300
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,460
Don't worry about that.

301
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,260
Ms. Jin, you should lie down.

302
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,130
-Sam-sik.
-Sam-sik.

303
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,760
Where am I?

304
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,930
You darn punk. Where do you think you are?

305
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,600
It's the hospital.

306
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,310
The hospital?

307
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,980
Why would you jump into the fire?

308
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,860
Are you a moth
drawn to a flame or something?

309
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,150
Why would you do such a thing?

310
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,980
You lunatic.

311
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,280
That's enough. He's still recovering.

312
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,700
Why would you call me a moth?

313
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,910
-Hey.
-Yes?

314
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,620
Is this funny to you?

315
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,950
Come on. Don't be so serious.

316
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
You almost died back there.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,040
What?

318
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,710
What if something happened to you?

319
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,760
What if we lost our precious only son?

320
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,840
I got mad at you first

321
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,680
so others wouldn't.

322
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,310
She beat you first

323
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:02,350
because she couldn't stand the thought
of you getting beaten up by others.

324
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,270
Do you even know
how it feels to be so harsh

325
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,520
to your own child?

326
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,740
It's okay to cause trouble.

327
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,200
You can even become a jobless thug.

328
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,330
Just stay alive, will you?

329
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,450
Is that so hard?

330
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,750
It's not, right?

331
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,630
Goodness me.

332
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,710
You son of a gun.

333
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,220
How dare you make my man cry?

334
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,470
It's not hard, is it?

335
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,390
Don't cry now.

336
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,640
You're awake. What a relief.

337
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,810
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

338
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,860
Yes, I'm fine.

339
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Right.

340
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,110
How's Kang-ho?

341
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,150
They need to run a few more tests,

342
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,740
so they're transferring him
to a general ward.

343
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,410
You're awake.

344
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,870
We're looking into the cause of the fire.

345
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,090
We found traces of gasoline

346
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,010
near the farm's entrance
where the fire started.

347
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,920
We suspect that
there were explosives around the area.

348
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,430
I can explain.

349
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,970
You see,

350
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,600
I went to the farm to look for Kang-ho.

351
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,560
And some suspicious-looking guy
was coming out of the farm.

352
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,480
I did it.

353
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,440
-It was me.
-What?

354
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,860
It was a mistake.

355
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,980
What was?

356
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,570
So…

357
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,280
It was my fault that the fire broke out.

358
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,950
I shouldn't have put the gasoline
near the fire.

359
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,120
I was in a hurry.

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,490
Ms. Jin, what are you talking about?

361
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,330
I saw him.

362
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,790
This guy…

363
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,710
No. It wasn't just one guy.

364
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,540
Do you see this on the back of my neck?

365
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,920
-They hit me really hard.
-I see.

366
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,340
That's not the only place you're injured.

367
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,380
-Sorry?
-Goodness, you're a mess.

368
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,260
What happened to your lip?

369
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,220
-Goodness.
-Well, this…

370
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,310
There's no need to
further investigate this.

371
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,020
I'm the victim, so why would I lie?

372
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,610
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

373
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,360
-I'm so sorry.
-What…

374
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,490
But…

375
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,400
What are you doing?

376
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,160
Who's the suspicious guy you saw?

377
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,660
Did you eavesdrop?

378
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,040
Answer me.

379
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,370
He isn't a villager, right?

380
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,040
No one in our neighborhood would do that.

381
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,290
Let me go.

382
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,000
He was really tall and burly.

383
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,920
He was as big as Don Lee.

384
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,170
When I got there,

385
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,340
I saw him running out of the farm.

386
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,050
You saw it too.

387
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,510
The gate to the farm was latched.

388
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
It couldn't have been done
from the inside.

389
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,560
Then why did Ms. Jin lie?

390
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,730
Beats me. I'm baffled too.

391
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,860
Maybe she caught on to it.

392
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,400
Caught on to what?

393
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,240
What?

394
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,120
Goodness.

395
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,410
That came out wrong.

396
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,160
Sam-sik, you know something, don't you?

397
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,330
I've never known anything in life.

398
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,370
Is that so?

399
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,670
Then why were you there so late?

400
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,710
That was because…

401
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,510
I went there to see Kang-ho.

402
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,220
Are you serious? At that hour?

403
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,510
Looking like this?

404
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,720
What happened to your face?

405
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,140
Who beat you up?

406
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,890
I wasn't beaten up.

407
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,060
I fell down the stairs earlier.

408
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,520
Do you really want to
fall down the stairs?

409
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,150
-Do you?
-What are you doing?

410
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,610
Tell me the truth,

411
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,360
or I can't help but think that
you set the fire.

412
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,780
What? Darn it.

413
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,780
That makes no sense!

414
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,030
Why not?

415
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,540
You've been jealous of Kang-ho
because I like him.

416
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,580
You like him?

417
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,170
I… No, I don't.

418
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,250
Anyway, so why did you set the fire?

419
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,380
Why?

420
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,210
It wasn't me! It was Oh Tae-soo's guys!

421
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,550
Oh Tae-soo?

422
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
-The Oh Tae-soo we all know?
-Yes.

423
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,060
Mi-joo.

424
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,980
I'll be honest.

425
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,520
Kang-ho is in danger.

426
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,570
Mi-joo.

427
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,450
What's going on?

428
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,070
I thought you had left with Sam-sik.

429
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,490
Report them to the police.

430
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,620
What? Report whom to the police?

431
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,960
Those people who want Kang-ho dead.

432
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,380
Ms. Jin.

433
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,090
What did you hear?

434
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,930
Sam-sik told me everything.

435
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,430
He said Kang-ho knew about
Assemblyman Oh's secret.

436
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,600
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's secret?

437
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,230
His illegitimate son.

438
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,610
Apparently, Kang-ho had
the original copy of the DNA test.

439
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,940
He did?

440
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,320
You didn't know?

441
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,950
They went after Sam-sik because of it too.

442
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,820
Why him?

443
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,870
The test result was in the bag

444
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,870
that you had given to Ms. Park.

445
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,870
What?

446
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,590
So tell me. Where is it now?

447
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,670
Sam-sik had it,

448
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,970
but Oh Tae-soo's men took it from him.

449
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,130
Then it's over now.
They have the evidence.

450
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,010
So why are they doing this to Kang-ho?

451
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,970
He must feel uneasy about
Kang-ho knowing the truth.

452
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,980
But why? Kang-ho has lost his memories.

453
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,560
Because if Kang-ho
ever regained his memories,

454
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,690
he'd find the evidence again.

455
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,020
That's why he's doing this.

456
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,070
So we must report this now.

457
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,860
No, don't.

458
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,820
Ms. Jin.

459
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,860
We don't have any evidence of this.

460
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,120
Provoking them could put Kang-ho
in further danger.

461
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,370
Don't you still get it?

462
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,960
Kang-ho is already in danger.

463
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,370
I know.

464
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,420
That's why…

465
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
That's why…

466
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,970
we're going to leave.

467
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,970
What?

468
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,690
I don't have much time anyway.

469
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,020
Once he wakes up,

470
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,650
we're going to move and go into hiding

471
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,940
and prepare for immigration.

472
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,780
So Mi-joo, you don't need to
worry about him anymore.

473
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,660
This is ridiculous.

474
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,870
Why must you guys run away

475
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,620
when Oh Tae-soo is the guilty one?

476
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,960
Let's just report him.

477
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,960
Then the police will reveal the truth

478
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,670
and protect Kang-ho.

479
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,050
That's how his dad died.

480
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,550
What?

481
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,840
A fire broke out at our farm in the past.

482
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,680
He lost his life

483
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,010
while trying to expose the truth.

484
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,770
No one protected him.

485
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,900
Neither the court nor our neighbors.

486
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,190
Even I, his wife,

487
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,900
was powerless.

488
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,570
That's why

489
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,820
I was so strict with Kang-ho.

490
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,240
I wanted him to become a powerful person.

491
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,120
He must've resented me so much

492
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,670
throughout those lonely and painful years.

493
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,720
I'm going to protect Kang-ho from now on.

494
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,010
I won't let him
meet the same fate as his dad.

495
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,020
Kang-ho was only able to endure
those lonely and painful years

496
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,940
because of you.

497
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,240
During those long years
he was preparing for the bar exam,

498
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,070
he always sang "I am Happy."

499
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,120
That's your favorite song.

500
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,000
I am happy

501
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,170
I am happy

502
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,380
I am…

503
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,140
-I am happy
-I am happy

504
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,220
-I am happy
-Keep it down. You're being too loud.

505
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,650
There are so many places
that make pancakes in Seoul.

506
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,730
We visited most of them.

507
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,900
You see,

508
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,320
he was craving mung bean pancakes.

509
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,320
But he wasn't happy with any of them.

510
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
How is it? Is it good?

511
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,210
How…

512
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,390
-Looking back,
-Sorry.

513
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,430
It's okay.

514
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,560
he was looking for the taste
of your mung bean pancakes.

515
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,440
Kang-ho

516
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,610
didn't resent you.

517
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,940
He was worried about you

518
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,190
and missed you a lot.

519
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Was it you?

520
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,710
Sorry?

521
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,960
Were you the girl

522
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,590
he wrote about in his journal?

523
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,130
You were the girl he loved to death.

524
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,760
It was you.

525
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,510
That's why

526
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,810
despite losing his memories,

527
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,390
he still searched for you
and had those feelings.

528
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,270
Mi-joo.

529
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,820
It must've been
so hard and painful for you.

530
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,820
Why didn't you tell me?

531
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm sorry.

532
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,370
I know it's late,

533
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,880
but let me apologize on his behalf.

534
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,210
-I'm truly sorry.
-I'm sorry as well.

535
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,720
I should've told you sooner.

536
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,050
It's taken me too long.

537
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,100
That's okay.
What could you possibly be sorry about?

538
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,890
It's all our fault.

539
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,360
-You had no choice--
-I'm…

540
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,570
not married.

541
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,900
Ye-jin and Seo-jin…

542
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,450
are Kang-ho's kids.

543
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,700
But they're my kids now.

544
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,870
I only found out about the pregnancy
after we broke up.

545
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,380
And I decided to have them without him.

546
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,340
I never planned to use them as an excuse
to hold onto Kang-ho.

547
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,380
And I don't intend to get back with him
by using them either.

548
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,510
He may not remember right now.

549
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,140
But he abandoned me in the past.

550
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,270
He didn't.

551
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,650
Kang-ho…

552
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,280
wanted to avenge his dad.

553
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,360
So he was going to become
the son of his dad's murderer

554
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,030
and marry the accomplice's daughter.

555
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,700
What do you mean?

556
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,540
Are you saying his dad was murdered by--

557
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,620
Song Woo-byeok

558
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,830
and Oh Tae-soo.

559
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,960
Kang-ho never abandoned us.

560
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,090
If things went haywire,

561
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,350
he knew we'd be in danger

562
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,930
for being his loved ones.

563
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,810
That's why he chose to leave us.

564
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,060
The only person

565
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,190
he ever abandoned

566
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,690
was himself.

567
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,950
Kang-ho.

568
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,320
Kang-ho.

569
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,660
Kang-ho, are you awake?

570
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,330
Mom.

571
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,090
Mi-joo.

572
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,880
Are you Mr. Choi Kang-ho?

573
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,510
Who are you?

574
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,640
Police.

575
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,930
We already explained everything
to the other officers.

576
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,520
What are you referring to?

577
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,770
Aren't you here because of the fire?

578
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,570
Or did you…

579
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,280
Mr. Choi.

580
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,820
You're under arrest on suspicion
of murdering Mr. Hwang Soo-hyun.

581
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,250
An anonymous source
sent these photos to us.

582
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,960
Then four hours later,

583
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,460
these photos were taken
on the coast of Taebu Island.

584
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,470
As for Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun,

585
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,010
her body was found near Jemyeon Island,

586
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,430
which is about 5km away from Taebu Island.

587
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,140
She was wearing
the same clothes and bag from that day.

588
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,350
So?

589
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,940
Are you insinuating that
my son murdered her?

590
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,110
Mr. Choi.

591
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,530
You know her, right?

592
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,950
No.

593
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,870
What about this baby?

594
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,210
You often visited her
at the postpartum care center!

595
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,710
Everyone there thinks you're the dad!

596
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,130
What are you talking about?

597
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,300
He had a fiancée back then.

598
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,430
And we suspect that's the reason
why he committed this crime.

599
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,760
He must've had to get rid
of Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun and the baby

600
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,850
to become the son-in-law
of such a powerful family.

601
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,850
Unbelievable.

602
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,360
I'll be honest.

603
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,490
The woman and her baby…

604
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,160
aren't related to him. They're…

605
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,200
Mom, I'm hungry!

606
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,450
What?

607
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

608
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,160
-Kang-ho.
-What?

609
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,790
-Food.
-Kang-ho!

610
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,080
What are you doing?

611
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,630
No, don't do this!

612
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,040
Don't do this!

613
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,260
What the…

614
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,840
-That's not a rag.
-Kang-ho.

615
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,550
Are you not hurt?

616
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,010
Mom, I'm hungry. I want to go home.

617
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,180
I'll bring you some food.

618
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,600
No, I want to go home.

619
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,140
Those men keep yelling at me.
I'm so scared. I want to go home.

620
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,360
-Kang-ho!
-Get him.

621
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,770
Don't do that!

622
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,400
-Get him!
-Mom!

623
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,320
Kang-ho!

624
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,900
Come here!

625
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,280
-Stay still.
-Stay still.

626
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,830
What are you doing?

627
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,030
That hurts!

628
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,450
Let him go!

629
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,410
It's okay. It's Mom.

630
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,120
You're all right.

631
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,960
Let's go home.

632
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,040
Let's go home.

633
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,710
Tell me.

634
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,550
Does being in the same car
make him the murderer?

635
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,090
Do you have proof that he killed her?

636
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,270
How could you use force on my son
who isn't mentally stable?

637
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,640
I want to see your chief.

638
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,610
I'm going to sue you all for violating
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities!

639
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,780
It's okay.

640
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,710
Thank you for lending us your tracksuit.

641
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,580
Should I send it back by courier?

642
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,460
I'm going to gather evidence
and come back.

643
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,710
So keep it with you.

644
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,590
Don't even think about running away.

645
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,340
That'll only aggravate his penalty.

646
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,400
Kang-ho.

647
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,750
Jeez, I stink.

648
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,050
I'm going to take a shower.

649
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,010
I've been waiting for a very long time.

650
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,890
Aren't you going to greet me?

651
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,330
You're back.

652
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,870
Welcome back.

653
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,630
It's been a while.

654
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,300
I was so afraid

655
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,970
that I might never see you again.

656
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,270
I knew

657
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,810
I had to

658
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,600
ask for your forgiveness
for everything I had done.

659
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,070
I was afraid
I might never be able to do that.

660
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,200
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

661
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,580
It was wrong of me.

662
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,380
I'm back,

663
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,260
Mother.

664
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,990
Mom, I think you should stay
at the hospital.

665
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,200
Kang-ho.

666
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,860
I'm okay.

667
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,330
By the way, how did you know?

668
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,540
How could I not? I'm your mom.

669
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,330
You could be an actor.

670
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,920
That was some incredible acting.

671
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,800
I had to get out of there at all costs

672
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,760
to do what I needed to do.

673
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,930
What do you…

674
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,350
Don't tell me…

675
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,480
No, Kang-ho.

676
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,270
It's too dangerous. I won't allow it.

677
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,190
Father,

678
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,650
Hwang Soo-hyun, and the fire at our farm.

679
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,700
Do you still not get it?

680
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,870
They'll keep coming after us.

681
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,370
All the evidence is gone.

682
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,870
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,500
I didn't know
things would pan out this way.

684
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,760
Kang-ho.

685
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,090
Let's just leave.

686
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,260
Why don't we go somewhere far away?

687
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,970
That's what Ms. Hwang tried to do,

688
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,350
and look

689
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,850
what happened to her.

690
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,730
They'll find us

691
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,060
one way or another.

692
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,940
So we must find evidence against them
before they do anything to us.

693
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,620
But how will you possibly do that?

694
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,040
You need seven different lies

695
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,750
to conceal one.

696
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,330
It's the same with crimes.

697
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,670
To conceal one,

698
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,670
you need to commit multiple crimes.

699
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,220
And there's always evidence left behind.

700
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,850
I'll find it at all costs.

701
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,980
However, no one can find out
that I've regained my memories

702
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,360
until everything is over.

703
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,690
And you should never be alone.

704
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,490
Do you understand?

705
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,820
I got you.

706
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,580
Wait for me.

707
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,970
That's impressive.

708
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,730
Pasta or pizza?

709
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,920
Babe, how are you guys here together?

710
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,630
We ran into each other.

711
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,880
Let me pack up. One minute.

712
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,670
-Sure.
-Jeez.

713
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,930
Gosh, my babies. Aren't you cold?

714
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,880
It's okay.

715
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,370
Hi, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

716
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,200
It's Kang-ho oppa.

717
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm sorry that I didn't recognize you.

718
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,500
To be honest,
I didn't recognize you either.

719
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,050
Did you get a new hat?

720
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,170
You're wrong!

721
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,430
He's worn this hat more than ten times!

722
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,260
It's okay if you don't recognize me.

723
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,180
I'd know you from a mile away.

724
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,560
Come here.

725
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,830
Ye-jin and Seo-jin…

726
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,000
are Kang-ho's kids.

727
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,380
Isn't he the prosecutor from last time?

728
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,430
WHEN NAILS COME

729
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,930
What…

730
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,730
did you just say?

731
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,440
Petit Nail.

732
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,770
Bar Exam Meal.

733
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,900
Fried tofu rice balls.
Ten square root of two.

734
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,900
I remember everything now.

735
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,620
Does this mean you're all better now?

736
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,530
Yes.

737
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,830
I see.

738
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,870
I'm so relieved.

739
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,170
You're better now?

740
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,460
Then I can give you a beating now,
you asshole.

741
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,380
Hey!

742
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,800
Why didn't you tell me?

743
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,180
I wanted to die multiple times a day.

744
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,600
I cried, cursed,

745
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,940
and resented you every single day.

746
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,530
How could you put a pregnant woman
through such a difficult time?

747
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
You know why Ye-jin and Seo-jin
are bad-tempered?

748
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,820
It's all because of you, you asshole!

749
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,000
If I ever saw you again,

750
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,210
I was going to kill you.

751
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,380
But you were unwell.

752
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,630
So I just waited until you got better.

753
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,720
Then I found out that

754
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,550
you were in more pain than I was.

755
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm the one who was abandoned and hurt.

756
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,650
So why can't I resent you
for what you did?

757
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,400
Why did you have to suffer more than me?

758
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,610
I'm sorry.

759
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,370
I'm sorry, Mi-joo.

760
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,040
But Mi-joo,

761
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,290
don't forgive me just yet.

762
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,830
What?

763
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,210
The thing I have to do without you
hasn't ended yet.

764
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,920
So don't

765
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,180
forgive me just yet.

766
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,850
Keep cursing and resenting me

767
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,390
for now.

768
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,390
Once I come back safe and sound,

769
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,270
I'll beg and ask for your forgiveness.

770
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,150
And I'll be the one waiting

771
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,650
for your forgiveness.

772
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Hi, Sung-ae.

773
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,710
It's me.

774
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,630
Please come to the village hall
with Mr. Bang by 6 p.m.

775
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,670
And don't eat beforehand.

776
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,260
Okay, see you then.

777
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,520
Who is it?

778
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,940
What brings you here?

779
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,320
I heard there was a fire at your farm.

780
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,610
Is that farm cursed or something?

781
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,450
It's one misfortune after another.

782
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,160
Tell me about it.

783
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,040
I should've just sold that cursed farm

784
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,000
to a certain despicable guy back then.

785
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,500
What a shame.

786
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,380
"Despicable guy"?

787
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,670
That despicable guy is leaving.
I'm moving out.

788
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,090
I have something for you before I leave.

789
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,600
I see.

790
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,940
There's no need for parting gifts,
but I appreciate the thought.

791
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,560
No, not that.
I came to return your container.

792
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,690
I see.

793
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,030
Goodness.

794
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,450
I feel bad

795
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,780
for a lot of things I did to you.

796
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,450
Take good care of yourself.

797
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,450
Here.

798
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,920
You have to survive.

799
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,880
Wait.

800
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,930
A goodbye party?

801
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,510
He's moving to Seoul tomorrow.

802
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,760
Is that why

803
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,390
you made all this food by yourself?

804
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,270
After everything that he's done to you?

805
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,150
Maybe she poisoned the food.

806
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,530
-Goodness.
-Are you serious right now?

807
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,280
Goodness, I'm sorry I'm late.

808
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,990
-Come on in.
-Come in.

809
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,120
Hi, kids.

810
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,620
-Come here.
-My babies.

811
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,080
Welcome. My dear Ye-jin.

812
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,620
You like pancakes, don't you?

813
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,790
I also brought dumpling soup
and radish water kimchi, your favorites.

814
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,170
Go sit down.

815
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,960
-Sit down.
-Goodness.

816
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,050
You shouldn't have cooked

817
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,340
when you haven't even fully recovered yet.

818
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,390
-Where's Kang-ho?
-Sorry?

819
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,970
The doctors needed to run
a few more tests on him,

820
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,600
so he's still at the hospital.

821
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,940
Don't worry. He's much better now.

822
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,230
I'm truly grateful for all you've done

823
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,650
-to save our farm.
-Please.

824
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,570
I'm also sorry that

825
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,040
I failed to appreciate you all
because I was so focused on working.

826
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,870
-Stop that.
-What's gotten into her?

827
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,080
From this moment on,

828
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,880
I'm going to put aside my worries

829
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,130
and live happily with you all.

830
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,420
-Sure.
-Do that.

831
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,670
Yes.

832
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,380
There's even a song about it.

833
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,340
Let's put aside our worries

834
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,390
And cha-cha-cha

835
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,810
Cha, cha, cha.

836
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,520
-And cha--
-Come on!

837
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,850
Is this why you brought me?

838
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,270
One, two.

839
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,230
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

840
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:21,570
If you cannot stop them

841
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,950
From leaving

842
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,240
-Don't turn your back and cry
-Don't turn your back and cry

843
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,580
-Spare yourself the tears
-Spare yourself the tears

844
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,420
-Tomorrow
-Tomorrow

845
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,460
-There will be
-There will be

846
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:48,470
-A new wind
-A new wind

847
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,470
-Three, four.
-Three, four.

848
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,640
-Let's put aside our worries
-Let's put aside our worries

849
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,270
-And cha-cha-cha
-And cha-cha-cha

850
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,260
Imagine the expectations I had
when I assigned

851
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,800
such an important task to you.

852
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,760
Didn't I tell you that Woobyeok Group

853
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,100
and all of our lives were at stake?

854
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
I'm sorry, sir.

855
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,230
We didn't expect it
to drag on for so long.

856
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,560
But thankfully, we caught…

857
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,070
What's so damn hard about
killing that idiot?

858
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,950
Damn it.

859
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,360
Damn it!

860
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,910
Were you the one who sent these…

861
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,330
Mr. Oh!

862
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,500
What happened to Kang-ho?

863
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,050
He was questioned this morning about
Hwang Soo-hyun and released a while ago.

864
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,550
He was released?

865
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,180
A vehicle was recovered at the
scene of the accident at Taebu Island.

866
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,140
And the doors and windows
were locked from the inside.

867
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,810
So you're telling me

868
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,310
Hwang Soo-hyun
was never in the car to begin with?

869
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,990
That means Kang-ho duped me.

870
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,820
Then who the hell killed her?

871
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,790
OH TAE-SOO

872
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,210
Tail him

873
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,380
and make sure you see it through.

874
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,280
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

875
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,070
-You're home. Goodness.
-Mom!

876
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,990
-Hey. Goodness.
-Did you have fun?

877
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,530
My dear Mi-joo.

878
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,660
My pretty Mi-joo.

879
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,540
-Goodness, here's a kiss.
-Right.

880
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,880
-You let an ill person drink?
-I only had one glass.

881
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,290
Just one.

882
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,380
I'm in such a great mood today.

883
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,050
Tell me about it.

884
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,550
It's unlike you to drink like that

885
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,140
and insist on sleeping
at our house tonight.

886
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,180
I'm going to sleep
with Seo-jin and Ye-jin.

887
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,230
-Seo-jin and Ye-jin…
-Goodness me!

888
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,690
-Let's put her to bed.
-Okay.

889
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,310
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

890
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,480
Ye-jin.

891
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,650
-Seo-jin. Wait for me.
-Let's go.

892
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,610
-Wait for me.
-You're killing me.

893
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,200
-Well done.
-Let's sleep together.

894
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,120
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

895
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,700
-You guys, come here.
-Mi-joo…

896
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,500
Let's go outside.

897
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,790
-Let's let her sleep.
-I want to sleep with them.

898
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,500
-Ye-jin and Seo-jin.
-Turn off the light.

899
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,170
-Okay, you can sleep with them.
-My babies.

900
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,880
-Let's sleep together.
-Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

901
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,130
My babies.

902
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,640
-Everyone was so happy today.
-I'm sorry.

903
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,430
They were all dancing and singing.

904
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,850
Really?

905
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,940
Why were they so happy?

906
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,730
I'm not sure.

907
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,700
I think they were happy to hear that
Mr. Baek was leaving.

908
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,570
What's this?

909
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,080
I took several videos to show you,

910
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,990
but none of them got saved.

911
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,410
Give it to me.

912
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,250
Let me see.

913
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,460
Look.

914
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,540
Your storage is full.

915
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,800
You should've deleted
unnecessary ones beforehand.

916
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,720
None of them are unnecessary!
They're all my work.

917
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,220
Really?

918
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,130
Okay.

919
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,010
What's this?

920
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,430
That?

921
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,810
I filmed Kang-ho's ex-fiancée.

922
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,690
Just delete it.
It's the most useless video ever.

923
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,480
-I hate it.
-Wait, hold on.

924
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,610
Hold on.

925
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,780
Do you see this Banz?

926
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,610
My grandma told me that

927
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,360
only those who are very rich
can drive one.

928
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,240
All right. Let's take a peek inside.

929
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,580
I see the lady Kang-ho brought with him.

930
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,290
She took something out of her bag.

931
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,030
No way.

932
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,700
They both could've died,

933
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,540
so why would she slip him pills?

934
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,160
I heard the driver that day was a woman.

935
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,170
Then it makes absolutely no sense.

936
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,090
Why would she spike her own drink?

937
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,630
I'm sure they were some supplements.

938
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,130
What's important is that
Kang-ho drove when they departed.

939
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,850
That means they switched places midway.

940
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,060
They could've done that if he was tired.

941
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,730
But the reason is just strange.

942
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,350
Apparently, Kang-ho fell asleep,

943
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,020
and she was outside the car
when the accident happened.

944
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,650
That's why she was unscathed and met me.

945
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,360
Isn't it so odd?

946
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,570
Well…

947
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,700
It is too convenient
to call it a coincidence.

948
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,080
This won't do.

949
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,700
I need to meet her.

950
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,080
What? Hey.

951
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,290
You can't do that!

952
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,460
Can't you see the state I'm in?

953
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,630
I even eat in here
in case those men come back for me.

954
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,420
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

955
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,680
Don't worry.

956
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,010
I won't be going alone.

957
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,270
I can't believe this.

958
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,810
Hey!

959
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,610
Mi-joo.

960
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,870
I'm truly honored and touched
that you chose me to do this with you.

961
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,370
But this isn't right. It's too dangerous.

962
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,040
Then will you live in a closet forever?

963
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,170
A closet is better than a coffin.

964
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,460
You've never met those guys.

965
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,170
If I get caught again,
I really might end up dead!

966
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,130
-Look.
-What?

967
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,670
-Now!
-Hey, Mi-joo!

968
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,680
Are you insane? Goodness.

969
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,850
Who is it?

970
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:33,850
Hello, is this Ha-young's house?

971
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,190
I'm a close friend of hers.

972
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,730
But I couldn't reach her.

973
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,780
Is she home right now by any chance?

974
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,450
I'm sorry, but she's not home.

975
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,030
Then can I…

976
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,280
Darn it.

977
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,290
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

978
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,410
He's not here?

979
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,330
No.

980
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,630
He sold the restaurant
a year ago and left.

981
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,170
Where did he go?

982
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,170
I'm not entirely sure where he went.

983
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,840
But we suddenly lost touch.

984
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,020
Hello?

985
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,690
Hello, who is this?

986
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,110
Prosecutor Choi, it's me.

987
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,900
Investigation Officer?

988
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,030
Your car suddenly disappeared,

989
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,540
so I called your mother to check.

990
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,460
You and I were the only ones
who knew where the car key was.

991
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,210
I'm truly glad.

992
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,960
I knew you'd come back.

993
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,210
-Sir.
-Yes?

994
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,130
I still have some work to do,

995
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,220
so please keep this a secret until then.

996
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,300
Of course.

997
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,680
I'm forever indebted to you.

998
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,180
You know me.

999
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,770
Have I ever asked you to lend me money?

1000
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,060
But my mother is getting surgery tomorrow.

1001
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,280
Could you please help me out this once?
I'll pay you back at all costs.

1002
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,030
Hello?

1003
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,160
Hello…

1004
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,240
Woobyeok Paper Company's
corporate transaction records and ledger

1005
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,950
for the third and fourth quarters
are missing.

1006
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,460
I'm sorry. I'll find them and get it to…

1007
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,210
-Sir?
-Take care of your personal matters

1008
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,960
so you can focus on work.

1009
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,170
You don't have to come to work
until the weekend.

1010
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,300
Take good care of your mother.

1011
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,310
My mother would have passed away
without having a chance to get surgery

1012
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,520
had you not helped me back then.

1013
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:42,440
Maybe that's why I couldn't say no
to anything your mother asked of me.

1014
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,860
Don't worry.

1015
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,030
I'll help you no matter what.

1016
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,820
Goodness.

1017
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,660
You've been throwing up all day.

1018
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,250
You shouldn't have drunk in your state.

1019
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,960
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

1020
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,130
We already know what I have.

1021
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,630
My body has become too weak
to handle a single glass of makgeolli.

1022
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,180
Oh, no.

1023
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,600
What a small world.

1024
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,270
That was random.

1025
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,070
I've met Oh Ha-young before.

1026
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,280
What? When?

1027
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,150
I won't apologize.

1028
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,110
There.

1029
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,030
What'll you do now?

1030
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,540
In that case, it can't be helped.

1031
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,090
Goodness, you're still here?

1032
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,220
Ha-young's phone is still off.

1033
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,100
Ma'am, I really need to see her.

1034
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,360
I've been studying abroad for five years,
and I flew in temporarily.

1035
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,940
Once I go back,

1036
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,490
I don't know when I'll return.

1037
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:12,820
I can't believe that woman.

1038
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,320
Could you please

1039
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,780
help me out this once?

1040
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,660
-Please.
-My goodness.

1041
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,660
You see…

1042
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,460
She's a bit ill,
so she's in a hospital right now.

1043
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,960
Which hospital?

1044
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,880
-I'll visit her.
-No!

1045
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:34,180
Anyway, it'll be difficult
to see her for the time being.

1046
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,550
So meet her next time.

1047
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,010
Come by again next time.

1048
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,350
Next time when?

1049
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,560
After the presidential election.

1050
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,730
I'm sure you'll be able to meet her then.

1051
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,400
Ma'am, please help me.

1052
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,190
Please…

1053
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,750
That lady

1054
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,460
looked very anxious.

1055
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,290
Did you notice it too?

1056
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,170
She's in a hospital,

1057
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,930
but that lady won't dare
tell you which hospital it is.

1058
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,140
And she said you should come back
after the election.

1059
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,510
But that's in four months.

1060
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,350
How ill could she possibly be
to be hospitalized for that long?

1061
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,440
I don't think the duration matters.

1062
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,110
I think it's the election part
that's important.

1063
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,360
Right. I saw this earlier.

1064
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,740
Maybe

1065
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,530
it has something to do with this.

1066
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,950
ASSEMBLYMAN OH'S DAUGHTER
DISAPPEARS AT HER WEDDING…

1067
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,080
No way.

1068
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,080
Think about it.

1069
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,580
The election is right around the corner,
and this is what his daughter did.

1070
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,120
Right.

1071
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:51,250
Plus, she's aware
of her father's illegitimate child.

1072
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,800
If I were him, I would've broken her legs
and locked her up somewhere.

1073
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,840
Do you think she's even in a hospital?

1074
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:03,720
Would he really risk the doctors
and nurses spreading rumors about her?

1075
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,350
And is there even a hospital
that admits you for four months?

1076
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,070
-Sam-sik!
-Oh, my god!

1077
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,910
I know where it is.

1078
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,700
What are you talking about?

1079
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,040
The hospital.

1080
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,500
It must be

1081
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,870
Woosung Medical Center.

1082
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,590
Hey.

1083
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,890
What is this?

1084
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,430
Can't you read?

1085
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,140
It's a medical certificate.

1086
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,890
"Fourteen weeks of recovery"?

1087
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,560
Did you not expect something like this
when you kicked me?

1088
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,360
You messed with the wrong person.

1089
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,990
You know who my dad is, right?

1090
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:07,290
Fabricating a medical certificate
is a cakewalk for him.

1091
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,540
He could turn someone like you

1092
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:14,380
into a lunatic and have you locked up
in a hospital forever.

1093
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,510
I did hear that your father

1094
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,970
is an assemblyman
who'll be running for president.

1095
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,010
"Oh Ha-young"?

1096
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,600
But I only just found out

1097
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,890
his last name.

1098
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,730
"Woosung Medical Center."

1099
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,390
I see.

1100
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,560
I understand that Assemblyman Oh
is a powerful figure

1101
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,110
who can fabricate medical certificates

1102
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,190
and threaten innocent people with them.

1103
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,410
I'll make sure to remember him
during elections.

1104
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,290
Do you think she's really here?

1105
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,080
She has to be. For Kang-ho's sake.

1106
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,340
You and your dear Kang-ho.

1107
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,340
And also for your sake, Sam-sik.

1108
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,550
People always mention
the most important person last, right?

1109
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,060
Right?

1110
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,140
Wait up.

1111
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,190
Excuse me.

1112
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,860
Have you seen this man before?

1113
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:22,490
I don't think so.

1114
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,110
Thank you.

1115
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,120
May I ask you something?

1116
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,990
Have you seen this man before?

1117
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,540
Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you something?

1118
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,100
GWANGMYEONGHO

1119
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,980
Name, Cho Yeong-jae. Age, 55.

1120
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,820
After he sold
his restaurant in Sillim-dong,

1121
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,200
he changed his address to his hometown.

1122
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,870
But no one is living there.

1123
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:12,750
And I looked into a boat
named Gwangmyeongho as you asked.

1124
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,120
I found out that

1125
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,790
there are boats by that name
in Dangjin, Pohang, and Haenam.

1126
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,800
Mr. Cho!

1127
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,640
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1128
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,870
You've worked tirelessly to support me,

1129
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,700
so I'll make sure
you don't regret your efforts.

1130
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,000
Did Mr. Choi run away?

1131
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,290
Don't ever come back without a warrant.

1132
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:58,920
Is everything going well?

1133
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,590
-That must be where Oh Ha-young is.
-What?

1134
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,590
How could you do something so dangerous?

1135
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,590
I do know this very secretive place.

1136
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:10,470
Jin Young-soon!

1137
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:12,430
Come out!

1138
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,600
I figured the two of them

1139
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,140
needed some time alone.

1140
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,730
You weren't by our side,

1141
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,020
but I was always with you.

1142
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:27,570
