00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,897
There are two animals

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,317
that are useful from their head to toe.

4
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,360
Do you know what they are?

5
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,446
Humans…

6
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,448
and pigs.

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,662
Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,247
but that's not the case.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,795
Not only do their business in one place
but they also only sleep where it's clean.

10
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,256
They bathe often in mud to cool themselves

11
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,133
and get rid of bugs.

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:38,306
But humans started to lock them up
in tiny pigsties.

13
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,646
The pigs couldn't bathe in mud anymore,

14
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,649
so they began to rub their bodies
on their own excrement.

15
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,529
That's how they grew dirtier
and more aggressive.

16
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,240
Isn't that so sad?

17
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,827
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

18
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,797
However, what's really sad is this.

19
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,676
Pigs are unable to lift their heads,

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,345
so they live their entire life
staring at the ground.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,937
There is only one way for a pig
to look up at the sky.

22
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,025
It's…

23
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,071
to fall down.

24
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,077
That's right.

25
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,663
Falling down

26
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,667
is a way for you to see another world,
a world you have never seen before,

27
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,921
both for pigs and people.

28
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,384
I got you!

29
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,472
EPISODE 1

30
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,143
I am happy

31
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,855
I am happy

32
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,317
I am happy

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,862
I am very very happy

JOONGANG FEED & SUPPLY

35
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,908
Food delivery!

36
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,578
You were all gathered here.

37
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,914
-Goodness!
-Hello!

38
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,790
You're at it by yourself again.

39
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,002
-Thank you.
-Sure.

40
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,756
It's too heavy for a woman.

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,633
Goodness, sir.

42
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,135
Goodness.

43
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,013
DOG FEED, COW FEED, HORSE FEED,
CHICKEN FEED, DUCK FEED, ALL FEEDS

44
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,557
Goodness. You're right.

45
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,018
It's too heavy for a woman.

46
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,144
Hey!

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,482
DELICIOUS FEED
FOR COWS

48
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,400
Hi.

49
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,236
Young-soon!

50
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,740
Young-soon, take these with you.

51
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,744
DELICIOUS FEED

52
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,828
FOR POULTRY

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,252
I'll give you the rest next month.

54
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,051
Goodness.

55
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,512
-Thank you, Young-soon.
-Sure.

56
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,431
Here. These are fresh
so it'll be delicious.

57
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,978
-Thank you.
-Drink up.

58
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,943
-Gosh, that's refreshing.
-Give this to your boss.

59
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,569
Mulberries?

60
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,322
They're great for men.

61
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,157
-Gosh, ma'am!
-Gosh.

62
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,329
JOONGANG FEED & SUPPLY

63
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,043
JOONGANG FEED & SUPPLY

64
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,461
This is nuts.

65
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,797
What's this?

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,175
That's red chili powder
made with farm-grown peppers.

67
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,094
Screw that.

68
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,014
Of course all red chili powders
are from farms.

69
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,433
Then what about these?

70
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,476
Were they assembled in a factory?

71
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,522
Tell them to stop giving us
these useless things

72
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,983
and pay us what they owe.

73
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,067
I forgot.

74
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,236
There are mulberries in the car.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,323
It's apparently great for men,

76
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,617
and Ms. Eun-ju from the goat farm
told me to make sure you receive it.

77
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,869
Ms. Eun-ju?

78
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,039
Why did she give me something…

79
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,792
that's good for men?

80
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,630
Mulberry, where are you?

81
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,007
Where are you?

82
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,633
Where?

83
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,304
They're both so obvious.

84
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
Seriously.

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,060
Welcome.

86
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,743
Well, you must be busy.

87
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,496
I…

88
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,124
Are you going to a funeral?

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,542
No.

90
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,795
Well, Young-soon.

91
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,922
She's pretty, isn't she?

92
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,049
She ate well this morning and…

93
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,219
Young-soon.

94
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,517
Will you marry me?

95
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,897
Do a good job. Go.

96
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,398
Go to her.

97
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,733
Go.

98
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,276
Come here.

99
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,654
These mulberries are sweet.

100
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,905
-Where are you going?
-No!

101
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,615
-No!
-Hey, wait!

102
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,408
-No!
-Hey!

103
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,868
-Get back here!
-Goodness.

104
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,912
-Catch it!
-Hey, piggy!

105
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,330
-Catch it!
-What's that?

106
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,456
-What's that?
-Goodness.

107
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,917
-It's running away!
-Stop right there!

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,128
-Hey!
-The pig!

109
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,464
Please catch the pig!

110
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,300
The pig!

111
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,468
A pig?

112
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,178
-Hey, catch it.
-Hey!

113
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,721
-Catch it!
-Hey!

114
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,973
Hey, where are you going?

115
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,558
-Come here.
-Catch it.

116
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,268
Catch it!

117
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,061
You have to catch it!

118
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,480
Go that way. Where did it go?

119
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,857
-Where did it go?
-Where did it go?

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
Rice pop!

121
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,610
-That scared me!
-Are you okay?

122
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,736
Have a good one.

123
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,737
-There.
-That scared me!

124
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,198
-It was here.
-A pig.

125
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,616
-Where?
-It's a pig!

126
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,909
Over there!

127
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,703
-Hey, come here!
-Over here.

128
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,288
-Where are you going?
-No!

129
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,206
-Oh, no!
-Can you catch that pig?

130
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,791
This way.

131
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,251
-Goodness.
-Where?

132
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,046
One more pork belly, please.

133
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,964
Sure.

134
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,424
What's that noise?

135
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,717
-Look.
-What?

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,802
-What's that?
-Oh, my!

137
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,387
-Goodness!
-Wait.

138
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,347
-What's that?
-Where are you?

139
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,891
I got it!

140
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,396
Goodness.

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,814
This little…

142
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,319
I don't want it.

143
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,779
They're having pork belly. Let's leave.

144
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,906
Enjoy.

145
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,324
Let's go.

146
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,700
-What?
-Go ahead and eat.

147
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,620
-They caught it.
-They did?

148
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,205
-They did!
-We did.

149
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,789
-Good job!
-Hey.

150
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,334
Young-soon, one second.

151
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,961
It didn't go as planned,

152
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,839
but next time,
I promise I'll train the pig better

153
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,093
so that it can go
directly to you next time.

154
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,930
You're going to get married again?

155
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,890
No, I'm not.

156
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,059
What are you talking about? I…

157
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,435
What?

158
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,898
That means you'll…

159
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,655
Thank you!

160
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,073
Thank you!

161
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,282
Thank you!

162
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,582
No wonder you always came to our shop
when you had nothing to buy.

163
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,626
Hey, wait!

164
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,046
Does this mean you're going to quit?

165
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,298
No!

166
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,008
I don't approve of this marriage!

167
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,593
-What do you mean?
-It's off!

168
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,928
-It can't happen!
-Move it.

169
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,806
I'll take a picture for you.
Look over here.

170
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,183
Goodness, you two are cute.

171
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,603
One, two, say piggy!

172
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,901
The circuits look fine.
Your electrical system looks good.

173
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,195
-Really?
-Sparks are quite dangerous,

174
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,364
so make sure you dust often.

175
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,949
Be careful when you spray water.

176
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,701
All right. Thank you.

177
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,244
No need to thank me. It's my job.

178
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,371
We're busy at the fire station

179
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,290
-with frequent piggery fires.
-I see.

180
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,166
I'll stop by next time I'm on patrol.

181
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,668
Hold on.

182
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,211
Take this.

183
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,172
I heard your baby just turned one!

184
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,591
Your father told me.

185
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,843
-Buy your kid some clothes.
-Goodness, it's okay.

186
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,803
I couldn't even go to your wedding.

187
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,555
Don't say that.

188
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,309
I know you spend all your weekends
with your mother at the hospital.

189
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,186
If it bothers you that much,

190
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,065
you can come to my kid's first birthday.

191
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,943
What? That means…

192
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,071
I'm going to be a dad!

193
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,951
-Congratulations!
-My heart is racing!

194
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,204
My gosh. Isn't this great?

195
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,664
When is the baby due?

196
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,708
Next September, the Year of the Dragon.

197
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,044
It's the Year of the Double Dragon
in the year '88

198
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,629
that only comes around
once every 300 years.

199
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,172
Look at this.

200
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,716
I want to give my kid the best name,

201
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,010
so I've been studying this.

202
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,053
Kang-cheol.

203
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,220
Kang-su.

204
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,805
Kang-jun.

205
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,557
Kang is the generational syllable.

206
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,516
Kang-hun.

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,601
Kang-sik.

208
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,770
-Kang-min.
-What if the baby's a girl?

209
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,480
Kang-hui. Kang-sun.

210
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,814
Kang-ja.

211
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,066
Kang-mi.

212
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,068
Hey, I'm prepared for everything.

213
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,778
And look at this too.

214
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,826
Ta-da.

215
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,205
I don't know if it'll be
a boy or a girl, so I got both.

216
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,665
BONGU FARM

217
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,584
The baby's not due for a while,
and you're studying names already.

218
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,044
You must be very excited.

219
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,504
Of course I am!

220
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,048
Anyway, why does it take
ten months for humans?

221
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,176
Why can't humans give birth
in four months like pigs?

222
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,094
Right?

223
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,889
I'll also think of a good name

224
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,933
-that begins with Kang.
-No, don't.

225
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,934
You don't need to.

226
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,018
I'm going to do it.

227
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,145
Don't you dare name my kid, okay?

228
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,689
Thanks, Sang-cheol. Bye.

229
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,441
Bye now.

230
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,074
All right.

231
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,162
Yong-yong, my Double Dragon.

232
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,622
Daddy made this.

233
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,707
YONG-YONG

234
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,918
This is all for you.

235
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,462
Hae-sik!

236
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,924
-Hae-sik.
-Yes?

237
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,968
-I need you at the breeding house.
-Why?

238
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,803
She's doing it again.

239
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,805
-Again?
-Yes.

240
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,723
Okay. Let's go.

241
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,563
Hey, piggy. Doesn't it hurt?

242
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,023
What makes you so miserable
that you bang your head?

243
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,317
Think of the babies in your womb.

244
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,571
You shouldn't do that as a mother.

245
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,949
-Here you are.
-Hey, you're here.

246
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,326
She did it again.

247
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,207
The Ministry of Home Affairs began
environmental improvement projects

248
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,084
to take a leap into developed nations.

249
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,671
More resources have been
allocated to paving local roads

250
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,048
to complete the project
before the Seoul Olympics,

251
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,342
-hastening the process.
-It's so good.

252
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,512
Our baby is probably only tiny,

253
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,598
but I'm already feeling morning sickness.

254
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,642
But that mother pig carries ten piglets.

255
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,102
It must be so tough.

256
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,563
That's true.

257
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,274
But I'm worried she'll stress out

258
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,692
the other mother pigs.

259
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,361
It's a sensitive time,
and they need to stay healthy.

260
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,239
Why don't you separate them?

261
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,824
Our storage is empty.

262
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,618
Should I do that?

263
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,412
I'll make a pigsty,

264
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,789
feed it every day, and look after it.

265
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,375
Nonsense! You're in early pregnancy.

266
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,544
You need to be the most careful right now.

267
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,922
Don't strain yourself. Don't even do this.

268
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,507
I'll do everything.

269
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,966
-I'm fine.
-No.

270
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,052
It's for our Yong-yong.

271
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,553
Let's see what our baby is up to.

272
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,597
-My gosh.
-One second.

273
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,140
Yong-yong.

274
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,436
You and I are going to have a chat today.

275
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,437
Here.

276
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,690
Yong-yong, respond, over.

277
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,776
Can you say, "Daddy"?

278
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,737
Say, "Daddy."

279
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,242
I just heard our baby say it. I mean it.

280
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,953
-One second.
-I can't believe you.

281
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,995
What?

282
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,830
I see.

283
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,083
I have to do that now?

284
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,168
I have to give Mommy a big kiss?

285
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,336
Thank you.

286
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,259
Oh, my.

287
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,345
You might have another child
before that one's born.

288
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,555
Chief.

289
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,848
Is our doorbell broken?

290
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,725
-Have some of this.
-Hello.

291
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,686
-Have a mung bean pancake.
-Goodness.

292
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,314
I can get a treat like this
now that you have a wife.

293
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,151
This is really good.

294
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,444
Right? Isn't it great?

295
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,072
Anyway, what brings you here, Chief?

296
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,950
I have something to discuss with you.

297
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,159
-I see.
-You know

298
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,912
about the Olympics torch relay, right?

299
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,122
Yes, I know.

300
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,207
For the Seoul Olympics,

301
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,918
the relay will go through Bongu-ro
and right out front.

302
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,670
-Right here?
-Really?

303
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,130
What an honor.

304
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,966
Does this mean
we get to see the torch relay live?

305
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,177
That's why I thought
of gathering the villagers

306
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,972
to cheer the runners
with Korean flags and banners.

307
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,432
That sounds great.

308
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,850
That's a wonderful idea.

309
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,729
Then may I make the flags and banners?

310
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm a good artist.

311
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,816
Honey, you shouldn't strain yourself.

312
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,069
Strain myself?
This is all for our country.

313
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,446
May I do that?

314
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,822
Of course!

315
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,034
-I'd be grateful!
-No, you can't.

316
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,201
Come on.

317
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,080
WISHING FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS
WELCOME TO BONGU-DONG

318
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,874
I will

319
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,170
Love forever

320
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,257
So what is this?

321
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,426
You're going to demolish my farm

322
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,054
because of the torch relay?

323
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,097
That's just one of the reasons.

324
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,642
The marathon will also
be held down this road.

325
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,810
Think about it.

326
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,104
The whole world will watch it on TV.

327
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,399
If the TV captures
this dirty, smelly pigsty,

328
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,903
foreigners are going to think
Korea is a backwater country.

329
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,655
-Don't you think so?
-Hey.

330
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,659
We're all doing this out of patriotism.

331
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,661
-Honey.
-Honey.

332
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,038
-Look.
-That's a good one.

333
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,956
Who are they?

334
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,540
Nobody. Go back inside.

335
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,459
We have to get to work.

336
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,294
We're busy, so please leave.

337
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,921
-Don't push me.
-No, please go.

338
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,089
Please leave now.

339
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,715
How dare you lay a hand on me?

340
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,593
-What are you doing? Let go!
-No!

341
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,846
-Let go, you bastards!
-What are you people doing?

342
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,806
Go back inside.

343
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,144
-Who do you think you are?
-Let go!

344
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,854
Quiet down!

345
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,439
Jeez.

346
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,152
I told you to explain it to him
quietly and with respect.

347
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,279
What are you doing right now?

348
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,492
What are you doing, you punk?

349
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,077
Darn it.

350
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,747
Goodness, I'm sorry.

351
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,292
All he's ever done is fight.

352
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,294
He's not educated.

353
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,796
Well…

354
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,800
Take this.

355
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,928
So…

356
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,932
Have you heard of
Major League Baseball in the US?

357
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,308
DIRECTOR
SONG WOO-BYEOK

358
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,062
The best pitcher on the Boston Red Sox,

359
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,482
Roger Clemens smokes these.

360
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,611
We may be able to import Patriot missiles,

361
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,406
but these are really tough
to bring into the country.

362
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,658
Please have a smoke

363
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,660
and forgive us.

364
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,329
You smoke foreign cigarettes

365
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,373
and talk about patriotism?

366
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,127
I don't care if it's the torch relay
or the marathon.

367
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,464
Even at a snail's pace, our farm
will be on TV for less than 30 seconds.

368
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,090
And the smell?

369
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,968
Do TVs abroad broadcast smells?

370
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,263
We've run this farm for generations,

371
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,974
since the days of
my grandfather's grandfather.

372
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,101
I'm going to leave it to my son,

373
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,479
and to his grandson and his grandson too!

374
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,399
So I'll never sign this form!

375
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,819
Don't ever come back here.

376
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,737
Understand?

377
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,201
You must be shocked. Let's go inside.

378
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,869
Goodbye.

379
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,298
Eat up and get well soon

380
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,426
so that you'll have a healthy delivery.

381
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,181
Yes.

382
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,644
I'm glad we put her in the storage.

383
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,813
-Right.
-She's much calmer now.

384
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,730
You're right.

385
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,317
So Chief, no matter
how important the Olympics is,

386
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,569
these are lawfully our personal assets.

387
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,572
What can they do about it?
We have to hold out no matter what.

388
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,118
We should put together
an anti-demolition committee

389
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,203
and fight until the end, okay?

390
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,955
I won't condone this.

391
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,874
I'll meet with an attorney right away.

392
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,585
Yes, I'll call you later. Bye.

393
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,553
Goodness, look at the time.

394
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,221
-I have to feed the pigs.
-Hey.

395
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,889
Honey.

396
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,516
I already fed the pigs.

397
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,434
-You did?
-Yes.

398
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,104
Why did you do that? It's tough on you.

399
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,856
Things are tougher for you.

400
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,944
Honey.

401
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,196
Don't worry about it.

402
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,282
You know me, right? I'll never give up.

403
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,867
I won't lose.

404
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,910
Do you know why?

405
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,705
Look, I got you right here,

406
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,957
and I got Yong-yong here too!

407
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,584
How can I lose to anybody?

408
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,337
Everything will be fine.

409
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,081
-Fire!
-Fire!

410
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,959
-Fire!
-There's a fire!

411
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,211
-Fire!
-Fire!

412
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,755
-Fire!
-Fire!

413
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,382
-Fire!
-Fire!

414
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,385
-Fire!
-Fire!

415
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,179
-Fire!
-Over there!

416
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,598
Honey.

417
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,433
What is it?

418
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,768
Honey!

419
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,354
What? What's going on?

420
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,438
Where's the fire?

421
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,692
Oh, no! Call the firehouse!

422
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,152
Where's the firetruck?

423
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,403
-No!
-No!

424
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,947
-You can't go in!
-No!

425
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,281
-I have to go in!
-Don't go!

426
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,491
-Let go!
-No, you can't!

427
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,034
-Goodness, no!
-Goodness!

428
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,619
-No!
-Let go!

429
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,080
My pigs are dying in there!
This isn't right!

430
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,542
Even pigs don't deserve to die like this!

431
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,669
No!

432
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,337
Honey, I'm sorry.

433
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,840
But you can't go in there.

434
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,551
I can't let you go in there.

435
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,015
Why?

436
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,102
Why?!

437
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,358
I saw it with my own two eyes.

438
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,485
I came out to take a leak earlier,

439
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,320
and I heard the dogs barking

440
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,031
and saw some dark figures lurking around.

441
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,993
I kept watching to see who they were,

442
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,495
and they were those punks
from Yongra Construction.

443
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,165
I wondered why they were here
in the middle of the night,

444
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,917
then I suddenly saw these flames.

445
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,127
See?

446
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,713
-I told you it would be them.
-Are you sure?

447
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,007
-Are you sure it was them?
-Yes!

448
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,175
Honey.

449
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,261
-Honey.
-Look at this.

450
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,723
It's the American brand
that man was smoking, right?

451
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,977
EVIDENCE 1

452
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,192
You're right.

453
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,987
That's the same brand as the ones I smoke.

454
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,531
Is that a problem?

455
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,451
These cigarettes are only sold in the US,

456
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,828
and they've never been imported here.

457
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,374
Which means it's not easy
for ordinary people to buy these.

458
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,420
However, this cigarette butt was found
near the victim's farm,

459
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,631
who recently had a dispute
with the defendant over the demolition.

460
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,928
It means there is a high possibility
this cigarette belongs to the defendant.

461
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:36,188
Well, Mr. Kim of Daeil Real Estate.

462
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,232
Me?

463
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,903
When I first went to see you,
I gave you a cigarette, didn't I?

464
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,072
I didn't smoke it.

465
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,657
I also gave one to the radio shop owner.

466
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,284
And the village chief too.

467
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,286
Chief, you got one too.

468
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,455
I smoked it that day!

469
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,458
-Silence.
-Who knows?

470
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,335
What?

471
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,003
Are you saying I started the fire?

472
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,421
I said, silence!

473
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,757
WITNESS

474
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,595
Well, yes, I did see something.

475
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,227
But come to think of it,
I'm not sure if it was a man or a boar.

476
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,022
Right, maybe a wild dog.

477
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,024
Yes, you're right.

478
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,779
We had to repaint the roof,

479
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,906
but recently it kept raining,

480
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,952
so we kept the buckets of paint
and thinner inside the farm.

481
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,079
We only had two buckets!

482
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,206
But more than five buckets
were at the scene!

483
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,624
This was clearly arson!

484
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,209
Silence!

485
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,880
There's a better chance that the cause
was a short circuit than arson.

486
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,881
Actually,

487
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,093
there were a lot of problems
with the electrical system at the farm.

488
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,264
I urged him to get it fixed,
but he never took adequate measures.

489
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,057
Hey, Sang-cheol! What's with you?

490
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,684
Silence!

491
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,601
Sang-cheol…

492
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,774
It is difficult to acknowledge
the cigarette butt as evidence

493
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,985
purely on the presumption
of the prosecution.

494
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,865
Also, no witnesses or tools of arson
were found to support the claim

495
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,325
that the defendant started the fire.

496
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,035
For such reasons,

497
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,038
the indictment is ruled as not credible.

498
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,832
The defendant is innocent.

499
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,958
That's right!

500
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,102
Hey, Sang-cheol.

501
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,312
Hae-sik.

502
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,771
I have something to say.

503
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,523
-Stay away from me.
-Sang-cheol.

504
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,317
-It's not that.
-Don't come near me!

505
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,902
Sang-cheol!

506
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,236
Sang-cheol!

507
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,753
I needed money for my mother's surgery.

508
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,964
They said no matter
how much you hold out and resist,

509
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,051
it'll be over once the state
decides to bulldoze the pig farm.

510
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,554
I'm sorry.

511
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,056
Hae-sik.

512
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,098
I'm sorry.

513
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,311
They knew my daughter's home address

514
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,313
and where she works.

515
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,815
What would you have done?

516
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,818
That must've been tough.

517
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,030
This is enough evidence to file an appeal.

518
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,156
I see.

519
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,700
Prosecutor Oh, I'm meeting TV reporters

520
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,745
and international reporters tomorrow.

521
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,289
-Reporters?
-Yes.

522
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,460
I asked around,

523
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,671
and that Director Song

524
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,675
is apparently the heir
to Yongra Construction.

525
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,302
And I found many suspicious incidents.

526
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,805
There were many incidents of fire
on demolition sites

527
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,265
where Director Song was in charge.

528
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,269
Although most incidents
were concluded as short-circuit fires,

529
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,937
many details were unclear.

530
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,314
Strangely enough,

531
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,985
witnesses and investigators
all changed their testimonies.

532
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,070
Doesn't it sound similar to our case?

533
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,030
Well…

534
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,241
Prosecutor Oh.

535
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,203
Here.

536
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,581
I've been saving up some money

537
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,042
to build a new house
when our baby is born.

538
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,919
I don't want my child to be ridiculed

539
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,797
for living in a smelly house
next to a pig farm.

540
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,009
But Prosecutor Oh,

541
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,304
I would feel more shame

542
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,224
to live as a helpless father
who let those jerks have their way

543
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,518
than to stink like a pigsty.

544
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,188
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

545
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,190
Prosecutor Oh.

546
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,235
Please reveal the truth.

547
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,655
But the money--

548
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,490
Prosecutor Oh, I…

549
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,581
I understand for now.

550
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,374
Thank you.

551
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,294
3 YEARS, 10 NIGHT FIRES

552
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,505
I'm counting on you, sir.

553
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,548
Goodbye.

554
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,717
Goodbye.

555
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,205
This is Oh Tae-soo.

556
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,249
Things have become troublesome.

557
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,919
I am happy

558
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,881
I am happy

559
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,176
I am happy

560
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,221
I am very very happy

561
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,229
Car trouble?

562
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,323
BONGU FARM

563
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,410
Excuse me, could you move?

564
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,048
Have a drink.

565
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,301
One for me.

566
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,200
I was watching baseball yesterday,

567
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,621
and the game was completely ridiculous.

568
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,207
I mean,

569
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,501
if the fielders got hold of the ball,

570
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,504
the runner should've stopped
at second or third base.

571
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,342
This idiot got greedy
and tried to make it to home plate.

572
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,720
And he was tagged out.

573
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,222
Gosh, that idiot.

574
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,067
Baseball

575
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,362
is exactly like life.

576
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,910
What's important isn't running,
but knowing when to stop.

577
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,746
And you also need to know where to stop.

578
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,873
Anyway.

579
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,833
Everything

580
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,336
is in the past.

581
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,590
Mr. Choi, have a drink

582
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,634
and forget all about it.

583
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,221
All right then.

584
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,436
Here. You can eat this on your way.

585
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,731
If he stepped on the chair to get up…

586
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,650
Good, right?

587
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,156
No, it should be knocked over.

588
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,450
That looks more natural, right?

589
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,119
All done. Let's go.

590
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,746
Boys, move. Let's hurry.

591
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,623
-Grab the glass.
-Yes.

592
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,458
All right.

593
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,293
YONG-YONG

594
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,388
Honey?

595
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,782
Honey, what happened?

596
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,830
Why are you here?

597
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,208
Let's go.

598
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,712
Let's go home.

599
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,511
Let's just give them the farm.
Let's let them have it all.

600
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,014
-Let's just go home, honey.
-Ma'am.

601
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,224
-Let's go!
-Please calm down.

602
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,810
I'll give you everything.

603
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,981
I'll give you everything!

604
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,150
Please save my husband!

605
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,985
No!

606
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,155
No!

607
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,407
Please save my husband!

608
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,493
You can have everything!

609
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,758
Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo?

610
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,967
Yes?

611
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,886
I brought the car you sent for repair.

612
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,430
The trunk is fully cleaned out too.
Please check.

613
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,309
Excuse me. Hey!

614
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,626
Are you Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo?

615
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,629
Yes, hello.

616
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,424
He said he found important evidence,

617
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,551
and he was going to meet with reporters.

618
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,137
So why would he kill himself?

619
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,057
And look at this.

620
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,517
Isn't this weird?

621
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,394
The scar on his neck is too smooth.

622
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,021
Even if he was determined to die,

623
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,067
there should be some trace
of struggling due to pain, right?

624
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,833
BANKBOOK

625
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,043
After hearing what you just said,

626
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,421
I'm convinced that he killed himself.

627
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,465
If he found important evidence,

628
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,802
why didn't he bring it to me?

629
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,681
Instead, he stopped by, drunk,
and said he wanted to kill himself

630
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,892
and that if anything happened to him,

631
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,603
I should give this bankbook to you.

632
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,151
He was quite drunk and persistent.

633
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,486
So I took it

634
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,614
and told him to go home.

635
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,704
I didn't know he'd end up like this.

636
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,513
Why did he do that?

637
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,723
BANKBOOK

638
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,436
How frustrated and lost must he have been
to do something like that?

639
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,025
I should've done…

640
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,528
everything I could to keep him safe.

641
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,782
I should have

642
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,326
supported him

643
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,703
and helped him better.

644
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,667
But I don't know anything,
and I don't have anything.

645
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,925
One thing I do have is…

646
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,224
I won't…

647
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,062
let this child live like us.

648
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,736
I'll live.

649
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,490
Let's live.

650
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,285
Both my baby

651
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,496
and your babies

652
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,375
must have come to save their mothers.

653
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,421
So…

654
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,882
let's…

655
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,011
not give up

656
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,348
and live.

657
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,144
I used to sell feed to this farm,

658
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,437
but it closed two years ago.

659
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,732
I'm only letting you know
because it's you, Young-soon.

660
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,569
It's tough to find a farm and a home
within your budget.

661
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,737
JOU-RI DOLDAM VILLAGE
WELCOME

662

BREEDING INFORMATION

664
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,557
They all look healthy.

665
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,143
All nine of them. Goodness.

666
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,190
"If the building set on fire

667
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,194
is used as a residence
at the time of the fire,

668
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,696
or if people are in…"

HAPPY FARM

670
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,387
Are those pigs?

671
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,641
Pigs in our pristine village?

672
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,684
Our village is clean and unspoiled!

673
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,103
Goodness, we have pigs here!

674
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,441
Why pigs?

675
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,694
Stay still. Calm down.

676
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,911
-Why are those pigs here?
-What?

677
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,246
Pigs are here!

678
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,706
-Yes, but why are they here?
-Why…

679
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,833
Look, honey.

680
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,127
Didn't I do a good job by myself?

681
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,215
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,509
Our child kicked me

683
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,552
to remind me that I'm not alone.

684
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,640
I'll raise our child well

685
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,725
to get our revenge on you for leaving us.

686
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,605
So honey, keep an eye on us from above.

687
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,732
I mean.

688
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,734
Watch over us.

689
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,405
NO TRESPASSING

690
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,123
The air was so fresh
for the last two years,

691
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,042
but we have to put up
with this nonsense again.

692
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,253
We can't just talk this out.

693
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,756
We should just wipe out the entire farm.

694
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,717
-Goodness, hey… Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

695
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,843
-Goodness, ma'am.
-Mother.

696
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,512
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

697
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,432
Ma'am, you, the kid, and the ladies should

698
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,434
all stay out of this.

699
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,854
The men will take care of everything.

700
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,065
So you were a man?

701
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,110
What have you done up to now

702
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:45,406
as the President
of the Young Adult Association?

703
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,159
Goodness gracious.

704
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:52,913
Then what have you done as
the President of the Women's Association?

705
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,040
-Tell me.
-Hey!

706
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,792
What are you doing?

707
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,546
-We can't fight among ourselves.
-He's right.

708
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:04,675
Last year, people
in the next village got into a fight,

709
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,762
then someone put pesticide in the well
and everyone died.

710
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,356
Why the heck are you saying
something so horrendous?

711
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,318
I'm just saying. Don't mind me.

712
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,197
Someone's there!

713
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,907
-What?
-Hey!

714
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,784
Hey! You!

715
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,078
What the heck is this?

716
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,163
Can you not hear me?

717
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,957
-Hey!
-Don't mess with my temper…

718
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,212
What? A woman?

719
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,548
Her stomach… She's pregnant too.

720
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,717
Did you bring this to shoot her?

721
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,511
No, I didn't.

722
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,762
-Darn you.
-Goodness.

723
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,847
Hey, I'm pregnant too!

724
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,810
I just gave birth to my kid too!

725
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,770
That's wonderful news!

726
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,481
Then our children will be the same age.

727
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:04,151
It'll be wonderful to see them grow, play,
and go to school together.

728
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,861
Hey, you're right.

729
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,324
Gum-ja, when are you due this month?

730
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,785
-Less than half a month.
-What?

731
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,787
Goodness, really?

732
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,958
I hope it's a son this time.

733
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,543
She's having a son!

734
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,460
-What?
-What?

735
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,296
I went to this famous fortune teller,

736
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,090
and this time, she's having a son.

737
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,383
-Really?
-My goodness!

738
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,676
She's really having a son?

739
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,220
-My goodness, this is wonderful!
-She is!

740
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,847
This is great news!

741
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,432
Congratulations.

742
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,600
I should butcher a pig.

743
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,395
-Sounds great!
-Yes, pork is a must for feasts!

744
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,479
-Yes.
-Goodness.

745
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,648
-I want some boiled pork.
-Wait!

746
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,820
We don't know if your kid
and my kid will go to school together.

747
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,073
Because you can't run a pig farm
in this village.

748
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,410
-Why not?
-Why do you think?

749
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,996
We'll keep filing civil complaints
to stop you.

750
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,707
And what if the pig catches
some contagious disease?

751
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,376
The entire village will get quarantined.

752
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,296
We can't live with this inconvenience!

753
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,589
Hey.

754
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,593
I'm the village head.

755
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,429
An unpleasant facility such as a pig farm

756
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:17,600
requires the understanding
and agreement of the villagers.

757
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,854
That's common sense
and it's the right thing to do.

758
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,980
Yes.

759
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,446
In that case,

760
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,324
may I file a civil complaint too?

761
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,992
Pardon?

762
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,453
Your dogs bark all day long,
and it's so loud.

763
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,121
I can't stand it.

764
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,082
And you've occupied state-owned land
without permission, right?

765
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,209
State-owned land?

766
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,543
You dry pepper on the road!

767
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,546
It's very inconvenient,
trying to avoid stepping on it.

768
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,424
And you, the village head.
You instigated the villagers

769
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,176
to vote for a certain candidate.

770
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,886
-That's illegal campaigning.
-Well…

771
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,639
They can vote for anyone
in this democratic country.

772
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,641
That's common sense
and it's the right thing to do.

773
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,645
The plastic greenhouse in the forest
should be pulled down!

774
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,647
It blocks my view of the mountains,

775
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,774
-and it's very inconvenient!
-Goodness.

776
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,110
And you, why do you use so much pesticide?

777
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,112
What if you damage the land?

778
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,366
Why do you care if I damage
the land I own?

779
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,993
You don't own the frogs and loaches
that live there!

780
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:18,911
You bitch.

781
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,247
What are you doing?

782
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,790
-Let her go!
-Stop that!

783
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,416
That's my husband you're talking to!

784
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,502
-That's enough!
-You people started this!

785
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,836
-Let go!
-Goodness!

786
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,338
-Let go!
-No, you let go!

787
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,798
-Let go!
-Stop this!

788
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,093
What's wrong?

789
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,219
-What's wrong with her?
-What…

790
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,470
Goodness.

791
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,638
Are you all right?

792
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,225
-Let go of him!
-Let go!

793
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,726
-What are you doing?
-Let go!

794
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,644
Gum-ja!

795
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,813
-You're making my husband bald!
-Let go!

796
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,357
-Stop pulling his hair!
-Let go of her!

797
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,275
Let go!

798
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,568
One second.

799
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,236
-I think she's about to give birth.
-Goodness.

800
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,071
-Goodness.
-Oh, no.

801
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,531
Goodness, what do we do?

802
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,241
-What's that?
-Goodness.

803
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,326
-Her water broke.
-Goodness.

804
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,744
-We have to hurry.
-Wait.

805
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,330
-Yes?
-Sung-ae, go boil some water.

806
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,541
-Okay.
-Gum-ja, go to her room

807
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,875
and lay out the bedding.

808
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,502
I'll grab the tools.

809
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,628
-Tools?
-Scissors!

810
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,671
-Scissors, yes.
-Yes.

811
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,008
Move!

812
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,551
Hey, hop on!

813
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,767
I called you ages ago!
Why the heck aren't you here yet?

814
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,894
No, it's Jou-ri!

815
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,314
What do you mean, Cho Yong-pil? Darn it.

816
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,732
Hello?

817
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,068
-Please look after Jou-ri
-Hey!

818
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,653
-and the unborn child…
-You jerks!

819
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,823
Will you take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

820
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,869
Yes, you're doing well.

821
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,704
Yes, listen to me.

822
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,707
You can't clench your stomach.

823
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,959
-Don't do that.
-Right.

824
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,837
Think of this as taking a dump

825
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,214
-and flex your buttocks.
-Okay.

826
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,591
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

827
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,675
So?

828
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,469
Are the scissors ready?

829
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,721
I'm coming!

830
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,727
It's nice and sharp.

831
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,022
This is sharp enough to cut down
the wood a woodchuck would chuck.

832
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:10,981
Goodness.

833
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,192
I can never say that right.

834
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,028
Wood a woodchunk would chunk.

835
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,489
No, wood a woodchuck would chuck.

836
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,074
-Woond…
-A woodchunk could chunk.

837
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,784
-Would chunk.
-Can you do it?

838
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,952
A wood a woodchunk would…

839
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,456
Wood a woodchuck…

840
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,124
-Goodness.
-would chuck!

841
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,209
That's right!

842
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,795
Wood a woodchuck would chuck. You're good!

843
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,963
Goodness, quiet down.

844
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:35,881
Quiet down.

845
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,258
All of you, hold her hands.

846
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,719
-Hands.
-Right here.

847
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,970
Here we go.

848
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,182
One, two, three.

849
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,310
-Push!
-Push!

850
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,979
Push!

851
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,940
-Okay, good.
-Goodness.

852
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,110
You can't relax like this again.

853
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,821
You're giving the child
a tough time in here.

854
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,781
Think of your child

855
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,866
and think of this as the last time.

856
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,911
Let's try this one more time
with all your energy.

857
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,122
One, two, three.

858
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,208
-Push!
-Push!

859
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,087
-It's coming!
-I see the baby!

860
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,172
-I see the baby!
-More!

861
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,841
You still haven't found us?

862
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,720
It's right under the persimmon tree!

863
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,556
It's next to Gu Ja-yeong's place!

864
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,559
Hey, you punk.
Don't you know who Gu Ja-yeong is?

865
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,520
You know, his grandpa
was our middle school principal…

866
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,902
-Is the baby here?
-Yes!

867
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,448
The baby's born!
I'm hanging up, you stinking punk!

868
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,908
-The baby is here!
-The baby's here?

869
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,703
-The baby is here!
-The baby is here!

870
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,413
-It's here!
-It's here!

871
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,123
The baby is here!

872
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,708
Your mommy is here.

873
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,128
Goodness.

874
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,714
My gosh.

875
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,634
Kang-ho.

876
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,512
"Choi Kang-ho"?

877
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,556
Yes, Kang-ho.

878
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,685
A really competent and strong person.

879
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,147
I wanted him to be like that,
so that's what the name means.

880
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,859
-I love it. Kang-ho.
-Isn't it nice?

881
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,070
And Kang-ho isn't just any strong person.

882
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:23,906
He's the strongest one.

883
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,699
-Choi Kang-ho.
-Choi Kang-ho.

884
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,909
Look.

885
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,913
Kang-ho, it's me, your father.

886
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:31,997
Choi Kang-ho.

887
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:36,251
You have to grow up
as a powerful and strong person.

888
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,419
Okay?

889
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,337
Okay.

890
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,464
He just said yes.

891
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,257
Honey.

892
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,301
He's our Kang-ho.

893
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,514
I'll raise him well.

894
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,683
I'll raise him

895
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,019
to be the strongest man.

896
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,565
His name is Kang-ho.

897
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,453
So?

898
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,789
So? Which is it?

899
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,582
The delivery was successful.

900
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,418
Which is it?

901
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,545
A boy.

902
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,338
-A boy!
-A boy!

903
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,589
-Goodness.
-A boy.

904
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,008
-Is he healthy?
-Of course!

905
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,386
-Why are you crying?
-Why are you crying?

906
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,929
-What?
-Why are you crying?

907
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,472
I'm practicing.

908
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,809
-What?
-I'll also have a son very soon.

909
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,687
Goodness, this guy.

910
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,313
-You surprised us.
-You startled me.

911
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,065
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

912
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,692
-Oh, my.
-What?

913
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,443
What are you doing?

914
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,488
Are you practicing too?

915
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,992
-Stop it.
-No, I have a few more days.

916
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,118
-Right?
-Yes.

917
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,619
What…

918
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,121
-Oh, my.
-What?

919
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,206
Goodness, it must be for real.

920
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,041
Mother, you need to come out!

921
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,794
-What's going on?
-What do we do?

922
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,379
I can't believe this.

923
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,131
Take this. Hurry.

924
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,176
My goodness.

925
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,636
Boil some water.

926
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,763
Go get water.

927
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,181
Goodness.

928
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,684
-No, stay with me right now.
-Hello?

929
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,686
It's the same Cho Yong-pil place.

930
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,479
I need your help.

931
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,443
On the same day, same hour,
and under the same roof.

932
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,611
Goodness.

933
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,655
What are the chances?

934
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,742
Tell me about it.

935
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,621
There have never been births like this.

936
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,457
Is this meant to be or fate?

937
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,709
That's a funny saying.

938
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,588
It'll be a huge hit
if that comes out in a movie.

939
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,589
Really?

940
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,926
Anyway, where's your husband?

941
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,930
What's wrong?

942
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,558
He went home.

943
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,353
That son of a gun.

944
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:03,899
Mother.

945
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,026
-Well, I…
-It's fine.

946
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,280
He is a son of a gun.

947
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,115
Son of a gun.

948
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,827
Good, smile.

949
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,412
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

950
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,039
-There, there.
-Goodness.

951
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,541
We say it's meant to be

952
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,836
to someone whom we meet
for the first time.

953
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,839
But fate is

954
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,886
what we say to someone
who stays with us until the end.

955
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:38,058
I'm not sure if this is
just meant to be or fate,

956
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:42,270
but I hope all these babies
who are born in Jou-ri,

957
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,482
including Sam-sik,

958
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,361
stay healthy for a very long time

959
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,531
and be good friends for a long time.

960
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,742
Sam-sik, they're like
your younger siblings.

961
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,703
-Sam-sik is--
-In that case,

962
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,831
are we not kicking out the dirty pig farm?

963
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,212
-That little…
-Are we kicking her out?

964
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,589
Cover your ears.

965
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,053
Goodness, look at them.

966
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,639
You can't go this time either?

967
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,102
I can't believe her.

968
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,771
You can't skip studying for just one day?

969
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,526
Should I ask your mom

970
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,069
to let you go to the picnic?

971
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,949
I'm sorry.

972
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,577
I didn't mean to hit you with it.

973
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,370
Now it'll reek of pig poop.

974
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,664
I'm sorry.

975
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,335
Smell this.

976
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,420
No!

977
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,629
Sam-sik, you jerk!

978
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,759
Why the heck do you keep bullying Kang-ho?

979
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,885
Why?

980
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,305
Why do you like him?

981
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,015
All that idiot does is study.

982
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,100
But then,

983
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,436
he should study hard.

984
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,313
He's a loser who doesn't have a dad!

985
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,028
You son of a bitch!

986
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,030
"Son of a bitch"?

987
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,492
Who taught you
to swear at your friend like that?

988
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,787
Where did you learn such foul language?

989
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,164
That son of a bitch made fun of me first!

990
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,792
He said I'm a loser with no dad

991
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,835
and to get lost
because I smell like pig poop!

992
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,590
Did you just say "son of a bitch" again?

993
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,675
ENCYCLOPEDIA
THE PERIODIC TABLE

994
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,344
You don't have to feel ashamed.

995
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,678
He's not entirely wrong.

996
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,973
You don't have a father

997
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,477
and a pig farm does smell like pig poop.

998
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,271
See your first birthday picture?

999
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,024
I put out a stethoscope,
money, a microphone,

1000
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,568
and even your favorite robot toy.

1001
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,279
But that gavel is what you picked.

1002
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,490
Let him say whatever he wants.

1003
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,243
If he insults you, let him.

1004
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,412
Once you study hard
and become a prosecutor,

1005
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,082
no one will be able to
look down on you or bully you.

1006
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,918
That's true power.

1007
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,587
Do you understand?

1008
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,593
Is that why
I can't go to the school picnic?

1009
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,013
That's right.

1010
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,474
You can never become successful

1011
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,852
without sacrifice.

1012
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,941
Stop eating if you're full.

1013
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,777
You'll get sleepy if you're too full.

1014
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,201
You got 3 wrong out of 100.

1015
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,663
Correct your mistakes
and solve the problems until page 130.

1016
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,638
AUTUMN PICNIC ANNOUNCEMENT

1017
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,599
PLEASE FILL OUT BELOW
GRADE 4

1018
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,563
REASON FOR ABSENCE

1019
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:22,407
BAD MOM

1020
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,701
I'm home!

1021
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,166
It's Grandma's favorite, meat pancakes!

1022
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,086
Don't touch it
before the memorial service.

1023
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,051
This one is torn.

1024
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:45,096
You can't serve a piece like this.

1025
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,519
What's wrong?

1026
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,231
Mom, are you crying?

1027
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,900
Crazy brat.

1028
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,903
I'm not crying.

1029
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,866
Darn it. The smoke is getting in my eyes.

1030
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,084
Dad!

1031
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,973
What's with you?

1032
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,933
-Come on out!
-Let go of me!

1033
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,061
Or I'll report this bar
for opening during the day.

1034
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,241
Goodness.

1035
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:50,203
Jennifer, you're becoming
a better dancer each day.

1036
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,705
You're flattering me.

1037
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,040
-Please sit.
-Thank you.

1038
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,876
Have some.

1039
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,169
My goodness!

1040
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,339
What are you doing here?

1041
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,340
Dad.

1042
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,175
What?

1043
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,430
Good grief.

1044
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,598
Let go, you brat.

1045
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,187
If you don't want to die
on the same day Grandma passed,

1046
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,231
you better come out.

1047
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,900
Do you want one?

1048
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,590
Let's go.

1049
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:45,884
Mi-joo!

1050
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,386
I'll be home before the sun sets!

1051
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,680
Red fruit on the right,
white fruit on the left!

1052
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,433
Dried fish on the left,
sikhye on the right!

1053
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,936
Call me, call me, call, call, give a call

1054
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,897
They're so pretty!

1055
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,399
If you want my heart, I'll give it to you

1056
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:05,111
Just like this, your love is

1057
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,863
All for me

1058
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,865
I'll give you my heart

1059
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,825
Isn't it enough that Dad's out dancing?

1060
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,452
Do you have to do this nonsense?

1061
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,120
What's with you?

1062
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,247
-Stop dancing!
-Why should I?

1063
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,947
Where's this darned little brat?

1064
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:50,865
Lee Mi-joo!

1065
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,369
Hey, you brat!

1066
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,663
Why do you keep doing this to my hand?

1067
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,375
What's that?

1068
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,459
Is she eating gimbap?

1069
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,711
Oh, my.

1070
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,005
You brat! You little…

1071
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,259
That was for your school trip!

1072
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,052
Stop right there, you brat!

1073
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,264
I missed the damn shot.

1074
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,349
Hey! Pass!

1075
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,476
-Pass!
-You're so handsome!

1076
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,602
Pass!

1077
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,105
I root for the winning team!

1078
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,940
Pass!

1079
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,152
You're so good-looking!

1080
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,612
Pass.

1081
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,406
-Go!
-Let's go!

1082
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,371
Oh, my!

1083
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,124
I knew you'd be here.

1084
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,750
How did you know…

1085
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,296
You'd always disappear
during lunch and dinner,

1086
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,548
so I tailed you for a few days.

1087
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,884
Right.

1088
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,303
Here, it's your present.

1089
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,766
I mean, you've never been
on a school picnic or trip,

1090
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,060
so you probably never had a chance
to eat gimbap.

1091
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,189
I wondered what I should get you
for your birthday,

1092
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,732
then thought of this.

1093
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,028
-For my birthday?
-Today's your birthday.

1094
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,990
And my birthday as well.

1095
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,842
Goodbye, Choi Kang-ho.

1096
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,719
Good luck.

1097
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,768
Why are you picking out the carrots?

1098
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,770
I don't like carrots.

1099
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,188
You do?

1100
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,984
Kang-ho doesn't like carrots. Noted.

1101
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,782
Wait, what?

1102
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,785
-Why don't you have some more?
-I'm done.

1103
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,454
You only had five pieces.
What do you mean?

1104
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,373
You should have some more.

1105
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,874
No, it's okay. I can't be full.

1106
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,168
Why not?

1107
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,797
I get sleepy when I'm full.

1108
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,632
If I'm sleepy, I can't study.

1109
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,759
If I don't study,
I can't become a prosecutor.

1110
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,720
That's nonsense.

1111
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,599
Right? It does sound like nonsense.

1112
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,229
Like our names, zodiac signs,
and blood types,

1113
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:30,733
I thought everyone was born
under a specific job.

1114
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,112
So when I saw kids
switching dreams every semester,

1115
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,156
-I thought they were ridiculous.
-Right.

1116
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,577
But it turns out,
I was the ridiculous one.

1117
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,498
If you don't like that,
it's not too late to do what you want.

1118
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,667
What I want?

1119
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,668
Yes.

1120
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,379
What is that?

1121
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:58,052
Come to think about it,
I've never thought about that.

1122
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,640
Kang-ho, you poor thing.

1123
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,896
That's the bell.
Let's go for our night study.

1124
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,814
Okay.

1125
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,822
What do we do?

1126
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,574
I think it's locked.

1127
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,368
Hello?

1128
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,329
-Hello?
-Hello?

1129
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,706
-Hello? Hey!
-Hello? -We're in here.

1130
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,665
Hey!

1131
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,542
Darn it.

1132
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,919
Hey! We're in here!

1133
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,255
Is anybody out there?

1134
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,590
Hello?

1135
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,966
Kang-ho.

1136
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,552
That's enough.

1137
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:45,183
URI HIGH SCHOOL

1138
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,236
FOOD FOR THE BRAIN

1139
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:18,049
WE'RE ALL JOU-RI FAMILY

1140
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,971
What on earth is going on?

1141
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,974
These kids never caused any trouble.
What's happening?

1142
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,185
Was he acting differently lately?

1143
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,937
No, not at all.

1144
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,021
Oh, right.

1145
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:36,109
Mi-joo took gimbap
when she left this morning.

1146
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,318
-Gimbap?
-Yes.

1147
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,029
Maybe they went
to hang out at Bongil Stream.

1148
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,907
Tomorrow is the midterm.
He wouldn't do that.

1149
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,450
The midterm is tomorrow?

1150
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,577
Good grief, that little brat.

1151
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,787
This is bad.

1152
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,581
It won't be good if high school kids
end up having a child.

1153
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,463
Hey! Watch what you say!

1154
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,342
She's quite unwell.
Please try to understand.

1155
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,468
I'm unwell?

1156
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,512
Sam-sik.

1157
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,889
-Sam-sik!
-Sam-sik, are you in?

1158
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:07,974
-Sam-sik!
-Sam-sik!

1159
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,809
-The lights turned on.
-The lights.

1160
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,686
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

1161
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:14,981
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1162
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,899
Why are you here at this ungodly hour?

1163
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,986
Kang-ho and Mi-joo are missing.

1164
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,612
Kang-ho's missing?

1165
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,990
Mi-joo too?

1166
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,284
Wait, Mi-joo was in there too?

1167
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,786
In there? Where?

1168
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,288
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

1169
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,206
-Mom, move.
-Sam-sik!

1170
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,875
-Sam-sik!
-Hey!

1171
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,960
Where are you going?
We came down that way!

1172
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:39,672
No!

1173
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,270
Do we have to stay here all night?

1174
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,648
Why do they make us
turn in our cell phones?

1175
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,735
Everyone must be freaking out now.

1176
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,198
I'm hungry. Do we have food?

1177
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,410
I found candy.

1178
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,788
-Kang-ho, I'll give you half.
-It's okay.

1179
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,164
I don't like candy.

1180
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,667
You dislike a lot of things.

1181
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,716
It's okay.

1182
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,885
I only need you to like me.

1183
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,428
Okay?

1184
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,641
Hey! Think about it.

1185
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,227
You're locked up in this place
with a girl.

1186
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,521
All you can do is study?

1187
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,736
What about me? Pay some attention to me.

1188
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,871
"Perhaps love is as such."

1189
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,790
Love?

1190
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:57,917
"Like a rainshower, it suffocates me…

1191
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,171
from the head and covers me."

1192
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,637
That rainshower is a simile.

1193
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,889
It might be on the exam tomorrow.

1194
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,064
Forget it.

1195
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:24,402
I'm going to lose weight, become pretty,
and marry into a good family.

1196
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:26,779
I can do it.

1197
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,782
All you do is study.

1198
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,076
Who cares if you get all As?

1199
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,370
You're an F when it comes to social cues.

1200
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,210
Hey, what's wrong?

1201
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,588
Are you choking on the candy?

1202
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,178
This isn't good. Come here.

1203
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,139
Spit it out on three.

1204
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,765
One, two, three.

1205
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,309
One, two, three.

1206
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,644
Again. One, two, three!

1207
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,687
Three! Again.

1208
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,855
One, two, three!

1209
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,996
You bastard!

1210
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,164
Goodness.

1211
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,165
Sam-sik.

1212
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,792
Why did you push him so hard?

1213
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,002
Are you all right?

1214
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,338
How long have you been here?

1215
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,548
Did you miss your supplementary class?

1216
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,223
KEY POINTS OF AT THE END OF CICADA'S CRY

1217
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,190
I'm sorry for causing trouble
at this hour.

1218
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,983
You.

1219
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,904
I was worried sick about you.

1220
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,615
Goodness, it's all right.

1221
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,283
It's fine. Nothing bad happened.

1222
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,620
They're both clothed. Nothing happened.

1223
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:02,833
Let's go.

1224
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,543
Go get your backpack.

1225
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,008
Let's go. We'll talk at home.

1226
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,387
I…

1227
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,973
She's so intense.

1228
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:21,852
How could she worry about
the supplementary class in this situation?

1229
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,313
Goodness, she's a great woman.

1230
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,775
But why is she so harsh to her son?

1231
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,569
That's why Kang-ho grew up so well.

1232
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,863
He's never caused any trouble,

1233
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:36,409
and he's the top student in the country.

1234
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,660
Shut up.

1235
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,745
Well, I guess it'll be great

1236
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:43,207
if he studies hard and goes into law.

1237
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,459
What's so good about that?

1238
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:50,339
To be frank, people here could live
an honest life even without the law.

1239
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,550
Not everyone.

1240
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,552
Sam-sik is an exception.

1241
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,970
-Gosh.
-What?

1242
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,392
You cursed woman!

1243
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,019
-You and your mouth!
-Come on.

1244
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,146
Let's go. It's late. Come with me.

1245
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,939
How could she say that?

1246
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,524
You darn punk.

1247
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,194
How could you lock up your friends?

1248
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,239
Do you want to get expelled from school?

1249
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,700
I don't care about school,

1250
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,661
but can you cut off my hands?

1251
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,872
What have I done?

1252
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,999
You darn punk.

1253
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:29,545
Are you trying to
disgrace your mother and father?

1254
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,594
You have exams tomorrow,
so I didn't make seaweed soup.

1255
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,805
I'll make it after the exams.

1256
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,848
I had

1257
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,018
gimbap earlier.

1258
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:51,901
All right.

1259
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,236
You'll be sleepy if you're full.

1260
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,114
Finish your studies and go to bed.

1261
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,333
2007 COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM

1262
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,501
DO WELL ON THE EXAM
CONQUER YOUR EXAM

1263
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,464
Don't be nervous.

1264
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,548
Do as you've always done.

1265
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,593
Read your questions thoroughly
and manage your time well.

1266
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,677
Right.

1267
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,096
Don't eat too much for lunch.

1268
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,181
You'll get sleepy
during the listening test.

1269
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,558
Okay.

1270
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,770
-Good luck!
-You'll do well!

1271
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:28,896
Kang-ho.

1272
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,023
-Kang-ho.
-Good luck!

1273
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,566
-Kang-ho, over here.
-Please move your car.

1274
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,069
-All right, I will.
-Good luck!

1275
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:38,197
-Good luck!
-Kang-ho!

1276
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,240
Kang-ho!

1277
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,326
You came? You're already admitted.

1278
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,454
I came to show support for my boyfriend.

1279
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,290
Oh, my. Did I just say boyfriend?

1280
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,375
How silly of me.

1281
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,628
Give me your hand.

1282
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,004
What?

1283
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,259
Stay still, okay?

1284
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,345
I read your horoscope today,

1285
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,974
and the lucky color is yellow
for the Year of the Dragon.

1286
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,601
So here.

1287
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,021
How pretty.

1288
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,773
There.

1289
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,775
I colored my nails too.

1290
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,194
And these.

1291
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,030
This is a fork so you can
pick the correct answers.

1292
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,160
And a roll of toilet paper.
You'll be on a roll.

1293
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,037
And this, a tambourine.

1294
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,455
Do well!

1295
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:29,957
Hey.

1296
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,959
And here's the highlight.

1297
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,920
Gimbap.

1298
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,339
After the exam,

1299
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,301
you're going to eat as much as you want.

1300
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:44,138
And you've never been to the movies
or to karaoke, so we're doing that too.

1301
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,765
You're allowed to do that today, right?

1302
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,559
-Yes.
-Good.

1303
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,356
I'll be praying for you
and I'll stick around until the end.

1304
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,150
Kang-ho, go get it!

1305
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,318
Go…

1306
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,486
-Go get it!
-Go get it!

1307
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,530
And this one too. Go now.

1308
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,409
Perfect score, Choi Kang-ho!

1309
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,205
I can't live without you!

1310
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,497
Perfect score…

1311
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,383
Mi-joo!

1312
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:24,970
Mi-joo!

1313
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:25,930
Excuse me.

1314
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,474
-What happened?
-Mi-joo.

1315
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:31,602
Mi-joo, are you okay?

1316
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,479
Mi-joo, wait… Mi-joo.

1317
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,272
Mi-joo, stay with me.

1318
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,273
Mi-joo!

1319
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,692
Mi-joo, stay with me.

1320
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,320
Finally, today is the day.

1321
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:43,280
Kang-ho

1322
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,660
has studied very hard until this day.

1323
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,827
HERE RESTS CHOI HAE-SIK

1324
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,496
You know it better than I do.

1325
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,833
Help him do well on the exam

1326
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:58,212
so the time he spent studying
won't be in vain.

1327
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,173
You have to help him, okay?

1328
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,561
Are you okay, Mi-joo?

1329
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,355
Why are you here?

1330
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,652
-What about the exam?
-You can't get up yet.

1331
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,028
The exam.

1332
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:25,864
So?

1333
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,162
I can't believe this.

1334
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,082
You're crazy.

1335
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:37,418
-No, Mi-joo.
-What about the exam?

1336
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,378
Mi-joo, it's okay.

1337
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,798
Mi-joo, it's all right.

1338
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,591
It's okay.

1339
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,553
I can take the exam next year.

1340
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,523
It's okay.

1341
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,447
-Get out.
-Mom.

1342
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,615
Do I have to pour pig poop on you?

1343
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,329
Were you the only one there?

1344
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:15,539
Are you her guardian?

1345
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,790
You didn't hit her.

1346
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,001
Why did you have to miss the exam?

1347
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,378
Do you not realize
how important today was?

1348
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,421
Mom.

1349
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,924
-Mi-joo got hurt.
-So what?

1350
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,720
-Did she die?
-Mom!

1351
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,641
Why should you ruin your life
because of her?

1352
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:35,809
Why?

1353
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,644
My life?

1354
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:39,688
Do I have a life?

1355
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,274
What?

1356
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,068
This is your life.

1357
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:48,322
I'm sick and tired of this.

1358
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,450
You're suffocating me to death!

1359
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:59,208
You made a decision over my life
and forced it on me.

1360
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:02,544
Is it my fault that Dad died like that?

1361
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:07,758
Yes.

1362
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,260
Exactly.

1363
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,055
Whose fault is it then?

1364
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:17,559
For what reason did your dad die?

1365
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,561
I need to know that!

1366
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,402
You're sick and tired of this?

1367
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,904
You want to run away?

1368
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,407
Then become a prosecutor.

1369
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,409
That's your only ticket out

1370
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,328
from this disgusting pigsty smell

1371
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,497
and your bad mother.

1372
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,297
You're right.

1373
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:49,716
You are

1374
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,635
a bad person.

1375
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:55,681
Why do I ruin my life
because of someone else?

1376
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,975
You taught me to live that way!

1377
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,228
You told me to become a powerful man

1378
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,398
and help those who are weak and in need!

1379
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,860
But no.

1380
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,903
You were just

1381
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,448
frustrated to live as the weak.

1382
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,409
You just wanted
to get that power through me.

1383
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:16,535
You…

1384
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,915
wanted to raise me into a selfish snob
just like those who killed Dad.

1385
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,586
Okay, fine.

1386
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,173
I'll do that.

1387
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:26,980
Kang-ho has a trial today.

1388
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:31,610
Please help him win again.

1389
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:33,529
Please.

1390
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,824
PROSECUTOR

1391
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,285
Prosecutor, request the sentencing.

1392
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:45,207
Jung Min-ho, the victim,
fell and passed away on December 22, 2020

1393
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:47,584
at the construction site
of Woobyeok Stay in Sua-dong

1394
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:51,129
due to the lack of scaffolding
of the exterior railing.

1395
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,633
He worked in the uppermost site,

1396
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,927
but there was
no safety equipment available,

1397
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,639
such as safety belts or nets,
which could have saved his life.

1398
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,768
Defendant Park Cheol-su,
the CEO of the subcontractor,

1399
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:06,311
ignored the constant request

1400
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,689
of Woobyeok Construction
for safety supervision

1401
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:13,735
and installation of safety nets
from the moment the construction began.

1402
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,909
Your Honor.

1403
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,371
The victim, Jung Min-ho,
sought a construction site

1404
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:28,166
to pay for his college
just before his school year began,

1405
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,502
but he passed at such a young age.

1406
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,672
Please consider this injustice

1407
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,551
and the seriousness of the crime
which the defendant has committed

1408
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,554
and sentence him to three years in prison.

1409
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,275
The defendant, Park Cheol-su,

1410
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,820
did not only cause damage
to the victim's assets,

1411
01:16:56,903 --> 01:17:01,241
but also irrevocable damage,
that is, the death of a laborer.

1412
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:02,784
Formal adjudication.

1413
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,662
The defendant is sentenced
to three years in prison.

1414
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:06,830
Prosecutor Choi.

1415
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:08,790
I have something to say.

1416
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,754
My husband was threatened.

1417
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,548
They pressured him with the schedule
as soon as they began.

1418
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,091
That's why the construction was rushed.

1419
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:22,262
He demanded more safety nets
and scaffoldings again and again,

1420
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:25,641
but Woobyeok Construction ignored him,
using the cost as an excuse.

1421
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,018
And when the accident happened,

1422
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,562
they pinned the blame on him.

1423
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,445
This is my husband's old phone.

1424
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:41,948
There's a recording of a call
he had with Woobyeok Construction.

1425
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:47,663
Why did you bring this important evidence
to me and not to your attorney?

1426
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,289
Because the attorney

1427
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,791
works for Woobyeok Construction.

1428
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,088
But you can help him.

1429
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:57,964
Please.

1430
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,592
Please help him.

1431
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,311
Thank you for plucking up
the courage to do this.

1432
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:12,646
I'll be in contact.

1433
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:14,523
Thank you.

1434
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:15,982
Thank you, Prosecutor Choi.

1435
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,068
Thank you.

1436
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,585
WOOBYEOK GROUP

1437
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:41,967
This is Choi Kang-ho.

1438
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,221
Things have become troublesome.

1439
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,828
There you are, Prosecutor Choi.

1440
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,707
Hello, Chairman Song.

1441
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:35,645
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1442
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,282
Do you want to be my son?

1443
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,285
Don't you have a father?

1444
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,163
How's our prosecutor doing?

1445
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,207
-Tell her I'm not home.
-Tell her you're not home?

1446
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,292
I won't apologize.

1447
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:01,671
Someone like you can never call me Father.

1448
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,633
It's more than just that.

1449
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,885
Her social status will change.

1450
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,056
This is a true home run.

1451
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,433
Isn't this what you wanted?

1452
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:19,564
