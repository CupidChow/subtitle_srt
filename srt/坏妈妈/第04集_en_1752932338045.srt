00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,310
-Goodbye, piggies.
-Goodness.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,320
You still feel sad every time
you send them away, don't you?

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,990
Of course, I do.

5
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,860
I lived with them and fed them
longer than my husband and kid.

6
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,740
Goodbye.

7
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,700
I'll take good care of your piglets.

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,250
Don't worry about a thing.

9
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,330
I'll get going then.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,330
-One second.
-Yes?

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,090
These potatoes are plump and delicious.
Eat them with your kids.

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,680
Goodness, you're always so kind.

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,720
By the way, how's your son doing?

14
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,990
-Ready or not!
-Ready or not!

15
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,070
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,700
-Shoot!
-Shoot!

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,830
All right! I won!

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,080
Okay!

19
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,220
Here we go!

20
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,770
Mom!

21
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,560
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,990
Are you done?

23
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,610
Yes, it's good as new.

24
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,360
-Goodness.
-It's perfect.

25
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,950
My gosh, you're such a crafty handyman.

26
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,540
Your family is skilled with your hands.

27
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,330
You know,

28
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,540
I'm feeling sort of offended to hear that.

29
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,510
Is it because I have a delinquent son?

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,380
Don't take things that far.

31
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,140
Anyway, I'm relieved that nobody got hurt.

32
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,600
-Yes.
-This could've been much worse.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,220
Push me.

34
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,390
-Here I go.
-It's smooth.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,980
-This is nice.
-Yes.

36
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,440
They said you'd love it

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
if I exercised.

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,570
Who did?

39
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,820
Goodness.

40
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,910
Goodness, Mommy's little boy
wanted to make her happy.

41
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,200
What a wonderful son.

42
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,080
Of course, he is.

43
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,750
And those clever twins
went after his weakness.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,170
Kids.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,260
How many times do I have to tell you
this is dangerous?

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,510
That's not a toy. That's his legs.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,850
That's not my legs. It's a wheelchair.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,650
Anyway, don't ever play
around with it again, okay?

49
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,940
It's not for muddy roads, icy roads,
bumpy stony paths, waterways,

50
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,440
rice paddy ridges, banks,

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,530
and especially anywhere up high.

52
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,740
Okay?

53
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,530
And it's not for
three people to ride, right?

54
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,820
Of course not!

55
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,910
See?

56
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,000
What about using the rubber
tube as a hula hoop?

57
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,460
What?

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,500
Kang-ho.

59
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,250
Goodness, Kang-ho…

60
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,540
Goodness. Hey!

61
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,210
You darned…

62
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,670
little twins!

63
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,340
You rascals!

64
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,590
-Goodness.
-Stop.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
Don't do that.

66
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,140
I already talked to them.

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,060
Why did you drag him out and bully him?

68
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,600
We didn't bully him!

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,810
We helped him exercise!

70
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,650
How are you going to help him do that?

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,110
Look at him!

72
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,230
And you can't treat him like that!

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,610
He's not your friend!

74
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,700
What? We weren't friends?

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,950
I thought we were friends.

76
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,280
You said you were seven!

77
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,450
I am!

78
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,160
The doctor said I'm seven!

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,410
Right, Mom?

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,390
Beans will grow from your tummy.

81
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,880
Thirty-five.

82
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,260
Repeat after me.

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,800
Thirty-five.

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
That's right.

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,180
Kang-ho, you're 35 years old.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,350
But you became a little ill.

87
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,730
So you became seven for a short while.

88
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,570
I know what that means.

89
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,570
What?

90
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm stupid, right?

91
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,490
No! Who said that?

92
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,240
-Who said that to you?
-You did!

93
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,200
What?

94
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,750
You and the doctor said that.

95
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,250
"Simply put, he is…

96
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,080
Simply put, he is…

97
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,330
Stupid?

98
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,710
…stupid."

99
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,470
No, Kang-ho.

100
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,640
I said that
because I didn't know any better.

101
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,770
So here's the thing.

102
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,350
Yes.

103
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,810
Kang-ho,

104
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,940
you went back to your childhood.

105
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,440
Everyone wants to be young again.

106
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,860
I do too. I want to go back too.

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,660
Because if I could,
I'd be able to change many things.

108
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,210
But nobody in this world
can turn back time.

109
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,380
Yet you did, Kang-ho.

110
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,460
This is

111
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,800
a chance given from above.

112
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,380
A chance to start all over again.

113
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,640
"A chance given from above"?

114
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,180
Yes, that's right.

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,810
So you should be happy.

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,940
Don't be sad or devastated.

117
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,030
Be happy.

118
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,740
-Happy?
-Yes.

119
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,820
Your return

120
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,780
makes me feel…

121
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,040
happy.

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,630
Happy.

123
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,300
That's right.

124
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,480
Hello.

125
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,690
Squid and mackerel are extra fresh today.

126
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,650
-What would you like?
-Well…

127
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,820
Are you Sun-young's mother?

128
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,370
-I…
-What is it?

129
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,660
Did that bitch
run off with your money too?

130
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,630
-Sorry?
-That crazy bitch!

131
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,630
I can't live like this!

132
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,920
Good grief!

133
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,720
She met this gigolo somewhere

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,060
and gave him every single penny she had.

135
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,480
Then she even took out a private loan
to pay back his gambling debt.

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Good grief.

137
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,020
She put up her home, salon,

138
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,240
and even her father's fishing boat
as collateral.

139
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,610
Goodness me.

140
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,030
That darned brat

141
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,700
never even called me once after that,

142
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,410
then texted me saying
she was going to Los Angeles

143
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,460
or whatever to make money.

144
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,830
Good grief.

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,710
All she left was that one message
before she disappeared.

146
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,340
-What do I do?
-I raised her wrong.

147
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,970
Who else is to blame?

148
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,100
You can just take me.

149
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,180
Just take me away!

150
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,100
No.

151
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,730
It must've been so tough for you.

152
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,320
You're much better than my daughter.

153
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,450
Just be my daughter!

154
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,950
Mom!

155
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,090
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WILL BE INITIATED
DUE TO LONG OVERDUE PAYMENTS.

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,470
LANDLADY

157
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,140
Hello, ma'am.

158
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,680
Are you really going to be like this?

159
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,350
I even gave you back
your deposit in advance.

160
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,440
Your rent payments have been long overdue.

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,400
I can't wait any longer.

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,150
I'm going to vacate the place
if you don't transfer the money by today.

163
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,440
Well, I…

164
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,170
SEO-JIN, YE-JIN
I MADE THIS BANKBOOK FOR YOU

165
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,380
I WANT TO LET YOU DO
EVERYTHING YOU WANT

166
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,630
YE-JIN, SEO-JIN
GIVE MOM THE POWER TO GO ON

167
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,290
Stay there.

168
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,120
A warm welcome
to Petit Nail, Sillim Branch!

169
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,000
How many years of experience do you have?

170
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,380
I got certified in school

171
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,470
and worked at the Ewha Branch
for three and a half years.

172
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,390
And I'm joining this branch
because I moved to Sillim-dong.

173
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,640
Welcome.

174
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,180
Your manager told us

175
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,140
you were popular among college girls
for your quick hands and nail arts.

176
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,850
I look forward to working with you.

177
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,140
Yes, I'll do my best.

178
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,770
-My gosh.
-It's here.

179
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,230
The raw fish here is delicious.

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
The owner catches the fish himself.

181
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,950
So this is caught in the wild?

182
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,450
Kang-ho?

183
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,120
No, not kelpfish. It's rockfish.

184
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,540
Wild rockfish.

185
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,120
A bottle of soju, please.

186
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,160
Mi-joo?

187
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,710
No, not Mi-joo. Soju.

188
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
Where have you been, you jerk?

189
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,620
I can't believe you've never called
after moving to Seoul.

190
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,540
I waited for so long.

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,710
Why didn't you call first?

192
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,710
I didn't have your number.

193
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,000
Your mom wouldn't tell me either.

194
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,250
You knew the school I was attending.

195
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,130
I wanted to look for you.

196
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,130
But I couldn't.

197
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,510
You ruined your exam because of me.

198
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,640
I couldn't ruin anything more.

199
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
Wait.

200
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,980
Did you give up on the bar exam?

201
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,690
I took the first test yesterday.

202
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,450
Isn't it a little too early to give up?

203
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,280
I see.

204
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,160
Then what are you doing here?

205
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,910
Working a part-time job.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,460
Shouldn't you be studying every second?

207
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,630
I'm doing this to survive.

208
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,710
I have to make a living too.

209
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,590
What do you mean?
Doesn't your mom help you?

210
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,390
I'm old enough to look after myself.

211
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,260
But every second counts for you.

212
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,350
If I fail the exam
because of a part-time job,

213
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,430
it means I'm just not good enough.

214
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,150
Don't worry.

215
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,400
It's a restaurant, so I get free food,

216
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,530
the lady here sometimes
helps with my laundry,

217
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,570
and on weekends, I get to go fishing too.

218
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,860
Above all,

219
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,030
I like looking at these fish.

220
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,120
What's great about staring at fish
that are about to die?

221
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,370
Exactly.

222
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,880
They might die any moment now,

223
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,380
but no matter how painful or scary it is,

224
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,670
they're unable to cry or scream.

225
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,640
I think judicial officers
must be like that.

226
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,470
You hated how your fate was decided
the moment you were born.

227
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,060
I guess you've changed your mind.

228
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,270
No.

229
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,770
Nothing's changed.

230
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,190
I still hate it,
and it's still a heavy burden.

231
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,740
But I hate this heavy burden so much that
I'll make sure I make it.

232
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,330
That's the revenge for my fate,
which was already decided

233
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,120
the moment I was born.

234
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,880
So, Mi-joo, how are you doing?
How's your job?

235
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,100
Things have never gone well for me,

236
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,310
and I never had a reason to be successful.

237
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,860
But from now, I'm going to do well.

238
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,530
I just found something I want to do.

239
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,950
You just focus on your studies.

240
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,620
You might be able to pass it
with the top score if you don't work.

241
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,620
Let me invest in you.

242
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,910
I don't have much right now,
so I'll start with myself.

243
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,290
Let me help you get your revenge.

244
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,760
Thank you for everything.

245
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,470
We never had any kids,

246
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,020
so you were like a son to us.

247
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,180
This is so sad.

248
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,730
Don't be so sad.

249
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,810
He'll study hard
and become a judicial officer.

250
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Come and visit me

251
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,490
when you need to blow off steam.

252
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,530
I'll give you a ride.

253
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,490
Yes, I'll do that. Thank you.

254
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,240
Future judicial officer, Kang-ho!

255
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,240
You got this!

256
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,170
Did you talk to them?

257
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,750
Yes, it went well.

258
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,250
-Wait, they'll see us.
-What?

259
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,800
Wait for me!

260
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,110
Focus!

261
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,820
Mi-joo.

262
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,500
Kang-ho, I'll wash these too.

263
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,380
-No! It's okay.
-Let me.

264
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,590
-No!
-There's another one.

265
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,680
PETIT NAIL

266
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,590
Mi-joo.

267
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,550
Yes?

268
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,600
YOU HAVE PASSED THE 1ST TEST

269
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,440
Really?

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,190
My gosh!

271
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,570
BAR EXAM MEAL

272
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,870
Hey. What is that?

273
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
YOU HAVE PASSED THE 2ND TEST

274
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,580
Really?

275
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,920
Gosh, look at those two.

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,750
-Oh, my.
-My gosh.

277
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,050
Don't forget your bar exam meal.

278
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,340
-Bye.
-Okay.

279
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,640
-Have a great day.
-Okay!

280
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,140
That looks good.

281
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,280
BAR EXAM MEAL REVIEW
FOUR STARS

282
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,620
THIS PLACE IS GREAT!
ONE LESS STAR FOR ONLY ONE KISS

283
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,670
YOU HAVE PASSED THE BAR EXAM

284
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,230
You know what?

285
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,730
You saved me twice already.

286
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,900
Once when I choked on candy,

287
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
and…

288
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,160
when I got into a motorcycle accident.

289
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,620
If you save me one more time,

290
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,920
then I'll let you marry me.

291
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,170
-That's weird.
-What?

292
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,220
Why am I punished
for doing something nice?

293
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,850
Punished?

294
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,810
-Come here. What did you say?
-I was joking.

295
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,890
-I'll teach you a lesson!
-No, it was a joke.

296
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
-Okay?
-It was a joke.

297
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,520
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

298
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,150
You should be grateful

299
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,240
to someone who makes you want to live,

300
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,990
not someone who saved you.

301
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,750
I want to live

302
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,500
a very long time with you.

303
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,460
All right.

304
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,670
I got him.

305
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,930
Okay, you're all set.

306
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,850
I'm sorry for the trouble every time.

307
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm sorry for the trouble every time.

308
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,770
Goodness, do you feel bad?

309
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,570
Then get well soon.

310
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,030
That'll comfort your mom,
you, and all of us.

311
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,240
It's a relief he can go back and forth
instead of staying at the rehab center.

312
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,120
-He's much better, right?
-Yes.

313
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,870
-Here.
-Goodness.

314
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,910
You like abalone porridge, so I made some.

315
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,710
I also packed water kimchi,

316
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,170
so have a bite while he exercises.

317
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
Don't skip your meals.

318
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,590
You didn't have to.

319
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,420
You didn't have to.

320
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,550
You feel sick in your stomach
because of stress.

321
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,800
You have so much to look after every day.

322
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,600
And you always eat in a hurry
in the kitchen.

323
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,520
That's why you feel sick!

324
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,520
She's right.

325
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,850
Kang-ho has gotten much better now,

326
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,770
so you need to relax a little.

327
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,610
You need to relax a little.

328
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,650
-See you later.
-Okay, go on.

329
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,530
Wait!

330
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,570
-Oh, my.
-Wait!

331
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,740
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

332
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,790
Wait.

333
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,290
I was worried that
you might have left already.

334
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,750
Kang-ho, give me your hand.

335
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,750
Here.

336
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,540
Goodness, what's that for?

337
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,720
You'll find a homemade
snack store for pets

338
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,470
near the back exit of the hospital.

339
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,430
Can you pick up an Alaskan salmon tart,

340
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,430
ricotta cheese cookies,
and oatmeal dog chews?

341
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,640
-Please get me--
-I knew it.

342
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,020
Go.

343
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,150
Mom, go.

344
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,230
Go on.

345
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320
Go!

346
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,780
Go.

347
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,110
Just go.

348
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,030
Go!

349
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,240
That's it.

350
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,370
Next, left foot.

351
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,090
Two more steps. One, two, three.

352
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,510
That's it.

353
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,840
Good.

354
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,550
One more time.

355
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,430
Last one.

356
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,010
-Excuse me.
-Last one.

357
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,470
Excuse me.

358
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,690
Where can I get some digestive medicine?

359
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,230
-Please follow me.
-Okay.

360
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,730
PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

361
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,280
-Bye, Kang-ho.
-Goodbye.

362
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
Get some rest.

363
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Mom?

364
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,170
Mom.

365
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,510
Mom.

366
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,260
Mom!

367
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,270
Mom…

368
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,270
Mom.

369
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,650
Mom.

370
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,310
Mom.

371
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,070
Mom!

372
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,030
Kang-ho.

373
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,530
-Mom!
-Kang-ho.

374
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,240
Mom!

375
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,910
-What's wrong?
-Mom!

376
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,410
Kang-ho, look at me.

377
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,790
-Mom!
-Look at me!

378
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,500
Look at me!

379
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,000
When you don't see me,

380
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,670
where did I say you could find me?

381
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,340
Pig farm.

382
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,840
Potato field.

383
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,380
And?

384
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,720
Bathroom.

385
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,800
Kitchen.

386
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,140
And? If you don't see me there?

387
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,730
I should call you.

388
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,690
You're right.

389
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,110
I will

390
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,360
never go anywhere without you, okay?

391
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,950
-Never.
-Okay.

392
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,280
Okay?

393
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,080
The results of the presidential
preference poll this month showed

394
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,540
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
as the leading candidate by 42.5%.

395
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,500
-Yes.
-This shows

396
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,470
many people are showing
their support for your candidacy.

397
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,340
If you do declare your candidacy,

398
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,800
is there a pledge you'd like to make?

399
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,310
If I run for the presidential election,

400
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,890
I will only abide by one principle.

401
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,730
"Come empty, return empty."

402
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,230
I, Oh Tae-soo, will come empty-handed…

403
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,400
ENCOUNTERING A NEW ERA, A NEW PERSON

404
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,860
…and leave empty-handed.

405
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,530
I see.

406
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,570
That was Assemblyman Oh's principle
when it comes to politics.

407
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,910
If he declares candidacy, that is.

408
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,250
Let's look forward to seeing
the rise of a new political leader.

409
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,630
This time, I'd like to ask
a casual question.

410
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,710
Who gives you
the most strength when you need…

411
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,760
What did you just say?

412
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,970
You want the money back?

413
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,560
The term was for him to leave Korea
right after the accident.

414
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,390
But Mr. Yang Gu-man
suddenly took his own life,

415
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,310
which led to a police investigation

416
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,520
and ended up putting us in danger.

417
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,570
This is a breach of contract.

418
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,450
I already know the hit-and-run accident
and suicide were in the contract.

419
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,570
As soon as I received
a huge amount of money in the bank,

420
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,580
I got a call about my husband's death.

421
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,910
And the day after that,
I received his suicide note.

422
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,250
It was all written there.

423
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,460
Where he got the money,
who made him do it,

424
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,090
and why he had to take his own life.

425
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,420
Where is

426
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,800
Mr. Yang's suicide note?

427
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,890
If you lay a finger on me or my child,

428
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,560
that note will be sent to the police.

429
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,390
I must save myself too.

430
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,730
All right.

431
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,200
Would you like to continue watching?

432
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,740
It took me a lot of effort

433
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,160
to find all these.

434
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,250
Do you know that?

435
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,330
Apparently, at the time of the accident,

436
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,130
Kang-ho was asleep in the car.

437
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,550
How does that make any sense?

438
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,420
He had just cut ties with his mother,

439
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,090
but managed to sleep peacefully afterward?

440
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,890
Does this mean
Kang-ho is the worst bastard in history?

441
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,640
Or did someone slip him

442
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,810
sleeping pills or something?

443
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,310
Oh, right.

444
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,230
The day before the accident, your daughter

445
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,030
got a prescription for sleeping pills.

446
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,110
Mr. Song!

447
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,620
Right, I enjoyed your show.

448
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,330
You were eloquent.

449
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,160
"I will come empty-handed
and leave empty-handed."

450
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,870
How wonderful.

451
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,960
Who would watch that and imagine that

452
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,710
you had your future son-in-law murdered?

453
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,610
Do you remember

454
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,610
Choi Hae-sik?

455
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,610
Choi… Who?

456
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,070
Back in 1987,

457
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,570
during the urban improvement,

458
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,580
the man who was running
a pig farm in Bongu-dong.

459
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,330
That Choi Hae-sik.

460
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,210
Goodness, I don't even remember
someone I met yesterday.

461
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,500
A man from 30 years ago?
Anyway, what about him?

462
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,760
Do you know how my daughter
came to meet Choi Kang-ho?

463
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,510
My daughter was arrested by him

464
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,640
for carrying illegal drugs.

465
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,680
It was odd, so I checked.

466
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,640
But they didn't receive
any order or report

467
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,390
regarding illegal drugs.

468
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,350
That's right.

469
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,560
He approached her on purpose.

470
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,530
I'm sure

471
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,570
it was to use my daughter

472
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,160
to eventually approach me.

473
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,080
Choi Kang-ho already knew everything.

474
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,290
He knew who killed his father

475
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,920
thirty years ago.

476
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,050
Who killed his father?

477
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,340
He's Choi Hae-sik's son.

478
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,720
Choi Kang-ho.

479
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Exactly.

480
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,890
Who killed Choi Kang-ho's father,
Choi Hae-sik?

481
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,150
Did you kill him?

482
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,900
You did.

483
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,900
Oh, my.

484
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,990
Did I kill him?

485
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,030
Really?

486
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,660
I didn't know
because there was no evidence.

487
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,160
But isn't this odd?

488
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,290
A kid who wanted to
take revenge on his father's killer

489
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,920
came to work for me without hiding that
he is Choi Hae-sik's son?

490
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,460
That's crazy.

491
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,670
Are you saying

492
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,510
you already knew who Choi Kang-ho was?

493
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,640
Look, Mr. Oh.

494
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,770
Do you really think

495
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,730
I wouldn't have checked
before I took him in

496
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,100
to do the dirtiest of jobs for me?

497
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,860
She said she'd give me drugs,
but it was a lie!

498
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,280
So…

499
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,620
I killed her.

500
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,340
No, Chairman Song.

501
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,260
I didn't hear anything.
Please, sir. Don't kill me!

502
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,840
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant and owner
of a street tteokbokki stall,

503
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,510
went to an alley nearby
to return a lipstick

504
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,970
Woo Mi-jeong had left behind,

505
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,100
where he found her dead.

506
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,520
The defendant checked to see
if she was conscious,

507
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,690
then a passerby saw it and made a report.

508
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,110
He was soon arrested on the scene
by nearby officers.

509
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,860
LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY PERMIT
JIN YOUNG-SOON, CHOI HAE-SIK

510
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,280
This is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho,
who took charge of the trial.

511
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,330
It's a pleasure.

512
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,120
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho

513
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,830
with the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

514
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,460
Your grandson's name will not be mentioned
during the course of this trial.

515
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,260
Prosecutor Choi
will ensure discretion throughout it.

516
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,900
I'm really curious

517
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,190
about your parents who brought you up
to be such a promising prosecutor.

518
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,780
What are your parents like?

519
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,450
So,

520
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,830
what does your father do?

521
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,330
He passed away.

522
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,870
Goodness.

523
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,330
I shouldn't have asked.

524
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,090
It's all right.

526
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,550
He passed away before I was born.

527
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,590
I don't have any memories of him.

528
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,970
He passed away…

529
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,220
even before you were born?

530
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,680
He must have passed away
at a very young age.

531
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,850
What happened?

532
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,360
I heard he took his own life.

533
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Suicide?

534
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,690
Why did he do that?

535
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,200
His farm went under after a fire,

536
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,530
and he was apparently
under a lot of stress.

537
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,910
I don't know anything more.

538
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,120
Well…

539
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,460
To be frank, I don't want to know.

540
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
To me, my father

541
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,720
is just an irresponsible man

542
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,260
who abandoned his wife and unborn child.

543
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,350
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

544
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,190
Have a drink with me.

545
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,700
Prosecutor Choi, let me ask you something.

546
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,200
What's the reason?

547
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,830
-Sorry?
-This trial, I mean.

548
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,040
Are you after money or power?

549
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,340
If I want it,

550
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,880
can you give it to me?

551
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,590
You just saved my grandson.

552
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,140
So why not?

553
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,940
In that case, both.

554
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,810
Man.

555
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,020
You're a man, aren't you?

556
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,110
Mr. So.

557
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,070
Go on.

558
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,420
In return, from now on,

559
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,420
you'll be a part of my family.

560
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,630
Thank you.

561
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,590
Thank you.

562
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,640
Thank you very much.

563
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,680
That's enough.

564
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,270
I'll do my best, Mr. Song. Thank you!

565
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,730
I don't care what Kang-ho had on his mind

566
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,270
when he approached me.

567
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,070
I don't care if it's ambition or wrath.

568
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,660
Because his hands are now also dirty.

569
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,530
All I want to do is use his talent

570
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,460
and then I'll abandon him.

571
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,090
Goodness, Mr. Son.

572
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,930
What on earth are you doing?
It's been an hour.

573
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,100
It's because my breathing rhythm is off.

574
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,060
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,940
This time, I'll really insert it.

576
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,500
Damn it.

577
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,210
Even fish don't breathe like that.

578
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,420
Mr. Son.

579
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,510
Are you really a licensed doctor?

580
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,220
I'm getting a bit anxious.

581
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,640
Goodness.

582
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,180
-Oh, my! What are you doing?
-Kang-ho.

583
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,680
My mom feels anxious.

584
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,560
No, Kang-ho.
That's dangerous. Give it to me.

585
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,730
Are you really licensed?

586
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,610
I really am! What's with you?

587
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,570
Honey, tell him.

588
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,570
He is.

589
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,030
He would never forge a license.

590
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,280
Although he has forged
his resident registration card before.

591
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,330
-What?
-What?

592
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,080
I did it because I love you!

593
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,710
I thought that was how I could have you!

594
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,840
You're my woman!

595
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,420
I thought you might not like me
because of our age gap.

596
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,470
Oh, my. Is that really why?

597
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,260
Did you want me that badly?

598
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,310
Good grief.

599
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,770
How is that relevant right now?

600
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,600
He'll bleed if you stab him.

601
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,820
That'll make me sad.
Do you want me to be sad?

602
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,530
Good boy.

603
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,240
-Good boy.
-Good, Kang-ho.

604
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,450
-Good boy.
-You must've been startled.

605
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,660
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

606
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,290
No, it's fine.

607
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,670
You can feel that way
if he doesn't seem very trustworthy.

608
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,630
By any chance, do you know

609
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,890
a man named Choi Mun-sik,
who owns a carp farm in Negi-ri?

610
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,270
Hello?

611
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,650
The realtor?

612
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,770
Yes, one second.

613
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,900
Was it Choi Mun-sik?

614
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,860
-Isn't it Yoo Mun-sik?
-Not Lee?

615
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,360
No, he's Choi Mun-sik.

616
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,280
Yes, that huge carp farm in Negi-ri.
Of course, I know.

617
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,830
I've heard of him too.

618
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
We know. Go on.

619
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,330
What's with him?

620
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,210
Mr. Son, go on and talk.

621
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,130
Go on and talk, Mr. Son.

622
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Mr. Son…

623
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,300
What's with him?

624
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,390
So that Choi Mun-sik--

625
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,350
I have to go to Seoul tomorrow.

626
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,930
Seoul? What for?

627
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,270
I'm sorry I keep asking you guys
for favors like this.

628
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,070
Don't say that. We're neighbors.

629
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,400
Don't worry.

630
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,200
We'll give the pigs their meals
and Kang-ho his feed…

631
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,460
We'll make sure Kang-ho has his meal
and the pigs their feed.

632
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,120
Don't worry about a thing.

633
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,710
Okay. Andrea's got the farm covered,

634
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,460
so please just look after Kang-ho.

635
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,050
I'll get going then.

636
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,430
Right.

637
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,510
Kang-ho, I'll come back soon

638
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,930
after I get your stuff.

639
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,020
I'll go with you and come back with you.

640
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,440
Kang-ho.

641
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,060
I told you, didn't I?

642
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,570
The place is really dusty
because people are moving things.

643
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,150
If dust gets into your body,
you'll get sick.

644
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,870
And that'll make me really sad.

645
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,950
Do you want me to be sad?

646
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,540
No.

647
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,420
How soon will you come back?

648
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Around five o'clock.

649
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,630
-Five o'clock.
-Yes.

650
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,010
So be good and do as they say, okay?

651
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,890
Make sure you study and exercise.

652
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,600
-Okay.
-Good.

653
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,440
WE'RE ALL JOU-RI FAMILY

654
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,040
I told you, didn't I?

655
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,250
I told you he'd be doing something stupid.

656
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,500
Why are you here?

657
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,590
I heard Ms. Jin
is coming back at five o'clock.

658
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,510
Yes.

659
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,130
So what time is five o'clock?

660
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,260
We're only seven,
so we can't read the clock,

661
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:38,430
but I do know that we have
a lot of time to play with him.

662
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

663
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,520
No, I can't play today.

664
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,690
I have to study and exercise.

665
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,440
Study? We'll help you.

666
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,110
Exercise?

667
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,610
You know we're experts at that.

668
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,700
-Let's play!
-No! I can't!

669
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,040
-Let's play!
-No! I can't play right now!

670
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,450
No!

671
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,580
No!

672
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,230
I left everything as is
because I thought you would return soon.

673
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,070
But the realtor called and said
your lease has expired.

674
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,660
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

675
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,240
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

676
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,290
I've always wanted to visit this place.

677
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,710
And I'm finally here.

678
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,600
Are you taking this painting?

679
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,350
This is…

680
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,730
-Sure.
-Okay.

681
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,000
He had some things here too.

682
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,300
MY SON, JUNG JONG-GU, IS INNOCENT!

683
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,340
I DENOUNCE PROSECUTOR CHOI KANG-HO!

684
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,260
He doesn't have a lot here.

685
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:45,020
I put his personal belongings in here.

686
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,230
And… Right.

687
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,230
That plant pot is his too.

688
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,490
It looks dead, so you can leave it.
We'll throw it out.

689
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:54,650
No.

690
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,200
It's not dead.

691
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,120
The stem looks perfectly fine.

692
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,290
I'll take it.

693
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,040
Why didn't anyone water this?

694
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,420
You can't go in there.
Ma'am, please leave.

695
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,460
Please.

696
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,880
Where's Choi Kang-ho? Where is he?

697
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,880
Woobyeok Group bought him off, right?

698
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,930
That's why the case was acquitted!

699
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,390
My daughter is the evidence!

700
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,100
So how is it that the case is dismissed
for lack of evidence?

701
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,810
Ma'am, you can't do this here!

702
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,730
If you don't stop, we'll arrest you
for obstruction of justice.

703
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,850
Come on.

704
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,400
Where is Choi Kang-ho?

705
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,690
Please leave.

706
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,690
Where is he?

707
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,820
Please leave.

708
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,030
What was that woman talking about?

709
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,870
MY SON, JUNG JONG-GU, IS INNOCENT!

710
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,620
I DENOUNCE PROSECUTOR CHOI KANG-HO!

711
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,050
Excuse me.

712
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,760
Why are you doing this?

713
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,640
What did my son do so wrong
for you to do this here?

714
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,520
Are you Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho's mother?

715
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,400
Yes, I'm his mother.

716
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,690
If you feel something is unfair,

717
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,610
you should go through the legal process
and get a retrial.

718
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,900
Why on earth are you
condemning my son so harshly?

719
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,620
What's wrong with you? Give it back!

720
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,200
Give it back!

721
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,460
My son

722
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,960
has a physical disability.

723
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,510
He couldn't even hurt a fly.

724
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,970
Your son knew that,
but he took a bribe from a rich man

725
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,430
and turned my son into a murderer.

726
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,440
When my husband asked to hear him out,

727
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,310
he said such harsh things
and made him collapse.

728
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,900
Your son is such a horrible person.

729
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,400
Why did you give birth to such scum?

730
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,450
Darn it!

731
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,860
I will make your son pay for it!

732
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,450
I may forget to eat,

733
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,330
but I will not forget to pray that

734
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,670
your son gets punished and dies!

735
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,420
You got that?

736
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,510
Why should my son get punished?

737
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,720
Your son should be punished for his crime.

738
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,840
He was bribed?

739
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,600
Why would he? What more could he want?

740
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,430
Did you see him take it?

741
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,190
If you say anything of this sort again,

742
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,070
I will make you pay for it.

743
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,150
Understand?

744
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,110
All right.

745
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,990
Kill me.

746
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,200
Just kill me.

747
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,490
Kill me!

748
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,410
My poor son…

749
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,290
Now, the next one is a science question.

750
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,160
This insect lives in a flower.

751
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,290
Butterfly.

752
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,330
Wrong.

753
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,710
-Bee.
-Wrong.

754
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,630
What?

755
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,760
Silverfish, cabbage caterpillars,
fleas, and aphids.

756
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,300
Correct!

757
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,550
I was actually talking
about napa cabbage flowers.

758
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,430
Okay, ten points to Lee Seo-jin.

759
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,390
Hey, Ye-jin, that's not right.

760
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,940
He mentioned four.
That means he gets forty points.

761
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,360
Okay. He can get 40 points.

762
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,950
That could've been bad, right?

763
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,320
Right, sure.

764
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,370
Okay, the next one is a math question.

765
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,410
Seo-jin had five apples.

766
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,210
But Ye-jin stole three. How many are left?

767
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,540
Kang-ho was faster.

768
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,380
Simple larceny shall be punished
for up to six years

769
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,930
or by a fine under ten million won
under Article 329 of the Criminal Act.

770
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,680
What's simple larceny?

771
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,270
What?

772
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,690
What's simple larceny?

773
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,820
Catch it!

774
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,820
Oh, no. She's mad.

775
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,240
You should have caught it.

776
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,080
My mom sent it to us from the US.

777
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,000
You almost lost it!

778
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,590
-The US?
-Yes, the US.

779
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,500
Look.

780
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,750
It's written in English.

781
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,550
"From the US."

782
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,880
Sorry.

783
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,800
Anyway, I'll get really mad
if you miss the ball again.

784
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,760
-Okay.
-All right.

785
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,930
Play ball!

786
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,110
Strike!

787
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,190
Hey, Ye-jin.

788
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,440
-That's a strike?
-Yes.

789
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,740
You're really good at baseball.

790
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,490
Did your dad teach you?

791
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,450
Don't ever mention my dad again,

792
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,080
especially before my grandma.

793
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,920
Why not?

794
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,830
This is a huge secret.

795
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,500
Actually, my dad is…

796
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,050
What? Your dad is a horrifying bastard?

797
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,470
I'm sure of it.

798
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,230
My grandma said that countless times.

799
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,810
But what's a horrifying bastard?

800
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,240
Tell him.

801
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,820
Do you know what horrifying means?

802
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,580
It means scary in other words.

803
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,500
So it means our dad
is someone who's really scary.

804
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,380
-I see.
-He's so scary that

805
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,840
my grandma shudders

806
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,760
whenever she mentions him.

807
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,680
I even saw her eyes turn white.

808
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,470
He must be really scary.

809
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,850
So you better behave.

810
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,690
If you don't, we'll tell on you

811
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,850
to our horrible bastard dad!

812
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,650
Understood?

813
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,610
Yes, ma'am.

814
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,690
Come on. You don't have to be so polite.

815
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,360
Okay.

816
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,320
All right, let's get back to baseball.

817
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,620
All right.

818
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,710
No!

819
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,970
-All safe?
-Yes, I'm fine.

820
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,680
I'm talking about the ball!

821
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,020
Is my bouncy ball safe?

822
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,940
No way.

823
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,770
Choi Kang-ho!

824
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,530
How dare you lose my bouncy ball?

825
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,030
My…

826
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,820
My dad

827
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,700
will come and teach you a lesson!

828
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,870
Ye-jin, wait!

829
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,000
Seo-jin!

830
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,130
Kang-ho would never do
something like that.

831
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,550
Things like that happen from time to time
when a trial doesn't go well.

832
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,670
Don't worry about it.

833
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,760
No.

834
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,490
Goodness.

835
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Are you all right?

836
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,030
Of course not. How can I be fine?

837
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,460
What are you doing?

838
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,420
Lady, what do you think?

839
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,540
I'm taking a photo of the assailant.

840
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,250
What do you mean?

841
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,590
Look how much damage
your beat-up truck caused

842
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,010
to my expensive foreign car.

843
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,390
You hit me from the back.

844
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,890
I don't want to hear it.

845
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,180
I'll settle for 50 million won.

846
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,940
If anything, I should be saying that!

847
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,560
Forget it. I'll call the police.

848
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,110
The police? Listen, lady.

849
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,320
Do you really want to go to prison?

850
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
Why would I go to prison?

851
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,910
You should keep
a safe distance when you drive!

852
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,320
Safe distance, my foot.

853
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,290
If you can't drive, you should
just cook for your kids at home

854
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:28,790
and just online shop
with your husband's money.

855
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,380
Why the heck do these women
have to drive on the road

856
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,260
and get in the way of a great man?

857
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,510
I don't have a husband who makes money,

858
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,680
but I still need to feed my kid.

859
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,980
So I drive this smelly truck

860
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,440
-to make money--
-Oh, I see.

861
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,270
So you don't have a husband.

862
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,190
Lady.

863
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,030
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

864
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,570
The way you talk back to me

865
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,040
shows just how tough your life must be.

866
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,580
My gosh.

867
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,120
How could you be so brazen and yell at me?

868
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,830
I can't believe this.

869
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,210
Goodness.

870
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,960
Goodness, look at you.

871
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,140
I told her she didn't have to
worry about a thing.

872
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,640
But look at him now. What do I do?

873
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,430
Goodness.

874
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,690
Darn it!

875
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,810
Those darned twins.

876
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,650
My gosh.

877
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,530
Goodness.

878
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,650
Wait.

879
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,780
Shouldn't he

880
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,410
wash his lower body too?

881
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,040
Right.

882
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,040
Just strip him naked and wash him.

883
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,540
Just pretend he's a seven-year-old.

884
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,300
But still, his body
isn't that of a seven-year-old.

885
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,720
Then what do we do?
Do we just leave him covered up in mud?

886
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,010
Then you do it. Think of him as Sam-sik.

887
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,850
Why would I bathe that damned kid?

888
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,190
Then I'll do it.

889
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,810
I bathe my husband too.

890
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,360
-Oh, my.
-Sparkling clean.

891
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,240
He gets sulky and refuses to eat

892
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,990
if I don't bathe him.

893
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,620
He's such a whiny baby.

894
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,660
All right. Here we go.

895
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,700
Oh, my.

896
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,580
-It's all right. I'll be gentle.
-Well…

897
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,170
-Hey, she's back.
-Mom!

898
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,500
Mom!

899
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,510
Mom!

900
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,620
Mom.

901
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,910
May I go out for a moment?

902
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,170
I lost Ye-jin's bouncy ball
while we were playing.

903
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,510
No.

904
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,300
We weren't playing.

905
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,760
We were exercising.

906
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,260
I studied too, Mom.

907
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,470
Silverfish, cabbage caterpillars, fleas,

908
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,770
and aphids live in a flower.

909
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,270
This flower is actually
a napa cabbage flower.

910
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,940
But I didn't know that.

911
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,950
I have to find that bouncy ball.

912
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,370
She's going to tell her dad.

913
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:53,500
And their dad is a horrifying bastard,
so he's really scary.

914
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,080
Mom, please, just once.

915
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,460
It'll only be a moment. I'll be quick.

916
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,960
Right, why don't we go together?

917
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,800
Why did you live like that?

918
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,510
Why did you live like that?

919
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,100
What's all this?

920
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,430
Did you take money and bribes
and do bad things?

921
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,520
No, right? Say you didn't.

922
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,360
Say you didn't!

923
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,730
Say you didn't!

924
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,450
You brought tears and pain

925
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,990
into other people's lives!

926
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,910
Did you think you'd live a good life?

927
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,910
Did you think you'd be fine?

928
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,460
Look.

929
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,540
Look how you've been punished
for what you've done!

930
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:42,920
Look!

931
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,220
Look, you punk.

932
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,310
It's all my fault.

933
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,190
I told you to help those in need.

934
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,200
I told you to save
those who have been wronged.

935
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,450
But I ended up raising you like this.

936
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,460
I locked you up in a pigsty
and didn't even let you breathe,

937
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,630
telling you to only study!

938
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,470
I wanted to make you rich and powerful,

939
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:38,350
but instead, I made you
into a cold-hearted monster!

940
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,610
It's my fault.

941
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,070
-It's my fault!
-Mom.

942
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,910
Mom.

943
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,490
Mom, I'm sorry.

944
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,040
Mom, I was wrong. I won't do that again.

945
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,170
Mom…

946
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:07,510
But I really don't remember, Mom.

947
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:14,720
Am I a bad person, Mom?

948
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,970
Is that why I was punished?

949
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,140
Was this a punishment from above

950
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,060
and not a chance?

951
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,980
No.

952
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,070
No.

953
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,030
No.

954
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Mom.

955
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,200
Mom, I'm sorry.

956
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:39,830
No.

957
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,330
No.

958
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:53,930
All done.

959
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,140
Come over here.

960
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,260
It stinks.

961
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,810
You're right.

962
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,270
That's why you hated this place so much.

963
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,490
And I also didn't want to bring you

964
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,780
to such a smelly, dirty place.

965
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,530
But…

966
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,870
there's something
I really want to show you now.

967
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:35,300
There are two animals
that are useful from their head to toe.

968
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,350
Do you know what they are?

969
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,430
Humans…

970
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,770
and pigs.

971
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,520
Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,

972
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,020
but that's not the case.

973
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,110
They not only
do their business in one place,

974
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,820
but they also only sleep where it's clean.

975
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,870
They bathe often in mud to cool themselves

976
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,830
and get rid of bugs.

977
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,540
But humans

978
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,250
started to lock them up in tiny pigsties.

979
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,840
The pigs couldn't bathe in mud anymore,

980
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,260
so they began to rub their bodies
on their own excrement.

981
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,970
That's how they grew dirtier
and more aggressive.

982
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,390
Isn't that so sad?

983
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,610
It is.

984
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,900
However, what's really sad is this.

985
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Pigs are unable to lift their heads,

986
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,610
so they live their entire life
staring at the ground.

987
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,200
There is only one way for a pig
to look up at the sky.

988
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,620
It's…

989
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,880
to fall down.

990
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,000
Fall down?

991
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:52,920
Yes.

992
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,260
That's right.

993
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,840
Falling down

994
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,300
is a way for you to see another world,
a world you have never seen before,

995
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:02,970
both for pigs

996
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,180
and people.

997
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,990
We have fallen over right now.

998
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,820
Both Mom and you, Kang-ho.

999
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,120
That's how we got to see this new world.

1000
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,540
A world we've never seen
and we couldn't see before.

1001
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,710
A precious world

1002
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,750
that we were meant to see.

1003
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,680
A precious world.

1004
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,400
I'm sorry.

1005
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,860
-Hello?
-Hey!

1006
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,860
Where are you?

1007
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,820
When will you pay me back…

1008
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,830
I'm sorry. Goodness.

1009
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,790
Is this it?

1010
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,880
-I'm sure of it.
-It's here.

1011
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,090
Excuse me.

1012
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,050
Lee Mi-joo is here, right? Where is she?

1013
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,800
-Where's Lee Mi-joo?
-What are you doing?

1014
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
Are you the owner?

1015
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,600
-Yes. What's the matter?
-Where's Lee Mi-joo?

1016
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,600
That bitch ran off
with our membership fees.

1017
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,890
And that bitch Baek Sun-young
took two million won from me!

1018
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,020
She's not here, so please leave.

1019
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,650
-Leave.
-Call the police!

1020
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,190
-Look around!
-Okay.

1021
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,610
-Stop this.
-I'm not leaving!

1022
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:37,900
-Start looking!
-Stop it!

1023
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,320
-Stop it!
-Move aside!

1024
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,820
-Move!
-Hey!

1025
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:42,530
There she is.

1026
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:43,740
It's her.

1027
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,450
Please give me some more time.

1028
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,990
I'll pay you back soon.

1029
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,710
So Mi-joo, are you drinking soju?

1030
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,210
It's too early to be drinking.

1031
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,050
You must not know.

1032
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,130
Soju tastes best after you get fired.

1033
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,550
Right.

1034
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,930
I got fired again.

1035
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,640
I got fired because I was too old.

1036
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,850
I got fired because of my bad credit.

1037
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,100
I got fired because of my creditors.

1038
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,400
Should I just go back to my kids
and start farming?

1039
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,940
Do you think farming's a joke?

1040
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,530
Do you know how hard it is?

1041
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,570
Do you know what the adequate distance
between rice plants is?

1042
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,790
When do you spray sterilizers,

1043
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:30,950
pesticides, and nutrients for peppers?

1044
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,250
Why don't you

1045
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,080
just go to the US with me?

1046
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,500
Let's go find Sun-young

1047
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,260
and that asshole who abandoned you
and left for the US.

1048
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,390
You should find him and get alimony.

1049
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,640
What do you say?

1050
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,890
Do you think we can get a visa?

1051
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:53,390
I have bad credit,
and you're an ex-convict.

1052
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,890
You're smart.

1053
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,490
How are you?
How's working on a fishing vessel?

1054
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,200
Where are you?

1055
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,450
Me?

1056
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:11,490
I'm, well, somewhere in the Pacific.

1057
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,040
Goodness, look at the dolphins jumping.

1058
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,420
Can you hear the dolphins?

1059
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,670
Yes.

1060
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,340
You're far away,
but you have great reception.

1061
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,720
It's because my heart
is always by your side.

1062
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:35,440
Anyway, I'm glad
you got your act together.

1063
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,310
Do you know why I did that?

1064
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,230
Just hang in there.

1065
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,730
I'll earn a lot of money

1066
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,150
and pay off all of your debt.

1067
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,740
But until then,

1068
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,910
please remain the Lee Mi-joo
I've always known.

1069
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,540
The Mi-joo who never loses to anybody,

1070
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,370
whether it be to a boy,
your dad, or your sisters.

1071
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,750
Thanks, Sam-sik.

1072
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,710
Take care.

1073
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,880
Okay.

1074
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,720
I'll call you again.

1075
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,880
Bye.

1076
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,850
FISHING UNION
COMMUNAL WORKSHOP

1077
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,220
Let me know if you need anything.

1078
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,930
-Hurry.
-I need beer.

1079
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,560
Sure, coming.

1080
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,100
Two large beers.

1081
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,610
-A pack of cigarettes.
-Cigarettes.

1082
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,150
Blow.

1083
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,820
How gross.

1084
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:29,910
Mom.

1085
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,080
Mom.

1086
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,540
Mom.

1087
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,170
I'm going to go feed the pigs.

1088
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,670
Have some snacks and watch TV, okay?

1089
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,380
And if anything happens…

1090
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,300
"Remember to call, okay?"

1091
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,090
Yes.

1092
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,600
I'll be quick.

1093
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,990
She didn't say I couldn't go out.

1094
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,290
Right?

1095
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,420
What do you mean, plagiarized?

1096
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:31,470
Similar lyrics isn't plagiarism.

1097
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,140
Hey, look.

1098
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,640
What Na Hoon-a's mother loved
was ripe persimmon,

1099
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,850
but what my mother loved
was firm persimmon.

1100
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,020
Listen to this.

1101
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,230
Gingers grow

1102
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:46,110
Na Hoon-a sang about thinking,
but I'm singing about ginger.

1103
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,320
When firm persimmons grow

1104
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Hello?

1105
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:52,450
Damn it!

1106
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,500
What is that?

1107
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,420
Hey.

1108
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,460
Who are you?

1109
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,260
Hello. I'm Choi Kang-ho.

1110
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,220
What is Choi Kang-ho doing here?

1111
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,470
Right, well…

1112
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,890
I'm looking for Ye-jin's bouncy ball.

1113
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,520
Have you seen it?

1114
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,430
It's pink…

1115
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,020
and it's this big.

1116
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,360
This is so ridiculous.

1117
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,230
This is intrusion upon habitation.

1118
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,070
Leave before I report you!

1119
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,780
"Criminal Act, Article 319,
Intrusion upon Habitation."

1120
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:37,660
"A person who intrudes upon
one’s residence, guarded building,

1121
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,080
structure, ship, or occupied room,
shall be punished

1122
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,120
for up to three years
or by a fine under five million won."

1123
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,130
But what is an intrusion upon habitation?

1124
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,050
You're just a village idiot, aren't you?

1125
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,220
Get out of here!

1126
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:04,020
Goodbye, then!

1127
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,820
But you know,

1128
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,820
I'm not an idiot.

1129
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,320
I just returned to my childhood.

1130
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,370
This is a chance given from above.

1131
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,160
I'll also give you a chance.

1132
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,080
You get three seconds

1133
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,000
to get lost!

1134
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,620
One.

1135
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,670
Two.

1136
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,000
Wait, darn it.

1137
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,800
Three! I challenge you to a duel!

1138
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,180
Where did he…

1139
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,600
Did he fall?

1140
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,560
Hi, Kang-ho.

1141
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,650
Are you looking for something?

1142
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,170
Kang-ho!

1143
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:22,530
Kang-ho!

1144
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,910
Kang-ho!

1145
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:57,860
I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

1146
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,220
Choi Kang-ho!

1147
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,670
I'm dead.

1148
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,890
Found it.

1149
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,680
I found it!

1150
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,020
Ye-jin, Seo-jin! I found it!

1151
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,150
I found it!

1152
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,330
One, two, three.

1153
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:32,790
I found it.

1154
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,080
I can do it. I can take it down.

1155
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,100
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

1156
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,400
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

1157
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,740
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

1158
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,160
Who is it?

1159
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,310
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1160
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,040
Someone I don't know.

1161
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,540
But it hurts right here.

1162
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,620
And it's something…

1163
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,880
you need to do on your own.

1164
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,130
If you ever get in my way,

1165
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,590
I will not condone it.

1166
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,590
I rotted in prison for months
because of you!

1167
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,430
Violation of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

1168
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:17,100
-He was never my friend.
-Mi-joo?

1169
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:20,020
Mi-joo.

1170
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,190
Do you remember her?

1171
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,860
Seeing how you came back
with all your stuff,

1172
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,400
it looks like you've come to stay.

1173
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,700
I know it wasn't easy for you to come.
Let's live together.

1174
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:30,650
Don't call him.

1175
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:33,700
Don't ever meet him
or play with him again.

1176
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:39,540
