00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,980
My Lord,

4
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,940
I've changed my outfit as you said.

5
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,500
Am I a qualified servant now?

6
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,500
Can you please

7
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,020
show me Jiuxiang's file?

8
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,940
I swear

9
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,540
I won't tell anyone.

10
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,660
Like I said,

11
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,860
it depends.

12
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,300
My Lord,

13
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,580
why do you use an umbrella

14
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,660
even when it's sunny?

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,860
I've had a disease since I was a kid.

16
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,340
I must avoid the sunlight.

17
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,580
My Lord,

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,290
as your servant,

19
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,900
I'm happy to hold

20
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,260
the umbrella for you.

21
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,350
What's wrong?

22
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,060
You're too slow.

23
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,220
Then I'll walk faster.

24
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,300
Lan Che.

25
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,340
What's wrong?

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,540
Give it to me.

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,500
Well, My Lord.

28
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,860
Maybe we can try it again.

29
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,180
The position must be wrong.

30
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,180
Let's do this.

31
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,620
Left, right.

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,420
Left, right.

33
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,900
- Left...
- Stop.

34
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,100
Aren't you embarrassed?

35
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,860
(Anyway, you're more embarrassed.)

36
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Give it to me.

37
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,260
My Lord, please give me another chance.

38
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,340
I can do it.

39
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,620
Come on. My Lord, you...

40
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,780
Look.

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,060
Why are they acting so weird?

42
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,900
Give it to me...

43
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,940
My Lord!

44
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,660
They must have mental issues.

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,380
Why does she look like Lan Che?

46
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,460
Give it to me!

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,500
No way.

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,700
My boss would never wear

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,340
such a fancy dress.

50
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
My Lord, please.

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,300
We can try...

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,220
- Boss!
- Boss!

53
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,300
My Lord?

54
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,820
Boss, you approached Lou Mingye

55
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,220
for Jiuxiang's file,

56
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,340
but you're our leader.

57
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,700
How can a gang leader be

58
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,980
another man's servant?

59
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,740
You're

60
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,820
so young and naive.

61
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,060
Success requires

62
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
patience.

63
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,820
But My Lord,

64
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,250
the way you fought with Lan Che
on the street

65
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,480
was so embarrassing!

66
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,020
My Lord, you used to be calm and decent.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,950
Since Lan Che came,

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,300
you've changed a lot.

69
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,740
I don't care what people think.

70
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,540
My Lord, you said you had a plan.

71
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,180
What's the plan?

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,940
The plan is

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,540
to stay in the Justice Department

74
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,100
and please Lou Mingye

75
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,180
for Jiuxiang's file.

76
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,980
It's just a file.

77
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,060
I can get it for you.

78
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,910
You can't get it,

79
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,500
but I'm a Deputy Lord Chancellor.

80
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,620
He's a cunning fox.

81
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,630
He knows our relationship.

82
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,340
Do you think he'll let you get it?

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Why should I fear him?

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,340
My father is...

85
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,980
Your father?

86
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,380
My father

87
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,060
is King of Yan's good friend.

88
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,430
So, don't worry.

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,620
I can make it.

90
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,620
Hardships

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,220
make one grow.

92
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,780
If I can't even overcome this,

93
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,750
how can I lead our gang to success?

94
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,580
It makes sense,

95
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,940
but Boss, why do you seem

96
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
quite satisfied

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,580
with this job?

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,420
Really?

99
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,990
It's too obvious.

100
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,630
My Lord, you've never been

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,580
so patient with other girls.

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,150
Lan Che lost her memory,

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,630
so I should be more patient

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,090
with her.

105
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,420
I met a fortune teller recently.

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,460
She seems to be a master.

107
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,810
Ask her to perform a ritual.

108
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,570
Lan Che will remember things

109
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,060
from the last life

110
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,380
in less than an hour,
let alone those from 10 years ago.

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,170
Fang Tingge.

112
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
You don't have

113
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,220
much work to do, right?

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,780
Why did you have time
to know a fortune teller?

115
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,740
I just wanted to help you

116
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,420
to let Lan Che get her memory back.

117
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,620
Did you find Hu Zhi?

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
What about Wu Ming?

119
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,080
Have you checked

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,260
all the laboratories?

121
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,020
My Lord,

122
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,030
I remembered I need

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,700
to organize some materials
in the library.

124
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm leaving.

125
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,980
(Is it really)

126
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,740
(a good thing)

127
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,300
(for Lan Che to get her memory back?)

128
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,620
(Justice Department)

129
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
I must act now,

130
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,700
or I'll lose my position
as the gang leader.

131
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,420
I just need to steal the file.

132
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,740
It's not a big deal.

133
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,780
Who are you?

134
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,540
I work here.

135
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,350
Approval letter.

136
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,520
Approval letter?

137
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,940
I forgot to bring it.

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,540
Look at me.

139
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,940
I'm Lord Lou's servant.

140
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,460
Can you make an exception?

141
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,540
So what?

142
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,570
Anyone except Lord Lou

143
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,660
needs an approval letter.

144
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,980
What's going on?

145
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,980
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

146
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,620
My Lord.

147
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,850
You look

148
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
pretty cool.

149
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,300
It's too sandy out there.

150
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,370
Keep an eye on the library.

151
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,300
No one can get in without permission,

152
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,660
especially Lord Li.

153
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,180
- Aye.
- Aye.

154
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,100
Where are you going?

155
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,380
Follow me.

156
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,940
You've got guts, right?

157
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,240
How dare you steal from the library?

158
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,720
I lost.

159
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,770
Just punish me.

160
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,820
Go to the study to organize the files

161
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,940
categorize them and place them in order.

162
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,490
What?

163
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,590
I need...

164
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,080
to go home for dinner.

165
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,980
My Lord!

166
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,380
Go.

167
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,500
My Lord,

168
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,260
I've checked the labs

169
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,500
Wu Ming told us,

170
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,340
but they're not capable of producing

171
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,210
as many drugs

172
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,740
as those in the city.

173
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,180
There must be other labs.

174
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,140
We need to ask him.

175
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,380
My Lord,

176
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,550
Wu Ming is supposed to be sent to
Ministry of Penalty.

177
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,260
I'm afraid he's on the way.

178
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,250
Let's go.

179
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,060
Well done!

180
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,540
Well done!

181
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,390
We can't let him live

182
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,270
and harm the city.

183
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,420
- Behead him!
- Behead!

184
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,860
Someone assassinated the suspect!

185
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,260
- Aye!
- Hurry!

186
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,780
Wu Ming is dead?

187
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,540
Yes.

188
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,820
I sent people to investigate it,

189
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,990
but the assassin didn't leave

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,020
any traces.

191
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,140
It's my fault.

192
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
Please punish me!

193
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,570
Lou Mingye,

194
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,540
who else in this world

195
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,690
can command the Tiger Roar Army?

196
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,140
Do you think you can defeat him?

197
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,100
Killing our suspect in public...

198
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,940
He's so arrogant.

199
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,900
Search everyone and figure out

200
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,220
if anyone came from Liangzhou

201
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,460
or served the army there.

202
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,340
Don't miss any suspects.

203
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,420
Aye.

204
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,260
(Jia)

205
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,540
Why are you laughing?

206
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,410
Your handwriting...

207
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,180
is too ugly.

208
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,980
Then do it yourself.

209
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,260
My Lord.

210
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,140
Our staff...

211
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,020
My Lord.

212
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,870
I'm leaving.

213
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,860
How can I get the file?

214
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,420
My Lord,

215
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,860
I don't know if I should say this.

216
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,310
Then don't.

217
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,660
But I think...

218
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,780
I don't care what you think.

219
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,380
My Lord, you don't

220
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,860
want her to remember, right?

221
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
Boss.

222
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,540
Why did you ask me to come?

223
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,100
I got the information

224
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,700
that Hu Zhi has been hiding here

225
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,900
since she left Yuyan Tower.

226
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,780
We can arrest her now

227
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,180
and exchange her

228
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,340
for Jiuxiang's file.

229
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,780
Li Mo, not bad.

230
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,060
You've got something.

231
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,450
Where's Lan Che?

232
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,860
Why hasn't she come to work?

233
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,780
She took a day off.

234
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,380
She said she needed

235
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,600
to take care of Luo.

236
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,340
Isn't Doctor Huanxi

237
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,500
enough?

238
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,900
Idiot. If I find him, I'll...

239
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,100
Your Highness.

240
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,420
- Your Highness.
- My Lord.

241
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,540
I wasn't busy today,

242
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,420
so I wanted to visit Mo.

243
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,900
However, my unruly son left

244
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,980
right after he clocked in.

245
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,500
My Lord, don't worry.

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,580
I'll send someone to get him back,

247
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,020
and I'll kick the hell out of him!

248
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
They're both absent.

249
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,380
What are you doing?

250
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,140
They're King of Yan's guards, right?

251
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,980
Why are you hiding?

252
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,460
I had a fight with my father,

253
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,060
and he asked the king to get me back.

254
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,300
Boss!

255
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,140
Help!

256
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,740
Stop.

257
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,860
Go.

258
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,700
They left.

259
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,100
Why staring at me?

260
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,600
I... It's too hot.

261
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,950
I'll buy a mung bean cake.

262
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,740
Hu Zhi?

263
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,620
(Is she leaving...)

264
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,060
(for her base?)

265
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,020
Where's she?

266
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
My Lord,

267
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,580
the drug lab Mother told us

268
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,620
should be around,

269
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,220
but we don't know the exact location.

270
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,460
My Lord.

271
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,540
It's hot.

272
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,580
Stay here.

273
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
We'll look for it.

274
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

275
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,220
(What happened?)

276
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,500
(I was...)

277
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,220
Lan Che.

278
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,300
If you want to see me,

279
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,260
you don't have to sneak around.

280
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,860
Hu Zhi...

281
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,990
Did Lord Lou ask you to follow me?

282
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, no.

283
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,420
I...

284
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,860
I heard there'd be
a hunting activity in the south,

285
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,140
so I wanted to check it out.

286
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,060
I didn't expect to meet you.

287
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,730
Well...

288
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,280
So,

289
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,860
no one knows you're here, right?

290
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,780
Then they won't

291
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,220
find out about your death either, right?

292
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,480
What do you mean?

293
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,740
Back then,

294
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,980
Jiuxiang and I were both sold

295
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,410
to Huaisha Village.

296
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,220
However, look how we ended up...

297
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,220
so differently.

298
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,060
Carefree Powder...

299
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,140
Thank you

300
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,380
for giving me a decent life.

301
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,050
What village

302
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,420
were you and Jiuxiang sold to?

303
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,980
How can I

304
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,300
avenge you?

305
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,660
If it weren't for you,

306
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,820
Lou Mingye would've died in Yuyan Tower.

307
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,740
Now you want to stay out of it.

308
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,940
It's too late!

309
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,820
Stay back!

310
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,470
Don't get closer,

311
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,810
or I'll burn your stuff, okay?

312
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,820
Go to hell!

313
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,140
(Oh, no.)

314
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,880
(So much Carefree Powder.)

315
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,460
(Carefree Powder?)

316
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,300
Stay back.

317
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,700
Stay back!

318
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,980
Stay away from me!

319
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,820
Stop!

320
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,860
Stop...

321
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Go to hell!

322
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,580
Lan Che!

323
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,980

Are you hallucinating?

325
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,460
You killed my father.

326
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
You killed Jiuxiang!

327
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,020
You must die.

328
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
Go to hell!

329
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,140

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,500
who hunted me in my dreams.

387
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,140
And?

388
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,060
Then I...

389
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,540
I...

390
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,700
You killed my father.

391
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,460
You killed Jiuxiang!

392
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,440
Go to hell!

393
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,000
That's weird.

394
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,570
He's got martial arts.

395
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,950
How could you hurt him?

396
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,450
He couldn't have done it on purpose.

397
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,780
Could it be...?

398
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,220
He did that to get you sober.

399
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,380
I'm leaving.

400
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,980
It's so touching.

401
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,300
(Lou's Mansion)

402
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,180
Lou Mingye.

403
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,180
You're a girl.

404
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,100
Stop looking.

405
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,500
Can't you protect yourself?

406
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,780
I'm not the one naked.

407
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,020
Anyway, it's his loss.

408
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,100
Still looking.

409
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,020
Turn around!

410
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
My Lord.

411
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,180
Well,

412
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,180
I've prepared the medicine

413
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,420
and wrapped your wounds.

414
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,270
Take the medicine and rest early.

415
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,700
Thanks, doctor.

416
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,360
Stop looking. Let's go home.

417
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,200
Master,

418
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,670
you go first.

419
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,990
I have something to tell Lord Lou.

420
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,260
What's so urgent?

421
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,820
Can't you wait until tomorrow?

422
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,350
He's a patient.

423
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,380
Doctor Huanxi,

424
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,500
Lord Li just found Hu Zhi's body.

425
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,860
Can you help us with the autopsy?

426
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,070
I'm not a coroner. Why should I...?

427
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,100
Wait.

428
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,140
They...

429
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,060
There are after-effects.

430
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,360
Wait.

431
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,780
You...

432
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,600
My Lord,

433
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,980
well, take the medicine.

434
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,510
Put it down.

435
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,550
I'll have it later.

436
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,900
No, you can't wait.

437
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,590
Take it while it's still hot.

438
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,220
My Lord.

439
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,160
Are you scared of

440
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,300
taking medicine?

441
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,020
- Nonsense.
- Then take it.

442
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,970
I said later.

443
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,420
My Lord.

444
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,460
A good boy should take the medicine.

445
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,900
Is it bitter?

446
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,460
It's okay.

447
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,740
I've prepared something.

448
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,620
How can medicine be sweet?

449
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,460
This one is sweet.

450
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,900
Try it.

451
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,100
Take a sip.

452
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,580
You lied!

453
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,980
It's so bitter!

454
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,540
Here's my favorite plum candy.

455
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,860
Open your mouth.

456
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
I didn't lie, right?

457
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,820
It's sweet.

458
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,220
Is it sweet?

459
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,780
Madam Wang made the candy.

460
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,220
My Lord,

461
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,580
did you...

462
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,210
let me hurt you on purpose?

463
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,220
I only wanted to bring you
to your senses.

464
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,620
I had no choice.

465
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Forget it.

466
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,740
Sorry.

467
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,700
You followed Hu Zhi

468
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,620
because of Jiuxiang's file, right?

469
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,140
Lan Che.

470
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,540
Let's go somewhere else.

471
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,380
My Lord,

472
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,100
why did you take me here?

473
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:52,500
(Resilient as Pine, Elegant as Bamboo)

474
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,900
The stars are so beautiful

475
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,780
tonight.

476
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,660
My Lord,

477
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,620
I've been wondering

478
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,180
why you installed
a sunroof in your room.

479
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,180
My mother died when I was little,

480
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,060
and my father was always at war.

481
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,220
I was a sick and weak child

482
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,420
who could only stay at home.

483
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,980
Luckily, I had a good friend.

484
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,820
My friend was worried

485
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,540
I might be scared
when I was alone at night,

486
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,750
so

487
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,140
my friend would sneak into my house

488
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,260
and watched the stars
with me in the yard.

489
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,620
My friend told me

490
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,060
when I'm alone,

491
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,060
I just need to remember
we're living under the same sky,

492
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,620
and I won't be lonely.

493
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,940
What happened then?

494
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,540
Then my friend left without a word

495
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,100
and left this to me.

496
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,380
This girl must be...

497
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,280
very important to you, My Lord.

498
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,380
How do you know it's a girl?

499
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
She sent you a glowing pearl

500
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,700
and watches stars with you.

501
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,500
A guy wouldn't be so romantic.

502
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,140
However...

503
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,940
I think

504
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,100
maybe she's forgotten about me.

505
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,020
My Lord,

506
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,060
don't be upset.

507
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,120
Maybe

508
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,960
it's the best

509
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,460
to keep someone

510
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,860
in your memory.

511
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,980
Maybe.

512
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,380
My Lord...

513
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,500
A star just fell.

514
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,460
Lan Che.

515
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,180
Are you okay?

516
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,820
There are after-effects!

517
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,940
Lan Che...

518
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,180
Be quiet.

519
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,660
Don't spoil the fun.

520
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,540
My Lord.

521
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,540
We're in heaven.

522
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,660
I'll catch a star for you.

523
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,740
I won't leave you

524
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,300
after giving you a pearl

525
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,100
and make you stuck in the past

526
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,060
like your childhood friend did.

527
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,940
My Lord...

528
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,660
