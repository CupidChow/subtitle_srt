00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,460
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,780
I don't think they can catch us.

4
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,380
My Lord,

5
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,860
this is Lingxi Lake.

6
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,620
I didn't know

7
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,220
Huaisha Village has such a nice view.

8
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,340
How did you find this place?

9
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,420
Li Mo brought me here

10
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,620
after we sent Huali away.

11
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,940
He was so thoughtful.

12
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,460
This place is so beautiful.

13
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,660
He's never thoughtful when he's at work.

14
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,060
My Lord.

15
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,220
Are you angry again?

16
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,780
Don't be angry all the time

17
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
so that there will be

18
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,140
much less rumors about you.

19
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,420
What rumors?

20
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,420
But I don't believe them.

21
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,220
I only believe what I see.

22
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,860
Then what's your conclusion?

23
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,740
My conclusion is

24
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,340
My Lord, you're smart, strong, and kind.

25
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,700
You're not what the rumors say.

26
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,580
Lan Che.

27
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,540
You don't have to praise me
if you think it's hard.

28
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,140
My Lord,

29
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,340
it's too hard to please you.

30
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,620
Lan Che.

31
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,860
What?

32
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,420
If you can't remember who you are,

33
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,980
what will you do?

34
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,380
I'll live a life as Lan Che.

35
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,980
Don't you feel sorry for that?

36
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,900
Of course I do.

37
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,720
However, compared to

38
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,540
the unknown identity,

39
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,540
the current life of Lan Che

40
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,820
is much more important.

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,860
In other words...

42
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
My Lord,

43
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,900
now you're sulking,

44
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,860
but why don't you

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,400
enjoy the view around you?

46
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,060
My Lord,

47
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,620
you really look like a fool
when you smile.

48
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,020
You're adorable
when you shut your mouth.

49
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,620
I'm wondering how Li Mo is doing.

50
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,620
Help?

51
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,500
Somebody?

52
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,820
Stay back!

53
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,820
Stay back.

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,620
Somebody, help!

55
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
Have a good rest.

56
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,340
You too, My Lord.

57
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,620
Lan Che.

58
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,300
Are you okay?

59
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,540
Lou Mingye,

60
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,220
you used this chance to get back at me.

61
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,700
Last night,

62
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,060
if it weren't for my wisdom and courage,

63
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,420
I would've been torn apart
by those mad dogs.

64
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,220
We don't pay for useless people.

65
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,860
My Lord, you can handle a few dogs,

66
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,100
can't you?

67
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,050
You...

68
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,180
Li Mo,

69
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,140
Lord Lou left you alone
because he trusted you,

70
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,380
and you didn't let him down, right?

71
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,620
I believe

72
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,860
you two

73
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,780
will become

74
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,860
perfect partners

75
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,660
very soon.

76
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh.

77
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,500
Okay.

78
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,980
For Lan Che's sake,

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,740
I'll put up with...

80
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,820
Look at him!

81
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,180
How can we be partners?

82
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,180
The dogs nearly killed me last night!

83
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,500
How could he do that to me?

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,340
Lan Che!

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,580
I can't believe it!

86
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,940
He took you away last night

87
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,100
while I was hunted by the dogs!

88
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,220
Lan Che!

89
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,180
(Come to the tea stall alone and give it
to the vendor for Jiuxiang's clues.)

90
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,900
Dear guest, what would you like?

91
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,820
Wait a minute.

92
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,500
Here's your tea!

93
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,780
Dear guest, you're a lucky person.

94
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,180
Hope you find a good husband.

95
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,460
The person will come in a minute.

96
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,900
Get out! Don't ruin my business!

97
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,260
Dear guest, I'm so sorry.

98
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,700
Who is she?

99
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,900
Well,

100
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
she's a psychopath,

101
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,380
but she seldom goes mad.

102
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Have some tea.

103
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
Hurry up!

104
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,900
Lan Che.

105
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,180
Lan Che!

106
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,540
Wake up, Lan Che!

107
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,660
Lan Che.

108
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,260
Huali?

109
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,380
Where am I?

110
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,020
Why are you here?

111
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,260
This is the place

112
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,860
where the Huangs imprison women.

113
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,940
Right after you got me out,

114
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,700
they sent someone

115
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,380
to catch me on the way.

116
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,980
I can't believe it.

117
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,700
How dare they offend the law?

118
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,420
Somebody! Huang Fuxing!

119
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,300
It won't work.

120
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,460
- They only come when delivering food.
- Huang Fuxing!

121
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,780
Lan Che.

122
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,820
What should we do?

123
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,020
Don't be scared.

124
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,820
We will get out.

125
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,100
Don't you feel sorry for that?

126
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,980
Compared to

127
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,780
the unknown identity,

128
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,340
the current life of Lan Che
is much more important.

129
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,020
luminous pearl is beautiful,

130
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,420
but I prefer

131
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,220
the real night sky with stars.

132
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,940
Lan Che.

133
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,100
Lan Che.

134
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,580
It's not for you.

135
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,580
Make it by yourself.

136
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,420
Remember to pay.

137
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,180
Hey! How can you do this?

138
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,820
How can you do this?

139
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Lan Che.

140
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,900
Lan Che, are you hungry?

141
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,340
Would you like something to eat?

142
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,660
She doesn't want to talk to you.

143
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,220
Lan Che.

144
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm Li Mo.

145
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,460
I asked the cook

146
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,380
to make your favorite food.

147
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,020
Shall we eat it together?

148
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,860
Lan Che.

149
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,460
Is she still sleeping?

150
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,380
Lan Che...

151
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,940
How can you get in?

152
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,380
What if you see something...

153
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,780
Where is she?

154
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,820
Brother,

155
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,260
The cuffs

156
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,820
are so heavy.

157
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,940
Don't play tricks.

158
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,860
Brother,

159
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,620
you look so handsome and smart.

160
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,100
Can you

161
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,020
open the lunch box for me?

162
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,140
I believe you won't reject

163
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
a simple request from a little girl!

164
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,300
The cuffs are really heavy!

165
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
If we don't

166
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,420
eat anything,

167
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,380
we'll starve to death.

168
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,100
What are you supposed to tell your boss?

169
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,940
Thank you.

170
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,100
They just got out.

171
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,460
They must be around.

172
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,460
Search everywhere!

173
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,700
- Aye!
- Aye!

174
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,380
- I'll distract them
- Over there!

175
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,460
Go to the inn and find

176
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,980
the man who always uses an umbrella.

177
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,160
- Understand?
- They're not here.

178
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,060
What about you?

179
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,380
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

180
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
Over there!

181
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,380
Where are they?

182
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,020
- Over there!
- Go!

183
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,780
Go!

184
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,820
Come on, hurry up!

185
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,820
Lord Teng,

186
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,060
where should I put this one?

187
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,900
- In the backyard.
- Okay.

188
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,700
Gardener Feng.

189
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,300
Why are you here?

190
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,670
You're the young man

191
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
I met by the lake last time, right?

192
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,780
It's me.

193
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,980
Teng,

194
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,420
why did you buy the flowers?

195
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,380
Everyone has them,

196
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,420
but I bought some too.

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,420
Did you see Lan Che?

198
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,580
Lan Che?

199
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,210
She left a while ago.

200
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,260
Left?

201
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,420
Where did she go?

202
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,580
I don't know. She didn't tell you?

203
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,540
(Beloved Son Huang Daping)

204
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,380
Let's go!

205
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,820
Hurry up!

206
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,300
Go.

207
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
Go!

208
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,820
- Don't move!
- My Lord, we've got her.

209
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,620
Huang Fuxing, how dare you catch me?

210
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,220
Don't you know who I work for?

211
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,220
Good-looking

212
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,940
but disobedient.

213
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,860
(Beloved Son Huang Daping)

214
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,820
Daping will be angry.

215
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,180
Daping desperately needed a woman.

216
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,340
I had no choice.

217
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,100
Let's put up with it this time.

218
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,300
We can find a better one later.

219
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,940
Forget it.

220
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,500
But Daping deserves better.

221
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,380
Huang Fuxing.

222
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,100
What are you going to do?

223
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,620
Girl,

224
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,420
it's your honor
to be married into our family.

225
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,020
As long as you behave,

226
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,500
Daping

227
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,780
will treat you well.

228
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,300
We will also burn

229
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,140
paper money for you

230
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,980
when we visit Daping.

231
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,940
No! You old woman.

232
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,900
You're also a woman.

233
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,260
Have you no conscience?

234
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,060
Girl, just finish the ritual
with our young lord.

235
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,900
Let's go.

236
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,420
I was born in a bad time.

237
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,820
I have a solitary destiny!

238
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,500
I won't go easy on you
when I turn into a ghost!

239
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,860
Nonsense! Unruly girl!

240
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,420
- Seal the coffin now!
- Let me go!

241
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,740
Go!

242
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,860
Go!

243
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,540
Get off me!

244
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,780
Get off me!

245
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Let me out!

246
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,900
Huang Fuxing, Let me out!

247
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,780
Let me go! Let me go!

248
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,180
Bury the coffin!

249
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,740
Huang Fuxing!

250
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,740
I won't go easy on you!

251
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,500
Let me go!

252
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,220
Are you looking for Lan Che?

253
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,050
Move.

254
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,900
No.

255
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,660
Move!

256
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,780
Lou Mingye.

257
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,700
Why are you always under an umbrella?

258
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,140
So pretentious.

259
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,340
Give it to me.

260
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,420
You can't go out without it, right?

261
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Lord Tuoba!

262
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
Lord Tuoba!

263
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,300
Huali, why are you back?

264
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,380
My Lord, please save Lan Che!

265
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,900
She was taken by the Huangs!

266
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,380
Daping,

267
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,660
you've finally got a wife.

268
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,140
Are you happy?

269
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,140
How I wish I could see you
one more time.

270
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,940
It's all that witch's fault.

271
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,780
Mother,

272
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,820
the past is in the past.

273
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,820
Huang Fuxing!

274
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,980
Give Lan Che back!

275
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,700
Lan Che just married

276
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,660
our young lord

277
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,180
and has been buried with him.

278
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,380
I think

279
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,180
the coffin has been sealed

280
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,540
for almost an hour.

281
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm afraid she's already gone.

282
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,220
My Lord,

283
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,780
I suggest you apologize to Lord Huang.

284
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,860
He's a generous man.

285
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,140
Maybe he'll forgive you.

286
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,540
He's ruined my grandson's wedding

287
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,980
again and again.

288
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,300
Take him down!

289
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,380
I count to three.

290
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,860
Dig the grave and open the coffin!

291
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,460
Otherwise, today is the day you die!

292
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
Fuxing!

293
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,780
Three...

294
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,220
Don't do this!

295
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,500
- Fuxing...
- Two!

296
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,660
- Fuxing!
- I'll do it!

297
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
- Hurry!
- One!

298
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,500
Hurry, open the coffin!

299
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,860
Hurry up!

300
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,900
Don't move! Don't!

301
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,340
- I'll do it!
- It's open!

302
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,060
Dig it!

303
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,220
Lan Che.

304
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,620
Huang Fuxing,

305
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,780
you shouldn't have hurt her.

306
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,060
No! Don't kill my son!

307
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,520
- My Lord!
- No!

308
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,140
My Lord...

309
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,980
My son!

310
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,260
My son!

311
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,380
Lan Che!

312
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,140
- Lan Che!
- Lan Che.

313
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,860
Wake up!

314
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,340
- Lan Che!
- Lan Che, get up!

315
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,380
Hurry!

316
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,660
Follow us!

317
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,340
Hurry!

318
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Get in!

319
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,140
Get in!

320
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,380
Are you feeling better?

321
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,260
Much better.

322
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,340
Let me help you.

323
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,060
Gardener Feng, why are you here?

324
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,220
I just passed by

325
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,340
and gave you a ride.

326
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,660
Don't worry.

327
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,380
(Yongning Temple)
It's safe.

328
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,860
Get some rest.

329
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,860
Thanks.

330
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,260
Let's go.

331
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,540
My Lord,

332
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,700
are you okay?

333
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,620
I can't look at the sun.

334
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,020
I didn't use the umbrella.

335
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,500
I'm temporarily blind.

336
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,660
That's why you're always
under an umbrella.

337
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,340
Why didn't you tell us?

338
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,300
My Lord,

339
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,980
let me help you.

340
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,580
Come on.

341
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,500
I can't move around.

342
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,580
Li Mo,

343
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,820
go back to the inn.

344
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,020
Tie Teng up and bring him here.

345
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,500
Why tie him up?

346
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,700
Who do you think

347
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,180
helped Huang Fuxing to kidnap Lan Che?

348
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,140
Nasty rat.

349
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,580
I'll break his legs!

350
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,940
Lan Che.

351
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,060
My Lord, I'm here.

352
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,700
Sorry.

353
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,700
For what?

354
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,140
I was late.

355
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
No.

356
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,580
Not at all.

357
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,900
You found me, didn't you?

358
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,900
Do you trust me that much?

359
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,860
Since I met you, My Lord,

360
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,900
I've always known

361
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
someone will have my back
no matter what happens.

362
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,940
I asked you to find out who he is.

363
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,060
You found Lou Mingye
eliminated the Tuobas.

364
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,340
How could you not know it's him?

365
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,300
Useless trash!

366
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,180
Forget it.

367
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,340
He's already here.

368
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,940
There's no point

369
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,020
arguing about it.

370
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,420
Mother,

371
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,820
what do you think

372
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,300
we should do?

373
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,620
Lou Mingye is hard to deal with,

374
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,060
but I don't think
he's fully prepared this time.

375
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,180
Why don't we

376
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,060
get them first?

377
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,180
Huang Gui.

378
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,060
Ask them to close the village.

379
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,540
Let's trap them here.

380
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,540
Aye.

381
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,060
(Mercy for All)

382
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,940
My Lord,

383
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,900
how are your eyes?

384
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,740
Much better.

385
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,340
Try this.

386
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,940
Come on.

387
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,660
Thanks.

388
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,660
Hurry!

389
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,100
Tell them.

390
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,260
Lan Che,

391
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,940
I put the note under your pillow,

392
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,540
but I had no choice.

393
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,020
Lord Huang forced me to.

394
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,580
What did he give you?

395
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,560
I...

396
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,220
He received your money,

397
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,420
so he'd also take their money.

398
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,620
My Lord, I really had no choice.

399
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,860
The Huangs are crazy.

400
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,020
If I disobey them,

401
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,140
they'll throw me into Lingxi Lake

402
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,980
like when...

403
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,340
Like what?

404
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,420
Was anyone thrown into the lake before?

405
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,620
I can't tell you.

406
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,740
Say it,

407
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,700
or he'll throw you into the lake.

408
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,060
It was Huang Daping's wife.

409
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,420
Huang Daping?

410
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,500
Did he get married before?

411
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,140
Daping.

412
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,860
I still regret it.

413
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,740
(Beloved Son Huang Daping)
I shouldn't have let you marry her.

414
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,700
If it weren't for that witch,

415
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,100
you wouldn't have died so early.

416
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,140
You're so miserable.

417
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,580
Why did you have to

418
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,100
(Beloved Son Huang Daping)
fall in love with

419
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,300
a married countrywoman?

420
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,780
Her name

421
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,540
is Fang Baixue.

422
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,660
She was already married,

423
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,340
and her man was in the army
in Liangzhou.

424
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,740
However, Huang Daping

425
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,420
really liked her

426
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,660
and forced her to marry him

427
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,260
while her husband was away!

428
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,820
The Huangs

429
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,780
not only sell women
but kidnap other people's wives.

430
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,620
Huang Daping deserved this.

431
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,780
How did he die?

432
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,700
One year later,

433
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,100
Lady Fang's husband came back.

434
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,940
They wanted to run away,

435
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,660
but they were caught.

436
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,700
Lady Fang asked her husband
to leave first

437
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,380
but accidentally killed Huang Daping.

438
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,020
He was the only heir

439
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,660
of the Huang Family.

440
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,540
Lord Huang and his mother
were pissed off

441
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,980
and threw her into the snow
for an entire day.

442
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,420
She was frozen to death.

443
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,420
Then they threw her into Lingxi Lake.

444
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,180
When they did this,

445
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,340
she was frozen into an ice

446
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,020
and never floated up.

447
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,620
They're monsters.

448
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,180
Then...

449
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,460
What about her ex-husband?

450
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,980
He never showed up.

451
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,980
His wife died for him.

452
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,900
How could he forgive them?

453
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,100
Why are you surprised?

454
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,180
Most men in this world are cowards.

455
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,620
Don't you think so, Lord Teng?

456
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,260
Gardener Feng,

457
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,460
don't make fun of me!

458
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,340
My Lord, I've told you everything.

459
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,580
Can you let me go?

460
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,340
Huang Gui.

461
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,860
Lord Huang died in a weird way.

462
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,580
My Lord, thank you for doing this.

463
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,100
It's our duty to handle
every case equally.

464
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,060
Can you do an autopsy

465
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
or not?

466
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,420
I've seen others do it before.

467
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
I've been Huanxi's disciple
for many years.

468
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,020
How's that possible?

469
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,460
What's wrong?

470
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,580
Nothing.

471
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
Let's go out.

472
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,020
Why are you being so secretive?

473
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,260
There's no wound

474
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
or sign of poison

475
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,580
in his body.

476
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,580
Do you mean...?

477
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,700
Don't doubt my conclusion, okay?

478
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,340
It seems

479
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,220
he was frozen to death.

480
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,300
Frozen?

481
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,660
Huang Gui.

482
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,780
Did he go out

483
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,820
before he died?

484
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,380
Well...

485
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,220
My Lord, I need to tell you something.

486
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,220
My Lord.

487
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,500
Are you okay, My Lord?

488
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,100
My Lord!

489
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,180
My Lord!

490
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,180
No.

491
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,700
Lord Huang never left home.

492
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,460
It's not winter.

493
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,620
Isn't it too wild

494
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,380
to be frozen to death in summer?

495
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,140
Even if it's winter,

496
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,700
he can't possibly be frozen like this.

497
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,220
Lord Huang and his mother
were pissed off

498
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,940
and threw her into the snow

499
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,900
for an entire day.
She was frozen to death.

500
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,580
Did he

501
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,780
meet a ghost?

502
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,710
Could it be...

503
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,420
his wife?

504
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,360
Stop!

505
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,940
Who allowed you to bother my son?

506
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,340
It's all your fault.

507
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,740
You brought disaster to us!

508
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Fuxing wouldn't dare to hurt you,

509
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,460
but I

510
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,700
don't care!

511
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,740
She's attacking us at all costs.

512
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
Stay close to me.

513
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm afraid

514
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,980
we have to rush out.

515
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,580
Kill them!

516
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,900
(Mercy for All)

517
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,660
My Lady, what's wrong with you?

518
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,060
Hurry!

519
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,260
Qingyao.

520
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,200
Lou...

521
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,460
Are you alright?

522
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,260
Qingyao, I've finally found you.

523
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,860
Let's go home.
