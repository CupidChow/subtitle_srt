=Episode 14=

3
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,980
My Lord.

4
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,940
Here are the letters

5
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,860
from their fans.

6
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,900
What should I do?

7
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,820
Let me see. Can I read them?

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,660
Lan Che.

9
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,220
Come with me.

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,340
My Lord.

11
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,300
I think Xie Jiulian

12
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,420
is very suspicious.

13
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,180
He expressed his jealousy of Jun Zichen
on purpose.

14
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,220
It seems he has nothing to hide,

15
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,620
but I think he has a secret.

16
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,660
My Lord.

17
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,420
Why are you so quiet?

18
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,380
My Lord?

19
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,340
When are you going to tell me

20
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,820
your relationship with Li Mo?

21
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,700
Even you know about it.

22
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
What?

23
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,260
Who told you?

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,940
Li Mo asked me for a favor,

25
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,940
and I had no choice.

26
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,180
Do you think it's real?

27
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,780
I know you're always careless,

28
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,340
but how can you joke about that?

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,220
I know you never

30
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,580
liked me.

31
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,980
You're always

32
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,380
criticizing me.

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,260
That's not what I meant.

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,980
Then what is it?

35
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,300
Now your childhood sweetheart is back,

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,940
so you want to kick me out,

37
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,100
right?

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,460
When did I say I'd kick you out?

39
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,620
Then what did you mean yesterday?

40
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,300
You said I could find a better place.

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,300
King of Yan wanted you.

42
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
He said at least you shouldn't

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
marry Li Mo

44
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,900
as a servant.

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,620
That's what

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,740
happened.

47
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,900
It's not a big deal.

48
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,460
Just be clear with him.

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,300
It's not that simple.

50
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,660
Li Mo is his son.

51
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,220
Whatever mistakes he makes,

52
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,500
he'll just be beaten, and that's all.

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,740
What if he takes it all out

54
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
on me?

55
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,540
You're my servant.

56
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,820
I won't let

57
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,740
anyone hurt you.

58
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,540
(To Xie Jiulian)

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,380
However,

60
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,140
if you make more stupid mistakes,

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,380
you'll see.

62
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,380
How can you judge me?

63
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,340
You're also a mess.

64
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,660
Letters. Letters.

65
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
You can't go home

66
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,340
until you finish all of them.

67
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,780
(To Xie Jiulian)

68
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,140
(Justice Department)

69
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,180
(To Xie Jiulian)
Those fans are crazy.

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,060
(Focus on Details)
They want to have kids with Jun Zichen.

71
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,780
This one says Xie Jiulian sings off-key

72
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,420
and looks mean.

73
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,420
She even curses his ancestors.

74
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
It seems

75
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
Xie Jiulian is the person

76
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,300
who hates Jun Zichen the most.

77
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,500
This one criticizes Jun Zichen.

78
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,300
Back then, Zhubo Theater
tried hard to make him famous.

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,460
When he succeeded,

80
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,460
he wanted to leave them

81
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,940
and find a better troupe.

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,460
Jun Zichen wanted to leave?

83
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,820
Why didn't Boss Ma tell us?

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,140
They made him famous,

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,660
so they can also ruin him.

86
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,940
If he really betrayed the troupe,

87
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,020
he'd deserve to die.

88
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,260
Maybe it's time

89
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,460
to talk to Boss Ma.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,860
(Hongfu Restaurant)

91
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,700
Bingbing,

92
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,580
why didn't you use a wheelchair?

93
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
There are so many stairs in Changjing.

94
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,500
It's inconvenient to use it.

95
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,020
A crutch is much better.

96
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
Boss.

97
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,780
Boss?

98
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,540
It seems he left.

99
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,020
How's that possible?

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,300
What happened?

101
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,980
Did the rope break when

102
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,980
he hanged himself?

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,940
My Lord!

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,980
That's our prop.

105
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,540
Boss Ma wanted to sell Zhubo Theater.

106
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,660
(Fairness and Integrity)

107
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,940
It's raining so hard.

108
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,460
My Lord.

109
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,900
It's you.

110
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,580
My Lord,

111
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,580
(Fairness and Integrity)
did Lord Lou go out?

112
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,490
Yes,

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,540
he went to Zhubo Theater.

114
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,420
What do you need?

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,260
It started to rain,

116
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,700
so I brought this.

117
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,580
By the way,

118
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,860
I also brought some cakes

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,460
and gave them

120
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
to the lords.

121
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,020
My Lord, you can have a taste.

122
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,540
Who offers unsolicited hospitality

123
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,580
must be harboring evil.

124
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,260
What do you want

125
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
exactly?

126
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,100
Don't act like I'm bullying you.

127
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,300
I've heard

128
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,620
some girls

129
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,220
like to play the victim

130
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,620
to gain sympathy.

131
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,180
If you want to
approach Lou Mingye like this,

132
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,700
I suggest you give up,

133
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,100
because he's heartless.

134
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,740
My Lord...

135
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,660
Me neither.

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm very sympathetic,

137
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,380
but I have piercing eyes.

138
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,780
I can see through

139
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,900
all your little tricks.

140
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,980
Just go.

141
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,860
My Lord,

142
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,820
why are you so hostile to me?

143
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,900
Is it because

144
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm so close to Mingye

145
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,220
that Lan Che gets upset?

146
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,380
My Lord.

147
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,980
Actually, I can tell

148
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,460
you like Lan Che.

149
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,260
Maybe I can help you.

150
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,500
So annoying.

151
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,460
It's my business.

152
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,300
Whether I win or lose,

153
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,900
I need a fair competition.

154
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,940
Stay out of it.

155
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
Wait a minute.

156
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,260
Xie Jiulian.

157
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,020
Before Boss Ma died,

158
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,620
he wanted to sell the troupe and

159
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,180
give your indentures

160
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,700
to different buyers.

161
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,100
Did you know that?

162
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,300
Yes.

163
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,540
He told us

164
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
after Jun Zichen died.

165
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,540
He's a profit-seeking businessman,

166
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,940
but were it not for him,

167
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,380
our troupe wouldn't have gone this far.

168
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
And we

169
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,220
would've been separated.

170
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,940
We wouldn't have

171
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,540
lived a wealthy life

172
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,980
for many years.

173
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,060
Don't say that.

174
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,580
You're talented.

175
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,980
You could've also

176
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,060
become famous without him.

177
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,580
Did you know Jun Zichen

178
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,300
was going to leave?

179
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,220
Of course.

180
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,980
If he hadn't insisted on leaving,

181
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,660
Boss Ma wouldn't have wanted
to sell the troupe.

182
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,980
Ungrateful traitor.

183
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,260
Boss Ma was so angry

184
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,420
that he smashed all the bowls

185
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,980
and called him a traitor.

186
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,740
Bingbing,

187
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,180
is there something
you want to say?

188
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,220
Actually, before Brother Jun died,

189
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,740
I heard

190
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,500
Boss Ma having a big fight with him.

191
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,180
I've made a lot of money for you
over the years.

192
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,540
I've paid off my debt.

193
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
A talent chooses the lord
that he shall serve.

194
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,620
You know nothing about art.

195
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,980
You won't benefit

196
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,260
my career at all.

197
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,500
Want to leave?

198
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,780
No way!

199
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,660
Listen,

200
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,220
I made you famous,

201
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,500
but I can also ruin you!

202
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,580
Okay. Let's wait and see.

203
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,380
Xu Bingbing,

204
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,460
why didn't you tell us

205
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
they had a fight?

206
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,780
I thought it wasn't

207
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,740
important.

208
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,180
Besides,

209
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,860
it's not a good story.

210
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,940
I didn't want others to know.

211
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,660
My Lord.

212
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,900
Did Boss Ma

213
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,100
kill Brother Jun

214
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,460
and kill himself?

215
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm not sure.

216
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,900
When can we leave here?

217
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,260
Changjing

218
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,900
is dry and unlucky.

219
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,460
I can't stay here anymore.

220
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,060
I'll let you know

221
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,220
when you can leave.

222
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,020
Take them away.

223
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,940
Why did it suddenly start raining?

224
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,780
My Lord,

225
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,620
didn't you always carry an umbrella?

226
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,700
Little Patient.

227
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,940
Why are you here?

228
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,380
It started to rain.

229
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,420
You needed an umbrella,

230
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
so I brought it here.

231
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
Lan Che.

232
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,740
Here's another one.

233
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,380
Thanks.

234
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,140
Little Patient, let's go.

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm going back.

236
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,620
Sit straight.

237
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,500
Don't let the patient

238
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,060
see you like this.

239
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,460
It's raining hard.

240
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,940
Who will come?

241
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,140
What's wrong?

242
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,740
Did Lou Mingye piss you off?

243
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,380
Girl,

244
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,660
listen to me,

245
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,780
he's Lord Chancellor,

246
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,100
and we're just common people.

247
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,340
We have different lives.

248
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,740
So what?

249
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,740
Well, you used to be

250
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,460
happy and carefree all the time,

251
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,940
but now you're...

252
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,940
Are you sure this is the life you want?

253
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,060
I didn't expect you'd keep it

254
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,660
for so many years.

255
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,660
It was the first gift you gave me.

256
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,660
Of course I'd keep it.

257
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,740
By the way, Qingyao,

258
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,140
do you still have the luminous pearl

259
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,340
I gave you?

260
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,540
We were in a hurry

261
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,940
to escape,

262
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,700
and I lost it.

263
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,820
Sorry.

264
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,700
It's okay.

265
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,260
It's late.

266
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
Go back and rest.

267
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,140
Okay.

268
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,420
My Lord,

269
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,980
that jailer is not innocent.

270
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,820
Before Tuo Jiduo died,

271
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,700
all his family had left Changjing.

272
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
I asked around

273
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,840
and found out they left
with a remote relative.

274
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,100
What about him?

275
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,300
He had an attack

276
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,500
and died.

277
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,220
I knew it.

278
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,020
My Lord,

279
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
what should we do?

280
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,820
Do nothing.

281
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,220
I need to verify an assumption.

282
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,580
If I'm right,

283
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,620
he'll act very soon.

284
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,740
My Lord,

285
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,340
I don't know

286
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,820
if I should say this.

287
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,020
Have you ever

288
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,540
respected my opinion?

289
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,020
I think you're being

290
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,460
unfair to Lan Che.

291
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,380
You never liked her, did you?

292
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,940
I only respect the facts.

293
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,100
She's Leng Qingyao,

294
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,660
the girl I've been looking for.

295
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,860
Now I've finally found her.

296
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Shouldn't I take care of her?

297
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,980
See?

298
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,500
You're faking it again.

299
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,160
You can fool others,

300
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,380
but not me.

301
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,380
In the next few days,

302
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
I'm going to...

303
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,140
(Justice Department)

304
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,540
You're here.

305
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,300
I made some tea.

306
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,180
You can join us.

307
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,900
Qingyao,

308
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,220
why are you here?

309
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
I was too boring

310
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,340
to stay in the house,

311
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,340
so I wanted

312
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,820
to take a walk with Little Patient.

313
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,900
I don't understand the cases,

314
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
but I can make some tea

315
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,260
and get some water.

316
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,860
Lan Che,

317
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,180
you can

318
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,780
find something else

319
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,900
to do.

320
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,020
Little Patient is trying to say

321
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,140
that you're smart,

322
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,100
and you shouldn't waste your talent.

323
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,620
Maybe you can
work on cases with Lord Li.

324
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,540
Okay.

325
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,300
Anyway, I never liked

326
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,380
serving people.

327
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,380
My Lord,

328
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,300
since someone else can serve you now,

329
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
can you let me go?

330
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,580
What do you mean?

331
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,940
I want to quit.

332
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,980
Quit what?

333
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,580
I want to quit this job.

334
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,300
After all,

335
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,940
anyone can make tea

336
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,260
and serve you.

337
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,620
I don't want it.

338
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,940
Oh, no!

339
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,900
Jun Zichen's fans are making a scene.

340
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,740
They're blocking the door.

341
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,620
Our poor Zichen

342
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,140
was brutally killed on stage!

343
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,860
How can you ignore it?

344
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,780
Calm down.

345
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,940
I can totally get why you're angry.

346
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,220
Jun Zichen's death

347
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,900
is a great loss to the world.

348
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,700
I'm the leader of Greater World.

349
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,220
Trust me,

350
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,940
they're doing their best

351
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,140
to find the murderer.

352
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,180
What Greater World?

353
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,900
She's joined the Justice Department.

354
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,860
Don't listen to her!

355
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,780
Sisters, avenge Zichen!

356
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,100
Calm down!

357
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,860
Calm down!

358
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,900
They are still out there.

359
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,380
Guys, calm down!

360
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,300
Calm down!

361
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,770
Calm down! Stay back!

362
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,420
Stop!

363
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,270
Calm down!

364
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,800
Sorry!

365
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,700
His Majesty granted me the clothes.

366
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,780
It can't get dirty.

367
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,540
It's obvious from Minghe Store!

368
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,620
Are you blind?

369
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,620
What a coward!

370
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,620
Hit him!

371
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,620
Hit him!

372
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,340
Stop! Stop!

373
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,270
Horrible.

374
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,740
They're so horrible.

375
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,700
Look at you.

376
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,700
Aren't you ashamed?

377
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,220
How could you let her take it for you?

378
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm so miserable.

379
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,900
Stop criticizing me.

380
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,180
My son.

381
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,060
Let me see.

382
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,420
Are you okay?

383
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,700
Father, I'm fine.

384
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,270
Does it hurt?

385
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,280
No.

386
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,220
Everyone is here.

387
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,580
Control yourself.

388
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm embarrassed.

389
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,460
Why are you so embarrassed?

390
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,460
Shouldn't a father care about his son?

391
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,050
Where are you going?

392
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,580
Stop hiding.

393
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,220
Lord Lou has told me

394
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,180
what happened between you and Li Mo.

395
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,660
Your Highness,

396
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,060
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,340
Father,

398
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,260
Lan Che is innocent.

399
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,900
I forced her to do this

400
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,060
to deceive you.

401
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,460
Please blame me.

402
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,740
I don't blame you.

403
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,900
I won't

404
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,300
and I can't

405
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,060
bother you anymore.

406
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,820
You're on your own.

407
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,220
My Lord,

408
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,580
I heard your godfather was leaving
for Liangzhou

409
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,740
after the report,

410
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,820
but now he has to stay here

411
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
because of this case.

412
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
Yes.

413
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,260
He wants to leave

414
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,500
after this is over.

415
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,700
Solve it now.

416
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,180
Don't let them

417
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,780
turn this place into a food market.

418
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,690
So annoying!

419
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,380
Did you get hurt?

420
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,820
Do you need to see a doctor?

421
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,020
No need.

422
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,020
It's not that serious.

423
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,020
Are you okay?

424
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,540
Then I'm leaving.

425
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,500
Where are you going?

426
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,580
None of your business.

427
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,700
Lan Che!

428
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,580
My Lord.

429
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,060
I think I've paid off my debt.

430
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,180
You have no reason to keep me here.

431
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,460
I regret it.

432
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,940
Lou Mingye,

433
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,420
what's wrong with you?

434
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,940
Aren't you ashamed?

435
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,140
Is it because of Huali?

436
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,700
Yes.

437
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,700
You said you didn't

438
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,180
want to cling to the past.

439
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,460
You wanted to move on.

440
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,980
Buy you've changed

441
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,900
since she came back.

442
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,980
And I've become

443
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,820
so emotional

444
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
because of you.

445
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,420
I don't know myself anymore.

446
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,340
I just want

447
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,180
to live a happy life.

448
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,820
I don't want to get into

449
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,580
a complicated relationship

450
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,660
and waste my time.

451
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,860
No matter what you think,

452
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,540
I'm leaving anyway.

453
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,660
When this case is over...

454
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
When it's over,

455
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,660
I'll give you an answer.

456
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,140
Whatever.

457
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,500
But before that,

458
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,980
can you stay here?

459
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,900
Two people

460
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,340
of Zhubo Theater have died,

461
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,540
and we're so close to the truth.

462
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,020
Don't you want to find

463
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,060
the murderer?

464
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,580
Have you figured out who did it?

465
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,740
Not yet.

466
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,780
But I'm sure

467
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,900
Boss Ma didn't kill himself.

468
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,780
Then I'll stay here

469
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,700
for three days
to help Li Mo with the case.

470
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,700
When it's over...

471
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,940
I'll have nothing to do
with you anymore.

472
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,500
Brother Xie.

473
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,380
Bingbing.

474
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,580
You're injured.

475
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,660
Just ask them

476
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,820
to deliver the message.

477
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Why did you come?

478
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,500
I just want to see you.

479
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,740
Why are you still practicing?

480
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,780
Zhubo Theater is gone,

481
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,020
but I'm not.

482
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,940
As long as I'm alive,

483
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,620
I need to practice.

484
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,540
You really love acting.

485
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,340
How about you?

486
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,340
What's your plan?

487
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,420
I'll follow you wherever you go.

488
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,780
Now

489
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
the troupe is gone,

490
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,060
and everyone is fighting for life.

491
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,540
Follow me...

492
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,300
You're from a better family.

493
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,060
You shouldn't have

494
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,380
wandered about with us.

495
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,340
Why don't you go home

496
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,540
this time?

497
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,460
No.

498
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,180
I'll follow you wherever you go.

499
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,300
Brother Xie.

500
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,420
Actually, I came here two years ago

501
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,740
because of you.

502
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Cripple,

503
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,540
are you blind?

504
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,300
(Hongfu Private Show)
Show?

505
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,260
What are you doing?

506
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,700
If I were you,

507
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,660
I'd stay at home.

508
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,060
Stop embarrassing yourself,

509
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,700
cripple.

510
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,420
Sir, were you bitten by a dog?

511
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,820
Why are you barking here

512
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
for no reason?

513
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,820
You...

514
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,260
- Go away!
- This isn't over!

515
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,100
Are you okay?

516
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,820
Come on.

517
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,580
Be careful.

518
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,740
He was just barking.

519
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,900
Forget it.

520
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Thanks.

521
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,820
Your ticket.

522
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,780
I'm Xie Jiulian.

523
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,780
I'm also an actor.

524
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,580
Lady, you're kind.

525
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,700
If you like it,

526
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,860
I can save tickets for you.

527
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,500
Okay.

528
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,820
Are you recruiting?

529
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,220
I can work here.

530
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,980
Lady,

531
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,780
no need. We can't afford your salary.

532
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I don't need money.

533
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,260
I thought you joined us

534
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,460
because you like theater.

535
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,260
I like you.

536
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,380
Even if you quit acting,

537
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,820
I can like other things for you.

538
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,500
If you ask,

539
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,420
I can do anything for you.

540
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,180
But now

541
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,940
I want to focus on acting.

542
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
I'm not planning to

543
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,100
get married.

544
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,860
Then I can be with you

545
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,260
just like before.

546
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,500
No. It's different.

547
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,660
I can't keep you around

548
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,900
after knowing your feelings.

549
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,180
It's unfair to you.

550
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,420
Is it because of my legs?

551
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,740
- My...
- It has nothing to do with it.

552
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,980
You're not like them.

553
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,300
You're a good girl from a good family.

554
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,420
You will find a better man.

555
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,300
Why do you have to waste your time

556
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,660
on an infamous actor?

557
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,260
Listen to me.

558
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,140
Go home.

559
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,460
Brother Xie!

560
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,980
Bingbing.

561
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,420
Bingbing!

562
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,060
Why are you sitting here alone?

563
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,180
It's cold.

564
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,780
I brought some clothes.

565
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,900
How are you doing?

566
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,740
Do you need money?

567
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,020
What's wrong?

568
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,340
Did someone bully you?

569
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,060
Tell me,

570
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,300
and I'll beat him.

571
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Brother.

572
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,220
I want to go home.

573
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,020
Okay.

574
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,500
Let's go home.

575
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,860
Okay.

576
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,200
