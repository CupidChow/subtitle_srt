2
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,660
Lan Che,

4
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,100
do you think you know me?

5
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,540
Of course I do.

6
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,340
We've lived together for ten years.

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,340
Okay,

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,300
answer me.

9
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,020
What's my real name?

10
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,140
You're Huan...

11
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,780
Back then, Lou Mingye was chosen

12
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,020
as the ingredient
because he had the purest yang energy.

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,620
Tuo Jiduo

14
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,460
lured me to Lou's mansion,
claiming he needed a doctor.

15
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,020
I didn't know at first.

16
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,100
Under Tuo Jiduo's instructions,

17
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,260
I drugged Lou Mingye to cultivate him

18
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,420
to be the ingredient.

19
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,380
However, Brother Leng found out quickly

20
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,260
and told General Lou.

21
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,060
Liangzhou is my hometown.

22
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,980
I won't allow anyone

23
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,620
to stain this place.

24
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,500
I was afraid of being arrested,

25
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,420
so I informed Tuo Jiduo

26
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,180
and told him to stop.

27
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,620
However...

28
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,620
Father!

29
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,100
Father! What happened?

30
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,900
So, after informing Doctor Leng,

31
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,540
Wu Ming and I

32
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,260
ran away at night.

33
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,260
Take care of Qingyao.

34
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,780
No matter what happens,

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,620
don't come out,

36
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,530
understand?

37
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,940
So, did you adopt me

38
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,100
because you felt guilty,

39
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,820
or you were up to something else?

40
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,700
I knew this day

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,940
would come eventually.

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,260
Qingyao!

43
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,420
Later, I was so worried about you,

44
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,340
so I came back to look for you

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,980
but only to find bodies everywhere.

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,820
Qingyao!

47
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,780
Luckily,

48
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,500
I found you.

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,100
Therefore,

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,780
I changed our names

51
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,740
and came to Changjing.

52
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,180
Ten years have flown by so fast.

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,460
And I've...

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,780
really treated you

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,260
like my real daughter.

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,780
If Tuo Jiduo hadn't showed up...

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,900
I...

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,540
I even thought

59
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,820
we could

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,420
live a simple and happy life forever.

61
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,020
But you treated Lou Mingye
for a long time.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,860
Why didn't he recognize you?

63
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,540
Back then,

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,980
I was busy making medicine
in the chicken

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,460
and didn't have a chance to meet him,

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,460
so he didn't recognize me.

67
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,460
You...

68
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,860
Have you ever thought
I'd remember everything one day?

69
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,220
I did.

70
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,100
I knew

71
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,240
this day would come,

72
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,700
and I'd have to pay

73
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,700
the debt.

74
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,540
Master...

75
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,620
Stay here and cooperate with them
for investigation.

76
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,900
You're still calling me Master.

77
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,180
Okay.

78
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,780
Since

79
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,660
I've treated you well

80
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,500
over the last decade,

81
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,340
please do me a favor.

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,460
Huanxi, what are you doing?

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,300
Let me go!

84
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,980
Okay, don't hurt her!

85
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,020
Ask them to leave!

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,340
- Go!
- Stay back!

87
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,180
Calm down!

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,660
Stay back! All of you!

89
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,780
- Stay back!
- Okay!

90
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,820
Back!

91
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,500
Master, don't make it worse!

92
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,980
I wish I was only Huanxi.

93
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,900
Take care of yourself.

94
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,380
Don't make me worried.

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,380
- Go!
- Get him!

96
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,260
(Huanxi Clinic)

97
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,820
How's it going? Any information?

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,820
I've sent everyone out to look for him

99
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,140
and informed all the gangsters
in Changjing.

100
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,540
Once Huanxi shows up,

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,380
they'll tell me immediately.

102
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,700
Where's Lan Che?

103
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,580
She's out.

104
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,980
She said she needed space.

105
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,900
Isn't Lou Mingye by her side?

106
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,020
Since Master was arrested,

107
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,460
Lord Lou has never come.

108
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,460
I'll talk to him.

109
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,100
Lou Mingye!

110
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,500
You can do whatever you what,

111
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
but how can you

112
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,420
leave Lan Che alone?

113
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,500
You have no right

114
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,980
to meddle in our relationship.

115
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,820
Huanxi is missing,

116
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,100
and Lan Che is in desperation.

117
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,220
Shouldn't you be by her side?

118
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,260
Huanxi is a wanted criminal.

119
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,580
No matter what,

120
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,660
I should keep my distance with her.

121
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,740
Lou Mingye,

122
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,220
I've put up with you for a long time.

123
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,820
Do you think
I wouldn't dare to beat you?

124
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,740
Me too.

125
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,460
I've lost my patience with you.

126
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,500
If you do this again,

127
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,780
you'll be doomed.

128
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,100
(Focus on Details)

129
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,900
Li Mo.

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,500
I want

131
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,220
to talk to Lord Lou.

132
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,220
What do you want to say?

133
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,020
Why are you avoiding me?

134
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,140
I need to avoid suspicion.

135
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
You're lying.

136
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,460
What's the real reason?

137
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,860
Didn't we agree

138
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,580
to face difficulties together?

139
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,220
I don't know how much
he was involved in the case.

140
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,300
I don't know

141
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,340
if he has something to do

142
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,660
with my father's death.

143
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,180
I believe Huanxi.

144
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,620
But I only believe the evidence.

145
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,340
Lan Che.

146
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,420
We shouldn't see each other

147
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,660
until we find Huanxi.

148
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,820
They killed my father.

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,580
If Huanxi

150
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,340
really participated in the murder,

151
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,740
I wouldn't have mercy on him.

152
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,940
Okay.

153
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,060
I won't see you

154
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,300
until we find Huanxi.

155
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,260
Once you become an ingredient,

156
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,100
you're doomed to have a short life.

157
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,900
You don't have much time left.

158
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,300
Sorry.

159
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,140
General.

160
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
We found Yu Xie's traces.

161
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,460
I was right.

162
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
General,

163
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,340
I knew you wanted to see me.

164
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,860
However, you're not doing this for me

165
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,100
but for

166
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,100
the Distortion Pill, right?

167
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,580
Six months ago,

168
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,940
Lou Mingye was transferred

169
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,060
all the way from Liangzhou to Changjing

170
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,980
to investigate Carefree Powder.

171
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,900
It seemed to be a good chance

172
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,740
for him to find out

173
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,180
the truth of his father's death.

174
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,420
However,

175
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,140
you only wanted to use him

176
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,580
to find Carefree Powder's recipe

177
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,540
Wu Ming took away back then.

178
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,340
Therefore,

179
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,780
after Wu Ming was arrested,

180
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
you reported to the emperor in advance.

181
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,820
However, you didn't expect

182
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,940
he'd be killed

183
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,820
on the way

184
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,660
to prison.

185
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,540
Yu Xie.

186
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,020
You're full of lies.

187
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,900
Don't you fear death?

188
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,100
You tried hard to arrest me

189
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,620
but didn't expose my identity
in front of them

190
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,980
because only Wu Ming and I

191
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,540
knew how to make the drug.

192
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,100
Since Wu Ming died,

193
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,580
I've become

194
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,300
the only drug maker in this world.

195
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
At this point,

196
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,220
I'll be honest with you.

197
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Give me the recipes of
Carefree Powder and Oblivion Drug,

198
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,940
and I'll spare your life.

199
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,660
I've always known

200
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,780
you're the one

201
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,020
who can ensure my safety.

202
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,060
That's my offer.

203
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,460
What about yours?

204
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,460
I'm just being cautious.

205
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Give us the recipes,

206
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,940
or I'll kill you right now!

207
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
If you kill me,

208
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,100
who will make the drug for General.

209
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,180
Yu Xie.

210
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,820
You know me well.

211
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,540
Don't try to play tricks.

212
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,340
Think about

213
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,780
the consequences.

214
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,980
You're all here.

215
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,820
Mingye?

216
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,180
Did you sell me out?

217
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,340
Huanxi,

218
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,500
you made illegal drugs

219
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,180
and escaped the prison.

220
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,940
Where do you want to go?

221
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,860
Guards!

222
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,620
Arrest Yu Xie.

223
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,500
- Aye.
- Stop.

224
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,860
Where are they?

225
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,140
Where are they?

226
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,980
Lord Li, an hour ago,

227
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,660
Lord Lou took every to arrest Yu Xie.

228
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,340
Oh, no, I need to tell Lan Che!

229
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,740
Mingye, stay out of this.

230
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,220
I'll take him back to Liangzhou.

231
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,900
Father, do you want to convict him

232
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,620
or make a deal with him

233
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,420
for the recipes?

234
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,780
Shut up!

235
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,540
Family can't beat the law.

236
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,500
I must

237
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,700
take him back to the Justice Department.

238
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,980
Lord Lou.

239
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,900
General Huo
is the governor of Liangzhou,

240
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,060
and you're just a Lord Chancellor.

241
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,380
If the court finds out,

242
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,980
do you think

243
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,820
you can be the winner?

244
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,500
I underestimated you.

245
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,620
I just

246
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,510
want to live.

247
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,860
You've lost the chance.

248
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,620
Right there.

249
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,660
Let's go.

250
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,940
I must

251
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,140
take him back today.

252
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,500
Take him down!

253
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,940
Lou Mingye committed murder.

254
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,140
- Arrest him!
- Aye!

255
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,220
Lou Mingye, stop!

256
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,980
Huali?

257
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,100
I'll help you.

258
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Help! I can't swim!

259
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,300
Help!

260
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,060
Li Mo.

261
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,220
Li Mo, wake up!

262
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
Wake up!

263
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,940
Li Mo!

264
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,740
Li Mo!

265
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,900
You're awake.

266
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,660
(She can't be simple.)

267
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,300
(I can't let her run away.)

268
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,380
Stop looking, or I'll rip

269
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,220
your eyes out.

270
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,580
Who are you?

271
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,700
Take a guess.

272
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,700
You work for Huo Feng.

273
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,740
If I worked for him,

274
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,300
I would've left you behind

275
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,580
to catch Lou Mingye.

276
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,700
Oh,

277
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,260
it makes sense.

278
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,060
But why do you know so much

279
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,540
about Lou Mingye's childhood?

280
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,180
Want to know?

281
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,260
Let's exchange our secrets.

282
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,660
That's all? Just ask me.

283
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,260
Never mind.

284
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,100
You're just

285
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,260
a simple person.

286
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
You don't have any valuable secrets.

287
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,740
Pretty as you are,

288
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,860
why are you so mean?

289
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,940
What a glib.

290
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,700
I'm a glib?

291
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,860
(Huanxi Clinic)

292
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,500

293
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,540
You're awake.

294
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,220
Boss, Boss!

295
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,100
Where's Master?

296
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,140
I just want you

297
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,220
to live a happy life.

298
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,980
Listen to me.

299
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,260
He's Lord Chancellor,

300
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,300
and we're just common people.

301
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,580
We have different lives.

302
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,260
Why?

303
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,460
Why?

304
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,620
Why?

305
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,140
Why?

306
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,810
Why?

(The Wanted)

308
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,500
What's happening?

309
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,460
- No idea.
- Check it out.

310
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,380
What happened?

311
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,140
Lou Mingye is the criminal.

312
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,060
Keep your eyes open.

313
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,580
We have to catch him!

314
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,740
Aye!

(Justice Department)

316
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,420
- Lord Li.
- Go on with your work.

317
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,940
My Lord.

318
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,540
My Lord!

319
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,540
It's late. Why are you still here?

320
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,860
I don't have anything to do.

321
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,660
I'll review the old cases.

322
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,250
You must be tired. Take a break.

323
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,100
Thanks, My Lord.

324
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,110
Let's go.

(Fairness and Integrity)

326
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,100
Do you smell something?

327
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,700
Yes, what is it?

328
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,380
The morgue is on fire! Put it out!

329
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,580
Hurry! Water!

330
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,180
Put out the fire!

331
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,940
Burned?

332
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,970
Yes. I heard the coroner
knocked over the oil lamp

333
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,340
and caused the fire.

334
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,700
Let's check it out.

335
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Be careful.

336
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,200
Guys, be careful.

337
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,320
My Lord.

338
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,260
My Lord.

339
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,260
It seems it's not easy

340
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,980
to be the Acting

341
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,940
Lord Chancellor.

342
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,060
General,

343
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,820
you're well-informed.

344
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,260
We just put out the fire,

345
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,420
and here you are.

346
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,100
My Lord, why are you so nervous?

347
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,860
Are you hiding

348
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,340
something in the Justice Department?

349
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,540
What are you talking about?

350
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,660
I don't understand.

351
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,900
The criminal Yu Xie

352
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,140
is an important witness
of Distortion Pill's Case.

353
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,940
He died today,

354
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,540
and

355
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,260
the morgue was on fire tonight.

356
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,620
I think

357
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,580
someone put on a show

358
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,420
to transfer the body.

359
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,100
Ridiculous.

360
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,860
Do you have proof?

361
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,460
Then,

362
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,100
My Lord,

363
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,340
please count the bodies

364
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,580
in front of me.

365
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,140
Here's

366
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,340
the register of corpses.

367
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,700
Check it out.

368
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,500
Seven corpses were registered

369
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,260
in the morgue.

370
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,740
But there are only six bodies.

371
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,380
My Lord.

372
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,740
How do you explain this?

373
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,980
What took you so long?

374
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,940
Move it.

375
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,780
My Lord, we've moved all the corpses.

376
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,300
General,

377
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,940
you know Yu Xie well.

378
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,020
You should recognize

379
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,300
this tiger pendant, right?

380
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
General.

381
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,700
Just a heads-up.

382
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,020
This is the Justice Department

383
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,060
instead of your hometown.

384
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
No matter what,

385
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,140
you don't get to tell us what to do.

386
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,940
Behave yourself.

387
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,820
If this gets out

388
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,860
and let them find out what you did,

389
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,020
you'll be in trouble.

390
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,820
No wonder you're King of Yan's son.

391
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,940
Don't go too far.

392
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,500
I'm doing this for Lan Che.

393
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,460
But I can't explain everything
right now.

394
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,500
What can I do for you?

395
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,300
I want to set fire

396
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,780
to the morgue.

397
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,300
Lou Mingye,

398
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,980
if I find out you lied,

399
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,020
I'll kill you.

400
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,140
General.

401
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,940
General,

402
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,780
why didn't you check the body?

403
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,940
There are rumors about us

404
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,500
in the imperial court.

405
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,020
If I insisted on checking the body,

406
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,660
they'd know the rumors are real.

407
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,020
Right now,

408
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,980
my good son has got the recipes

409
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,940
of Carefree Powder and Oblivion Drug.

410
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,820
We must find him first.

411
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,660
But you know what he's capable of.

412
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,060
If he really wants to escape,

413
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,780
I'm afraid no one can find him.

414
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,900
In the past,

415
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,740
there was nothing we could do.

416
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,100
But it's different now.

417
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,660
He has a weakness.

418
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,260
Let's go.
