Are you blin...

5
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,220
Brother Xu.

6
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,090
It's you.

7
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,020
Lord Li.

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,460
Why are you

9
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,470
in a hurry?

10
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,240
Lord Lou just came back to work.

11
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,580
I want to show him

12
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,430
the cases he missed.

13
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,400
He's not here.

14
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,770
Why don't we solve these cases?

15
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,320
- What?
- What?

16
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,530
But...

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,960
But what?

18
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,940
I heard what Lou Mingye said

19
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,320
about us.

20
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,790
He said you were temporizing

21
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,190
and called me

22
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,040
an idiot.

23
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,630
How could he say that?

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,810
He said it to provoke Huo Feng.

25
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,320
Anyway, he shouldn't have said it.

26
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,350
Lou Mingye thinks

27
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,070
the Justice Department
can't survive without him.

28
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,190
We should work hard

29
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,400
and solve some cases to prove ourselves.

30
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,330
Okay.

31
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,350
Let's do it!

32
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,710
- Let's go.
- Wait.

33
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,040
It's his first day back to work.

34
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,430
Where is he?

35
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,040
Don't ask.

36
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,630

Lan Che,

38
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,710
I promise

39
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,600
I won't lie to you anymore.

40
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,810
Actually, it's not my idea

41
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,190
to fake Huanxi's death.

42
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,190
Who else could it be?

43
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,990
It's Huanxi's idea.

44
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,270
How dare he lie to me?

45
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,480
You're not innocent either!

46
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,060
- My Lord, please go back.
- Please go back.

47
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,040
Just go.

48
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,690
My Lord,

49
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,430
maybe we should just break in.

50
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,850
If you're not tough enough,

51
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,350
she'll go too far.

52
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,460
You go first.

53

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,110

55
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,230

what kind of novels would you like?

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,530
Love stories.

68
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,450
Oh, love stories.

69

89
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,800
fond of folklores.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,340
You... You're mistaken.

91
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,180
What?

92
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,900
Not him?

93
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,480
Why are you so embarrassed?

94
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,800

I did,

108
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,880
but you were so obsessed and ignored me.

109
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,780

the approaches in this book

112
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,360
will work?

Then...

116
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,040
Give it a try?

Yes.

119
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,800

Now I'm giving them to you.

385
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,800
From now on,

386
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,960
you'll be responsible for me.

387
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,230
Maybe not.

388
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,110
I don't understand this.

389
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,300
If you give them to me,

390
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,800
I'll lose all of them.

391
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,590
It doesn't matter.

392
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,870
No.

393
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,750
What if I leave you

394
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,750
one day?

395
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,040
You'll need them

396
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,160
to marry someone else.

397
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,660
Don't you dare.

398
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,750
I'm just kidding.

399
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,040
Take it.

400
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,560
Okay.

401
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,110
I'll take it.

402
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,440
Are you satisfied?

403
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,510
It's a good day.

404
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,620
My Lord,

405
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,620
are you in the mood

406
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,320
for our latest show?

407
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,380
Okay.

408
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,340
Okay.

409
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,210
Then let's

410
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,160
get it started.

411
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,380
(Huanxi Clinic)

412
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,590
Master,

413
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,750
are you waiting for me?

414
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,990
I want to ask you something.

415
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,200
Do you and Lou Mingye

416
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,720
have a plan?

417
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,230
What plan?

418
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,750
Look,

419
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,920
you're stuck together all the time.

420
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,580
Have you decided

421
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,750
to marry him?

422
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,590
Lord Lou...

423
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,040
is good to me.

424
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,390
I don't want to fail him.

425
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,160
- Master.
- Yes.

426
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,960
I need to do something.

427
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,020
(Lou's Mansion)

428
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,870
What's wrong with you lately?

429
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,630
You're absent-minded.

430
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,260
My Lord,

431
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,010
do you think I don't know

432
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,720
why you gave your properties to Lan Che?

433
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,470
How about Huo Feng's allies?

434
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,510
We've arrested all of them.

435
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,560
It's almost over.

436
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,470
You need to remember one thing.

437
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,630
When I'm gone,

438
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,320
take care of Huanxi Clinic for me,

439
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,780
especially Lan Che.

440
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,040
Don't let anyone bully her.

441
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,440
My Lord!

442
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,800
Please don't go!

443
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,840
My Lord!

444
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,940
My Lord!

445
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,870
My Lord!

446
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,800
Here. Be careful.

447
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,800
What are you doing?

448
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,850
We're officially

449
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,560
paying you the bride price.

450
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,750
Lord Lou, marry our boss!

451
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,080
Lou Mingye.

452
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,720
Say yes!

453
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,320
Don't embarrass me.

454
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,040
Marriage is not a game.

455
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,040
Have you made up your mind?

456
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,570
Yes.

457
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,590
I'm sure about this.

458
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,040
Anyway,

459
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,800
you have to

460
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,960
marry me.

461
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,750
Otherwise, I'll kidnap you
and throw you into bed.

462
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,720
You can't always be
the one in control.

463
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,870
Lou Mingye.

464
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,270
Don't make me regret this, okay?

465
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,350
Okay.
