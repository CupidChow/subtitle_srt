00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,540
(Blessed Mountain and White Clouds)

4
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,300
Lan Che,

5
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,900
don't work so hard.

6
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,100
Health is the top priority.

7
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,610
There are always

8
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,180
cases to be solved.

9
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,860
Lord Xu,

10
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,690
do you have good news?

11
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,330
Why are you so happy?

12
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,690
Bingbing

13
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,770
is going home!

14
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,330
Really?

15
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,100
Congratulations on your reunion.

16
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,100
Lord Xu,

17
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,740
the victim of the burglary will

18
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,660
identify the goods.

19
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm on it.

20
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,970
I copied a key
for Bingbing this morning.

21
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,330
I was in a hurry

22
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,330
and took the wrong key.

23
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,700
Well, let's finish the file first and

24
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,730
verify the goods later.

25
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,900
- Aye.
- Let's go.

26
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,610
My Lord.

27
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,580
Something's wrong.

28
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,050
I think Jun Zichen never wrote
Jiudu Mountains.

29
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,410
Look.

30
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,130
Isn't this the script
of Jiudu Mountains?

31
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,970
Yes.

32
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,690
The handwriting is good.

33
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,850
I didn't expect him
to be good at handwriting.

34
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,300
Check this out.

35
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,850
This is

36
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,130
a letter from Xie Jiulian's fan.

37
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,260
It's signed Shiqiao Spring.

38
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,050
Look carefully.

39
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,460
(Yuan)

40
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,330
Why are they

41
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,860
so familiar?

42
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,980
Not just familiar.

43
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,770
They're exactly the same.

44
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,700
I wasn't sure about it

45
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,160
until I saw this.

46
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,700
The character Yuan was misspelled.

47
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,210
(Yuan)
A stroke is missing.

48
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,010
(Yuan)
This one too.

49
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,980
Yuan is not a rare character.

50
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,100
Same handwriting and mistakes.

51
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,020
It can't be a coincidence.

52
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,980
I get it.

53
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,500
Jun Zichen seemed to have a grudge
against Xie Jiulian,

54
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,420
but in fact, he admired Xie Jiulian

55
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,500
and was his biggest fan.

56
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,900
Am I wrong?

57
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,940
I think

58
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,740
this script

59
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,580
wasn't from Jun Zichen,

60
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,300
and Shiqiao Spring

61
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
is the real author of Jiudu Mountains.

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
No matter what,

63
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,740
we need to ask Xie Jiulian.

64
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,940
Then let's go.

65
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,060
Lan Che.

66
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,740
You stayed up all night

67
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,700
reviewing the evidence.

68
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,020
Maybe

69
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,620
you should take a break.

70
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,020
No need.

71
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,060
I want to finish it as soon as I can.

72
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,300
Okay.

73
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,740
Stay here for tonight.

74
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,940
We'll be right back.

75
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,300
Be careful.

76
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,380
(Justice Department)

77
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
What are you doing?

78
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,740
Lord Li, Lord Lou,

79
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,940
the crazy fans got the plaque dirty.

80
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,260
I'm

81
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,460
cleaning it up.

82
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,940
Good.

83
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,900
What are you thinking?

84
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,940
Let's go.

85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,660
Talk to Xie Jiulian.

86
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,340
I have to verify something else.

87
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
Let's go.

88
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,580
I thought we'd make a name
with Jiudu Mountains,

89
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,900
but it turns out to be our last show.

90
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,900
Brother Xie,

91
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,020
what's your plan?

92
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,540
Acting is the only thing

93
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,180
I'm good at.

94
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm going back to my hometown

95
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,020
to get married

96
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
and build a family.

97
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,180
But if you leave,

98
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,540
our group won't exist anymore.

99
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,260
Jiulian!

100
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,220
Wait!

101
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,420
It's you again.

102
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,260
Jiulian,

103
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,980
we need to ask you something.

104
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,260
Did Jun Zichen

105
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,260
really write Jiudu Mountains?

106
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,060
How should I know?

107
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,460
Do you think we were so close

108
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,780
that he'd tell me everything?

109
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,780
And Shiqiao Spring?

110
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,580
I remember

111
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,220
she's my fan.

112
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,700
She can identify a talent.

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
She's been

114
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,660
writing to me since two years ago

115
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,500
when I was

116
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,740
still a nobody.

117
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,620
Have you found out

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,140
Shiqiao Spring's handwriting

119
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,980
is the same as the script?

120
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,860
I'm just an actor

121
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,300
without much education.

122
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,620
Why would I

123
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,980
notice the handwriting?

124
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,540
Shiqiao Spring knows you very well.

125
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,740
She knows what you're

126
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,980
doing and where you are.

127
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,820
She must be around you.

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,140
Is there anyone

129
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,140
who cares about you a lot?

130
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,980
What?

131
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,420
We all live together.

132
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,100
If we like someone,

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,300
we'll tell that person.

134
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,460
Who'd write a letter?

135
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,500
Did something occur to you?

136
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,620
My Lord.

137
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,660
Zhubo Theater is leaving.

138
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Why are you still here?

139
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,300
What Zhubo Theater?

140
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,780
We're now separated.

141
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,940
My Lord, are you looking for my brother?

142
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm looking for you.

143
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,300
Even if Shiqiao Spring is Xu Bingbing,

144
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,740
we can't prove

145
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,780
she has something to do

146
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,220
with their deaths.

147
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,660
But if she wrote Jiudu Mountains

148
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,500
and liked Xie Jiulian,

149
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,740
why would she help Jun Zichen
to deceive others?

150
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,540
Why can't I clean this up?

151
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,900
Lord Xu.

152
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,740
We want to ask Xu Bingbing

153
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,420
a few questions about Zhubo Theater.

154
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,460
Is she home?

155
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,540
She just left after sending the key.

156
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,300
Didn't you meet her?

157
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,820
Did she get in?

158
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
I was hanging the plaque,

159
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,120
so I asked her to leave the key here.

160
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,380
Did anyone else come?

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
No.

162
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,540
She'd stayed here until I came back.

163
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,020
Okay.

164
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,900
Go ahead.

165
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,820
Okay.

166
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,620
What's wrong?

167
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,180
Look at the footprints.

168
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,540
They're obviously from a woman.

169
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
But he said no one else came.

170
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,660
They must be Xu Bingbing's footprints.

171
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,660
It's been empty for so long.

172
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,980
There's no water in the pot.

173
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,460
I'm crippled,

174
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,980
so I always carry a jug.

175
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,580
My Lord, do you mind?

176
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,060
My Lord, why do you

177
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,620
want to talk to me?

178
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,620
I've heard you're intelligent,

179
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,260
so I want to ask you

180
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,300
about a character.

181
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,900
As far as I know,

182
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,260
your father used to work
in the Ministry of Punishment,

183
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,100
and his name is Yuanzhi.

184
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
Yes.

185
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,100
Therefore,

186
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,180
when writing a character
containing his name,

187
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,660
you'll miss a stroke

188
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,260
to express condolences.

189
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,500
But isn't it too decisive

190
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,580
to conclude that I wrote it

191
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,100
just because of the character Yuan?

192
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm sure you've written many letters
to your family.

193
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,180
If you don't admit it,

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,500
why don't we

195
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,780
compare it with those letters?

196
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,020
My Lord, you're right.

197
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,220
I'm Shiqiao Spring,

198
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,500
and I like Xie Jiulian.

199
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,260
But am I wrong?

200
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,100
You can like Xie Jiulian as you want,

201
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,020
but you shouldn't have

202
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,060
killed innocent people for him.

203
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,580
But

204
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,260
if she only has one broken leg,

205
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,540
one of the footprints

206
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,220
should be shallower.

207
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Look at this.

208
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,820
They're the same.

209
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,500
Oh, no.

210
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,500
Did Xu Bingbing pretend to be crippled?

211
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,820
Your leg is already healed.

212
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,140
At the door of the Justice Department,

213
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,460
I saw them lower the plaque.

214
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,020
A simple lifting device

215
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,180
can help one lift heavy objects easily.

216
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,020
And it was the device

217
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,060
that helped me figure out

218
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,340
the mystery of Boss Ma's death.

219
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,020
What's the stain

220
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,180
on the white silk he used

221
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,460
to hang himself?

222
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,580
It's the mark of your wheelchair.

223
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,900
That day,

224
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,060
you drugged him

225
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,700
and made a simple

226
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,780
lifting device with your wheelchair.

227
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,820
However, it couldn't lift him up
to the beam,

228
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,180
so you placed

229
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,980
his body on the ground

230
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,340
and made it look like

231
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,380
the knot broke by accident.

232
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,380
You've stopped using the wheelchair

233
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,180
since Boss Ma died.

234
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,580
I'm sure you couldn't reinstall it

235
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,980
after using it.

236
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,260
If I go to your room,

237
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,980
I'll find a half-finished wheelchair.

238
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,060
Since you're convinced
that I'm the murderer,

239
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,180
why don't you arrest me now?

240
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,540
Because you're Xu Chaozhi's sister.

241
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,180
I didn't expect
the famous Ruthless Judge

242
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,060
to be so kindhearted.

243
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,300
Don't you want to know

244
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,180
why I was looking for you?

245
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,940
I also want to tell you something.

246
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,460
Let's go somewhere else.

247
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,900
Lou Mingye,

248
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,900
you're

249
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,460
the real priceless treasure.

250
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
Lan Che,

251
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,300
go to the Zhubo Theater.

252
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,820
Lord Xu,

253
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,420
let's go to your house

254
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,620
to ask her a few questions.

255
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,100
Okay.

256
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,180
Let's go.

257
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,420
Let's go.

258
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,540
Lou Mingye.

259
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,180
Lou Mingye, wake up!

260
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,220
Lou Mingye!

261
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
Lou Mingye!

262
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,580
I really underestimated you,

263
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,620
Lan Che.

264
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Xu Bingbing,

265
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,460
what do you want?

266
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,940
I can't believe you figured it all out.

267
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,460
Why did you pretend to be crippled?

268
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,420
You wanted to be able to walk, right?

269
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,140
Because only in this way

270
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,940
can Jiulian take care of me more.

271
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,820
Jiulian looks mean,

272
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,980
but he's very kind.

273
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,260
He even made

274
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,060
this chair for me.

275
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,710
Bingbing,

276
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,140
since you...

277
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,220
What?

278
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,540
Since you like Xie Jiulian so much,

279
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,620
why did you write plays for Jun Zichen?

280
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,060
Wrote plays? He couldn't even read!

281
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,020
I couldn't walk at first,

282
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,780
and Boss Ma didn't like me.

283
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,980
To stay in Zhubo Theater,

284
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,380
I had to sign Jun Zichen's name

285
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,980
on my plays.

286
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,540
But they had no idea

287
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
I wrote them for Xie Jiulian.

288
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
So, you killed them all for that?

289
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,340
Didn't they deserve to die?

290
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,980
Jun Zichen took everything
from my Jiulian.

291
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,860
He got everything!

292
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
How dare he leave the troupe?

293
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,060
It was Jiulian's favorite place.

294
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,100
They should go to hell!

295
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,540
Unfortunately,

296
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,940
after all I've done for him,

297
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,300
he still doesn't like me.

298
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,260
But it doesn't matter.

299
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
If I can get his blood

300
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,820
and make the Distortion Pill,

301
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,900
Jiulian will stay with me forever.

302
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,700
How did you know

303
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Distortion Pill?

304
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,380
After I killed Jun Zichen,

305
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,860
a masked man

306
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,260
came to my room.

307
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,500
He promised

308
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,220
if I help him,

309
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,300
he'll give me anything I want.

310
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,100
By then,

311
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,900
I'll stay with Jiulian forever!

312
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,220
Did he tell you

313
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,500
to get Lou Mingye's blood?

314
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,540
Yes.

315
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,540
After all,

316
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,620
he's the third ingredient
of Distortion Pill.

317
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,300
Use human blood to make medicine.

318
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,220
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not!

319
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,140
I need the blood
with the purest yang energy.

320
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
I've always known you're the person.

321
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,460
Even if you get my blood,

322
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,740
you won't be able to make it.

323
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,540
I put a fake recipe

324
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
in the library.

325
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,980
I'm the only one who knows

326
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,700
the recipe of Carefree Powder.

327
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Lou Mingye.

328
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,220
My Lord.

329
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,420
Lan Che!

330
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,060
Lan Che!

331
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,900
(Huanxi Clinic)

332
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
The wound on her arm isn't serious,

333
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,340
but

334
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,700
the knife has poison.

335
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,860
Doctor, can you cure it?

336
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
My Lord, don't worry.

337
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,700
I'll do my best to save Lan Che.

338
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,260
Thanks, doctor.

339
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,820
Xu Bingbing is so vicious.

340
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,620
She poisoned the knife.

341
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,620
After all,

342
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,020
he's the third ingredient
of Distortion Pill.

343
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,900
Where's Xu Chaozhi?

344
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,100
He's looking for Xu Bingbing.

345
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,780
He swore he'd get her back.

346
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,940
Send more people.

347
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,380
We must find her

348
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,780
as soon as possible?

349
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,940
Do you think

350
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
someone wants to kill her?

351
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,100
If she only wanted my blood,

352
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,700
why would she poison the knife?

353
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,620
It's a luminous pearl.

354
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,940
Little Patient.

355
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,980
We're leaving very soon.

356
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,220
It can keep you company for me.

357
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
You won't be alone.

358
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,820
I'll be waiting for you.

359
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,060
What's happening?

360
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,780
Isn't it

361
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
a token between Lord Lou and Qingyao?

362
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,510
Why did I dream about it?

363
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
How do you feel?

364
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,860
Are you okay?

365
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,340
I'm fine.

366
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,020
Just a little dizzy.

367
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,340
Huanxi has done acupuncture for you.

368
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,580
It'll take a few days

369
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,180
for you to recover.

370
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,460
Where's Xu Bingbing?

371
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,180
Have you found her?

372
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,380
Not yet.

373
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,380
It doesn't matter.

374
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,940
You only need to focus on your recovery.

375
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,780
Are you hungry?

376
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,140
What do you want?

377
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
I'll ask them to cook.

378
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,780
I'm not hungry.

379
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,700
Are you thirsty?

380
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,220
I'll get some water.

381
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,380
My Lord.

382
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,460
Why are you suddenly so good to me?

383
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,260
I'm not used to it.

384
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,260
I was too careless.

385
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,160
If it wasn't for me,

386
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,980
you wouldn't get hurt.

387
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,900
It's okay.

388
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,660
Forget about what happened

389
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,820
at Zhubo Theater.

390
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,460
At that point,

391
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,540
any colleague

392
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,460
would do the same.

393
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,940
Besides, you saved me many times.

394
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
I can finally

395
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,020
pay you back.

396
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Lan Che...

397
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,970
Stop.

398
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,380
I've heard enough.

399
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,360
Do you remember?

400
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,660
When this case is over,

401
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,740
you'll no longer be my boss.

402
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,660
Now we've found the murderer.

403
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,340
It's time

404
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,620
to keep the promise.

405
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,980
I'm so tired...

406
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
I want to sleep.

407
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,820
Rest well.

408
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,740
If you need anything,

409
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,620
just tell me.
