00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,970
(Yuyan Tower)

4
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,500
Please come in.

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,190
Come on. Welcome the guests.

6
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,750
Over there.

7
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
- Who are you?
- Girl,

8
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,680
are you in the right place?

9
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,970
It's not a place

10
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,400
for women.

11
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,840
I'm not here to have fun.

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,580
Is Hu Zhi in there?

13
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,260
Lady Hu Zhi

14
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,260
is the most popular girl here.

15
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,540
The entire city

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,620
wants to see her.

17
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,300
I suggest you get in line.

18
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,420
Hu Zhi. Hu Zhi.

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,420
Are you in there?

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,500
Hu Zhi. Hu Zhi!

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,620
Who is this unruly girl?

22
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,380
Guards. Kick her out!

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,380
Hu...

24
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,500
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,220
- Get out.
- Don't touch her.

26
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,980
Everyone here is our guest.

27
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,700
Don't spoil the fun.

28
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,060
My Lady, you must
have something important.

29
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,900
Come with me.

30
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Since it's this lady
who wants to see me,

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,260
My Lord, please stay here.

32
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,580
Don't worry.

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
This way.

34
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,100
Have a seat.

35
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,460
Tell me who Wu Ming is,

36
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,580
and I'll spare your life.

37
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,580
Beautiful lady,

38
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,860
I'll make it clear.

39
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,300
What's your relationship
with Chen Zhisong?

40
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,980
He came here a few times
when he was alive.

41
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,540
We met before.

42
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,060
Have some tea.

43
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Only

44
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,820
met each other?

45
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,620
What else could it be?

46
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,100
Did he

47
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,660
give you

48
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,420
a deed of a house in Datong District?

49
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,660
I've never seen Wu Ming.

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,060
He never shows up.

51
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,700
We have a contact person.

52
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,300
Who?

53
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,740
Yuyan Tower,

54
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,980
Hu Zhi.

55
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,460
What did you do?

56
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,140
I messed it up.

57
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,020
I can't face you.

58
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,740
Take off your mask first.

59
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,740
Surprise.

60
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,980
Master Lan,

61
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,700
aren't you the famous Know-it-all?

62
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,660
Why can't you get a simple deed?

63
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,300
You can't blame me for that.

64
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,460
It's all because of Hu Zhi.

65
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,940
She insisted she wanted

66
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,700
to meet you, the generous lord.

67
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,660
I'll take it from here.

68
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,820
It's not your problem.

69
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,620
- But I...
- If you want to get the deed,

70
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,980
go home and wait.

71
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
Stay out of it.

72
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,980
I can stay out of it,

73
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,220
but why are you so mean?

74
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,740
What a capricious man.

75
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,340
My Lady,

76
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,620
why didn't you kill that girl?

77
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,620
She doesn't seem

78
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,500
to know anything.

79
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,820
However,

80
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,860
it doesn't mean

81
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,060
the person behind her
doesn't know anything either.

82
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,260
What should we do?

83
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,940
No rush.

84
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,460
I think

85
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,140
I'll see that person very soon.

86
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,300
(Justice Department)

87
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,540
Tell us.

88
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,820
Did you kill Chen Zhisong?

89
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,020
My Lord, Mrs. Chen and the butler
have admitted

90
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
that they knew

91
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,860
Chen Zhisong was selling
Carefree Powder,

92
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,540
but they didn't kill him.

93
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,540
When he was killed,

94
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,180
they were messing around together.

95
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,500
Convict them of withholding information.

96
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,340
Aye.

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,340
Chen Zhisong...

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,580
We didn't kill him.

99
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Where's Wu Ming?

100
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
Remember anything?

101
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,380
You took my daughter!

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,780
I can let her go,

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,500
but do you think

104
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,940
Wu Ming will let her go?

105
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,340
Yuyan Tower

106
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,340
holds Langyuan Conference regularly

107
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,260
for its big clients,

108
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,940
and Wu Ming

109
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,180
shows up every time.

110
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,620
When's the next Langyuan Conference?

111
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,660
Tonight.

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Are you going to Yuyan Tower
to steal the deed tonight?

113
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,620
Lou Mingye is not reliable.

114
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,180
He wanted 3000 taels of silver.

115
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,300
Am I an idiot?

116
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,060
I can buy the entire Changle Street.

117
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,700
In my opinion,

118
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,580
we should

119
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,820
just steal it.

120
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,500
Lord Lou stopped you

121
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,100
because he knew it'd be dangerous.

122
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,980
In a place like Yuyan Tower,

123
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,500
he should be the one

124
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,460
in danger.

125
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,060
We should never count on others.

126
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,780
Lou Mingye is not reliable.

127
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
Why don't we help ourselves?

128
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,380
Besides,

129
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,020
I've never

130
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,740
been to Yuyan Tower.

131
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,660
Look at you!

132
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,220
You'll definitely get stuck in there.

133
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,100
Enough. Stop.

134
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,380
Anyway,

135
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,980
we must be

136
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,580
prepared for tonight.

137
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,260
Prepared for what?

138
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,180
Master. Of course we're

139
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,260
preparing for our work.

140
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,300
I'm warning you.

141
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,260
Don't cause any trouble again.

142
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,620
How's that possible?

143
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,500
We'll stay here tonight.

144
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,780
We won't go anywhere.

145
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,260
Boss, don't worry. I...

146
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,780
It's complicated.

147
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,940
That's right.

148
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,260
Boss,

149
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,380
you have our support.

150
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Mine too.

151
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,420
Tonight,

152
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
the Greater World

153
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
will make it.

154
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,260
Come out.

155
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,540
What's wrong

156
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,980
with the Greater World tonight?

157
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,380
Didn't you say we'd do something big
in Yuyan Tower?

158
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,940
We'll risk our lives to get you in.

159
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,140
Risk your lives?

160
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,180
Do you know anything about it?

161
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,380
Do you think

162
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,540
you have to risk your lives?

163
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,780
Then how can we get in?

164
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,610
(Yuyan Tower)
- My Lord. - Please Come in.

165
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,340
Please come in.

166
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,100
Remember to greet every guest

167
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,900
when they arrive.

168
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,340
My Lord, you don't look familiar.

169
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,980
Is this your first time?

170
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,140
Mother,

171
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,380
You're so forgetful, aren't you?

172
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,260
I just sent

173
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,540
a pair of Blessed Jades to Lady Ruyu
last month.

174
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,980
Don't you remember?

175
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm so forgetful.

176
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,340
That's right.

177
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,580
Come on.

178
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,020
Take care of our guests.

179
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,260
Let's split up.

180
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,680
Come in.

181
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,420
My Lord, enjoy your time here.

182
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,860
Who said he'd get stuck in here?

183
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,980
Don't judge a book by its cover.

184
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,380
Langyuan Conference is about to start.

185
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,820
Let's go upstairs.

186
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,980
Please show me your badge.

187
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,180
Langyuan Conference

188
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,060
requires a badge.

189
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,460
What's going on?

190
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,420
Are you blind?

191
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,940
My Lord, I'm so sorry.

192
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,740
Where's your badge?

193
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,300
Is this yours?

194
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,460
Are you Li Tiegen?

195
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,740
Where's my badge?

196
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,980
He stole my badge!

197
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,500
Stop! Don't run!

198
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,340
- There's a thief.
- Stop!

199
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,490
- Go get him.
- Don't run!

200
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,140
What are you looking at?

201
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,780
Are you blind or something?

202
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,620
So clumsy.

203
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,140
If it weren't for the mission,

204
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,540
I'd knock your head off!

205
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,340
Didn't you come this afternoon?

206
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,300
Who let you in?

207
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,740
It's you!

208
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,740
Stop!

209
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,420
I was wondering why you looked familiar.

210
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,260
You're here for the deed, right?

211
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,580
You two, take her down.

212
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,300
Wait a minute.

213
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,220
I was wondering

214
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,540
why Lord Tuoba cared about the old house

215
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,020
in Datong District so much.

216
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,260
It turns out
you're up to something else.

217
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,810
Lord Tuoba,

218
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,860
she must work for you, right?

219
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,740
You're wrong.

220
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,180
She doesn't.

221
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,260
(How can he sell me out?)

222
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,820
My Lord,

223
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,700
you haven't officially hired me,

224
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,340
but didn't we have a deal?

225
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,500
Langyuan Conference

226
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,820
is my final test.

227
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,660
If I pass it,

228
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,060
I'll be your assistant,

229
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,660
right?

230
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,660
(Test?)

231
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,500
(What do you want?)

232
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,860
(They're getting suspicious.)

233
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,260
(It's up to you.)

234
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,380
(Act first, report later.)

235
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,580
(You're doing this again.)

236
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,700
(I can sell you out too.)

237
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,700
(Don't you dare.)

238
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,700
(Then try me.)

239
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,100
I came from Liangzhou,

240
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,980
so I didn't know the rules.

241
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Sorry for your trouble.

242
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,500
Since it's a misunderstanding,

243
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,740
Mother, please take them to their seats.

244
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,660
Langyuan Conference is about to start.

245
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,780
Come on.

246
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,060
This way, please.

247
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,580
(Morning Flowers and Gentle Moonlight)

248
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,180
Distinguished guests,

249
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,660
the first lot of the Langyuan Conference

250
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,580
is the Oriental Pearl.

251
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,420
Starting at

252
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,540
3000 taels of silver.

253
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,620
What kind of idiot would buy this?

254
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,620
Golden Casket?

255
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,380
3000 taels!

256
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,900
(Morning Flowers and Gentle Moonlight)

257
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,620
There really are idiots.

258
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,780
3500 taels.

259
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,700
4000 taels.

260
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,620
5000 taels.

261
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,700
Who's this?

262
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,860
What a generous offer.

263
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,660
5000 taels.

264
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,340
5000 taels once.

265
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,140
(Isn't he the man
who brushed against me?)

266
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,220
5000 taels twice.

267
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,260
(Oh, lord.)

268
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,380
(I offended Lord 5000 Taels.)

269
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,220
10 thousand taels.

270
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,420
10 thousand taels!

271
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,660
Who's this?

272
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
He's so handsome.

273
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,180
How dare you double my price?

274
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,220
Double it!

275
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,500
No matter how much he offers,

276
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,820
I'll double his price.

277
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,540
Who are these guys?

278
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,580
Can't we have a normal auction?

279
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,900
Do they really have to show off?

280
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,540
Tell him...

281
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,180
Lord Tuoba,

282
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,020
are you still bidding?

283
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,180
You got us wrong.

284
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,700
My lord

285
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,660
isn't interested in the Oriental Pearl

286
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,340
but the Golden Casket under it.

287
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,260
As my lord said,

288
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,100
he doesn't steal another man's treasure.

289
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,060
My Lord, if you really

290
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,340
like the pearl,

291
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,580
we can

292
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,460
give it to you.

293
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,380
10 thousand taels of sliver
for a casket.

294
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,180
Lord Tuoba is so impressive.

295
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,100
(Morning Flowers and Gentle Moonlight)

296
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,700
Sold at 10 thousand taels.

297
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,500
Bravo.

298
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,020
Lord Tuoba, congratulations.
The Oriental Pearl is yours.

299
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,420
What a waste.

300
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,860
Please be quiet.

301
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,940
Here's our next lot.

302
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,140
Lord Tuoba,

303
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,060
Lady Hu Zhi wants to see you.

304
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,980
My lady only invited

305
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
Lord Tuoba.

306
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,700
No way.

307
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,380
I have to follow my...

308
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,740
Stay here.

309
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,500
As guests,

310
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,860
we need to obey the rules.

311
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,940
My Lord.

312
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,620
This way.

313
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,060
My Lord, Lady Hu Zhi is in there.

314
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,100
I've heard a lot about

315
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,580
Lord Tuoba from Liangzhou.

316
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,100
But I've just

317
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,820
realized

318
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,500
how handsome you are.

319
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,180
My Lord, I can do anything

320
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,860
you want.

321
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,740
I can't let

322
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,100
my generous guest down.

323
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,500
What took him so long?

324
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,580
Did something happen to him?

325
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,380
If he's in trouble,

326
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,940
my life will be at risk too.

327
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,340
Sir,

328
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,660
can you please tell me

329
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,180
what happened to the man
who left just now?

330
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,700
Which man?

331
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,540
The young man

332
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,980
who's tall

333
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,900
and

334
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,660
a little handsome.

335
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,980
Oh, that man.

336
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,220
I heard he's an official's son.

337
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
He sneaked in with a fake identity

338
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
and got caught.

339
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,780
Sir,

340
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,900
you must be wrong.

341
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,460
How can I be wrong?

342
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,740
Lady Hu Zhi held this auction

343
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,660
to filter out the unqualified guests.

344
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,060
He happens to be a handsome young man.

345
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,900
Maybe Lady Hu Zhi

346
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,340
had enough fun with him

347
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,620
and got him...

348
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,420
I've heard a lot about Yuyan Tower

349
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,380
and always wanted to see
the beautiful girls in Changjing.

350
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,060
However, when I saw you...

351
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,060
My Lord, I knew
you wouldn't be interested in

352
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,700
a superficial and vain girl like me.

353
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,700
However,

354
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,060
why didn't you

355
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,540
give up the pearl for the casket?

356
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,060
Valuable as the Oriental Pearl is,

357
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,860
the Golden Casket

358
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,340
is the relic of Lou Huaiyun,

359
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,380
the former governor of Liangzhou.

360
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,260
Since it's Lou Huaiyun's
personal belonging,

361
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,300
how could a young man like you
recognize it?

362
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,220
Unless...

363
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,060
you're not from the Tuoba Family
in Liangzhou, right?

364
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,260
But you're...

365
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,620
the real owner of Yuyan Tower.

366
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,620
My Lord, you must be kidding.

367
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
As a woman,

368
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,020
how can I be the owner?

369
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,100
I'm talking about you,

370
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,940
Wu Ming.

371
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,420
Since I saw the Golden Casket,

372
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,220
I've realized the bidding
of Oriental Pearl

373
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,820
is just a disguise.

374
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,580
When I got the casket
at such a high price,

375
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,940
everyone was cheering.

376
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,180
However, Lady Hu Zhi

377
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,220
turned around and looked at you.

378
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,100
And the way you looked at me

379
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,540
made me more convinced

380
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,780
that you're an old friend.

381
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,860
Hu Zhi.

382
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,940
You've finished your work.

383
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,820
You can leave.

384
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,700
It hurts!

385
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,060
Ouch! It hurts!

386
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,900
My Lady, what's wrong?

387
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,380
It really hurts...

388
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,100
My beauty...

389
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,460
Lady Hu Zhi, you're here!

390
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,180
I've been looking for you.

391
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,380
Come on, come to my room
and have a drink.

392
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,660
Come on. Over there.

393
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,700
Have fun.

394
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,820
Thanks.

395
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,140
Lou Mingye!

396
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,620
How could you go to her bed?

397
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
Get up!

398
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,540
Why are you here?

399
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
Darling.

400
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,180
Oh, no!

401
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,140
- Who's your darling?
- Darling...

402
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,500
Darling!

403
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,220
Darling, don't go!

404
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,060
Dar...

405
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,180
He happens to be a handsome young man.

406
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,300
Maybe Lady Hu Zhi

407
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,980
had enough fun with him and got him...

408
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,060
Are you the handsome young man
they talked about?

409
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,460
Listen,

410
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,740
it's very dangerous here.

411
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,660
We need to get out.

412
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,060
Let's talk after we get out.

413
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,620
It's up to you, dar...

414
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,870
Hush.

415
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,140
Let's go.

416
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,020
It's been ten years.

417
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,540
Back then,

418
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,140
you were just a kid.

419
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,820
You've really

420
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,780
grown up.

421
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,300
Since we both know each other,

422
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,900
let's make it clear.

423
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,620
Did you kill

424
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,820
Chen Zhisong?

425
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,500
I wanted to,

426
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,860
but someone got ahead of me.

427
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,660
Lou Mingye.

428
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,380
I know

429
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,060
you investigated Carefree Powder

430
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,540
only to find the person
who killed your father.

431
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
But the murderer is Leng Quji.

432
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,220
This case was solved a long time ago.

433
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,340
Why are you still after me?

434
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,460
My father died
because of Carefree Powder,

435
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,700
and it was you and Leng Quji

436
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,660
who smuggled the drug.

437
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,980
Don't tell me you had
nothing to do with it.

438
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,780
I only wanted money
instead of human lives.

439
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,900
Since I left Liangzhou,

440
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,020
I've never seen him again.

441
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm sorry

442
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,620
to disappoint you.

443
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,740
You're lying.

444
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,060
Why would I lie

445
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,180
to a dying man?

446
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,340
Women in Changjing

447
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,380
are not

448
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,140
silly and innocent girls.

449
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,100
Lady Hu Zhi's Feeble Powder

450
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,060
never fails.

451
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,820
Don't blame me for this.

452
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,820
If you keep digging into it,

453
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,380
you'll suffer a lot.

454
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,700
Wouldn't it be a relief

455
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,900
to have a quick death?

456
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,980
Kill him.
