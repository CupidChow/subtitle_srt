00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,420
(Mingsha Inn)

4
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,140
Why are you here?

5
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
Brother Feng,

6
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,930
are you leaving?

7
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,360
There are dead bodies

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,880
and ghosts in this village.

9
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,790
If I don't leave,

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,570
I'll die before I spend all my money.

11
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,990
Are you afraid of the ghosts

12
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,980
or the people?

13
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,430
My Lord,

14
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,370
what do you mean?

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,520
I've found out the truth

16
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,570
about the ghost

17
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,370
and the frostbite of organs.

18
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,490
Aren't you interested?

19
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,820
It's none of my business.

20
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,460
I'm not interested.

21
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,670
Goodbye.

22
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,010
You should hear it.

23
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,190
Lou Mingye,

24
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,160
I heard you found out

25
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,930
who murdered the Huangs.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,210
Who's the murderer?

27
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,980
The murderer

28
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,990
is the ghost of a girl

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,700
who was killed by the Huangs
a few years ago.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Are you

31
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,820
also in charge of ghost hunting?

32
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,620
What are you talking about?

33
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,540
He's right.

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,930
Three days ago, Huang Fuxing
died in a strange way,

35
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,650
and yesterday,

36
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,010
his mother died of shock at home.

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,130
It really looks like

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,080
(Beloved Fang Baixue)
the dead girl

39
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,130
came back

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,340
for revenge.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,490
However,

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,820
it wasn't a ghost but a person

43
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,420
who killed them.

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,570
But Huanxi said

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,420
his organs were frozen.

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,820
How could anyone manage to do that?

47
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,820
What are these?

48
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,970
I got them

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,420
from Huang Fuxing's stomach.

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,750
I hadn't figured out

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,060
why there were stones in his stomach

52
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,620
until Lan Che came to my room

53
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,730
and spilled the water this morning.

54
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,100
Saltpeter generates ice.

55
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,050
Liangzhou abounds in saltpeter.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,650
It's often used to make gunpowder,

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
but it has another function.

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,370
It reacts with water and generates ice.

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,480
So, rich people

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,610
often use it to make ice in summer.

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,300
So, his organs

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
were frozen

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,980
because he ate saltpeter.

64
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,580
His servants told me

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,260
he was in poor health

66
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,740
and needed to take medicine regularly.

67
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,310
I believe

68
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,890
someone must've replaced his pills

69
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,210
with wax balls made of saltpeter.

70
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,330
You talked a lot,

71
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,300
but why am I relevant?

72
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
Because

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,930
it was you who made fake pills

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,890
with saltpeter.

75
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,330
When we were in the temple,

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,300
I saw the knife you used
to slaughter the rabbit.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,230
The knife at your waist

78
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,450
is common in Liangzhou's army.

79
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,560
You changed its sheath,

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,890
but the hilt is still there.

81
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,640
Soldiers in Liangzhou

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,860
like to carve their name on the hilt.

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,870
Brother Feng,

84
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,930
can you show us your hilt?

85
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,800
That's right.

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,960
It's

87
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,170
my knife,

88
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,490
and I did serve in Liangzhou.

89
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,540
However, My Lord,

90
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,210
there are so many people
who once served in Liangzhou.

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,820
Isn't it inappropriate

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,580
to accuse of murder

93
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,440
based on

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,820
that single fact?

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,580
But what about

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,860
the ghost everyone saw that night?

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,050
That night,

98
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,860
we all saw an illusion.

99
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,860
Illusion?

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,210
I hadn't had a clue at first

101
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,860
until Doctor Huanxi reminded me

102
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,450
that girl-seeking flower

103
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,650
is also called oblivion flower.

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,930
Its pollen can make one see
terrible illusions.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,880
You renamed it

106
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
- to make it
- I've told you

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,960
no watering at night.

108
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,150
- popular in the village.
- Daping. I'm sorry!

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,920
You know the climate
will change frequently

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,740
at the end of summer.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Once the wind blows,

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,960
the pollen can be scattered

113
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,700
around the village
without being noticed.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,440
You wanted to sneak in
the Huang's Mansion

115
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,700
- and kill her,
- Are you okay?

116
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,480
but you didn't expect her

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,540
to die of shock because she was old.

118
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,600
Therefore, you use the opportunity

119
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
to put Fang Baixue's tablet on the table

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,330
and make her kneel down

121
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,070
to make others believe

122
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,650
the dead wife came back.

123
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,210
Bravo! Bravo!

124
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,880
My Lord,

125
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,050
what a great story.

126
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,470
However,

127
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,770
you have no evidence.

128
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Is that so?

129
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,330
I found these in her hair

130
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,370
after she died.

131
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,300
I confirmed it with the villagers.

132
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,860
Cocklebur only grows in one place
in the village,

133
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,540
and it's that temple.

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Apart from us,

135
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,210
you were the only person who went there

136
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,300
that day.

137
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,400
Therefore,

138
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,270
Brother Feng

139
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,540
accidentally got cocklebur on his body

140
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,370
and left it in her hair

141
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,370
when he was moving her body.

142
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
Feng Qing,

143
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,770
you're just like cocklebur.

144
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,650
It looks ordinary

145
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,370
but has thorns.

146
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,980
Lord Lou was right about everything.

147
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,260
I admit it.

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,800
Brother Feng,

149
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,820
why did you kill them

150
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,600
in the name of Mrs. Huang?

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,820
Don't call him Mrs. Huang!

152
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,740
She a Fang!

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,650
Listen carefully,

154
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,720
she never belonged

155
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,980
to the Huang family

156
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,100
and will never come back as a ghost!

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200
She has nothing to do

158
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,860
with the Huangs in this life!

159
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,190
Are you...?

160
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,450
He's the husband

161
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,060
who served in Liangzhou.

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,450
You could've resorted to law.

163
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,180
Why did you kill them?

164
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,330
Didn't you know you'd pay for that?

165
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,010
Law?

166
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,570
Lord Lou,

167
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,080
Lord Li,

168
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,690
you're the great heroes now!

169
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes,

170
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,770
they sent people to investigate it,

171
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,740
but the Huangs bribed everyone

172
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,880
to make them testify

173
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,810
Baixue fell into the water and died!

174
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,490
Everyone in this village

175
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,770
lied about her death!

176
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,150
In the end,

177
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,540
the officials couldn't do anything.

178
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,950
But...

179
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,890
But I...

180
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,880
Do you know what Baixue

181
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,980
went through?

182
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,650
Do you know?

183
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,810
I can't watch those monsters

184
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,980
get away with it.

185
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
Since the law

186
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,450
couldn't bring justice,

187
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,670
I'll do it myself!

188
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,620
I must

189
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,450
avenge my wife's death!

190
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,620
If I'd known this,

191
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,150
I'd rather this case

192
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,380
never get solved.

193
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,350
My Lord.

194
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,210
Don't you feel sad?

195
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,420
I used to be
the Grand Warden of Liangzhou.

196
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,380
I'm used to this.

197
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,540
That's right.

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,450
The more experienced,

199
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,330
the more heartless.

200
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,940
If one could get away with murder

201
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,450
just because he did it for revenge,

202
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,890
why would we need the law?

203
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,070
But the law is supposed to bring justice

204
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,770
instead of punishing the good people.

205
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,100
If we didn't arrest Feng Qing,

206
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,670
the villagers

207
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,380
would still believe
the ghost did all this.

208
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,210
Lady Fang had a miserable life,

209
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,890
and she would never rest in peace.

210
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,280
Moreover, what if the Huangs

211
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
blame the innocent

212
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,100
for the murder?

213
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,420
You want justice

214
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,940
because there's so much injustice
in this world.

215
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,920
However, if we didn't have the law,

216
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,980
we'd never know the difference

217
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,810
between right and wrong.

218
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,100
My master said

219
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,060
Feng Qing is like cocklebur,

220
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,880
but so is everyone

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,420
in this world.

222
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,810
They don't get to decide

223
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,180
their own fate.

224
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,300
It's getting windy.

225
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,570
Let's go back.

226
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,450
Wait.

227
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,770
Cocklebur has thorns,

228
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,130
but it isn't lethal.

229
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,030
My Lord.

230
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,210
I think I know

231
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,500
who's been helping Feng Qing.

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,620
Don't be scared.

233
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,980
It's me.

234
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,740
I won't hurt you.

235
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,420
When I came last time,

236
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,650
It felt like someone was living here,

237
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,130
but I didn't know it was you.

238
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,570
When I was at the tea stall,

239
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,060
you spilled my tea on purpose

240
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,320
to warn me

241
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,740
it was poisoned, right?

242
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,590
Why don't

243
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,060
get down here?

244
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,870
Huang Fuxing is already dead.

245
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,210
No one can hurt you now.

246
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,710
Let's go.

247
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,760
Don't be afraid.

248
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,210
I'm with you.

249
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,210
Go.

250
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,420
(Yongning Temple)

251
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,390
My Lord.

252
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,710
My Lord!

253
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,030
My Lord!

254
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,130
What happened?

255
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,810
Feng Qing is the murderer,

256
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,380
and she's the accomplice.

257
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,800
She's just a crazy woman.

258
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,330
She couldn't possibly do that.

259
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,350
You must

260
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,250
be wrong, My Lord.

261
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,570
Are you questioning me?

262
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,650
No. I wouldn't dare!

263
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,890
I wouldn't dare!

264
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,910
I've forgiven you for what you did

265
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,280
with Huang Fuxing,

266
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,860
so stay out of our business.

267
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,920
Huang Gui, what are you doing?

268
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,010
Stay back,

269
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,090
or I'll kill her!

270
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,130
- Huang Gui...
- Shut up!

271
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,300
Wuniang had a miserable life.

272
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,550
I won't allow

273
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,740
anyone to bully her!

274
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,030
Let her go.

275
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,330
I'll be your hostage.

276
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,210
She's just a servant.

277
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,940
I'm Lord Chancellor.

278
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,940
My life is much more important.

279
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,130
It doesn't matter
if others care about her,

280
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,310
as long as

281
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,250
you care about her, My Lord.

282
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,680
Go!

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,880
If you want her to live,

284
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,130
ensure our safety.

285
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,330
Don't follow us.

286
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,860
Follow them secretly.

287
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,350
Go.

288
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
Go.

289
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,990
Huang Gui,

290
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,650
Wuniang is your sister, right?

291
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,390
How...

292
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,420
How do you know?

293
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,620
Wuniang has extremely
white skin and hair

294
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,130
because of albinism.

295
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,420
I've seen the same symptoms in you.

296
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,980
Besides, when you were
thrown into the lake,

297
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,420
she risked her life to save you.

298
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,770
You're right.

299
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,980
Wuniang

300
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,890
is my sister.

301
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,880
So, when we arrived at the village,

302
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,450
you were trying to

303
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,310
scare us away

304
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,180
to keep us out of all this.

305
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,130
To be honest,
your brother is a good guy,

306
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,960
but why did he work for the Huangs

307
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,010
and do evil things for Huang Fuxing?

308
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,740
Because they kept us

309
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,960
when we had no place

310
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,210
to go.

311
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,750
Wuniang

312
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,570
had the disease when she was 10,

313
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,400
and everyone treated her like a monster

314
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,690
and tortured her.

315
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,190
She can't speak

316
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,250
- because some kids
- Don't hurt my sister!

317
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,250
- poisoned her throat.
- Go away!

318
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,750
When I was serving in Liangzhou,

319
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,670
I heard she almost died,

320
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,420
so I escaped from the army at night.

321
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,510
After that,

322
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,110
we came to Huaisha Village

323
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,250
and met Huang Fuxing.

324
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,740
We thought we finally met a nice guy.

325
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,910
However,

326
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
Huang Fuxing

327
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,500
wanted to sell her as a freak!

328
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,960
I had no choice

329
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,720
but tell her to act crazy,

330
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,600
and she did it

331
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,860
for over a decade.

332
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,570
That's how she survived.

333
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,500
Discipline in Liangzhou is very strict.

334
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,450
If a deserter is caught,

335
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,250
he'll be beheaded.

336
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,620
Feng Qing found out about this,

337
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,740
so he threatened you to help him.

338
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,540
Of course not.

339
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,080
I volunteered to help him

340
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,250
kill Huang Fuxing.

341
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,740
Huang Fuxing is a monster.

342
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,650
I've been a coward all my life,

343
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,180
now I've finally done something brave.

344
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,270
Stop!

345
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,570
Sorry, I'm late.

346
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,620
Tell me.

347
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,260
Who asked you to sell oblivion flowers
at Huaisha Village?

348
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,690
Nobody.

349
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,430
I was alone.

350
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,790
The flowers grow in remote mountains.

351
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,980
How did you get them?

352
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,000
I bought them.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,900
Who sold them to you?

354
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,930
I forgot.

355
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,570
Huang Gui and Wuniang died.

356
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,620
He died?

357
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,100
Who killed him?

358
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,140
Shouldn't you

359
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,530
know better than me?

360
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,690
Prolonged inhalation of the pollen

361
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,280
will make one go mad

362
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,900
and die of excessive bleeding.

363
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,140
Can you be responsible

364
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,500
for everyone's death?

365
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,260
What?

366
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,410
I only wanted to scare them

367
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,690
instead of killing them.

368
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,020
I asked about it,

369
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,060
and he said

370
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,570
it'd only generate terrible illusions.

371
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,780
Who's that person?

372
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,100
Are you still covering for him?

373
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,040
I want to tell you,

374
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,100
but I don't know

375
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,150
who he is.

376
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,620
I was arrested for stealing saltpeter
from the army.

377
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,580
I thought I was going to die.

378
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,160
However,

379
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,810
he showed up.

380
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,980
I know why you stole the saltpeter.

381
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,100
Do as I say,

382
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,810
and you'll live

383
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,330
and get your revenge.

384
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,080
You...

385
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,410
What do you want?

386
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,450
Have you heard of

387
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,930
oblivion flowers?

388
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,930
Is he from the army in Liangzhou?

389
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,290
I don't know his identity.

390
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,190
However, stealing saltpeter
is a felony,

391
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,310
and he got me out,

392
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,620
so he can't be ordinary.

393
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,900
Gui,

394
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,450
it's my fault.

395
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,540
I...

396
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,410
I...

397
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,860
Two hallucinogenic drugs appeared

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,410
in Changjing.

399
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,380
I should've known
this was not a coincidence.

400
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,380
Why would the person behind Feng Qing
do this?

401
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,380
Do you remember

402
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,000
why my father banned Carefree Powder?

403
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,020
Because it's addictive.

404
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,650
Not just that.

405
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,170
Have you ever heard of Distortion Pill?

406
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,840
No.

407
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,870
What's that?

408
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,620
It's said Distortion Pill
is a magical drug

409
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,170
that can make people lose their mind

410
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,470
and become obedient puppets.

411
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,740
It requires three ingredients
to make the pill.

412
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,450
First, Carefree Powder.

413
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,620
Second, Oblivion Drug
made of the flowers.

414
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,690
But why did he

415
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,760
ask Feng Qing

416
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,210
to create chaos in the village?

417
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,020
No matter what,

418
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,100
the ultimate goal

419
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,740
must be the Distortion Pill.

420
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,270
Boss,

421
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,930
do you want food?

422
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,570
Not hungry.

423
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,740
Don't be sad.

424
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,620
It's not your fault

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,330
that they died.

426
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,570
Luo,

427
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Lan Che.

428
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
Coming.

429
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,150
Huali?

430
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,030
Lan Che.

431
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,240
Lan Che,

432
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,590
Doctor Huanxi said

433
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,590
the flowers are poisonous.

434
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,980
Here's the cure he made.

435
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,100
Take it while it's hot.

436
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,570
Thank you, Huali.

437
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,780
I can't help you with the case,

438
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,550
but I can take care

439
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,660
of you.

440
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,180
What are you doing?

441
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,030
I'm watching...

442
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,210
My... My Lord!

443
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,160
Why didn't I hear your footsteps?

444
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm freaked out.

445
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,910
My Lord,

446
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,170
how's it going with Feng Qing?

447
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,290
Do you need my help?

448
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,960
Don't worry.

449
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,290
If I need you,

450
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,100
I'll tell you.

451
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,690
Then it's a deal.

452
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,030
What's this?

453
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,210
My master made this.

454
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,170
He said the pollen
would damage our brains,

455
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,530
so I brought it

456
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,500
for your health.

457
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,020
Don't you think it's bitter?

458
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,600
No.

459
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,210
How's that possible?

460
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,530
My master's medicine is always bitter.

461
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,170
It's sweet.

462
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,140
Nonsense.

463
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,570
It's so bitter!

464
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,210
Anyway, it's bitter.

465
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,260
Keep pretending.

466
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,810
Actually, I lost the sense of taste.

467
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,330
It's because of

468
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,100
my childhood disease.

469
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,630
But...

470
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,500
why did you refuse to take medicine?

471
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,330
I took so much medicine

472
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,660
that I couldn't forget

473
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,740
the bitterness.

474
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,620
However,

475
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,170
this is so sweet.

476
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,740
It's getting late.

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,380
Rest early.

478
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,680
We need to go back

479
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,570
early in the morning.

480
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,230
My Lord.

481
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,530
Rest well.

482
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,620
I'm over there.
