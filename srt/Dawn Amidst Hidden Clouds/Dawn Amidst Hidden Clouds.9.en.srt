=Episode 9=

3
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,620
What happened?

4
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,700
What was that thing last night?

5
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,300
You saw it too, right?

6
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,300
Yes, so terrifying.

7
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,980
Has anyone seen Old Lady?

8
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,460
No.

9
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,060
Wake up.

10
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,140
Wake up.

11
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,740
Stay back! Stop!

12
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,540
Are you humans or ghosts?

13
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,210
Oh, lord.

14
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,780
Was I possessed last night?

15
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,180
Lan Che!

16
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,620
Lan Che.

17
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,180
Where's my daughter Lan Che?

18
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,100
What are you doing?

19
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,740
Nothing.

20
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,060
Where are we?

21
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,220
How did we get here?

22
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,740
How much can you remember

23
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,120
about last night?

24
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,420
Last night,

25
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,340
the Huangs were hunting us,

26
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,380
and I lost consciousness.

27
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,500
My Lord.

28
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,500
Who's Qingyao?

29
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,660
Who?

30
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,780
You said that name many times.

31
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,540
Is she very important to you?

32
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,940
She's my childhood friend.

33
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,550
Oh.

34
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,980
Is she

35
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,740
your childhood sweetheart

36
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,300
who send you a luminous pearl?

37
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
I want to go back.

38
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,780
My Lord,

39
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,060
I'm a woman.

40
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,060
Please keep your distance from me, okay?

41
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,340
Boss,

42
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,900
- you're finally back!
- My Lord.

43
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,340
Are you okay?

44
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm fine.

45
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,780
You're just a little girl.

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,540
Why do you have to make me worried?

47
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Look, I'm fine.

48
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,020
Lord Lou is always by her side.

49
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,820
That's right.

50
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,180
Thanks, My Lord.

51
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,220
I wouldn't dare bother him.

52
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,940
Lan Che!

53
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,820
Huali?

54
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,900
I'm so glad you're fine.

55
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,580
I thought

56
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,620
you were just righteous heroes.

57
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,900
It turns out

58
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,500
you're officials from Changjing.

59
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,300
Officials?

60
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,860
I'm Lan Che,

61
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,580
the leader of Greater World.

62
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,020
The silly man you saw yesterday

63
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
is the Deputy Lord Chancellor Li Mo.

64
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,460
As for him,

65
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,500
he's a big deal.

66
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,700
He's the Lord Chancellor Lou Mingye,

67
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,540
Lord Lou.

68
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
He looks

69
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,740
decent and righteous,

70
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,900
but in fact...

71
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,060
Anyway, just be careful.

72
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,220
Stay away

73
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,420
from him.

74
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Why are you here?

75
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,900
Doctor Huanxi heard

76
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,740
something weird happened here,

77
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,380
and he was worried about Lan Che,

78
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,700
so I came with our people.

79
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,660
You...

80
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,340
Did you really see a ghost?

81
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,100
No ghost,

82
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,060
but much nonsense.

83
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,180
That's too bad.

84
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,020
Luckily, Lord Lou is here.

85
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,220
He'll protect you.

86
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,740
After seeing a living devil,

87
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,660
that little ghost seems

88
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
quite nice to me.

89
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,380
Lan Che,

90
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,020
why isn't Lord Li

91
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
you mentioned

92
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,060
with you right now?

93
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm so dizzy.

94
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,780
Where am I?

95
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,780
Where's my clothes?

96
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,860
Oh, no!

97
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,760
Something happened!

98
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,580
It's so bad!

99
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,600
My Lord, it's serious.

100
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,540
I heard something happened
to the Huangs again.

101
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,380
What's wrong?

102
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,020
Old Lady died!

103
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,340
When did you find her body?

104
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,220
Just now.

105
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,660
A ghost showed up last night,

106
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,060
and somehow everyone

107
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,780
went mad and lost consciousness.

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,500
I went to the hall only to find

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,420
Old Lady

110
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,740
kneeling right there!

111
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,060
Kneeling there?

112
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,180
There's something more terrifying.

113
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,300
You...

114
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,300
Please see for yourself.

115
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,300
(Beloved Fang Baixue)

116
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,740
My Lady!

117
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,340
Mercy! My Lady!

118
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,060
- Did anyone move the body?
- Did anyone move the body?

119
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,580
It's scary! We wouldn't dare.

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,540
- How did she die?
- How did she die?

121
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,980
Well, it's not clear.

122
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,580
My Lord,

123
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,700
can you do me a favor?

124
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,540
Please be clear.

125
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,420
I want

126
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,220
to do autopsy

127
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,100
for them.

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,780
No!

129
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,900
Lord Huang and Old Lady just died.

130
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,940
You can't insult

131
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,780
their bodies!

132
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,380
If we can find out the truth,

133
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,140
just do it.

134
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,660
Okay.

135
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,660
My Lord, you...

136
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,540
You can't do this!

137
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,060
Take him down first.

138
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,380
Set him free

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
after the autopsy.

140
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,500
- Let's go.
- My Lord, you...

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,020
- Go.
- You can't do this!

142
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,780
My Lord.

143
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,620
How's the result?

144
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,820
They died in different

145
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,860
ways.

146
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,460
Old Lady

147
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,260
died of shock.

148
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,460
She's very old.

149
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,580
It's not surprised

150
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,060
she died of shock.

151
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,020
Yes,

152
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,100
but...

153
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,780
Huang Fuxing's death is strange.

154
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,540
He...

155
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,500
He died of frostbite

156
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,620
from the inside out.

157
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,100
From the inside out?

158
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,580
Yes, My Lord.

159
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,860
I also found this

160
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,420
in his stomach.

161
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,820
(Mingsha Inn)

162
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,180
I heard

163
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,580
Huang Fuxing's

164
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,850
organs were frozen.

165
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,660
Did you make a mistake?

166
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,740
How's that possible?

167
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,020
No way.

168
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,810
Lord Li,

169
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,930
maybe I should buy some clothes for you.

170
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,620
You look so strange

171
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,900
in Lord Teng's outfit.

172
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,180
My Lord,

173
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,100
did I embarrass

174
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,060
you?

175
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,900
Enough.

176
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,820
Stop! Stop!

177
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,700
Get changed.

178
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,900
After all, you're an official.

179
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,980
Don't be a joke.

180
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,780
Thanks.

181
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,700
My Lord, have a seat.

182
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,540
What are you doing?

183
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,400
Please be seated

184
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,420
right here.

185
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,340
Now there's a rumor

186
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,100
that Lord Huang's wife

187
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,660
came back for revenge.

188
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,460
Huang Fuxing froze Lady Fang to death,

189
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,780
so her ghost came back

190
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,300
and let them

191
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,700
pay the price.

192
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
She froze Huang Fuxing

193
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,860
and scared Old Lady to death.

194
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,780
Does that make sense?

195
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,300
Ghosts don't exist.

196
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,820
Usually, we can find human traces

197
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,300
behind the scenes.

198
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,580
But how can someone freeze

199
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,140
another person from the inside out?

200
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,780
Besides, everyone

201
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,020
in the village can prove

202
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,060
they saw a ghost.

203
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,500
How do you explain it?

204
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,420
Sometimes,

205
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,340
what we see is not the truth.

206
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Well, let's have lunch.

207
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,540
Come on. Here you are.

208
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,940
Thanks.

209
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,900
Boss,

210
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,180
did you have a fight

211
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,220
with Lord Lou?

212
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,460
He's always

213
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,740
talking about Qingyao.

214
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,780
Isn't he ashamed?

215
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,310
Who's Qingyao?

216
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,680
His childhood sweetheart.

217
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,980
She sent him a luminous pearl
when they were kids,

218
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,420
and he still cares about her.

219
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,020
Boss,

220
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,060
something's wrong with you.

221
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,980
What's wrong?

222
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,220
You're jealous.

223
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,900
I'm not.

224
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,580
Then why are you blushing?

225
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm not.

226
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,380
You're denying it.

227
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,380
Did you fall in love with Lord Lou?

228
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,660
Who'd like that living devil?

229
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,220
Do you think it's possible

230
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
that Lord Lou

231
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,660
likes you too?

232
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,660
It must be a hallucination.

233
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,140
My Lord, do you mean

234
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,700
the murderer made
everyone hallucinate somehow

235
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,740
and tried to get away with it

236
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,220
with the theory of ghosts?

237
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,580
There's no ghost in this world.

238
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,020
Someone must be behind this.

239
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,020
But how did the murder manage

240
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,180
to affect everyone in the village?

241
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,100
Maybe when we solve this problem,

242
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,660
we'll find the truth.

243
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,860
My Lord.

244
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,980
Lan Che

245
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,540
has been complaining about you a lot.

246
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,500
I think I called the wrong name

247
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,700
and pissed her off.

248
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
That's a huge mistake
for a relationship!

249
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,780
Really?

250
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,860
Yes.

251
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,660
Then

252
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,900
in your opinion,

253
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,260
what should I do?

254
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,500
In a relationship,

255
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,020
the man should compromise first.

256
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,260
Apologize to her

257
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,300
and make her happy,

258
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,220
and everything will be alright.

259
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,100
Fang Tingge.

260
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,180
It's not your normal style.

261
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,980
You don't understand.

262
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,380
The love between two people

263
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,460
is like a sparkle.

264
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,790
If you want to put it out,

265
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,860
you have to let it burn

266
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,140
and turn everything

267
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,860
into ashes.

268
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,580
When it's over...

269
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
My Lord,

270
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,020
you'll calm down.

271
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,140
What does that mean,

272
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
Fang Tingge?

273
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,140
I asked Luo out tonight.

274
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,700
If a man

275
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,740
really likes a girl,

276
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,740
he should

277
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,340
care about her a lot

278
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,100
and make her happy all the time.

279
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,820
However, Lou Mingye's different.

280
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,260
He only wants to deduct my wages.

281
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,700
You don't understand.

282
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,420
Some men are just like that.

283
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,820
They're very childish.

284
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,540
In other words,

285
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,580
if they like a girl,

286
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,980
they'll try to bully her.

287
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,020
Lord Lou

288
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,240
doesn't deduct Fang Tingge's wages
all the time, right?

289
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,380
It makes sense.

290
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,380
But why is he always

291
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,420
talking about Qingyao in front of me?

292
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
What's on your mind?

293
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,700
I...

294
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,220
I'm watching the flowers.

295
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,900
The other day,

296
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,700
I mistook you for someone else.

297
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,380
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,780
(What?)

299
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
(Is this real?)

300
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,460
(He apologized?)

301
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,980
(Was I)

302
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,780
(way out of line?)

303
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,620
It's in the past,

304
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,620
so forget it.

305
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,140
Besides,

306
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,700
I never cared anyway.

307
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
Good.

308
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,180
(He really looks like an idiot
when he smiles.)

309
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,460
The girl-seeking flowers
were fine yesterday.

310
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,540
How could they all wither overnight?

311
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,370
Except for the ones
in Huang Fuxing's room,

312
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,220
all the girl-seeking flowers
in the village

313
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,820
seem to be frozen.

314
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,070
That's right.

315
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,180
Somebody!

316
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,220
Help!

317
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,440
Someone wants to kill me!

318
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,580
Get him!

319
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Don't let him run away!

320
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,780
Kneel!

321
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,300
Attention.

322
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,820
Recently,

323
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
there have been many disasters
in the village.

324
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,740
The truth is

325
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,060
Fang Baixue,
who were killed by the Huangs,

326
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,220
came back for revenge!

327
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,100
Back then,

328
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,060
there were three murderers.

329
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,660
Two of them are dead.

330
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,340
He's the last one!

331
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,860
You're wrong!

332
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,540
I didn't kill her!

333
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,460
You're their butler

334
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,420
and Huang Fuxing's lickspittle!

335
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,980
How dare you claim
to have nothing to do

336
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,500
with Fang Baixue's death?

337
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,020
Exactly. He can't be innocent.

338
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,980
He's still denying it.

339
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,220
He can't be innocent.

340
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,660
You did bad things with the support
of the Huangs.

341
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,300
Now they're gone,

342
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,700
so are you!

343
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,020
Kill him!

344
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,060
Kill him!

345
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,180
Kill him!

346
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,720
Kill him!

347
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,020
Pull her away!

348
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,820
Psychopath.

349
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,820
Throw her into the lake!

350
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,060
Don't you dare!

351
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,420
Lord Chancellor is here.

352
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,860
Don't you dare kill them!

353
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,060
My Lord,

354
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,860
Lord Huang and his mother died,

355
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,860
and all the girl-seeking flowers
were frozen overnight.

356
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,500
Obviously, Fang Baixue
came back for revenge!

357
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,300
If he lives,

358
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,060
we'll die!

359
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,820
We don't want to die!

360
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,260
You deserve it!

361
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,500
When Fang Baixue was sold
to the Huangs,

362
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,220
none of you tried to save her.

363
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,380
When she died in the snow,

364
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,180
you ignored her death again.

365
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,860
All of you are responsible

366
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,380
for Fang Baixue's death.

367
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,100
It's our business.

368
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,700
It's not up to you!

369
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,180
Huang Gui must die today!

370
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,460
Kill him!

371
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,540
Kill him!

372
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
Kill him!

373
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,660
Kill him!

374
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,980
Kill him!

375
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,300
Shut up!

376
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,180
Don't you dare touch him!

377
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,020
The law will decide

378
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,100
whether he should die or not.

379
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,900
It's not up to you.

380
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,260
Get out of here.

381
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,340
Do you want

382
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,140
to be thrown into the lake?

383
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,180
My Lord,

384
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,860
you're so generous!

385
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,310
Thank you

386
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,780
so much!

387
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,700
Huang Gui,

388
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,380
why did that gray-haired woman save you?

389
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,020
Well...

390
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,700
I don't know.

391
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,900
Maybe...

392
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,020
it's because

393
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,460
I once gave her food.

394
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,760
(It seems)

395
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,620
(she was trying to save me.)

396
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,820
What are you thinking?

397
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,540
Nothing.

398
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,900
Doctor Huanxi.

399
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,300
My Lord,

400
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
it was crowded.

401
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,260
Doctor Huanxi,

402
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,540
do you like the flowers?

403
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,980
It's not like that.

404
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,740
Actually, it's very rare.

405
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,980
My Lord, do you know

406
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,420
it has another name?

407
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,660
What is it?

408
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,420
I traveled around when I was young

409
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,420
and saw the flowers

410
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,620
in a mountain.

411
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,260
The locals

412
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,660
called them oblivion flowers.

413
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,900
Oblivion flowers?

414
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,860
From my experience,

415
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,860
any unusual phenomenon

416
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,300
must have deep secrets.

417
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,180
Lord Lou

418
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,860
doesn't talk much.

419
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,900
We should light him up

420
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,540
and let him burn.

421
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,460
How?

422
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,820
If you want to light him up,

423
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,650
you still

424
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,940
lack something.

425
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,300
What is it?

426
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,860
A woman's tenderness.

427
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,860
My Lord,

428
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,260
I asked Huanxi to make

429
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,620
the medicine for you.

430
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,580
It's good

431
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,180
for your eyes.

432
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,500
Leave it there.

433
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,540
- My Lord, this...
- Don't touch it.

434
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,780
They're the stones

435
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,860
in Huang Fuxing's stomach.

436
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,820
My Lord.

437
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,220
You're working so hard.

438
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,100
Don't forget...

439
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,300
to...

440
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,340
rest...

441
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,020
well.

442
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,580
My Lord, what's wrong?

443
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,620
You're acting weird

444
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,860
with distorted expressions.

445
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,540
Did the medicine poison your head?

446
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,300
Luckily, it's not serious.

447
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,620
You're the one with a poisoned brain.

448
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,220
No medicine for you anymore.
