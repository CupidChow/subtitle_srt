3
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,300
- Lan Che!
- Lan Che!

4
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,500
Lan Che!

5
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,490
Lan Che!

6
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,210
Why is it suddenly raining?

7
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,610
Are you injured?

8
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,260
None of your business.

9
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,820
Luckily, your bones are fine.

10
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,210
It's just a sprain.

11
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,410
Does it hurt?

12
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,410
It's not that serious.

13
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,900
Let's go back.

14
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,740
Lan Che.

15
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,610
I figured out the question you asked.

16
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,140
What?

17
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,690
You asked me

18
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,610
if I'd let you stay with me

19
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,900
when I'm in danger.

20
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,970
So...

21
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,540
Your answer is...

22
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,690
No.

23
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,410
Because I don't want

24
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,460
to have you only when

25
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,850
I'm in danger.

26
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,660
I hope you can always be

27
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,260
by my side

28
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,900
whether I'm safe or danger,

29
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,260
whether my life is normal

30
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,380
or out of order.

31
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,890
Lan Che.

32
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,170
You're the most important person
in my life.

33
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,890
I want to protect you

34
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,940
and make you happy

35
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,820
for the rest of my life.

36
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,100
I hope

37
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,820
we can stay together

38
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,980
till death do us part.

39
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,330
My Lord.

40
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,380
Is this a love confession?

41
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,170
I want us

42
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,050
to be together.

43
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,540
(Resilient as Pine, Elegant as Bamboo)

44
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,290
Ouch.

45
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,980
It's okay.

46
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,100
It's just a strain.

47
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,290
Apply some ointment.

48
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,130
My Lord,

49
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,660
I'll get it for her.

50
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,500
Thanks.

51
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,490
The bed in Lord Lou's study

52
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,450
is elaborately placed.

53
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,210
Why is it in the center?

54
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,940
I've just realized

55
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,290
that we need to change

56
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,380
the layouts

57
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,890
so that we can

58
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,450
be lucky and make

59
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,290
things work.

60
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,170
I didn't know you knew that.

61
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,490
Are you interested?

62
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,540
Want to learn?

63
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,660
I can teach you.

64
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,980
Of course.

65
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,490
- Let's go.
- Hey, wait.

66
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,660
Let's go together.

67
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,050
You're injured.

68
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,450
Stay here together.

69
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,050
Actually, it...

70
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,980
Actually, it matters.

71
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,130
Be careful.

72
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,490
You shouldn't walk around

73
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,610
with your injured feet.

74
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,780
Bye.

75
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
Well, the layouts

76
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,100
of the mansion...

77
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,130
Lan Che,

78
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,420
I have something to say.

79
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,610
You asked me

80
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,540
why I was so sure about
Huali's falsehood.

81
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,890
Because

82
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,050
you're the real Leng Qingyao.

83
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,820
I grew up in Changjing.

84
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,490
My parents are gone.

85
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,420
Master Huanxi brought me up.

86
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,820
At first, it was only an assumption.

87
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
However,

88
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,100
when I saw the crescent-shaped scar,

89
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,730
I knew I was right.

90
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,260
I wanted to tell you,

91
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,010
but you seemed

92
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,260
so simple and happy.

93
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,820
They call me

94
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,050
Little Dragon.

95
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,580
Oh, no.

96
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,170
You happen to be a Lou.

97
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,700
For your safety,

98
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,050
farewell!

99
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,820
Let's go.

100
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,170
I had hesitations.

101
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,730
I didn't want you

102
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,970
to be affected by the past.

103
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,650
Oh, I see.

104
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,490
To be honest,
I not only remembered Jiuxiang,

105
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,290
but dreamed about your luminous pearl.

106
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,170
Do you remember everything?

107
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,170
Just some fragments.

108
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,820
It's okay.

109
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,170
Just remember

110
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,820
I'll always care about you.

111
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,460
Why are you telling me now

112
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,730
after hiding it for so long?

113
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,410
You've taught me a hard lesson.

114
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,820
I've finally figured it out.

115
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,290
I shouldn't make decisions for you

116
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,220
but

117
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,610
support all your decisions.

118
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,930
Lan Che.

119
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,260
My life was a boundless dark land,

120
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,170
and you were my guiding star.

121
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,490
You lit up my world.

122
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,490
You took care of the Little Patient.

123
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,290
Now it's my turn

124
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,650
to take care of you.

125
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,660
Wait a minute.

126
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,610
If I didn't say yes

127
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
in the mountains,

128
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,020
would you still tell me this?

129
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,900
How dare you say no?

130
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,010
Well,

131
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,410
can I regret it

132
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,820
now?

133
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,250
It's too late.

134
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,620
(Justice Department)

135
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,420
(Focus on Details)

136
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
Last night...

137
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,340
What's wrong with last night?

138
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,380
Focus on your work.

139
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,050
Don't talk to me.

140
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,780
What about you?

141
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,460
Just look at you.

142
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,650
You didn't come home last night.

143
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,020
Didn't Huanxi say anything?

144
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,090
He knows.

145
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,050
Master

146
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,650
and Fang Tingge planned...

147
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,820
What did you say?

148
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,130
My Lord.

149
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,490
My Lord.

150
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,170
Well, Lan Che is here.

151
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,850
You're are

152
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,050
way out of line.

153
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,290
How dare you set me up?

154
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,580
I'm completely innocent.

155
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,020
It all started...

156
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,380
when Fang Tingge

157
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,080
called you a donkey

158
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,050
and lured me in

159
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,470
and planned the whole thing.

160
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,050
Lan Che,

161
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,970
you're killing the donkey
after using it.

162
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,740
Kill what?

163
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,010
My Lord.

164
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,650
I can explain this.

165
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
It's a misunderstanding.

166
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,140
It's a misunderstanding.

167
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,980
Misunderstanding?

168
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,850
My Lord.

169
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,460
Focus on

170
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,580
your work.

171
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,900
Otherwise, they'll call me
Helen of Troy,

172
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,090
and you'll be worried about me.

173
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,420
Lan Che.

174
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,900
I prepared something for you.

175
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,690
My Lord.

176
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,820
In Liangzhou,

177
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,530
people often send a knife
to their lover as a token.

178
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,280
This is the knife my father left.

179
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,330
Now

180
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,050
I'm giving it to you.

181
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,020
If he knew

182
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,940
I gave this to you,

183
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,460
he'd be so happy.

184
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,500
(Focus on Details)

185
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,260
Lord Li, thank you so much

186
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,700
for your help.

187
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,010
It's okay.

188
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,920
We're colleagues.

189
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,730
Besides, I only...

190
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,940
My Lord, it just occurred to me

191
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
an old hen in the kitchen laid some eggs

192
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,060
and needed company.

193
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,140
I'm leaving.

194
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,010
You...

195
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,860
It's

196
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,340
exactly what you think.

197
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,940
Come on. Over here.

198
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,220
Customized Lanterns.

199
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,700
Customized Lanterns.

200
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,900
Okay.

201
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,020
Here you are.

202
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,900
See you next time.

203
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,940
Is a holiday coming up?

204
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,140
Why are they all selling lanterns?

205
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,530
Lanterns are for the Lantern Festival.

206
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,810
My Lord,

207
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,930
don't you know?

208
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,380
Liangzhou doesn't have it.

209
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,540
My Lord,

210
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,820
pick a lantern for the lady.

211
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,020
You need to book it in advance

212
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,700
and come on Lantern Festival.

213
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,860
Choose one.

214
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,540
I like this.

215
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,610
A butterfly lantern.

216
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
(Voucher)
Here's the voucher.

217
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,610
On Lantern Festival,

218
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,140
exchange it for your lantern.

219
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,820
My Lord, on that day,

220
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,610
people will release the lanterns
by the river.

221
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,860
Shall we

222
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,940
do it together this year?

223
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,620
Okay.

224
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,820
Then it's a deal. No backing out.

225
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,250
I promise.

226
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,890
Are you okay?

227
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,080
I'm fine.

228
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,130
Maybe I need more rest.

229
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,660
Lan Che.

230
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,370
Lan Che?

231
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,820
You're awake.

232
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,820
Why did I pass out?

233
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,090
Master,

234
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,170
she hasn't been feeling well lately

235
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,370
and has lost her sense of flavor.

236
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,890
What's going on?

237
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,740
Why did you tell me?

238
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,620
I thought it was just an after-effect.

239
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,820
Are there any other symptoms?

240
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,700
I'm fine.

241
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,890
I just didn't rest well
after being poisoned.

242
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,530
I'll eat more food, and I'll be fine.

243
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,620
Don't worry.

244
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,780
Luo,

245
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,410
I'm hungry.

246
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,010
Can you cook for me?

247
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,210
Okay.

248
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,000
Doctor,

249
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,340
please take care of Lan Che.

250
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:42,970
Don't worry.

251
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,460
Master,

252
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,170
can you give me more sleeping incense?

253
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,620
Master?

254
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,530
I'm coming in.

255
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,010
Why is he staying out tonight?

256
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,300
(Dendrobium)

257
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,580
It's engraved with three flame patterns.

258
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,170
That's the special mark

259
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,370
for Liangzhou's pharmacists.

260
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Why does Master have

261
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,700
a tiger pendant
of Liangzhou's pharmacists.

262
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,100
My Lord, wait.

263
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,780
Lan Che.

264
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,380
Why are you sleeping here?

265
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,130
Master,

266
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,820
where were you last night?

267
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,990
I went out for something.

268
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,600
What's wrong?

269
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,620
Master,

270
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,170
I found this tiger pendant in your room.

271
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,890
Feng Qing told me

272
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,370
Jiuxiang has the same tiger pendant.

273
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,620
Did you know her?

274
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,130
No.

275
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,540
Master,

276
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,410
I've always regarded you as my family.

277
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,370
Can you be honest with me?

278
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,630
I...

279
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,320
Who's Huanxi?

280
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,280
I am.

281
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,660
Our brother died
after taking your medicine.

282
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,060
Liangzhou's governor Huo Feng
ordered me

283
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,460
to take you back.

284
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,220
Take all of them.

285
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,140
My Lord,

286
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,100
Huanxi and Lan Che

287
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,140
were taken away.

288
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,340
(Changjing Station)

289
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,220
General.

290
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,140
Huanxi,

291
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,820
did he go to your clinic this morning

292
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,260
and get some medicine that can
improve blood circulation and kill pain?

293
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,180
Give me

294
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,820
Aconiti Radix.

295
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
Yes.

296
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,500
Did you know his lung deficiency?

297
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,060
Pale face

298
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,180
and white tongue,

299
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,220
you have serious lung deficiency.

300
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,420
I did.

301
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,620
Do you know

302
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,700
Aconiti Radix will be
poisonous and even lethal

303
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,980
when mixed with fritillary?

304
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,180
Of course.

305
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
Then why did you add Aconiti Radix?

306
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,940
Justice Department.

307
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,060
Back off.

308
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,020
I did give him some medicine

309
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,980
for his joint pain,

310
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
but I didn't add Aconiti Radix.

311
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,780
General,

312
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,260
the passers-by heard clearly

313
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,740
our brother ask for it,

314
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,940
and Huanxi promised to get it.

315
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,820
Besides, we kept the residues.

316
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,100
How can you deny it?

317
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,540
The residues?

318
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,500
If that's the case,

319
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,460
bring them

320
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,870
and find out if there's Aconiti Radix.

321
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,140
Father,

322
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,940
he wants to check the evidence.

323
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,260
That's a fair request.

324
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,020
You will agree, right?

325
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,340
Didn't you hear Lord Chancellor?

326
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Go get them.

327
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,260
Aye.

328
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,380
Mingye,

329
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,460
you're well-informed.

330
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,380
I just took him back,

331
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,100
and now you're here.

332
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,420
As the Lord Chancellor,

333
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,340
it's my duty

334
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,940
to go through every case.

335
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,700
General.

336
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,700
Lord Lou,

337
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,780
I've heard you also know medicine.

338
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,740
Why don't help us

339
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,420
clarify the ingredients.

340
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,420
Earthworm,

341
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,100
Asiatic Wormwood,

342
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,700
and Safflower.

343
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,180
They're common herbs
for blood congestion.

344
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,300
There's no Aconiti Radix.

345
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,980
How's that possible?

346
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,100
They said it was you

347
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,940
who...

348
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,180
I'm a doctor.

349
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,340
How can I risk my patient's life?

350
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,100
I noticed he couldn't recognize
Aconiti Radix,

351
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,520
- so I decided to give him
- Hurry up!

352
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,340
the alternatives.

353
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,580
Here's a pack of Safflower.

354
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,020
Let me see.

355
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,780
Aye.

356
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,210
General.

357
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,540
Idiot!

358
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,100
Apologize now!

359
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,620
Doctor Huanxi,

360
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,860
Lady Lan Che,

361
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,140
I'm sorry.

362
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,340
Please forgive me.

363
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,700
No need.

364
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,460
Can you

365
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,340
let us go?

366
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,540
Suit yourself.

367
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Huanxi can't leave.

368
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,260
He's suspected of
making Carefree Powder.

369
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,980
According to the law,

370
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,940
he must be investigated.

371
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,220
Lan Che!

372
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,540
I heard Huanxi was arrested.

373
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,260
Lord Lou said

374
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,380
he helped them make Carefree Powder.

375
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,020
How's that possible?

376
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,500
Where's Lou Mingye?

377
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,100
Still in there.

378
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,500
Lord Li.

379
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,900
As Lord Lou said,

380
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,580
no one can get in

381
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,180
until he's out.

382
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,340
I'll just take a look.

383
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,300
Not even a glance.

384
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,460
Not even King of Yan.

385
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,540
I should've

386
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,580
foreseen this.

387
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,420
If it weren't for Lan Che,

388
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,140
I wouldn't have helped you
in Huaisha Village.

389
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,700
If you really care about her,

390
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,140
you should tell me everything.

391
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,020
Who's behind

392
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,660
Distortion Pill?

393
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,500
I can

394
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,660
tell you everything,

395
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,220
but how long

396
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,220
can you protect me?

397
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,580
Lou Mingye.

398
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,020
Are you crazy?

399
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,900
How can Huanxi be involved?

400
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,540
Is he framed?

401
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,260
We can help him.

402
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,820
- He's admitted it.
- You...

403
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,260
What?

404
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,180
My Lord.

405
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,180
Can I talk to him?

406
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,140
No matter what,

407
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,260
if I don't ask him myself,

408
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,260
I won't accept it.

409
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,020
Master.

410
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,900
You shouldn't come.

411
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,700
Master,

412
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,900
why did you say

413
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,500
you made Carefree Powder?

414
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,740
No one forced me to.

415
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,340
Wu Ming and I

416
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,940
made Carefree Powder together.

417
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,340
Ten years ago,

418
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,860
we were ordered by Tuo Jiduo

419
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,380
to make Distortion Pill.

420
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,740
In the process,

421
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,300
we were surprised to find

422
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,860
that Carefree Grass

423
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,100
can be used to make

424
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,420
a hallucinatory drug,

425
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,300
that is, Carefree Powder.

426
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Master, what are you talking about?

427
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,180
Lan Che,

428
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,740
do you think you know me?

429
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,260
Of course I do.

430
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,660
We've lived together for ten years.

431
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,820
Okay, answer me.

432
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,540
What's my real name?

433
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,820
You're Huan...

434
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,570
Have you ever wondered

435
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,660
why an unknown doctor like me

436
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,300
identified Oblivion Flower immediately

437
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,420
and made the cures for
Carefree Powder and Oblivion Drug?

438
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,410
Because I made them in the first place.

439
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,780
I'm the last pharmacist

440
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,530
(Huanxi)
who escaped

441
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,220
from Liangzhou.

442
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,890
Yu Xie is Huanxi.

443
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,810
Huanxi

444
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,900
is Yu Xie.
