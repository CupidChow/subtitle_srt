=Episode 21=

3
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,450
Master.

4
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,100
You look good.

5
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,500
Why aren't you dressed?

6
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,810
It's about time.

7
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,960
What's the rush?

8
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,810
Boss!

9
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,420
Master.

10
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,260
Li Mo is here.

11
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,780
Good morning.

12
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,420
Come on.

13
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,420
- Here.
- Be careful.

14
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,440
Put it here.

15
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,810
This is too much.

16
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,330
Come on. Right here.

17
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,420
Come on. Put it in.

18
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,730
Over here.

19
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,730
- Be careful.
- Okay.

20
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,450
It's been a long time.

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,220
Should I call you Lan Che or Lady Leng?

22
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,090
Stop.

23
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,140
Do you want

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,090
to be expelled from our gang?

25
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,220
No, no, no.

26
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,170
Boss.

27
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,330
Congratulations.

28
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,170
Congratulations.

29
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,890
The groom is so handsome.

30
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,250
(Blessing)
Exactly.

31
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,220
Come on, let's share the blessing.

32
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,090
Yes.

33
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,330
The groom is coming.

34
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,020
The groom is coming.

35
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,940
Lord Lou has arrived.

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,090
- So fast?
- You're not dressed!

37
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,930
Hurry up!

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,860
Give us a hand!

39
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,890
Hurry! Come on!

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,900
- Let's go.
- Come on.

41
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,140
Congratulations.

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,170
Congratulations.

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,380
Yes, he's so handsome.

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,810
Best wishes.

45
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,930
Huanxi.

46
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,420
Lan Che is getting changed.

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,290
Dao.

48
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,170
You're here.

49
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,530
Yes.

50
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,090
I've brought gifts.

51
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,860
All of these are for her.

52
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,060
If you fail her,

53
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,220
with these things,

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,780
she can always kick you out.

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,140
If you dare to bully her,

56
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,660
I'll knock your teeth out.

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,900
Thanks.

58
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,330
What?

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,170
You've

60
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,300
helped me a lot.

61
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,300
Thank you for trusting me.

62
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,220
Who wants to help you?

63
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,570
Everything I've done

64
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,890

Father.

88
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,500
Why are you here?

89
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,100
Your Highness.

90
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,890
It's Lan Che's wedding.

91
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,890
Why don't you join us?

92
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,570
Take him to his seat...

93
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,890
No need.

94
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,130
I'm here to take Lou Mingye back.

95
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,780
Lord Lou,

96
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,700
did you forget

97
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,220
your promise?

98
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,380
Someone wants to keep you alive.

99
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,410
I'm just following the order.

100
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Your Highness,

101
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
I don't think you helped me
out of kindness.

102
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,290
I'm helping you

103
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,540
because I want a deal.

104
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,290
I've heard

105
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,410
you're the ingredient
of Distortion Pill.

106
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,940
The drug is highly poisonous.

107
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,940
Once made,

108
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,330
it'll bring disaster.

109
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,130
His Majesty won't allow

110
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,290
anyone or anything to harm Qi

111
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,730
even if some innocent people

112
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,540
have to sacrifice themselves.

113
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,100
My Lord.

114
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,730
What's going on?

115
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,570
Not a big deal.

116
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,060
Don't worry.

117
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,290
Father.

118
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,410
It's Lou Mingye and Lan Che's wedding.

119
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,410
Why can't you choose another day?

120
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,980
He's the ingredient of Distortion Pill.

121
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm ordered to take him back.

122
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,500
Let's go, Lord Lou.

123
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,130
Sorry.

124
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,940
Wait a minute.

125
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,660
Your Highness.

126
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,290
You're doing it wrong.

127
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,780
He's not the ingredient.

128
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,500
The person you're looking for

129
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,850
is me.

130
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,300
Stop kidding.

131
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm not.

132
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,060
Lou Mingye.

133
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,330
I also have the purest yang energy.

134
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,060
When we were kids,

135
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,780
my father once exchanged our blood.

136
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,260
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,660
Sleep.

138
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,060
How could you exchange their blood?

139
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,170
Mingye hasn't received proper treatment.

140
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,970
Now he's dying.

141
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,560
Only Qingyao's blood

142
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,530
can save him.

143
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,100
Mingye

144
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,170
is going to be the governor
of Liangzhou.

145
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,460
His safety

146
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,970
will affect the morale
of the entire Liangzhou army.

147
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,650
Impossible.

148
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,170
We'll

149
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,700
figure it out.

150
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,860
Bring it.

151
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,340
The ingredient's blood is special.

152
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,580
The person whose blood

153
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,170
can activate the worm

154
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,020
is the real ingredient.

155
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,530
Lan Che,

156
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,780
please.

157
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,580
Maybe not.

158
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,500
What if I leave you one day?

159
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,970
You'll need them

160
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,170
to marry someone else.

161
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,700
Marriage is not a game.

162
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,580
Have you made up your mind?

163
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,220
Lou Mingye.

164
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,060
Don't make me regret this, okay?

165
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,140
Lan Che,

166
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,820
come with me.

167
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,380
She can't.

168
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,690
What did you say?

169
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,210
I said,

170
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,460
she can't go with you.

171
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,780
Lou Mingye,

172
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,210
do you want to disobey the edict?

173
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,410
Don't you dare hurt my lord!

174
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,750
Fang Tingge,

175
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,020
I know you're
the best fighter in Liangzhou.

176
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,380
But this is Changjing.

177
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,460
It doesn't work for me.

178
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,610
Whoever hurts him,

179
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,580
I'll cut their heads off.

180
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,490
Your Highness,

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,060
I have to take Lan Che away today.

182
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,250
After that,

183
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,460
I'll ask His Majesty to punish me.

184
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,460
Let's take a break.

185
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,700
He can't find us right now.

186
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,010
Lou Mingye.

187
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,090
Why did you promise him?

188
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,820
He helped me to catch Huo Feng,

189
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,530
but I have to...

190
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,410
Do you know Shanyin Pavilion in Donghai?

191
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,340
When this is over.

192
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,970
You'll move there.

193
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,340
It's even worse than dying.

194
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,650
So, I can't let you go.

195
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,250
Lou Mingye.

196
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,210
I don't have much time left.

197
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,460
You shouldn't have
disobeyed His Majesty.

198
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,650
It's not worth it.

199
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,700
Lan Che.

200
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,140
I'm not going to let you lie.

201
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,700
We haven't finished the wedding.

202
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Three bows, right?

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,530
We have to finish it.

204
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,410
Why don't we take the last bow

205
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
under the eye

206
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,090
of heaven and earth?

207
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,630
Okay.

208
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,260
(In the presence)

209
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,340
(of heaven and earth,)

210
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,260
(Lou Mingye and Lan Che)

211
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,610
(are married to each other.)

212
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,770
(Stay with each other)

213
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,700
(till death do us part.)

214
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,900
(Love each other when we're alive)

215
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,380
(and keep each other in mind
after death.)

216
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,740
(King of Yan's Mansion)
Help!

217
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,650
Let me out!

218
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,410
Are you crazy?

219
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,730
Don't you know me?

220
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,540
Help!

221
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,650
Let me out!

222
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,900
Are you crazy?

223
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,450
It's you.

224
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,170
My Lord, please calm down.

225
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,700
I have no choice.

226
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,500
You're good at fighting.

227
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,900
Only in this way can we control you.

228
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,170
I'm so sorry.

229
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,210
What are you thinking?

230
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm thinking about our future.

231
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,380
Look at us.

232
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,170
Our outfits are too noticeable.

233
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,090
There's a farmer.

234
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,610
Buy some common clothes

235
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,170
for us, okay?

236
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,050
Okay.

237
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,820
Wait here.

238
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,860
Okay.

239
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,300
Your Highness,

240
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,650
Lan Che wants to see you.

241
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,660
Bring her in.

242
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,570
Aye.

243
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,900
Lou Mingye is disobedient,

244
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,410
but you're smart.

245
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,780
Your Highness,

246
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,660
can you

247
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,460
do me a favor?

248
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,730
Tell me.

249
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,250
My master and friends
have nothing to do with this.

250
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,060
Can you please release them?

251
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,530
They're useless.

252
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,250
I never wanted to give them a hard time.

253
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,890
As for Lou Mingye...

254
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,170
Can you please forgive him?

255
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,580
If he behaves himself...

256
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,700
I'll have mercy on him.

257
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,250
However,

258
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,890
it's all up to you.

259
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,420
Your Highness,

260
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,410
since you're so generous,

261
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,780
then I'll

262
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,620
keep my promise

263
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,820
and go to Shanyin Pavilion.

264
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,620
Who told you about

265
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,530
Shanyin Pavilion?

266
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,530
Lord Lou.

267
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,090
Your Highness,

268
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,740
is Lan Che here?

269
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,740
I didn't force her.

270
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,940
She took the initiative.

271
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,010
She doesn't have much time.

272
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,770
I can't let her die alone.

273
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,530
Please fulfill my wish.

274
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,940
As you once worked with my son,

275
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,890
I'll have mercy this time,

276
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,650
but don't go too far.

277
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,970
Your Highness...

278
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,180
Walk him out.

279
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,580
My Lord, please.

280
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,940
Which troop are you from?

281
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,490
My Lord, look.

282
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,980
It's said the burned soldiers

283
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,890
went mad before they died.

284
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,690
They were so strong
and would attack anyone.

285
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,770
That's the symptom of being poisoned
by both Carefree Powder

286
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,220
and Oblivion Drug.

287
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,010
Huanxi told me

288
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,890
when they were making the drug,

289
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,940
they found if one only takes
one of the drugs,

290
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,700
he'll be extremely strong,

291
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,650
but it'll only last for three days.

292
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,340
After that, he'll die of
excessive bleeding.

293
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,060
My Lord, do you mean...?

294
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,130
They wanted to destroy the bodies.

295
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,980
Where's Huanxi?

296
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,770
No idea.

297
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,980
Only Luo and Dao were released.

298
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,100
I didn't expect

299
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,170
you'd work for King of Yan.

300
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,170
Don't let King of Yan

301
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,770
catch me.

302
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,130
Please.

303
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,700
I want to die with dignity.

304
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,010
My godfather had always known this.

305
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,250
No wonder he was
so afraid of King of Yan.

306
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,340
It's yours.

307
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,530
My diary?

308
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,060
It turns out it's King of Yan
who wants the pill.

309
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,340
Lan Che must be in danger.

310
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,060
(King of Yan's Mansion)

311
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,370
My Lord, time for lunch.

312
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,370
Not in the mood.

313
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,530
Your father told me to take care of you.

314
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,100
Don't make it hard for me.

315
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,610
Here.

316
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,340
Is this how you take care of me?

317
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,940
I have no choice.

318
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,060
Don't blame me.

319
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,370
You're pretty,

320
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,340
but why are you so mean?

321
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,490
What a glib.

322
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,700
Eat it.

323
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,410
I want to eat with you.

324
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,940
It's inappropriate.

325
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,700
Inappropriate?

326
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,170
I can eat with anyone

327
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,530
as I want.

328
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,490
Hel...

329
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,850
You can fight,

330
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,220
but it's not worth it.

331
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,900
Just

332
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,290
stay here and rest.

333
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,700
I have work to do.

334
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,860
Goodbye.

335
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,620
I'm free!

336
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,370
Father.

337
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,580
Lan Che?

338
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,300
Li Mo?

339
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,620
Why are you here?

340
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,740
Why are you here?

341
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,370
I'll get you out.

342
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,850
Brother.

343
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,940
Are you okay?

344
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,290
What's wrong?

345
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,730
Father,

346
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,490
who are these people in the dungeon?

347
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,460
They're

348
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,100
the testers I used
to make Distortion Pill.

349
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,980
What did you say?

350
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,700
Why are you so nervous?

351
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,540
Your Highness.

352
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,620
You sent

353
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,370
Huali to spy on Lou Mingye

354
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,860
because you wanted to make the pill

355
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,820
under the guise of investigation, right?

356
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,490
Since you've found out,

357
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,340
I'll be honest with you.

358
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,530
Back then, His Majesty

359
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,130
did order me to destroy
the Distortion Pill.

360
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,290
But it's because

361
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,650
he had no idea

362
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,370
what it can bring to Qi.

363
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,130
Fortunately,

364
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,820
the ingredient inside you

365
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,060
will be ready in two days,

366
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,290
and you'll be sacrificed
to make the pill.

367
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,010
When it's finished,

368
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,770
our army will be stronger than ever,

369
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,580
and we'll

370
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,460
bring back our glory.

371
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,700
Father!

372
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,490
Distortion Pill is just a myth.

373
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,770
How could you kill
so many innocent people

374
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,100
for a fantasy?

375
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,530
Take her down.

376
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,370
Aye.

377
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,130
Father!

378
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,410
If you insist on doing this,

379
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,100
you won't save Qi but ruin it!

380
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,940
Shut up!

381
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,170
You have no right

382
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,890
to meddle with my business.

383
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,250
Don't forget

384
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,740
everything you have

385
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,650
is from me.

386
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,770
As long as I'm the king,

387
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,130
you'll only be a useless prince.

388
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,820
Guards.

389
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,900
Aye.

390
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,170
Locked him up.

391
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,410
No one can visit him

392
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,770
without my permission.

393
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,970
Aye!

394
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,900
Your Highness,

395
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,410
he was just worried about you.

396
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,770
How dare you teach me

397
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,770
to educate my son?

398
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,460
If you don't know the rules,

399
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,940
I'll teach you!

400
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,130
Father!

401
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,130
I'm so sorry.

402
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,010
I'm so stupid!

403
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,410
I'm sorry I let you down.

404
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,060
I'll assist you

405
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,340
in the rejuvenation of Qi.

406
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,010
Please forgive me.

407
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,370
Your Highness.

408
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,530
Get out.

409
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,820
Aye.

410
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,580
King of Yan is dominating the court,

411
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,820
and His Majesty trusts him very much,

412
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,490
not to mention his patrol troops.

413
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,370
It's impossible

414
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,370
for us to defeat him alone.

415
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,850
Not necessarily true.

416
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,300
My Lord,

417
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,330
why did you

418
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,650
save me?

419
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,980
Because you save us,

420
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,620
and I don't want anyone to get hurt

421
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,820
because of my father.

422
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,890
Can you do me a favor?

423
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,130
Lou Mingye must've figured out
my father's plan.

424
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,250
This place is heavily guarded.

425
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,250
He can't stop my father

426
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,650
on his own.

427
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,980
His father's name
is highly respected in Liangzhou,

428
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,530
and now Huo Feng is dead,

429
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,940
so the Liangzhou army in Changjing

430
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,890
My Lord!

431
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,980
will make him a new leader.

432
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,290
My Lord!

433
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,900
I bet

434
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,100
he'll lead these soldiers
to take the risk.

435
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,100
There's only one way out.

436
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,410
Lan Che.
