00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,900
=Episode 1=

3
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,440
Every individual has five elements,

4
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,040
joy, anger, nostalgia, fear, and sorrow.

5
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,560
The five elements
generate seven emotions.

6
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,870
Whoever can control the emotions

7
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,430
will win people's hearts.

8
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,840
Blessed be the heaven.

9
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,710
May the lord open.

10
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,510
My Lord, here's your refreshment.

11
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,820
My Lord,

12
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,140
those people in white robes

13
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,620
are Divine Joy Cult's followers.

14
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,860
It's said Chen Zhisong
can communicate with the heaven.

15
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,300
All the followers are very loyal to him

16
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,860
and offer him
countless gold every month.

17
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,860
In the presence of god
descends the true spirit.

18
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,940
Time to return to heaven.

19
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,820
Ascends the goddess!

20
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,350
Look! Statue of god is shedding tears!

21
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,020
Who are the followers?

22
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,940
It's hard to say.

23
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,340
Bishop Chen Zhisong selected them.

24
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,060
The last day of each month
is the Worship Day.

25
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,540
The followers will come

26
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,140
and pray for a mysterious pill.

27
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,460
It's said after taking it,

28
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,780
one can feel the divine joy

29
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,180
like in heaven.

30
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,420
Master, please help me ascend to heaven.

31
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,220
On the Worship Day,
a Divine Joy Saint will be chosen.

32
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,340
If the Heavenly Lord
gives a sacred sign,

33
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,940
she'll ascend to heaven.

34
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,300
Is it real?

35
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,660
I wouldn't know.

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm just a waiter

37
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,900
counting on tips.

38
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,100
However, considering the scene today,

39
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,780
I think something big is happening.

40
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,700
The person you're looking for

41
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,260
will come today.

42
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
I need to give you a heads-up.

43
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,660
You shouldn't get involved in

44
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,460
Divine Joy Cult's affairs.

45
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,500
Why?

46
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,820
I heard they had problems,

47
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,780
and the court sent a new Lord Chancellor

48
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,940
to dig into it.

49
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,340
You're well-informed.

50
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,860
That's my job.

51
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,100
My Lord, I'll open the curtain.

52
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,260
My lord doesn't like sunlight.

53
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,620
You can leave.

54
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,860
Suit yourself.

55
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,140
My Lord,

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,260
we've found her.

57
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,140
She's hiding in Changjing,

58
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,300
but she's changed her name

59
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,780
and never told anyone
about Leng Qingyao.

60
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Her name

61
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,020
is Lan Che now.

62
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,980
Take the elixir.

63
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,700
Go to heaven.

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,340
Be patient.

65
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,180
A scared sign!

66
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,260
A scared sign!

67
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,300
Blessed be the Lord!

68
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,620
Blessed be the Lord!

69
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,100
Can you feel

70
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,740
the wonderland?

71
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,860
The saint is ascending to heaven.

72
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,540
Blessed be
the Heavenly Lord of Divine Joy!

73
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,140
Blessed be the Lord!

74
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,620
Soul teleport completed.

75
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,300
Seal the coffin.

76
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,540
Send the saint to heaven!

77
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,180
Chen Zhisong, give my lady back!

78
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,460
How dare you?

79
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,200
Your lady?

80
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,980
Today marks the ascension of the saint.

81
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,180
Get out!

82
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,580
Don't be rude.

83
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,700
My lady is called Lan Che.

84
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,660
Master, don't you remember her?

85
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,100
She's always devout.

86
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
She follows you

87
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,100
on every Worship Day.

88
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,060
Your lady

89
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,940
is blessed by the Lord.

90
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,980
She's in heaven now,

91
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,660
it's her great fortune.

92
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,540
No way!

93
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,540
She wouldn't even dare
to kill a chicken.

94
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,340
How could she leave without us?

95
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,620
Heaven's order must not be violated.

96
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,900
Your lady's soul
has teleported to heaven.

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,020
I'm warning you.

98
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,020
Don't fight against heaven,

99
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,260
or you'll be punished

100
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,860
and die in misery.

101
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,580
- My Lady!
- My Lady!

102
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,340
Dao, come on.

103
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,940
My Lady, we're here to save you.

104
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,980
Nasty tricks.

105
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,980
The saint has come back!

106
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,420
Your Highness.

107
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
I ascended to heaven

108
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,740
and face the Heavenly Lord.

109
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,180
His Majesty sent me back
to the mortal world

110
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,820
because

111
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,060
Chen Zhisong

112
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,300
speculated about the will of heaven

113
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,220
and plundered people's properties
with the Heavenly Lord's order.

114
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,460
Do you acknowledge your sins?

115
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,500
What? The Supreme Master...

116
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,460
Master, what's going on?

117
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,260
My Lord, what is she doing?

118
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,420
Nasty tricks for nasty people.

119
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,900
Nonsense! It's nonsense!

120
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,700
Shut up.

121
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,580
Chen Zhisong,

122
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,660
how dare you offend me?

123
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,380
Mercy, Your Majesty!

124
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,820
You collected followers
in the name of His Majesty

125
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,540
and lured them
to take your so-called elixir.

126
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,740
However,

127
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,180
your elixir is a poison

128
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,780
that makes them obey you

129
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,340
and offer all their savings

130
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,460
for your drug.

131
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,540
How dare you? It's nonsense!

132
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,620
How dare you deny it?

133
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,340
Chen Zhisong
has been deceiving the people.

134
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,780
His true color has been revealed.

135
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,140
Take him down

136
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,380
and take back your properties.

137
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,100
Bring him to justice.

138
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,340
After this,

139
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,700
the Heavenly Lord will bless you.

140
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,100
Don't listen to her!

141
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,650
- Who's this?
- Who is he?

142
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,030
It's on fire! Run!

143
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,090
Watch out!

144
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, no!

145
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
Chen Zhisong.

146
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,140
Are you scared?

147
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,940
Today,

148
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,260
you have to give back

149
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,500
your dirty money.

150
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,580
How dare you murder me?

151
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,300
Chen Zhisong, stop pretending!

152
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,980
You...

153
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,740
The saint is punishing him for heaven!

154
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,340
My Lady!

155
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,740
Somebody, help!

156
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,020
Bring my lord to his mansion!

157
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,780
Wait a minute.

158
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,340
Chen Zhisong died

159
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,580
in front of me.

160
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,860
It's a murder.

161
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,660
How can you take him away?

162
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,820
We should

163
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,740
report it to the Justice Department

164
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,380
and let them interrogate me.

165
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,380
The new Lord Chancellor
just came, didn't he?

166
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,420
He's known as the Ruthless Judge

167
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,380
who can handle any cases.

168
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,580
- My Lady...
- Boss,

169
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,460
what's wrong with you?

170
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,300
Shut up.

171
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,700
Something's wrong with this.

172
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,060
Do you want him to get away?

173
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,580
My lady passed the will of heaven,

174
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,540
but she wouldn't murder others.

175
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,020
We're willing to

176
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,100
go to the Justice Department
to prove her innocence.

177
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,420
Is that so?

178
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,180
If that's the case,

179
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,100
my lord will perform an autopsy.

180
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,340
Who's this?

181
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
Who's this?

182
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,940
You...

183
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,460
What are you doing here?

184
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,140
Aren't you looking for Lord Chancellor?

185
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,940
That's me.

186
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,020
He's the new Lord Chancellor.

187
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,420
Don't move!

188
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,060
Don't move!

189
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,820
Let me go!

190
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,300
Who'd believe you?

191
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,300
Don't move!

192
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,060
Don't move!

193
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,930
Get off me!

194
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,430
Hurry!

195
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,260
My Lord!

196
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,160
- My Lord!
- Hurry!

197
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
Aye.

198
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,540
How can you leave me?

199
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,620
My Lord!

200
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,530
Wake up!

201
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,740
Who told you to come in?

202
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,340
Get out!

203
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,580
My lord was murdered.

204
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,620
As officers, how can you
let the murderer get away

205
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,260
and try to kick me out?

206
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,660
Are you bullying me
because my husband is gone?

207
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,580
My Lord!

208
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,260
Get her out.

209
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,980
Aye.

210
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,380
- Let's go!
- Get off me!

211
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,220
Get off me!

212
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,810
How dare you?

213
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,230
- This is illegal!
- My Lady!

214
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,780
Get off me!

215
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,140
Keep an eye on them.

216
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,420
Don't let them steal the body.

217
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,260
Aye.

218
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,340
What about her?

219
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,820
Lord Xu is interrogating her.

220
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,980
I didn't tell him

221
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,540
you came for her.

222
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
Lan Che,

223
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,220
(Silence)
why did you kill him?

224
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,660
Haven't I told you

225
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,820
something's wrong with his death?

226
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,780
If I had killed him,

227
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
why would I report it

228
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
and turn myself in?

229
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,380
If you can't figure it out,

230
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,540
ask the new officer to do it.

231
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,060
How dare you?

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,580
What's the difference?

233
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,460
Lord Lou.

234
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,100
Is Lou your surname?

235
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,980
My Lord, I'm innocent.

236
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,900
My Lord, this woman is cunning.

237
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,020
She denied her crimes.

238
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,860
I was...

239
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,580
You pretended to be a saint
to deceive people

240
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,660
and use them to start a riot.

241
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,660
I don't think

242
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,060
you're completely innocent.

243
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,900
My Lord,

244
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,100
you're accusing me

245
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,820
of so many crimes without a reason.

246
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,820
Do you have evidence?

247
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,220
You did prepare a lot

248
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,260
for your disguise.

249
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,460
You placed phosphorus,

250
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,860
alum, and saltpeter in the coffin.

251
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,100
You created

252
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,940
a lot of smoke in the coffin

253
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,580
to set the tone

254
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,140
for your saint identity.

255
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,300
And your assistants...

256
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,380
Shut up!

257
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,140
Chen Zhisong,

258
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,820
how dare you offend me?

259
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,900
Those stupid followers

260
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,900
believed the fake Supreme Master,

261
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,420
so they'd definitely believe you.

262
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,500
My Lord,

263
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,220
no wonder you're Lord Chancellor.

264
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,420
I admire you so much.

265
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,660
You're my role model!

266
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,500
You just came to Changjing,

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,580
so you didn't know

268
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,660
Chen Zhisong was a disgusting criminal.

269
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,050
He not only controlled his followers
with Carefree Powder

270
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,500
but kidnapped and sold people.

271
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,780
He hurt countless naive girls.

272
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,380
Tell me more.

273
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,500
For example,

274
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,740
the god statue's tear

275
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,580
is just a small trick he often uses.

276
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,940
He'd

277
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,620
put wax under the eyes

278
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,260
- of the statue, and...
- Light the candles inside it,

279
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,660
and it'd melt the wax
as the temperature rises

280
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,220
as if the god was shedding tears.

281
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,740
I didn't ask this.

282
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,980
Go to the point.

283
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
Why are you innocent?

284
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,820
Because

285
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,100
he's

286
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,820
not dead.

287
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,900
Fake Death Pill

288
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,100
is also one of his tricks.

289
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,820
Whenever he sees a beautiful girl,

290
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,620
he'll use the burial ceremony

291
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,940
to move her body out secretly

292
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,700
and sell her to others.

293
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,260
I caught him in the act this time.

294
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,100
He knew he was about to fail,

295
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,900
so he wanted to get away

296
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
with a fake death.

297
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,620
Where's the evidence?

298
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,700
My Lord, if you want evidence,

299
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,860
shouldn't you be

300
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,580
more sincere?

301
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,980
How dare you?

302
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,140
Tell me.

303
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,300
What do you want?

304
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,260
My Lord,

305
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,220
Chen Zhisong committed many crimes
and harmed the people.

306
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
One of his crimes

307
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,260
is that he occupied

308
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,900
a house in Datong District.

309
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,620
My Lord,

310
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,820
can you please help me

311
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,500
get the deed back?

312
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,740
Why would I believe you?

313
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,260
Luckily,

314
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,540
I happen to be

315
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,220
a pharmacist,

316
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,460
and I have the cure

317
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,780
for his fake death.

318
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,900
Fake Death Pill can
make his blood coagulate for a while

319
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,940
as if his heart stops,

320
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,100
and my pill can stimulate his heart

321
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,380
and make his blood flow.

322
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,980
He'll wake up very soon.

323
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,940
What did you do?

324
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,420
I...

325
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,060
No way.

326
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,340
When did he get the wound on his head?

327
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
It's a penetrating wound.

328
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,020
I didn't do anything!

329
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,100
I just gave him the pill!

330
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,540
You saw it, right?

331
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,420
Did anyone approach him

332
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,580
apart from his family?

333
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,580
His family was out of control,

334
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,300
and I was distracted.

335
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,860
Someone found out about his fake death

336
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,180
and

337
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,940
didn't want him to wake up.

338
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,620
Well...

339
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,220
If nothing else,

340
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm leaving.

341
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
As for the deed,

342
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,580
you can send it to Huanxi Clinic

343
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,660
in Guiyi District.

344
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,060
This is terrifying.

345
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,900
Wait.

346
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,660
When did I promise

347
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,100
to give you the deed?

348
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,580
You...

349
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,700
You didn't keep your promise.

350
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
Shameless liar.

351
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,740
Keep an eye on her

352
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,140
and find out

353
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,740
what she's up to.

354
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,860
Aye.

355
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,180
My Lord,

356
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,740
I think he's a drug addict.

357
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,420
Carefree Powder...

358
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,180
My Lord, Carefree Powder
is highly addictive.

359
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,100
Don't light it!

360
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,900
The smell...

361
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,100
Please give it to me...

362
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,860
Give it to me!

363
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,140
Give it to me!

364
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,300
Who killed Chen Zhisong?

365
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

366
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,980
take a look.

367
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,580
Huanxi Clinic

368
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,780
has made a new drug
named Cure for Worries

369
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,620
for Carefree Powder addicts.

370
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,020
You can get clean after one session.

371
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,140
(Huanxi Clinic)

372
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,420
My Lady. Take a look!

373
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,260
Check this out!

374
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,940
Thanks.

375
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,820
Get your medicine over there.

376
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,740
Thanks.

377
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,500
Master, you're impressive.

378
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,060
How much have you made this time?

379
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,020
Stupid girl, you're finally back.

380
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,020
I've told you a million times...

381
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,700
Thanks.

382
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,420
Don't get involved with
Carefree Powder,

383
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,260
and what did you do?

384
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,820
You destroyed the cult.

385
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,420
I just wanted to get
Madam Wang's deed back.

386
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,900
Besides,

387
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,620
thanks to this, you've earned a lot.

388
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,460
You...

389
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,340
Thanks.

390
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,220
Where's the deed? Did you get it?

391
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,740
Who'd have expected his death?

392
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,060
You got in trouble again!

393
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,420
- Don't deny it!
- Have a good day.

394
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,300
- Don't run!
- Master!

395
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,140
Get over here!

396
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,250
- Don't run!
- Too terrible!

397
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,860
Master,

398
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,780
Boss has always been blessed by god

399
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,300
and can get out of trouble every time.

400
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,180
Stop defending her.

401
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,220
Master!

402
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,780
You have no idea what I went through.

403
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,140
I was taken to the Justice Department,

404
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,420
and someone even touched me.

405
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,860
So annoying.

406
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,660
Who... Who touched you?

407
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,180
Lou Mingye,

408
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,060
the new Lord Chancellor.

409
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,700
If I get the chance,

410
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,220
I'll definitely teach him a lesson.

411
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,020
Boss,

412
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,940
I think he rushed to hold you

413
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,220
because he wanted to save you.

414
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,260
Someone was shooting arrows upstairs.

415
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,900
If he hadn't held you and dodged it,

416
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,180
you would've been shot.

417
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,980
Girl,

418
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,420
are you alright?

419
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm fine.

420
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
Is he okay?

421
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,740
I don't know.

422
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,140
You have no idea who he is.

423
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,380
Huo Feng, the governor of Liangzhou,
is his godfather.

424
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,340
He used to be the Grand Warden
of Liangzhou, managing 3000 prisoners.

425
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,340
Anyway, I've heard

426
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,700
people in Liangzhou are wild.

427
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,580
Maybe he got in trouble in Liangzhou

428
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,900
and wanted to make a living here.

429
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,300
What? Stupid girl,

430
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,180
you know nothing.

431
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,180
Anyway, just listen to me.

432
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,420
Stay away from him,

433
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,460
or I'll deduct your wages.

434
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,620
Master.

435
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,580
I can stay away from him,

436
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,020
but isn't it too much

437
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,540
to deduct my wages?

438
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,820
Sir, I want to buy some medicine.

439
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,940
Come in. Come in.

440
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,060
It's been a long time.

441
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,740
(Lou's Mansion)

442
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,420
(Leng Quji, Leng Qingyao,)

443
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,140
(you destroyed my family)

444
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,900
(ten years ago.)

445
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,140
(I've never given up on revenge.)

446
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,020
(God bless,)

447
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,940
(I've finally found you.)

448
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,740
(Let's wait and see.)

449
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
(I'll make you pay the price.)
