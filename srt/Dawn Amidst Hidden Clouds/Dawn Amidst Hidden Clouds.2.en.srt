00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,060
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,610
Little Patient,

4
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,510
my dad said
you should take your medicine.

5
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,870
I don't want it.

6
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,720
It's sweet.

7
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,970
You lied every time.

8
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,790
I won't fall for it again.

9
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,420
Look. I tried.

10
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,040
It's not bitter at all.

11
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,340
You lied!

12
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,870
Liangzhou is my hometown.

13
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,770
I won't allow anyone

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,200
to harm the city.

15
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,530
Mingye.

16
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,710
Dad,

17
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,860
Uncle Lou,

18
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,040
you're back.

19
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,490
Mingye,

20
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,760
play with Qingyao for a while.

21
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,570
I need to talk to Uncle Leng.

22
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,270
Don't lie to me again.

23
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,240
Then you need to take the medicine.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
Deal.

25
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,130
Qingyao,

26
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,400
it's time to go home.

27
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,710
Little Patient, see you tomorrow.

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
See you tomorrow.

29
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,710
Let's go.

30
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,180
(Justice and Virtue)

31
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,960
Dad! What happened?

32
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,150
Dad! Say something!

33
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,710
Dad!

34
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,570
Dad, are you okay?

35
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,150
Say something! Dad!

36
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,370
Dad!

37
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,510
Dad!

38
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,300
(Lou's Mansion)

39
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,600
My Lord, you're losing
your sense of taste,

40
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,840
but sometimes I envy you.

41
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,620
Without the sense of taste,

42
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,540
you have no desire for food.

43
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,340
Without the desire for food,

44
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,780
you'll have less to worry about.

45
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,300
It's also a blessing.

46
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,540
I can share the blessing with you.

47
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,340
Hardships make heroes.

48
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,360
To become your best

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
right-hand man,

50
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,540
I should experience more hardships

51
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,380
in this big world.

52
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
My Lord.

53
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,260
You can hand over

54
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,900
the Carefree Powder's case
to someone else.

55
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,060
We came all the way to Changjing

56
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
only to investigate

57
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,220
the truth about General Lou's death.

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,780
We shouldn't be distracted
by something else.

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,660
Don't forget

60
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,500
Carefree Powder showed up in Liangzhou
ten years ago,

61
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,060
and my father was murdered by Leng Quji

62
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,860
as he dug into this.

63
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,820
(Justice and Virtue)

64
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,020
My Lord, are you suspecting...?

65
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Carefree Powder showed up again,

66
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,300
and Leng Quji's daughter

67
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,340
suddenly got into this

68
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,060
after disappearing for a decade.

69
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,700
I don't think it's a coincidence.

70
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,340
There might be a bigger conspiracy.

71
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,860
I'll bring her back right now.

72
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,940
No rush.

73
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,070
You'll tip them off.

74
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,940
Keep her

75
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,620
so that we can find Leng Quji.

76
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,700
By the way, My Lord,

77
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,940
(Lan Che's File)
here's her household register.

78
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,420
She's been running a small gang
in recent years.

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,340
It's called the Greater World,

80
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,860
and she claims to be the leader.

81
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,780
(No Childhood Information)
The only four members

82
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,980
(Origin: Unknown)
often help their neighbors

83
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,460
(No Parents)
with some daily matters,

84
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,700
nothing important.

85
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,500
Okay. I got it.

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,980
(Lan Che's File)

87
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,820
Hurry up.

88
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,140
We need to visit Mrs. Chen Later.

89
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,500
Give back my money!

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,140
Guys, calm down!

91
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,820
Please trust us.

92
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,460
The Greater World

93
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,740
will get your money back.

94
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,260
Two consecutive days of protest.

95
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,420
She's impressive.

96
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,380
Give back my money!

97
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,740
I don't think it's a bad thing.

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,590
Give back my money!

99
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,250
- What are they doing?
- Who are they?

100
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,860
Master Lan Che, do you want to get in?

101
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,620
My Lord.

102
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,220
I heard you saved me yesterday.

103
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,460
Thank you.

104
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,630
Did you get hurt?

105
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,860
Master Lan Che, thanks for your concern.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,340
I'm okay.

107
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,500
My Lord,

108
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,700
you're impressive.

109
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,340
We're the officials.

110
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,380
Open the door.

111
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,900
Let's go.

112
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,940
You two, stay here.

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,780
I'll be right back.

114
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,700
Come on.

115
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
My Lord, your identity worked.

116
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,940
Your gangster identity will be useful.

117
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,460
We'll see.

118
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,580
My Lord, come in.

119
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,420
Hurry.

120
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,140
My Lord, this way.

121
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,180
My Lord.

122
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
Hurry,

123
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,460
get some tea.

124
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,300
Aye.

125
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
Have a seat.

126
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
My Lady.

127
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,860
My condolences, My Lady.

128
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,100
My husband

129
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,020
used to be an herbalist.

130
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,100
He was an honest

131
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,260
and righteous person,

132
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,260
and was always kind to the servants.

133
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,860
No one ever said

134
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,580
bad things about him.

135
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,140
However, I never expected

136
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,100
he'd sell illegal drugs.

137
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,380
She's already

138
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,900
dissociated herself.

139
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,340
She doesn't seem

140
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,120
to love him that much.

141
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,180
My Lord,

142
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,580
have some tea.

143
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,380
(Obvious, everyone in the Chen Family)

144
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,260
(is involved in Carefree Powder.)

145
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,900
Did Chen Zhisong do

146
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,700
anything strange in the past few days?

147
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,100
I don't think so.

148
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,660
However,

149
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,860
his birthday is coming.

150
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
We were going to

151
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,020
celebrate it together.

152
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
Who'd have thought...?

153
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,500
Chen Zhisong!

154
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,900
He knows what he's doing.

155
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,460
He was afraid of
being killed by his boss,

156
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,140
so he prepared Fake Death Pill
in advance.

157
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,460
I think he works for

158
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,780
a man named Wu Ming.

159
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,580
Was Wu Ming invited

160
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
to his birthday party?

161
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,700
Wu Ming?

162
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,660
My husband has never mentioned

163
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,980
this name before.

164
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,380
My Lord,

165
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,700
will when the mobs at the door leave?

166
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,180
And can we take back

167
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,100
my lord's body?

168
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,300
It's not

169
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,020
up to Lord Lou.

170
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,100
You should

171
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,280
ask me.

172
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,900
May I ask

173
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,020
know your name?

174
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,270
I'm Lan Che,

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,460
also known as

176
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,740
Little Dragon.

177
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,580
(Chen's Mansion)

178
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,300
What's your name?

179
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,020
Fang Tingge.

180
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm Luo, and this is Dao.

181
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,500
Lan Che is our boss.

182
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,940
I know.

183
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,700
That's great.

184
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,380
Bro,

185
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,880
I have a question.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,120
Did someone

187
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,860
kill Chen Zhisong after his fake death?

188
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,100
Can't comment.

189
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,340
It must be someone
who knew he faked his death.

190
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,460
Is it Chen San?

191
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,460
Can't comment.

192
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,940
Not Chen San?

193
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,540
Then it must be his family.

194
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,620
After all, that charlatan

195
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,660
would never tell others...

196
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,500
Can't comment.

197
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,100
Can anyone
at the Justice Department talk?

198
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,340
We'll only say

199
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,940
what we're supposed to say.

200
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,700
My Lord,

201
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,940
look, your boss and my boss

202
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,900
met each other twice

203
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,340
in the big city of Changjing.

204
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,620
It must be God's plan.

205
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,540
Can you please tell me something?

206
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,780
God's plan?

207
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,820
If my lord hadn't known Lan Che...

208
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Tell me more.

209
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,020
I'm all ears.

210
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,220
My Lady,

211
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,580
do you know

212
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,140
how many bad things he did

213
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,500
and people he offended?

214
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,340
Do you have any idea

215
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,380
how much would people pay

216
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,060
for your family's lives?

217
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,220
Now you're

218
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,060
the lamb to the slaughter.

219
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,500
Do you really think

220
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,900
they'll let you get away?

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,180
It was Lord Chen who did all of this.

222
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,020
It has...

223
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,500
nothing to do with us!

224
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,820
My Lord,

225
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,540
please help us!

226
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
My Lady, don't worry.

227
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
However, the Justice Department

228
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,740
only cares about dead people.

229
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,460
If you really want us to do something,

230
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,500
this one...

231
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,820
What's your nickname again?

232
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,100
Little Dragon.

233
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,740
The slaughter Little Dragon mentioned

234
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,260
has to do something first.

235
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,860
My Lady!

236
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,900
He's asking us to wait for death.

237
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,020
What should we do?

238
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,300
Listen to me. My boss...

239
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,420
My Lord.

240
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,140
Send the land and house deeds we seized

241
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,260
to my mansion.

242
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,300
Aye.

243
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,500
Come on. Get out of here.

244
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,940
- You can only take his properties!
- Get out.

245
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,300
This is my dowry!

246
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,740
You can't take it!

247
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,620
Give it back!

248
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,380
- My Lord.
- You can't take it!

249
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,540
I didn't expect

250
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,940
our first cooperation

251
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,900
to be a huge success.

252
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,540
We're perfect partners!

253
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,860
My Lady! Are you okay?

254
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,060
My Lady!

255
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,900
My Lady!

256
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,660
It seems Chen Zhisong

257
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,300
has been betrayed for a long time.

258
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,900
As Chen Zhisong's wife,

259
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,540
why would she take

260
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,400
a personal item from the butler
so naturally?

261
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,480
Be careful, My Lady.

262
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,980
Perhaps

263
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,980
Mrs. Chen and the butler

264
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,220
conspired to kill him

265
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,300
to take over his properties

266
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,260
and get together.

267
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,580
But how did they know

268
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,580
you'd unmask Chen Zhisong

269
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,300
yesterday?

270
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,220
Are you

271
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,220
their ally?

272
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,940
Your mission is completed.

273
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,580
Just go.

274
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,300
Anything else?

275
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,580
My Lord.

276
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,540
We've tried our best

277
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,780
to help you

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,540
solve this case.

279
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,380
We've made contributions,

280
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,220
right?

281
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,220
You're still trying to get that deed.

282
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Do you own that house?

283
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,140
Hurry.

284
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,740
My neighbor Madam Wang
was deceived by Chen Zhisong

285
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,100
and gave him that house.

286
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,940
Now she's a miserable

287
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,940
homeless old lady.

288
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,340
Whether she can be saved

289
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,780
is up to you, My Lord.

290
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,180
I heard you're from Changjing.

291
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,460
Yes.

292
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,020
I was born and brought up here.

293
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,940
I just came here.
Everything is new to me.

294
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,820
I could use a clever assistant.

295
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,100
Why don't you stay

296
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220
and work for me?

297
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,940
If you say yes,

298
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,860
you'll get

299
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
that deed.

300
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,060
(I'm a gang leader.)

301
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,980
(How dare he ask me
to be his assistant?)

302
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,700
My Lord,

303
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,300
a fortune teller

304
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,940
once told me

305
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,580
to stay away from the Lous,

306
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,940
or we'd get each other

307
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,380
killed.

308
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,980
My Lord,

309
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,740
you happen to be a Lou.

310
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,740
We should

311
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,140
keep our distance for your safety.

312
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,940
My Lord,

313
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,420
farewell.

314
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,940
Let's go!

315
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,740
My Lord,

316
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,380
is Lan Che the person
you're looking for?

317
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,500
What's wrong?

318
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,380
If she was Leng Qingyao,

319
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,780
why would she ignore you
when she met you?

320
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,060
Even if you looked different

321
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,100
after all these years,

322
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,740
she'd at least remember your name.

323
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,940
Did she pretend

324
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,380
to have forgotten you?

325
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,260
Am I mistaken,

326
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,900
or are you lying to me?

327
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,420
Leng Qingyao.

328
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,260
(Huanxi Clinic)

329
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,700
It's enough.

330
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,100
So dramatic.

331
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,940
Did Lou Mingye

332
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,260
offer you a job as his assistant?

333
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
I rejected him.

334
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,020
I just told you yesterday

335
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,460
to stay away from him.

336
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,380
Look at you,

337
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,220
seizing any chances to meet him, right?

338
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,220
Why do you have to piss me off?

339
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,460
I didn't seize any chance!

340
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,740
I never knew he'd be there.

341
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,780
Master,

342
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,180
it's not her fault.

343
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,540
His assistant told me

344
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,620
Lord Lou went to Chen's Mansion
because he knew

345
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,700
Boss was there.

346
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,250
Why?

347
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,180
He saved you yesterday.

348
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,780
And went to Chen's Mansion

349
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,100
for you.

350
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,140
Is he in love with you?

351
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,300
After all, I'm a popular girl,

352
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,940
so it's possible.

353
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,740
Stop dreaming.

354
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,940
He's the Lord Chancellor.

355
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,340
Why would he like you?

356
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Because you're ignorant and eat a lot?

357
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,020
I think it's because she's ignorant.

358
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,940
It'll be easy for him to persuade her

359
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,740
to go back to Liangzhou with him.

360
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,980
No.

361
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,980
I think it's because she eats a lot.

362
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,260
The more you eat, the stronger you are,

363
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,100
and the more work you can do.

364
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,420
Shut up.

365
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,660
Who's strong?

366
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,380
I'm old

367
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,540
but not dead.

368
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,140
How dare you ignore me?

369
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,100
Master,

370
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,460
you're not old.

371
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,660
Look at you,

372
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,420
eating well and sleeping well every day.

373
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,020
You're even stronger than Dao,

374
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,180
- right?
- I...

375
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,540
Yes, that's right.

376
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,020
- What? You...
- Master!

377
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
- What?
- Master.

378
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,020
I'll give you a massage.

379
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Do you like it?

380
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,940
Sister Lan Che!

381
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,580
My grandma is begging for drugs!

382
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,940
Please help her!

383
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,940
- Be careful.
- Hurry!

384
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,780
Let's go.

385
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,460
Grandma!

386
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,380
It's Carefree Powder.

387
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,340
Hurry. Put it out.

388
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,940
Guazi, come here.

389
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,380
Grandma.

390
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,380
Grandma?

391
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,860
Grandma,

392
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,740
I've told you many times

393
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,260
you can't light the incense.

394
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,020
Why don't you listen to me?

395
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,540
Guazi's mother,

396
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,660
you're back.

397
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,660
Well,

398
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,300
she thinks you're her daughter-in-law.

399
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,130
Good girl,

400
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,860
did you see my deed?

401
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,660
The deed?

402
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,820
I've got it.

403
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,780
I'll bring it

404
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,460
and show you tomorrow.

405
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,300
Let's get some rest,

406
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,140
okay?

407
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,380
Master,

408
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,220
your Cure for Worries can help one
get clean, right?

409
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,020
Why didn't it work for Madam Wang?

410
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,940
It works for those who just started

411
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,060
to use Carefree Powder.

412
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,980
However, Madam Wang

413
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,420
is extremely addicted.

414
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,820
If she wants to get clean, she has to go

415
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,860
to the Justice Department.

416
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,940
No, she can't!

417
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,740
Madam Wang is old.

418
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,540
She can't take it.

419
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,900
She's been good to me
since I was little.

420
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,900
Guazi is her only family now.

421
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,060
If I can't get the deed,

422
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,260
I'm afraid she'll...

423
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,980
From what we know,

424
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,460
Lou Mingye must've taken

425
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,420
the deed.

426
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,580
Luckily, it won't go anywhere.

427
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,820
We'll figure it out.

428
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,820
I'm warning you one last time.

429
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,100
Don't mess with Lou Mingye.

430
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,300
I'll never do it again.

431
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,700
(Lou's Mansion)

432
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,340
Master,

433
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,140
don't blame me for this.

434
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,020
I wanted to listen to you,

435
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,580
but the deed can save Madam Wang's life.

436
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,940
When I get the deed...

437
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
(Elegance of Bamboo)
So beautiful.

438
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,740
I didn't expect

439
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,260
that poker face from Liangzhou

440
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,020
to have such good taste.

441
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,180
Where is the deed?

442
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,620
Sorry.

443
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,700
You got hurt because of me.

444
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,580
It's like a crescent.

445
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,740
It's pretty.

446
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,420
Don't worry about it.

447
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,500
No matter where you are,

448
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,460
I'll recognize you

449
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,340
once I see the crescent.

450
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,900
What are you looking at?

451
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,620
It's just a hug.

452
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,980
I won't be responsible for this.

453
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,740
Responsible?

454
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,580
I'm a gangster

455
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,380
who doesn't care about courtesy.

456
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,340
However, a gentleman like you

457
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,340
must care about your reputation.

458
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,300
Don't worry.

459
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,780
I won't tell anyone.

460
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,500
Well, Miss Gangster,

461
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,780
you sneaked into

462
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,220
a gentleman's house
in the middle of the night.

463
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,740
What are you up to?

464
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,660
I'm here

465
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,900
to tell you

466
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,460
I've changed my mind.

467
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,860
I can

468
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,580
be your assistant.

469
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,700
Okay.

470
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,100
But you have to give me the deed first.

471
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,250
- No.
- Why?

472
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,420
Didn't we have a deal?

473
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,460
How can I know

474
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,940
if you'll break the promise
once you get it.

475
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,220
My Lord,

476
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,020
is that what you think?

477
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,660
Go around and ask anyone, okay?

478
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,660
As Little Dragon,

479
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,620
I'm always an honest person.

480
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,540
I never break my promises.

481
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,780
You can never be too careful.

482
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,100
Suit yourself.

483
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,420
This is Madam Wang's house.

484
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
How can you demolish it?

485
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,060
Whoever gets the deed

486
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,300
owns the house.

487
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,220
My boss has the deed.

488
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,620
How we deal with it

489
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
is not up to you!

490
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,740
Boss, doesn't Lou Mingye have the deed?

491
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,380
Do they work for him?

492
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,940
Lou Mingye,

493
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,140
what a liar.

494
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,460
(Justice Department)

495
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,300
My Lord,

496
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,700
we searched through the stuff we got

497
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,540
from Chen's Mansion

498
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,420
but didn't find
the deed you talked about.

499
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,420
No Datong District's deed?

500
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,420
My Lord, you care about it so much.

501
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,860
Is it important for Chen Zhisong's case?

502
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Xu Chaozhi,

503
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,540
forget about the deed.

504
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,420
I need you to spy on Mrs. Chen.

505
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
I will

506
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,140
do my best.

507
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,700
(Focus on Details)

508
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,900
My Lord, something happened
to Madam Wang's house.

509
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,460
Get out of here.

510
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,140
Stay out of this,

511
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,620
or

512
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,300
I won't go easy on you.

513
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,500
- Stupid kid.
- Guazi!

514
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,860
- Are you okay?
- How dare you?

515
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,020
It's my grandma's house.

516
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,980
Get out of here!

517
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,700
My Lord.

518
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,180
It seems Chen Zhisong gave the deed
to someone else.

519
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,860
Get up.

520
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,220
How can you hit a child?

521
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,820
Get out,

522
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,300
or I'll beat women too.

523
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,060
Sorry about that.

524
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,300
Did you get hurt?

525
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,140
Is it serious?

526
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Do you need my help?

527
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,780
Which gang are you in?

528
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,620
Tell me your name!

529
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,580
Don't ask. Just go.

530
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,540
Behave yourself.

531
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,700
Who the hell are you?

532
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,980
Lord Lou?

533
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,500
Lou Mingye,

534
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,660
didn't you promise to give me the deed?

535
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,140
What's going on?

536
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,180
Who's your boss?

537
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,260
Who the hell are you?

538
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,260
You don't deserve to know our boss's...

539
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,660
Ouch! It hurts!

540
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,780
I told you to behave yourself.

541
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,060
Why didn't you listen?

542
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll tell you!

543
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,140
It's Lady Hu Zhi

544
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
from Yuyan Tower.

545
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,100
Get off me!

546
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,740
What's Yuyan Tower?

547
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,220
It's the biggest brothel in Changjing,

548
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,620
and Hu Zhi is the most popular girl

549
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,900
in Yuyan tower.

550
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,660
Boss,

551
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,980
how did Hu Zhi get the deed?

552
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,860
Are you an idiot? Chen Zhisong
must've given it to her.

553
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,980
The house belongs to my lady now.

554
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,380
She can do whatever

555
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,420
she wants.

556
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,620
How dare you beat us?

557
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,420
I'll report this
to the Justice Department!

558
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,540
(Justice Department?)

559
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,100
(They're not allies.)

560
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,820
(Great.)

561
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,060
You,

562
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,380
listen carefully.

563
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,500
My Lord likes this house.

564
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,140
Tell your boss

565
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,580
that we'd pay ten times the price

566
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,180
for the house.

567
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,580
Listen to her.

568
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,940
Brother,

569
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,340
my grandma told me

570
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,620
if you like someone,
you'll spend money on her.

571
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,860
You spent so much money
on Sister Lan Che.

572
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,660
Do you like her?

573
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,140
Does it matter

574
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
whether I like her or not?

575
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,660
It does,

576
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,140
because she likes me.

577
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,260
Look,

578
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,580
she bought me sugar-coated haws!

579
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,060
Guazi.

580
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,500
Thanks, Sister Lan Che.

581
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
My Lord.

582
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,980
You don't like candies, right?

583
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,860
Come on, Guazi,

584
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,900
take this one too.

585
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,100
(You broke the promise first.)

586
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
Sister Lan Che,

587
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,420
my grandma told me if I like someone,

588
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,820
I should marry her.

589
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,580
Can I marry you when I grow up?

590
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,540
Naughty boy.

591
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,820
Talk to me when you grow up.

592
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,500
Master Lan.

593
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,740
When will you pay back

594
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,300
the 3000 taels of silver?

595
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,820
When did I owe you that?

596
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,620
Did you forget

597
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,100
Lord Lou just paid ten times the price

598
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,340
for that deed.

599
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,260
It's beautiful and well-located,

600
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,780
at least 300 taels of silver.

601
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,780
Ten times the price is 3000 taels.

602
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,820
What?

603
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,860
Do I need to pay for that deed?

604
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,820
Or should I pay?

605
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,020
Get the deed for her

606
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,500
in Yuyan Tower later

607
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,380
and tell me the price.

608
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,780
Aye.

609
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,900
You're not coming?

610
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,740
My Lord.

611
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,980
I'm busy.

612
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,740
Do you like sugar-coated haws?

613
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,580
But if you marry Sister Lan Che,

614
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,900
you won't eat it anymore.

615
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,180
Why?

616
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,940
Because she's in deep debt

617
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,180
and can't afford it.

618
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,140
She owes me a lot of money,

619
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
so everything she has is mine now,

620
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,860
including the sugar-coated haws.

621
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,860
You...

622
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,620
Hey, stop crying.

623
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,380
Sister Lan Che!

624
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,580
My Lord,

625
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,580
I found Mrs. Chen...

626
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,970
Sugar-coated haws!

627
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,120
Sugar-coated haws!

628
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,820
Did you bring it?

629
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,050
These are all the accounts
related to Carefree Powder.

630
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,190
(Accounts)
Here you are.

631
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,540
We had a deal.
You need to pay for the book.

632
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,220
We've brought the book.

633
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,500
Where's the money?

634
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,700
As Lord Wu said,

635
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,220
you said you had nothing to do

636
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,340
with Carefree Powder,

637
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,500
so you should never get involved.

638
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,340
Now I've got the book.

639
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,820
You must leave the capital.

640
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,540
Go back and wait.

641
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,140
Someone will pick you up tonight.

642
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,540
You can leave.

643
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,900
How dare you

644
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,580
try to kill them in public?

645
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,860
It seems you have great power

646
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,020
in Changjing.
