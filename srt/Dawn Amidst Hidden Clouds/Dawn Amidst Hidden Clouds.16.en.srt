00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,780
(Justice Department)

4
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,540
You said you didn't

5
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,380
want to cling to the past.

6
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,180
You wanted to move on.

7
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,820
I just want

8
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,380
to live a happy life.

9
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,140
I don't want to get into

10
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,700
a complicated relationship

11
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,940
and waste my time.

12
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,780
I can finally

13
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,740
pay you back.

14
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
My Lord, we've found Xu Bingbing.

15
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,460
Where is she?

16
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,370
She... She's dead.

17
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,110
My Lord!

18
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,740
Sorry for your loss.

19
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,780
Go back and take a rest.

20
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,120
Goodbye, My Lord.

21
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,320
Chao Zhi,

22
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,700
let me walk you out.

23
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,480
Father, why are you here?

24
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,500
I heard you were attacked
at Zhubo Theater,

25
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,860
so I'm here to see you.

26
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,460
I'm fine.

27
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,700
Thank you, Father.

28
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,620
Isn't Lan Che here?

29
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,100
She was stabbed by Xu Bingbing

30
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,900
for protecting me.

31
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,140
Thankfully,

32
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,740
Huanxi took care of her,

33
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,020
and she's fine.

34
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,900
Huanxi?

35
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,500
The person who made

36
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,300
the cures of Oblivion Flower
and Carefree Powder?

37
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,060
Yes.

38
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,780
How did Xu Bingbing die?

39
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,220
The person behind this

40
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,520
didn't care about Zhubo Theater

41
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,490
but Distortion Pill.

42
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,940
He wanted to use Xu Bingbing
to steal the recipe,

43
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,140
but it's hidden in my house.

44
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,860
Okay.

45
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,380
(Lou's Mansion)

46
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,660
Are you looking for this?

47
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,340
The recipe of Carefree Powder.

48
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,940
You wanted to use
Xu Bingbing to steal it.

49
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,620
After she failed,
you sent someone to kill her.

50
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,220
Who gave you the orders?

51
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,740
A lot of things have happened.

52
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,260
You still don't want to be honest?

53
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,460
Huali.

54
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,500
I get it.

55
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,780
You never trusted me.

56
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,340
Because you're not her.

57
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,700
You wanted my blood to make the pill,

58
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
so why did you poison the knife?

59
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,580
My Lord, you're so smart.

60
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,260
Don't you have an answer?

61
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,860
Who sent you?

62
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,740
Fang Tingge.

63
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
No need.

64
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,060
She'll show up again.

65
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
Master,

66
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,220
I failed,

67
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,620
and I was exposed.

68
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,460
Never mind.

69
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Someone can't wait any longer.

70
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
By then,

71
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,980
they'll fight against each other,

72
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,820
and we can

73
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
reap

74
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,180
the trophies.

75
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,300
(Huanxi Clinic)

76
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,060
These are powerful herbs.

77
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,540
Actually, I'm almost recovered.

78
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,000
This will only lead to overnutrition.

79
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,860
Oh, no.

80
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,020
Master arranged this herb bath for you.

81
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,020
He said the poison was strong.

82
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,060
You need more time to recover.

83
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,980
Boss,

84
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,820
I heard Huali

85
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,100
tried to steal the recipe last night

86
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,820
but was caught by Lord Lou.

87
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,540
It turns out he knew

88
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,060
something was wrong with her.

89
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,420
He's so far-sighted.

90
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,060
Boss.

91
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,300
Actually, Lord Lou
never liked other girls.

92
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,420
He was kind to Huali

93
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,060
so that she'd let her guard down.

94
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,340
Which side are you on?

95
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,140
Of course yours,

96
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,700
but I think

97
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Lord Lou bore no ill will.

98
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,660
But he shouldn't have lied!

99
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,740
He must be punished.

100
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,100
So, he thinks we're all idiots

101
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,380
except for himself.

102
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,420
Don't you agree?

103
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,780
It's cold. I'll boil more water.

104
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,220
The water isn't...

105
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,940
Go.

106
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,740
Go now.

107
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,140
Get in.

108
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,390
Go.

109
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,860
The water...

110
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,540
Fang Tingge?

111
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Why are you here?

112
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,420
Lord Lou wants to see Lan Che.

113
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,580
- Oh, no.
- Come back.

114
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,860
Don't bother them.

115
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,220
Nasty dog!

116
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,780
Are you a pervert?

117
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,100
You let me in.

118
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,820
But I thought it was Luo, okay?

119
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,220
Then I'll be waiting outside.

120
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,740
Wait!

121
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,660
My clothes.

122
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
I said my clothes!

123
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,660
I can't reach it!

124
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,340
- What?
- Stop looking!

125
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,900
Get out!

126
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,700
You need to give them some space,

127
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,540
understand?

128
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,980
My Lord...

129
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,430
What's wrong?

130
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
Nothing.

131
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,580
Nothing happened.

132
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
I'll bet 5 taels of silver

133
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,420
that Boss won't forgive him.

134
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,500
I bet 50 teals.

135
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,100
What are you doing?

136
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,500
Your boss bullied my boss!

137
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,540
Then pinch him!

138
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,620
Why hurt me?

139
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,460
If I dared to pinch him,
why would I do that to you?

140
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,900
Listen,

141
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,220
I won't have mercy

142
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,340
just because you're a woman.

143
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,980
In Liangzhou, we...

144
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,900
It hurts!

145
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,180
Don't bully Luo.

146
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,860
What are you doing here?

147
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,460
We received

148
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,500
some nice tea,

149
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,820
and I saved some for you.

150
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,220
When you've recovered,

151
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,700
come back and try it.

152
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,020
My Lord,

153
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,940
don't you understand?

154
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,780
I'm not having days off. I quit.

155
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,100
As for the tea,

156
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,900
enjoy it yourself.

157
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,300
Lan Che.

158
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,500
I had no choice

159
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,020
but to keep Huali.

160
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,820
When she claimed to be Leng Qingyao,

161
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,700
I knew something was wrong.

162
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,060
Someone must've been behind this.

163
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,300
So, I couldn't take action.

164
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,140
You compromised and pleased her

165
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,500
so that she'd be off guard.

166
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,620
But why didn't you tell me first?

167
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,620
Did you think I'd ruin your plan?

168
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,860
Lou Mingye.

169
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,540
Deep down,

170
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,420
you only regard me as a useless servant.

171
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,380
Lan Che.

172
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,180
I've never regarded you as a servant.

173
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,380
Then what am I to you?

174
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,820
I'll admit

175
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,380
that after everything
we've been through,

176
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,860
you're not just Lord Chancellor to me,

177
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,100
and I'm willing to overcome

178
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,460
any hardships with you.

179
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,340
But are you?

180
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
My Lord,

181
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,180
that's all I have to say.

182
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,100
Just go.

183
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,700
My Lord.

184
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,380
You're here.

185
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,980
You run out of the eye medicine, right?

186
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,180
I prepared some

187
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,460
and was going to let Lan Che
send it to you.

188
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,340
Is she still angry?

189
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,300
Lan Che told me

190
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,580
about the ingredients.

191
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,100
Your eye disease was also
caused by it.

192
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,540
I can only control it for now,

193
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,420
but I'm not sure

194
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,300
if I can cure it.

195
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,820
Boss,

196
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,060
why are you reading a medical book?

197
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,300
Stay hungry, stay foolish.

198
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,740
I won't disgrace my master.

199
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,020
Did you really quit the job?

200
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,900
Actually, I think he cares about you.

201
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,220
He didn't tell you

202
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,180
because he didn't want
to put you in danger.

203
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,700
What if Huali hurt you?

204
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,860
I know.

205
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,700
That's not why I'm angry.

206
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,620
I'm angry

207
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,620
because he wants to fight alone.

208
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,700
Luo,

209
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,220
I don't want him
to protect me all the time.

210
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
But

211
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,620
isn't it nice to be protected

212
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,220
by someone?

213
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,860
I can protect myself.

214
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,660
And if possible,

215
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,740
I want to protect him.

216
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,500
And I'm willing to overcome

217
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
any hardships with you.

218
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,820
But are you?

219
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,060
You haven't eaten all day.

220
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,970
Eat something.

221
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,700
Not hungry. Go away.

222
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,940
(Sulk)

223
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,860
My Lord,

224
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,260
I don't know

225
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
if I should say this.

226
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,980
Say it.

227
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,060
Then get out.

228
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Listen,

229
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,050
just like this word,

230
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,780
you can't sulk about it

231
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,980
forever.

232
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,940
If you miss the person,

233
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,820
there'll be no turning back.

234
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,220
I thought she'd understand me.

235
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,140
I only wanted to protect her.

236
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,180
But what about her opinion?

237
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,340
Like the food.

238
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,140
I want you to eat it.

239
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,300
Will you?

240
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,060
- I...
- You won't.

241
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,980
You only want to get her back.

242
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,860
But am I wrong

243
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,300
by asking you to eat?

244
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,140
- Of course not.
- This...

245
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,100
But I'm not solving this problem.

246
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,820
I'm only bothering you.

247
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,380
As a result, you won't

248
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,100
appreciate my kindness.

249
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,420
What does that mean?

250
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,140
I can't take it.

251
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,300
What do you mean?

252
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,060
What does that mean?

253
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
Time for lunch.

254
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,860
Master, please.

255
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,420
Who made this?

256
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,100
What's wrong?

257
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,740
Do you think the salt

258
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,380
is free?

259
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,740
Stop lying.

260
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,540
I tasted it.

261
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,540
It's not salty at all.

262
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,780
Fine.

263
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,100
You're growing. Eat it.

264
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,700
Send the medicine

265
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,940
to Lord Lou.

266
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,220
I'm not going.

267
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,380
For real?

268
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,540
For real.

269
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,940
Fine.

270
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,100
Dao,

271
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,180
throw it away later.

272
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,740
After all, I've treated him

273
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,020
for the sake of Lan Che.

274
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,620
She doesn't care about him anymore.

275
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,260
He's on his own.

276
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,100
Okay, Master.

277
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,140
Master, where are you going?

278
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
I...

279
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,100
Have some noodles.

280
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,300
Boss.

281
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,700
Didn't you tell us to leave him alone?

282
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,180
None of your business.

283
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,180
Oh, love.

284
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,820
Master, wait!

285
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
You're not right.

286
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,820
Master, wait!

287
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,740
You're not right.

288
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,740
(Lou's Mansion)

289
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,500
Lan Che, why are you here?

290
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,260
Well, Lord Fang,

291
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,780
my master

292
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
told me to send

293
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,020
the medicine for his eyes.

294
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,540
Lan Che, thank you

295
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,100
for coming here.

296
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,140
My mission is completed.

297
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,260
I'm leaving.

298
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,460
Lan Che!

299
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,260
You're already here.

300
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,700
Come in.

301
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,220
No.

302
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,660
Lan Che,

303
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,380
Don't you find

304
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,820
that donkey familiar?

305
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,140
I know

306
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,140
donkeys very well.

307
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,060
They're stupid

308
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,580
and sometimes stubborn.

309
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,020
But they're easier to tame

310
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,260
than horses.

311
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,540
What donkey?

312
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,500
What are you talking about?

313
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,860
Listen.

314
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,780
Lord Donkey...

315
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,900
Lord Lou

316
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,340
can be silly

317
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,180
sometimes.

318
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,940
I don't know

319
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,700
what happened to him.

320
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,220
Lately, he couldn't eat

321
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,980
or sleep.

322
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,020
And there are signs

323
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,380
of recurrence of his eye disease.

324
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,500
Then...

325
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,940
Is it serious?

326
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,340
Not so serious right now,

327
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,500
but I'm not sure

328
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,500
whether it'll get worse.

329
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,140
Lan Che.

330
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,740
Why don't you

331
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,820
check on him?

332
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,660
Fine.

333
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,260
Lan Che.

334
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,940
If you're still angry,

335
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,100
you can always

336
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,100
whip the donkey

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,820
and make it obedient.

338
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
Hey. Get the donkey out of here.

339
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,420
(Prince's Mansion)

340
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,060
(Resilient as Pine, Elegant as Bamboo)

341
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,100
Why are you here?

342
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,740
Feng said you had a recurrence.

343
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,500
I need to check on you.

344
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,180
My eyes

345
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,420
are fine.

346
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,940
Anyway, here's the medicine.

347
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,380
Remember to take it.

348
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,220
Thanks.

349
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,140
If nothing else, I'm leaving.

350
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,780
Wait!

351
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,420
Lan Che...

352
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,340
I...

353
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,180
My Lord!

354
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,580
Are you in there?

355
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,020
My Lord.

356
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,460
Lan Che, you're here.

357
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,860
Am I interrupting you?

358
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
- No.
- Yes.

359
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,140
My Lord, you're funny.

360
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,100
My Lord, Bingbing has caused

361
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,580
a lot of trouble.

362
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
My family

363
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
sent some

364
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,060
home-raised chickens to me,

365
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,740
so I brought some

366
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,180
for you two.

367
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,300
It's good for health.

368
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,060
Thanks, Lord Xu.

369
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,120
My Lord, well...

370
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,900
Stop!

371
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,260
Where are you going?

372
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100
Don't run!

373
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,980
My Lord, it was an accident.

374
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,780
I was busy comforting the donkey.

375
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,380
Who'd have thought Lord Xu

376
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,020
would come at that point?

377
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,020
Why did he have to come

378
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,500
at that point?

379
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,420
Actually,

380
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,660
I don't think it was a total failure.

381
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,900
How come?

382
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,660
At least Lan Che seemed happy
when going back

383
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,860
with the chickens.

384
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,660
Where are you going?

385
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,100
Work.

386
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,620

Xie Jiulian said

388
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,700
one night,

389
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,580
he overheard someone else talking

390
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,860
in Xu Bingbing's room.

391
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,100
They mentioned Distortion Pill.

392
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,500
Given the current situation,

393
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,380
I think that person was Huali.

394
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
By rights,

395
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,500
she's most likely to work for Tuo Jiduo,

396
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,860
but he's already dead.

397
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,180
Is there

398
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,620
another force

399
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,860
trying to make Distortion Pill?

400
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,820
We're not sure if they're allies.

401
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,580
She tried to assassinate him that night

402
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,580
to shut his mouth.

403
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
If she weren't from Liangzhou,

404
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,580
why would she know my past?

405
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,100
My Lord. Luo said
Lan Che went to collect herbs...

406
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,300
Lord Li?

407
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,740
What did you say?

408
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,580
Lan Che went to collect herbs

409
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,060
but hasn't come back.

410
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,060
What are you waiting for?
Let's look for her.

411
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,100
My Lord, here!

412
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,300
Boss is missing. What should we do?

413
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,580
Let's split up.

414
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,820
You go that way.

415
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,900
- Okay.
- We'll go this way.
