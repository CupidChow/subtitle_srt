=Dawn Amidst Hidden Clouds=

2
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,110
Mingye,

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,690
where's Fang Tingge?

5
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,750
Didn't he come?

6
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,290
I was worried that someone would
assassinate Feng Qing,

7
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,220
so I asked him to follow them.

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,650
Are you overthinking it?

9
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,930
This is the capital.

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,730
How can that happen?

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,900
I found out

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,230
someone told Feng Qing
to use oblivion flowers

13
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,490
in Huaisha Village.

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,420
It might be the same person
who's responsible for

15
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,370
the Carefree Powder Case
in Liangzhou.

16
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,840
Have you found out who it is?

17
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,980
Not yet,

18
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,650
but I'm sure

19
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,930
he's a commander in Liangzhou's army.

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,710
What?

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,010
Not just that.

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,210
I think his ultimate goal

23
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,180
is to get a mythical drug

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,730
named Distortion Pill.

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,260
I can't believe

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,620
someone is still

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,440
creating chaos for it

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,900
after ten years.

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
So,

30
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,010
you exiled Feng Qing on purpose

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,210
to lure the killer

32
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,460
so as to find out who's behind this,

33
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
right?

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
Exactly.

35
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,420
It's you.

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
My Lord...

37
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,830
Father,

38
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,580
someone really tried to kill Feng Qing
on the way,

39
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,580
and we've

40
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,860
got him back.

41
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,470
My Lord,

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,450
he's the person
who saved me from the jail

43
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,980
and gave me

44
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,820
oblivion flowers.

45
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,470
Why did you

46
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,980
try to assassinate Feng Qing?

47
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,700
He escaped from the army

48
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,540
and insulted Liangzhou.

49
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,020
I want to bring him to justice

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,490
for the honor of the army.

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,350
As the General of Fast Cavalry,

52
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,300
I've made contributions to Qi.

53
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,170
You're not suspecting me

54
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,700
because of a deserter, are you?

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,140
You were trying to shut his mouth.

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,100
My Lord,

57
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,420
unlike the Justice Department,

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,490
the army doesn't take losers.

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
You...

60
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,800
Shut up!

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,930
A country needs laws,

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,820
and an army needs rules.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
Tuo Jiduo,

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,300
if you make a mistake,

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,170
you should be responsible.

66
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,450
I won't defend you,

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,020
but I can ensure
you go back to Liangzhou.

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,020
In this way,

69
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,650
at least you can die
in your hometown.

70
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
Mingye.

71
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,390
Tuo Jiduo

72
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,700
has served the country for many years.

73
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,770
Please grant this request.

74
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm willing

75
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,540
to give you one last chance.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,520
Did you

77
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,890
do it or not?

78
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,820
I admit.

79
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,750
I used Feng Qing

80
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,890
to scatter

81
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,540
oblivion flowers in the village.

82
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,610
I also sent someone

83
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,650
to kill Huang Gui and Wuniang.

84
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,650
Why did you use Feng Qing?

85
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,490
For the drug.

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,020
What drug?

87
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,510
Of course

88
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,370
the magical drug Distortion Pill.

89
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,300
I've planned this for over a decade.

90
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,200
Every time I was about to succeed,

91
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,370
someone would get in the way.

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,020
First Lou Huaiyun,

93
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,100
and now

94
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,860
it's you.

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,370
You killed my father.

96
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,450
Not only him

97
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,650
but that troublesome pharmacist

98
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,740
Leng Quji

99
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,140
and all his family.

100
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,490
I was so kindhearted

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,020
that I spared your life.

102
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,490
If I'd known this,

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,020
I should've killed you too.

104
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,450
In that case,

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,140
I wouldn't have been your prisoner.

106
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,650
Fang Tingge!

107
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,740
Lock him up

108
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,980
for interrogation.

109
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,150
Aye.

110
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,610
Lou Mingye!

111
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,700
One day,

112
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,540
Distortion Pill will be made.

113
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,420
Just wait and see!

114
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,100
I'm giving you this sword.

115
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,590
Hope

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,820
you can use it

117
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,350
to protect

118
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,100
the destined person

119
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,300
in your life.

120
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,810
I've been a soldier all this life

121
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,010
and killed numerous enemies.

122
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,690
Rather than being a hero,

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
I'd wish you

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
a happy

125
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,420
and safe life

126
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,650
and a good family.

127
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,760
Dad!

128
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,380
Dad! What happened?

129
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,100
Dad! Say something!

130
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,130
Dad!

131
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,570
But Leng Quji

132
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,380
and all his family.

133
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
My Lord.

134
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,080
My Lord,

135
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,330
are you okay?

136
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,540
Not until I heard it from Tuo Jiduo

137
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,710
did I realize you had

138
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,210
a miserable life.

139
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,570
I thought...

140
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,180
you were a fool

141
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,060
because you often
talk about Leng Qingyao

142
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,010
even if she's forgotten about you.

143
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,380
I felt sorry for you.

144
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,540
However, not until today

145
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,300
did I realize she never
forgot about you.

146
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,810
She never looked for you

147
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,030
because maybe she had no choice.

148
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
My Lord.

149
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,420
If she can make you happy,

150
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,180
I'll help you to look for her.

151
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,390
Lan Che.

152
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,450
The past is important,

153
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,940
but the most important thing right now

154
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,890
is to cherish

155
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,740
the person in front of me.

156
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,380
Thanks.

157
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,980
(King of Yan's Mansion)

158
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,890
- Father.
- Mo, come here.

159
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,300
Let me introduce her.

160
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,740
She's Lord Zhang's daughter,

161
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,380
one of the most talented women
in Changjing

162
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,130
who can master all kinds of arts.

163
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,100
Hello, Lady Zhang,

164
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,240
My Lord, I've heard a lot about you,

165
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,350
and you're really

166
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,440
a hero tough as the pine tree

167
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,570
and gorgeous as the jade mountain.

168
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,060
Lady Zhang,
you're so witty and articulate.

169
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,390
Mo.

170
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,010
I have work to do.

171
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,130
Take care of Lady Zhang.

172
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,130
Make her feel at home.

173
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,130
A master told me

174
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
you two

175
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,420
are close in age

176
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,980
and a great match.

177
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,040
You're both young.

178
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,880
Take time

179
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,060
to talk.

180
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,910
Father, I...

181
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,800
It's a beautiful day.

182
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,210
My Lord, do you want to go to a park?

183
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,300
I've got a sore back.

184
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,540
Maybe next time.

185
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,710
My Lord, did you

186
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,940
stay up reading last night?

187
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,360
Yuyan Tower

188
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,330
reopened yesterday,

189
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,250
and I had fun all night.

190
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Maybe next time.

191
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,620
You got rid of her like that?

192
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,130
You're so nasty.

193
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,400
We don't like

194
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,620
each other.

195
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,650
Why should we waste time?

196
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,280
It's not necessarily true.

197
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,300
Maybe you'll like her
after being with her.

198
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,060
But I...

199
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,330
prefer

200
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,650
love at first sight.

201
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,380
It's all about a pretty face,

202
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,670
but it's the most unreliable thing

203
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,240
in the world.

204
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,080
My Lord!

205
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
My Lord!

206
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,980
My Lord.

207
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,110
Why are you still here?

208
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,010
Something happened!

209
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,260
What's wrong?

210
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,350
His Highness lost his temper

211
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,470
and is looking for you.

212
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,570
Please go back.

213
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,770
Good luck.

214
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,550
I have an idea,

215
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,710
but you need to do me a favor.

216
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,670
Can you...?

217
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,570
Oh, no.

218
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,690
He met me before.

219
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,030
Boss!

220
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,450
If you don't help me,

221
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,380
you won't be able to see me again.

222
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,940
Unruly son.

223
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,450
How can I

224
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,540
have such a disobedient son?

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,400
Do you like the flowers?

226
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,890
I like beating you!

227
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,330
She kindly asked you to go to a park.

228
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,440
How could you screw it up?

229
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,010
What do you want?

230
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,980
I don't have to get married now.

231
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,250
Only marriage

232
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,500
can teach you to grow up

233
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,180
and be a real man!

234
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,570
I already have someone.

235
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,640
What?

236
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,570
I have someone I like.

237
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,390
Who?

238
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,030
Look,

239
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,510
she's here.

240
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,500
Isn't she Lou Mingye's servant?

241
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,210
Yes. That's her.

242
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,330
When did you get together?

243
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,100
A while ago.

244
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Well,

245
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,200
she's pretty, right?

246
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,250
He's been drinking this cup of tea
for an hour.

247
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,130
Is your father that angry?

248
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,340
Maybe...

249
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,100
we should tell him the truth.

250
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,250
He's been through a lot.

251
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,620
He's not that fragile.

252
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,110
Lan Che,

253
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,860
why did you

254
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,520
choose Mo?

255
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,360
Father,

256
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,440
Lan Che is not

257
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,010
interested in money and fame.

258
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,180
I can tell.

259
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,520
Lan Che and Lord Lou

260
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,130
risked their lives

261
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,670
to solve the cases of Carefree Powder

262
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,330
and Huaisha Village.

263
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,250
I know she's not ordinary.

264
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,300
That's why I'm curious.

265
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,180
Why would an outstanding talent like you

266
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,670
fall in love with

267
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,210
my stupid... son?

268
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,890
Your Highness.

269
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,740
Li Mo is much better than you think.

270
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,450
You don't have to do this.

271
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,420
Look at Lord Chancellor Lou Mingye,

272
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,250
and look at him.

273
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,770
Even a hammer is more useful than him.

274
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,130
Your Highness,

275
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,540
Li Mo is a simple man,

276
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,330
which means you've protected him well.

277
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,680
Besides,

278
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,810
he's warm-hearted,

279
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,860
kind, and responsible.

280
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,350
He's a princess,

281
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,780
but he never puts on airs.

282
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,170
However, Lord Lou

283
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,310
is arrogant

284
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,170
and likes to mock others.

285
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,810
It must be exhausting

286
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,140
to get along with him.

287
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,810
Lan Che,

288
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,240
do you mean it?

289
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,080
Of Course.

290
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,470
In a few months,

291
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,050
you'll be better than Lord Lou.

292
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,930
So,

293
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,380
he's got some strengths, right?

294
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,500
Yes.

295
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,860
I'm glad you can see

296
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,570
the good side of him.

297
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,900
Come on. Have some water.

298
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,360
Li Mo.

299
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,340
I've fulfilled my mission.

300
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,540
I've done everything I can.

301
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,940
Lan Che.

302
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,280
Were you serious

303
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,260
when you said I was better

304
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,100
than Lou Mingye?

305
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,690
Of course.

306
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,560
When you lie,

307
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,930
you have to tell part of the truth

308
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,260
so that people can believe you.

309
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,810
Okay then.

310
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,410
You really cared about
Lou Mingye before,

311
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,740
so I thought...

312
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,540
He'd do anything

313
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,780
to deduct my wages.

314
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,660
He's a bad boss.

315
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,280
Tell me,

316
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,780
why would the famous

317
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Lord Chancellor be so constrained?

318
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,420
He never tells me his deep thoughts.

319
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,580
Does he want me to ask?

320
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,420
How's that possible?

321
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,260
I mean...

322
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,780
he's hard

323
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,140
to please.

324
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,060
Lan Che.

325
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,940
If I want to keep pretending it,

326
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,860
will you say yes?

327
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,860
(Justice Department)

328
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,710
Your Highness,

329
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,140
Feng Qing never got his hands dirty,

330
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,980
and the murderer Huang Gui

331
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,660
was killed halfway.

332
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,820
Therefore, I've decided

333
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,380
to release him.

334
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,380
What a great file.

335
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,020
You managed to exonerate him.

336
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,620
That's impressive.

337
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,980
I'm flattered.

338
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,340
It's just

339
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,100
a statement of fact.

340
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,100
The Huangs have got what they deserve.

341
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,100
Just do what you want.

342
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,660
Mingye.

343
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,540
Actually,

344
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,260
I'm here for your servant Lan Che.

345
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,060
Lan Che?

346
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,660
Your Highness,

347
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,300
Lan Che is straightforward.

348
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,620
If she offends you...

349
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,460
Oh, no.

350
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,780
You got me wrong.

351
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,060
She's a good girl.

352
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,240
She came from a common family,

353
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,830
but Mo and she really like each other.

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,580
It's all that matters

355
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,780
to a marriage.

356
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,380
Your Highness, what?

357
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,140
But after all, Li Mo is my son.

358
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,820
No matter how open-minded we are,

359
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,340
a servant and a princess

360
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,100
are not a match.

361
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,780
After all, we have to

362
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,500
defend our reputation.

363
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,140
I know Lan Che is very capable.

364
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,380
How about this?

365
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,420
How much is her indenture worth?

366
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,500
I'll pay three times the price

367
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,540
for her.

368
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,020
Your Highness, do you mean

369
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Li Mo is going to marry her?

370
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,500
Yes.

371
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,900
They're both adults.

372
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,940
It's pretty normal.

373
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,060
Does Lan Che

374
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,500
know about this?

375
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,300
Don't worry.

376
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,740
Unruly as he is,

377
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,780
he'll never force her to marry him.

378
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,500
Just think about it.

379
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,940
What are you talking about?

380
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,060
In this world,

381
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,620
there are only two people
that I care about

382
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,540
the most.

383
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,740
One is my father.

384
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,740
The other one is you.

385
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,900
Lan Che, I like you.

386
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,180
I've fallen in love with you

387
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,380
since I met you at Yuyan Tower.

388
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm a lazy

389
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,860
and careless person,

390
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,780
but falling in love with you

391
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,540
is the most serious thing in my life.

392
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,580
I...

393
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,260
I...

394
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,580
I've treated you like a good friend.

395
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,260
I never thought you'd be

396
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,500
my husband.

397
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,220
Think about it now.

398
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,420
What's so good about marriage?

399
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,220
Cooking, doing laundry,
and raising kids,

400
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,460
it'll only take away my freedom.

401
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,060
That's all?

402
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,670
There are dozens of servants
in my family.

403
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,980
You do need to do these things.

404
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,900
No.

405
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
Why don't you understand?

406
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,620
Anyway, I won't marry you.

407
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,620
How about Lou Mingye?

408
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,300
Will you marry him?

409
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,900
Li Mo,

410
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,140
you will

411
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,340
find the love of your life.

412
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,140
I've been absent all afternoon.

413
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,420
Goodbye.

414
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,620
Lan Che,

415
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,140
I won't give up.

416
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,740
I'll prove you

417
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm as good as Lou Mingye.

418
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,140
(Lou's Mansion)

419
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,670
My Lord.

420
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,260
Where were you this afternoon?

421
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
I...

422
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,020
This afternoon...

423
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,100
I...

424
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,420
did my friend a favor.

425
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,460
My Lord,

426
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,540
have some tea.

427
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,540
Is there anything you want to tell me?

428
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,180
What?

429
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,180
Lan Che,

430
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,180
how long have you worked here?

431
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,260
Almost half a year.

432
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,900
Four months and ten days.

433
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,780
I didn't expect you

434
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,220
to remember it so clearly.

435
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,100
If you find a better place,

436
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,860
I won't force you to stay.

437
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,180
Who are you?

438
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,860
Don't move,

439
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,140
or I'll kill him!

440
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,460
My Lord.

441
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,300
What does that mean?

442
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
My Lord!

443
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,940
Tuo Jiduo is dead.

444
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
What?

445
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,300
My Lord.

446
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,660
General.

447
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,060
This person

448
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,100
killed Tuo Jiduo.

449
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,580
Tuo Jiduo is suspected of

450
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,260
assassinating the former
governor of Liangzhou.

451
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,860
This case is still unsolved,

452
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,820
and there are many mysteries.

453
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,140
Now you've killed him.

454
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,020
Can you be responsible?

455
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Tuo Jiduo tried to escape

456
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,260
and hijacked a jailer.

457
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,540
I had no choice

458
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,940
at that point.

459
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Please investigate it.

460
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,740
Tell me,

461
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,740
why did you say Tuo Jiduo

462
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,820
tried to escape?

463
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,700
General,

464
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,340
it's complicated.

465
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,540
Someone pretended to deliver food

466
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,620
and sneaked in

467
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,260
to assassinate Tuo Jiduo.

468
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,300
However,

469
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,210
she failed

470
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,820
and almost let him escape.

471
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,300
Take him down.

472
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
Summon the assassin.

473
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,540
Aye.

474
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,820
Go!

475
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,700
Huali?

476
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,700
Huali,

477
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,420
why did you sneak in

478
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,620
to kill Tuo Jiduo?

479
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,820
To avenge my father.

480
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,220
Who's your father?

481
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,900
Leng Quji.

482
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,100
Then you're...

483
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,220
Leng Qingyao.

484
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,460
Since you're Leng Qingyao,

485
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,780
why didn't you tell us about it?

486
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,500
Everyone believes

487
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,020
it was my father who killed General Lou.

488
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,460
My family was destroyed
because of this,

489
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,820
and I've been homeless for a decade.

490
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,140
How could I tell you the truth?

491
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,740
When Tuo Jiduo was arrested,

492
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,580
it reminded of

493
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,700
the injustice my father has suffered
over the years.

494
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,700
I was furious

495
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,740
and wanted to kill Tuo Jiduo

496
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,300
to avenge my father and Ci.

497
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Mingye.

498
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,340
I can understand

499
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,780
why Qingyao wanted to kill him.

500
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,340
Besides, she couldn't make it.

501
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,860
Let's forget it.

502
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,780
I agree.

503
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,220
Excellent.

504
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,700
Qingyao,

505
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,020
do you remember me?

506
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,780
Uncle Huo Feng.

507
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,820
You taught me to ride a horse,

508
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,460
and you promised

509
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,940
to send me a pony.

510
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,620
I remember everything.

511
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
We just met,

512
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,460
and you want me to pay the debt.

513
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,740
I won't forget it.

514
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Mingye.

515
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,260
Mingye?

516
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,820
Untie her.

517
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,580
Little Patient.
