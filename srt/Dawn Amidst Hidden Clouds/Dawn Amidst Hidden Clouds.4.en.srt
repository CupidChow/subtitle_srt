=Episode 4=

3
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,700
Darling...

4
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,900
Be quiet!

5
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,860
You have more people. This is unfair.

6
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,140
Why are you here?

7
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,380
Idiot, I'm here to save you.

8
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm glad you're all here.

9
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,300
I can kill

10
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,460
all of you.

11
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,940
Darling.

12
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,980
They don't seem

13
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,300
to be good guys.

14
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,180
You've finally figured it out.

15
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,060
Darling, don't worry.

16
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm Li Mo, the Deputy Lord Chancellor.

17
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,340
As long as I'm here,
I won't let them hurt you.

18
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,860
Get him!

19
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,460
Are you okay?

20
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,420
This idiot can fight?

21
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
Wait.

22
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,220
There are three moons in the sky!

23
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,740
I take back what I said.

24
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
Lou Mingye,

25
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,140
think of something, okay?

26
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,300
I asked you to leave, but you didn't.

27
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,740
Do you regret it now?

28
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,140
If I had left,

29
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,380
you would've died, okay?

30
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,980
The drug is working.

31
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,460
What are you waiting for? Go!

32
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,660
Take this.

33
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,700
He can't hold them off for long.

34
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,900
Hold me.

35
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,780
If you want to live, do as I say.

36
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,780
Insert the needle into

37
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,740
the point between
my 3rd and 4th cervical spines.

38
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,980
No.

39
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,860
If I make a mistake,

40
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,460
you might be permanently paralyzed.

41
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,340
No, you won't.

42
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,740
Qingyao...

43
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,180
I've always believed in you.

44
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,740
Back off!

45
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,580
My Lord!

46
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,100
Take them down!

47
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,900
Lou Mingye.

48
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,220
Lou Mingye, wake up! Lou Mingye!

49
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
Oh, no.

50
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,700
Did I kill him with the needle?

51
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,580
Why did you force me to do it?

52
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,900
Lou Mingye!

53
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,140
Lou Mingye!

54
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,580
Lan Che...

55
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,980
My Lord, I'm here.

56
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,860
I won't try to be a hero anymore.

57
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,180
This job isn't easy at all.

58
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,460
I was so freaked out.

59
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,300
Lou Mingye, wake up!

60
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,060
What did you say?

61
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,780
You're so loud.

62
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,460
Don't move.

63
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,260
My Lord,

64
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,140
after tonight,

65
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,780
we'll be good friends
who saved each other's lives.

66
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,580
Just tell me

67
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,620
what you want this time.

68
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,580
The deed, of course.

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,940
My Lord, after all,

70
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,820
your life is worth
much more than the deed.

71
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,660
You're really persistent.

72
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,700
I think the man named Li Mo

73
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,300
is still lying in there.

74
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,140
What about him?

75
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Just let him be.

76
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,420
He'll come back when he wakes up.

77
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,740
Let's go.

78
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,500
My Lord,

79
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,580
why are you so cruel to your people?

80
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,180
Why don't you carry him?

81
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,100
I think it's nice for him to lie there.

82
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,900
(Yuyan Tower)

83
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,580
If nothing else,

84
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,980
fingerprint it.

85
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,060
If everyone

86
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,740
can be as cooperative as you,

87
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,420
they can save me a lot of trouble.

88
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,620
My Lord!

89
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,460
My Lord, the interrogation went well.

90
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,820
Wu Ming just told us

91
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,220
the location of a few laboratories.

92
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,180
I'll take them to search the places.

93
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,660
Get out.

94
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,620
Okay. Let's go.

95
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,500
A small amount of

96
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,220
Carefree Powder makes one happy.

97
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,660
More use causes hallucinations,

98
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,740
and overdose

99
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,580
makes one die in half an hour.

100
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,500
If you die of overdoes,

101
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,300
will it be a mercy for you?

102
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,100
You won't let me die.

103
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,020
If I die,

104
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,700
who else

105
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,540
in this world can tell you the truth?

106
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,020
Yes.

107
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,540
Fang Tingge.

108
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,900
Free him.

109
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
What do you want?

110
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,380
Soon,

111
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,980
everyone will know

112
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,860
the pharmacist Wu Ming who invented

113
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,020
Carefree Powder 10 years ago

114
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,860
was acquitted for lack of evidence.

115
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,180
What?

116
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,020
I said you were acquitted.

117
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,900
Congratulations,

118
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,900
Lord Wu.

119
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,300
Let's go.

120
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,700
Lou Mingye,

121
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,860
you'll get me killed.

122
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,420
Over the past ten years,

123
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,700
you've never dared
to sell Carefree Powder

124
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,860
to Liangzhou.

125
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,980
Who have you been hiding from?

126
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,780
Don't want to talk?

127
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,220
Take him away.

128
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
- Lou Mingye!
- Let's go.

129
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,700
Lou Mingye!

130
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,700
Lou Mingye! I'll tell you!

131
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,460
I'll tell you!

132
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
I never knew

133
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,460
who ordered me to make the drug,

134
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
but someone would

135
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,580
check my progress from time to time.

136
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,140
I remember that person

137
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,100
got a tomahawk tattoo on his arm.

138
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,740
Tiger Roar Army?

139
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,940
In this world,

140
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
who else can command
the Tiger Roar Army?

141
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,140
Do you think you can defeat him?

142
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,700
General.

143
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,620
Lord Lou searched Yuyan Tower

144
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,700
and arrested a pharmacist named Wu Ming.

145
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,300
He's destroyed

146
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,500
Carefree Powder business.

147
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,060
I sent him there
to investigate Carefree Powder.

148
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,660
I knew he wouldn't let me down.

149
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,980
No wonder he's my godson.

150
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,100
Tuo Jiduo,

151
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,500
any problem now?

152
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,620
General, you've raised him
to be a talent.

153
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,300
He's definitely capable.

154
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,940
By the way, General,

155
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,140
we're ready to leave

156
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,620
for the capital anytime.

157
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,260
Boss.

158
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,860
Boss!

159
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,740
Did you have another nightmare?

160
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,620
Sometimes I hope

161
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,100
my dreams

162
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,940
can tell me something about my identity.

163
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,980
But sometimes I wish

164
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,340
they were only nightmares

165
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,260
so that what happened in my dreams

166
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,500
wouldn't be real.

167
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,300
Lan Che.

168
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,580
Master is here.

169
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,340
He'll punish me!

170
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,180
Hurry!

171
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,980
Master, Boss is still sleeping...

172
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,420
Stop pretending.

173
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,020
I heard your voice.

174
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Get up now.

175
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,420
Get cleaned up.

176
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Someone wants to see you.

177
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,140
It's

178
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,420
a very handsome man.

179
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,300
A man?

180
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,900
Very handsome?

181
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,380
- What...?
- Go back to sleep.

182
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,980
Why does he want to see me?

183
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,380
(Isn't this the idiot
who fought the enemies last night?)

184
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Lady Lan Che,

185
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,580
good morning.

186
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,180
(What is he doing here?)

187
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,140
King of Yan's heir?

188
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,940
His name is Li Mo.

189
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,980
He's a famous playboy in Changjing.

190
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,420
Lord Xu told me

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
King of Yan got a position
of Deputy Lord Chancellor

192
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,460
for Lord Li a long time ago,

193
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,940
and he happened to

194
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,860
find some clues

195
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,340
of Carefree Powder recently.

196
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,380
Maybe he wanted to impress them

197
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,060
before taking office.

198
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,500
Where's he now?

199
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,620
He hasn't shown up for work yet.

200
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,340
My Lord,

201
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,100
should we find an excuse

202
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,380
to ask him to leave?

203
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,460
No need.

204
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,660
King of Yan and my godfather
are close friends.

205
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,060
As long as he doesn't make trouble,

206
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,740
I'll keep him to do his father a favor.

207
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,220
At the Langyuan Conference,

208
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,300
I said something stupid
due to Carefree Powder.

209
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm here to apologize.

210
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,860
Here are some small gifts.

211
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,060
Hope you like them.

212
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,620
No...

213
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,620
(Fuchunju)

214
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,260
Not a big deal.

215
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,580
You're welcome.

216
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,980
Fuchunju's cakes.

217
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,060
Common people have no access to them.

218
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,100
And the bracelet...

219
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,180
This...

220
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,980
What's this?

221
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,300
(Spoiled by the King's Heir)

222
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,980
Spoiled by the King's Heir?

223
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,900
This is the best-selling novel

224
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,020
for young girls.

225
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,460
It tells

226
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,860
a touching love story

227
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,420
between a king's heir

228
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,140
and a common girl.

229
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,060
Are these

230
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,220
for me?

231
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,020
Yes.

232
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,660
I didn't know your interests,

233
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,460
so I bought all of them.

234
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,020
(He called me darling many times)

235
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,100
(and took advantage of me.)

236
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,220
(I'll take them as compensation.)

237
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,540
Well, you can come anytime.

238
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,020
You don't have to do this.

239
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,420
You're so generous.

240
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,260
Why were you

241
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,900
at the conference last night?

242
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,260
I...

243
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm Deputy Lord Chancellor.

244
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,660
I went there for a case.

245
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,260
For a case.

246
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,660
Since you're an officer,

247
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,220
why didn't you know Lord Lou?

248
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,980
Do you mean Lou Mingye?

249
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,340
He's new here,

250
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,500
and I haven't taken office,
so I didn't meet him.

251
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,340
Whatever.

252
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,180
As long as he's here,

253
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,180
you'll have

254
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,380
a hard time.

255
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Good luck.

256
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,900
It's just Deputy Lord Chancellor.

257
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,340
I can quit it anytime.

258
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,260
What else do you want?

259
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,980
I want to adventure

260
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,100
and help others with you.

261
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,420
(Justice Department)

262
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Did you find the deed among the things

263
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,620
we got from Yuyan Tower?

264
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
Well, My Lord,

265
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,780
are you really going to give it back?

266
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,780
If it weren't for her,

267
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,260
I wouldn't have survived last night.

268
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
I'll give it to her

269
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,100
as the compensation.

270
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,820
I don't know if I should say this.

271
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,340
Don't say anything

272
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,940
you shouldn't say.

273
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,540
My Lord,

274
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,900
you didn't forgive her

275
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,180
for what happened last night, did you?

276
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,260
Why did you force me to do it?

277
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,540
If I make a mistake,

278
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,020
you might be permanently paralyzed.

279
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,460
No, you won't.

280
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,140
I'll never forget they killed my father.

281
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
I know what I'm doing.

282
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,460
Since she doesn't want
to reveal her identity,

283
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
I'll keep playing with her.

284
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,460
If she's pretending
to have lost her memory,

285
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,100
she'll get caught sooner or later.

286
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,340
- Close the door.
- Close the door.

287
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,180
Close the door.

288
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,660
The Great World has rigorous standards
for selecting new members.

289
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,980
We don't accept losers.

290
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,420
What's your strength?

291
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,140
Show us what you've got.

292
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,300
My strength

293
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,020
is my face.

294
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,180
He's got soft skin

295
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,620
like a girl.

296
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,300
Nothing special.

297
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,740
I've heard Shaolin disciples
have Iron Head skills.

298
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,340
Their skulls are hard as iron

299
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,380
and can

300
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,060
smash bricks.

301
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,900
I'll get a brick.

302
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,220
No need.

303
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,420
I don't have an iron head.

304
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,620
Then your face must be

305
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,340
hard as armor.

306
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,580
Put it down.

307
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,140
You can do neither of them.

308
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,100
What else can you do?

309
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,020
Can't my face

310
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,620
speak for Greater World?

311
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
We've got our boss.

312
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,540
We don't your face to speak for us.

313
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm a brilliant genius.

314
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,260
Then why did you get caught
in Yuyan Tower?

315
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm a master of martial arts.

316
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,100
I heard you passed out that night.

317
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,980
Greater World has been

318
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,180
recruiting for three years,

319
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,700
and finally,

320
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,820
an idiot wants to join us.

321
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,300
Don't scare him away.

322
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,900
Understand?

323
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,380
Wait.

324
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,060
Well...

325
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,260
I have money. Does that count?

326
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,860
Look,

327
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,380
you need money to run the gang, right?

328
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,500
I'll pay for it.

329
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,980
Look at you.

330
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,780
You don't have to do this.

331
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,660
Welcome to Greater World!

332
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,020
You're in.

333
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,540
Really?

334
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,980
Thanks.

335
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,500
Cure for Carefree Powder is for sale.

336
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,460
Do you need medicine or treatment?

337
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,780
Where's Madam Wang?

338
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,940
Something's wrong!

339
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,060
Something's wrong! Some...

340
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,060
What's wrong?

341
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,260
The Lord Chancellor

342
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,500
wants to see Madam Wang.

343
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,820
Where is he?

344
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,780
In the yard.

345
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Master, why didn't you stop him?

346
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,020
I wouldn't dare.

347
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,300
Where are you going?

348
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,900
My Lord.

349
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,820
Carefree Powder?

350
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,740
Is she also an addict?

351
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,580
Guazi's mother.

352
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
You're back.

353
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,740
You'll give me the deed, right?

354
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,780
Where is it?

355
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,100
Madam Wang...

356
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,980
Well, the deed...

357
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,060
Maybe I can't...

358
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,780
Didn't you ask me to bring it?

359
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,220
Did you forget it?

360
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,820
Here you are.

361
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,660
Madam Wang, look.

362
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,220
The deed.

363
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,660
Okay.

364
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,140
Good. Good.

365
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,020
It's still here.

366
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,900
Idiot,

367
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,540
what took you so long?

368
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,460
I forgive you for leaving me alone.

369
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,900
But how could you abandon your wife?

370
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,140
Madam Wang,

371
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,300
he's not...

372
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,820
Idiot,

373
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,100
sit down.

374
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,380
Mother,

375
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm your son.

376
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,500
Look carefully.

377
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,980
You're not my son!

378
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,820
Do you think I'm old

379
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,530
- and confused?
- You...

380
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,180
You only want my deed!

381
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,580
- Get out!
- Don't hit me!

382
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,900
Stop!

383
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,060
(Huanxi Clinic)

384
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,740
Be gentle!

385
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,100
The old lady did give you a hard time.

386
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,740
Why did you pretend to be her son?

387
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,420
You deserve this.

388
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,340
I didn't want Lou Mingye

389
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,580
to take advantage of you.

390
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,100
You're Lou Mingye, right?

391
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm Li Mo.

392
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,940
We're colleagues,

393
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,700
but I'm not going to
make friends with you.

394
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,980
Please stay away from me.

395
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,940
What do you mean?

396
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,140
Why were you

397
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,740
together?

398
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,380
We've decided to let him join our gang

399
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,700
by our unanimous vote.

400
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,020
Well,

401
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,940
Deputy Lord Chancellor

402
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,580
isn't forbidden from joining a gang,
right?

403
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,100
My Lord.

404
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,300
Lan Che told me

405
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,900
you pretended to be the leader
of the bandits in Liangzhou

406
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,540
to sneak in Yuyan Tower

407
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,940
and arrested Wu Ming and his allies.

408
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,260
Since I heard this,

409
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,020
I've really

410
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,620
admired you,

411
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,060
and you're my idol now.

412
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,260
The Justice Department
is so lucky to have you.

413
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,940
Like master, like disciple.

414
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,460
Your words are exactly the same.

415
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,820
It's destiny.

416
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Back then,

417
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,940
I was just a quack who traveled around.

418
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,380
When I found her
on the outskirts of the town,

419
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,900
she was only seven or eight years old.

420
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,860
I never wanted to adopt her,

421
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,740
but that little girl

422
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,260
was so persistent.

423
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,860
I couldn't get rid of her.

424
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,020
Why are you telling him this?

425
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,860
That's right. What am I doing?

426
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,460
Sir, I'm here to get my medicine.

427
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,980
My Lady,

428
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,460
your hairpin is quite unique.

429
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,140
I think I saw it before.

430
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,620
It's my mother's hairpin.

431
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,740
I think it's from Liangzhou.

432
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,380
It's hard

433
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,060
to find it in Changjing.

434
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,580
Why does it look familiar to you?

435
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,100
I...

436
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
Many people come and go

437
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,940
every day.

438
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,100
Maybe someone

439
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,420
wore it before, right?

440
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,060
It also looks familiar to me.

441
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,380
(No.)

442
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,220
(I must've seen it somewhere.)

443
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,500
(I think)

444
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,140
(it was at the Justice Department.)

445
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,300
I remember now.

446
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
The Chen's maid Jiuxiang

447
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
has the same hairpin.

448
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,060
The Chen's Mansion

449
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,340
is empty now.

450
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,060
(Beloved Husband Chen Zhisong)

451
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,660
Since Mrs. Chen and the butler
were arrested,

452
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,660
all the servants

453
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,860
have left.

454
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,340
My Lord.

455
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,060
My Lady.

456
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,740
Since they're gone,

457
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,380
why are you still here?

458
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,540
Lord Chen just died,

459
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,740
and his wife was arrested.

460
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,700
Someone has to

461
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,140
deal with family affairs.

462
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,500
Jiuxiang,

463
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,420
I remember

464
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,700
I saw you in Justice Department

465
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,140
when Chen Zhisong was killed,

466
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,420
and you were wearing a pretty hairpin.

467
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,380
Why didn't you wear it today?

468
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,140
My Lady, I'm afraid you're wrong.

469
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,540
I didn't wear

470
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,460
a hairpin that day.

471
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,980
How's that possible?

472
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,420
I remember it clearly.

473
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,140
There are two plum blossoms.

474
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,980
It's stylish.

475
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,180
That's right.

476
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,820
I was wrong.

477
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,180
I did wear it that day,

478
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
but...

479
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,500
I broke it by accident.

480
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,580
You broke it when you killed

481
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,540
Chen Zhisong, right?

482
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,660
He earned a lot of dirty money,

483
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,420
and he knew he'd get caught
sooner or later,

484
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,860
so

485
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,980
he planned his fake death
a long time ago.

486
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,500
However, he was ruined
by his own wisdom.

487
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,500
You killed him when visiting him
in the Justice Department.

488
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,700
And the hairpin

489
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,700
was your weapon.

490
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,700
If you want evidence,

491
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,100
we can search your room

492
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,730
and see if the hairpin

493
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,700
is still there.

494
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,940
No need.

495
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,980
I am

496
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
the murderer.

497
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,700
That day, Lan Che

498
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,100
exposed his scam in public.

499
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,620
Lord Lou ordered them

500
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,420
to take everyone to the department.

501
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,580
Back then,

502
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,420
many people were suffering from drugs.

503
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,900
I said I needed to identify the body

504
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,340
and went to the morgue in the chaos.

505
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,580
I was surprised to find
the coroner was absent.

506
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,220
I had

507
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,060
a perfect chance to kill him.

508
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,020
Where's my lord?

509
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,500
My Lord!

510
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,820
My Lord, how can you leave me?

511
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,180
You'd always wanted to kill him,
hadn't you?

512
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,940
I'd waited for it

513
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,060
for so long.

514
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,780
All these years,

515
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,660
I'd been his drug tester.

516
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,420
I'm dying anyway.

517
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,340
I finally killed him.

518
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,780
It's all worth it!

519
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,260
You...

520
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
Watch your steps.

521
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,140
Lan Che.

522
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,540
What's wrong?

523
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,580
You've been distracted.

524
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,380
I just feel pity for Jiuxiang.

525
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,300
Forget it.

526
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,500
This case is over.

527
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,580
May I treat you to dinner?

528
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,220
You're not invited.

529
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,860
I don't like you,

530
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
so no dinner for you.

531
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,300
When will you start to work?

532
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,500
It depends.

533
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,220
You've never been to the office,

534
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,980
but you know every case well.

535
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,300
Someone must've sent them to

536
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,940
King of Yan's Mansion, right?

537
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,260
Enough.

538
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,980
I'll come tomorrow, okay?

539
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,260
Why were they sent there?

540
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,900
Do you work for the king?

541
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,900
No.

542
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
My Lord.

543
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,180
He's just a Lord Chancellor.

544
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,580
How dare he be so arrogant?

545
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,900
What's the matter?

546
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,740
My Lord,

547
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,180
you gave back the deed to Madam Wang

548
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,460
and didn't take her to rehab.

549
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,980
Thank you so much.

550
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,940
You saved my life in Yuyan Tower.

551
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,100
We're even.

552
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,780
But...

553
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,780
Can you do me another favor?

554
