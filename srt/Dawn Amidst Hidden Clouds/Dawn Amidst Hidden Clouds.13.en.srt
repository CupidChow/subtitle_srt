00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,140
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,520
Is Lord Lou sure about it?

4
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,850
Could that

5
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,520
Leng Qingyao be a phony?

6
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,200
But Huali...

7
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,570
Both the story

8
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,160
and the time are correct.

9
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,120
Besides, judging from
how she treats people,

10
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,280
I don't think she's a liar.

11
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,390
Boss, what are you going to do?

12
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,720
To do what?

13
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,000
What's that got to do with me?

14
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,900
Even an idiot can tell

15
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,510
that you like Lord Lou.

16
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,150
So what?

17
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't steal men

18
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,720
from others.

19
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,130
When they became friends,

20
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,460
they were just kids.

21
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,140
Kids know nothing.

22
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,200
Yes, kids don't know what love is.

23
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,650
He misses her so much

24
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,690
only because he lost her

25
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,740
a long time ago

26
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,000
and couldn't move on.

27
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,980
However, Boss, you're different.

28
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,930
Lord Lou and You
have risked lives together

29
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,950
and gone through a lot.

30
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,050
Is Qingyao

31
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,340
more important than this relationship?

32
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,340
No, it isn't.

33
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,410
If I were him,

34
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,080
I'd stay with you forever.

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,370
But...

36
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,280
But what?

37
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,670
Don't be a coward.

38
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,260
Fight for it.

39
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,030
We got your back.

40
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,740
(Lou's Mansion)

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,590
Stay here for a few days,

42
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,000
and I'll find another place for you.

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,310
I've been homeless for years.

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,290
I'm grateful that you can offer me

45
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,360
a shelter.

46
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,720
Compared to my father and Ci,

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm so lucky.

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,060
Little Patient.

49
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,210
Little Patient.

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,790
Don't you believe me?

51
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,440
Do you remember the scar?

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,320
You told me...

53
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,230
When I see this crescent,

54
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,670
I'll recognize you

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,230
wherever you are.

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,470
It's getting late.

57
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,910
Rest early.

58
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,260
Okay.

59
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,580
My Lord,

60
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,560
I think it's too coincidental.

61
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,020
I'll confirm her identity

62
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,280
as soon as possible.

63
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,320
However, as for Lan Che...

64
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,560
shouldn't you give her an explanation?

65
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,790
What does that mean?

66
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,510
After all, you like each other.

67
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,790
Now there's suddenly another girl.

68
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,350
She must be upset.

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,600
Fang Tingge,

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,950
why are you always worried about others?

71
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,900
Tuo Jiduo died

72
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,320
right after he pleaded guilty.

73
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,610
This

74
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,320
can't be a coincidence.

75
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,630
It might happen to
a common person,

76
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,630
but he's the General
of Fast Cavalry.

77
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,670
How could he be easily...?

78
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,930
Keep an eye on the jailer.

79
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,210
If anything happens,

80
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,280
report to me immediately.

81
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,260
Aye.

82
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,180
(Justice Department)

83
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,260
My Lord.

84
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,950
You're so early.

85
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,440
My Lord, did you have breakfast?

86
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,390
- I brought some food.
- Little Patient.

87
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,390
Lan Che, you're here.

88
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,860
Little Patient,

89
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,910
I made some porridge.

90
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,040
I also added Jueming and Goji(wolfberry),

91
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,280
which is good for your eyes.

92
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,600
You can try it.

93
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,670
Actually,

94
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,880
you don't have to do this.

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,210
It's okay.

96
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,620
When you were young,

97
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,040
you liked my porridge, right?

98
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,180
However, I'm not sure

99
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,390
if your taste has changed,

100
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,790
so I brought some sugar and salt.

101
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,410
You can add it

102
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,510
as you like.

103
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,280
I know exactly what he likes.

104
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,610
Let me do it.

105
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,860
Try it.

106
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,610
How is it?

107
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,820
Good.

108
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,420
He said it was good.

109
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,070
Qingyao, would you like to try it too?

110
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,460
In that case,

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,190
you can prepare it earlier.

112
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,460
Okay.

113
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,040
The porridge...

114
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,120
What's wrong?

115
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,630
Lord Lou said it was good.

116
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,040
Right, My Lord?

117
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,210
Very good.

118
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,880
- Very...
- Very good.

119
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,760
Then finish it

120
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,910
while it's still hot.

121
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,980
Wait.

122
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,440
What did you bring?

123
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,140
Breakfast.

124
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,880
But this is for Li Mo.

125
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,350
My Lord, enjoy the porridge.

126
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,020
Be careful.

127
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,670
Be careful. Be careful.

128
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,400
Watch out.

129
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,410
Okay.

130
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,560
Okay, okay.

131
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,560
- They passed.
- Jun Zichen!

132
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,170
- Be careful. Stay back.
- Jun Zichen!

133
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,540
Jun Zichen, you're so handsome!

134
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,520
Be careful!

135
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,790
Lan Che, why are you here?

136
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,350
I've been looking for you.

137
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,520
Is this your duty now?

138
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,570
Changle Street is short of hand.

139
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,230
We were assigned here.

140
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,010
Well,

141
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,880
who were those two people?

142
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,130
Is God of Wealth here?

143
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,450
God of Wealth?

144
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,780
They're the two leading actors
of Zhubo Theater,

145
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,560
the most popular troupe right now.

146
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,570
We can't even see their faces.

147
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,030
Why are they so crazy?

148
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,710
What do you mean?

149
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,780
Are you insulting our Zichen?

150
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,150
No, no, no.

151
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,940
You don't have a taste.

152
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,960
What a waste of time.

153
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,020
Let's go.

154
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,640
- So ignorant.
- Exactly.

155
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,490
Come in.

156
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,660
My Lord.

157
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,410
My Lord,

158
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,210
General Huo's man said

159
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,180
the popular Zhubo Theater just arrived.

160
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,230
He wanted to invite you and Huali
to enjoy the show.

161
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,860
I need to finish some files.

162
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,910
I'll skip it.

163
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,530
Tell him thanks.

164
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,830
- Okay.
- Wait.

165
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,170
Have our people returned?

166
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,020
Just came back.

167
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,950
They're at the door.

168
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,610
Let's go.

169
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,420
If I weren't for your buns,

170
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,130
I would've passed out from hunger.

171
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,570
But don't eat too fast, okay?

172
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,880
No. I'm starving.

173
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,760
Are you exhausted from stopping
a few excited girls?

174
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,790
You're really a prince.

175
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,450
You have no idea

176
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,400
how powerful they were

177
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,560
even though they looked weak.

178
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,520
He can't stand in others' shoes.

179
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,590
Li Mo, finish your buns.

180
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,020
Just ignore him.

181
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,030
Maybe we can go to the theater tonight.

182
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,730
Okay.

183
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,590
Anyway, I don't have work to do.

184
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,100
We can enjoy it together.

185
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,400
Then it's a deal.

186
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,020
Lan Che.

187
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,080
I need to stay for the files tonight.

188
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,760
Then take your time.

189
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,640
You can stay up late.

190
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,120
After all, Huali will bring you
food and drinks.

191
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,710
Take your time.

192
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,850
Do your best.

193
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,400
He's so busy.

194
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,180
- Yes.
- He's not only handsome...

195
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,460
That's great.

(Jiudu Mountains,
Starring: Jun Zichen, Xie Jiulian)

197
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,910
It's so crowded here.

198
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,710
They're the most popular troupe
in Qi right now.

199
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,790
It's hard to get a ticket.

200
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,830
- Our tickets...
- Idol! Idol!

201
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,720
We're here!

202
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,930
These young girls

203
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,560
are so inexperienced.

204
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,130
Why are they so obsessed?

205
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,150
Are they prettier than me?

206
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,730
Stop talking nonsense.

207
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,080
Someone will hit you!

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,300
Who dares?

209
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,520
Who's insulting my idol?

210
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,530
It's you again!

211

Okay, please come in.

Well, Li Mo...

Actually...

216
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,060
I...

217
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,900
I know.

218
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,020
I don't mind.

219
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,500
I know you're upset,

220
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,790
so I'm here to comfort you as a friend.

221
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,400
What if it's Lou Mingye?

222
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,960
How about Lou Mingye?

find the love of your life.

226

She'll like you

227
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,830
and stay with you forever.

228
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,520
But I hope it's you.

229

Are we still friends?

230
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,930
Of course.

231
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,300
It's great.

232
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,270
Don't overthink it.

233
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,590
Just enjoy the show.

234
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,910
They're hard to get.

235
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,200
Isn't he Lord Xu?

236
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,200
It turns out Chaozhi is also a fan.

237

- But he seems
- Please come in.

238
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,760
a little distracted.

Fang Tingge?

240
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,620
Why are you here?

241
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,460
Bye.

242
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,020
He got in.

243
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,980
Shall we

get in? It's about to start.

- Okay.

I've arranged it.

You're next to her.

249

That's quite the outfit.

250
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
Really?

251
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,850
Cool.

252
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,910
Do I look good?

253
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,640
Be confident.

Just relax.

Bye.

Mingye?

- Father.
- Didn't you...?

260

Mingye,

261

you had work to do.

I finished it,

264
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,520
so I wanted to check this out.

265
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,320
You said you wouldn't come,

266
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,710
so I didn't prepare your ticket.

- Buzan.
- No need, Father.

So many people.

273

Here we are.

It's a perfect spot,

275

and it's quiet.

276
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,120
Try this.

277

278

Why are you here?

284
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,650
It's an open theater.

285
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,640
If you can come,

286
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,380
why can't I?

I have a question.

295
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,450
Didn't they say we needed

296
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,200
to book the front row
a month in advance?

297
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
I paid three times the price

298
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,400
to get the tickets.

299
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,590
How did he get it?

300
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
I saved the ticket

301
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,710
for Lord Lou.

302
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,450
My Lord,

303
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,270
you don't have to send Lord Fang.

304
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,500
I've saved

305
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,150
all your tickets.

306
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,700
Saved all your tickets.

307
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,270
Lady,

308
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,610
Lord Lou is honest,

309
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,060
wise, and brave.

310
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,270
You two seem...

311
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,030
Why are you telling me this?

312
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,730
Dear guests, please be seated.

313
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,300
Call me if you need anything.

314
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,830
- Just call me.
- Just go.

315
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
Please take a seat.

316
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,830
Shouldn't you be in the office
reading the files?

317
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,400
Why are you here?

318
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,180
My servant left.

319
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,520
No one could serve me.

320
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,000
I couldn't read.

321
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,000
The almond cookies

322
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,320
are plain.

323
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,660
I...

All the guests are here.

325
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,020
Are you ready?

326
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,420
Don't keep them waiting.

327
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,300
Qiao Qi, have you checked the props?

328
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,150
No problem.

329
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,100
costumes?

330
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,930
Can't you see there's a big hole

331
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,860
on the sleeve?

332
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,780
Fix it now!

333
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm on it. It'll be quick.

334
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,140
Come on.

335
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,250
What about the makeup

336
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,450
for the leading actors?

337
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,310
Jiulian.

338
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,900
Jiulian.

339
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,800
Boss.

340
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,950
Jiulian.

doesn't take the debut of our new play

seriously.

Where's Jun Zichen?

347
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,660
Zichen went out

348
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,640
and hasn't come back.

349
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,660
What?

350
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,520
It's getting late!

351
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,710
Jiulian,

352
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,520
are you familiar with his character?

353
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,620
What?

354
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,890
You'll do it.

355
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,520
That's the male lead of the play.

356
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,940
Just do as I said.

357
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,350
How dare he?

358
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,300
Does he think we can't live

359
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,520
without him?

360
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,250
Then

361
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,430
I'll take it.

362
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,610
Hurry. Come on.

363
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,450
Come on.

364
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,340
Change the costume.

365
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,880
Do you enjoy

366
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,950
wearing my costume?

367
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,400
We'll exchange roles

368
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,760
today.

369
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,740
Boss.

370
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,250
If you let this happen,

371
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,470
I'll quit.

372
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,710
Find someone else.

373
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,640

- you...
- Boss,

376

we've all heard

377
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,920
your words.

378
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,100
Well,

379
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,400
do you regret it?

380
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,400
- No.
- Boss.

381
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,580
Boss.

382
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,420
Boss, they're waiting for us.

383
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,590
It's about time.

384
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,310
Hurry. Go to the stage!

385
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,280
Dear Zichen,

386
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,900
everyone came here

387
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,550
for you.

388
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,740
It's about to start.

389
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't upset the audience.

390
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,380
Let Jiulian do it this time.

391
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,160
You can always get it back.

392
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,230
Xie Jiulian.

393
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,950
Do you think you can steal my thunder

394
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,070
just because you get
the leading role tonight?

395
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,070
How do you know

396
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,400
I can't?

397
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,770
Qiao Qi!

398
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,580
If you make another mistake,

399
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,950
I'll kick you out of the troupe!

400
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,050
Hey. Calm down.

401
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,920
The show is the top priority.

402
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,170
Okay? Come on.

403
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,640
Get Zichen changed.

404
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,020
Let's welcome Jun Zichen

405
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,980
and Xie Jiulian to present us with

406
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,520
Jiudu Mountains.

407
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,500
Legend has it

408
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,680
there are two Kings of Hell.

409
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,590
One in charge of deciding on births,

410
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,800
and the other
in charge of receiving the dead.

411
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,400
Whenever a living being
runs out of its life,

412
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,700
the King of Hell

413
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,690
will send messengers

414
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,280
to collect

415
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,680
it soul.

416
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,350
As the Ruthless Judge,
Two-face King of Hell

417
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,930
will go through its merits

418
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,470
and sins.

419
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,260
Some

420
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,400
will be sentenced to suffering in hell.

421
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,620
Some

422
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,780
will be sentenced to...

423
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,760
Don't be scared.

424
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,160
- Enjoy it.
- reincarnation

425
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,040
to ensure balance

426
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,280
and world peace.

427
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,260
However,

428
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,710
good things don't last.

429
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,160
The law is eventually broken.

430
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,740
The good

431
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,450
is sent to hell

432
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,140
while the evil gets away

433
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,950
in reincarnations.

434
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,140
This is

435
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,330
all because of the greed

436
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,520
of the power.

437
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,500
Green-faced King of Hell

438
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,230
betrays his partner

439
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,400
and banish

440
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,380
his soul

441
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,120
to Jiudu Mountains

442
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,680
till the end of time.

443
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,470
The end of act one!

444
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,610
Seems like we need

445
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,040
more applause.

446
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,060
Let's make some noise

447
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,920
to cheer Zichen up!

448
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,010
Bravo!

449
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,350
Zichen?

450
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,530
Jun Zichen.

451
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,160
Stop acting. Get up.

452
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,920
Zichen.

453
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,120
The show is over. Get up.

454
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,350
He's dead!

455
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,000
He's dead!

456
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,070
He's dead!

457
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,240
- Go!
- Stop looking!

458
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,430
Zichen is dead!

459
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,160
Who stabbed him?

460
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,380
It's Qiao Qi.

461
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,500
Qiao Qi!

462
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,740
Qiao Qi!

463
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,890
Qiao Qi!

464
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,650
Qiao Qi,

465
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,500
the show isn't over.

466
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,680
Why are you running away?

467
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,540
I...

468
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,130
Are you hiding from us?

469
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,290
No...

470
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,680
- Give me your bag!
- Go away!

471
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,280
- My bag!
- Go away!

472
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,160
Didn't you say no money?

473
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,460
What's this?

474
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,640
- I...
- Stop.

475
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,900
Who's this kept man?

476
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
Get out!

477
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,350
(Justice Department)
Justice Department.

478
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,860
Run!

479
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,470
You killed a man in public
and fled from the scene.

480
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,100
Qiao Qi.

481
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,350
How dare you?

482
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,800
My Lord! My Lord!

483
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,280
I'm innocent!

484
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,640
I didn't kill anyone!

485
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,330
Is this iron stake

486
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,260
yours?

487
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,190
Yes, it's mine.

488
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Then how can you be innocent?

489
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,350
I did stab him,

490
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,330
but it was supposed to be retractable.

491
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,460
Somehow

492
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,760
it was replaced.

493
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,660
You've rehearsed this many times,

494
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,800
and the stake is your prop.

495
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,430
Didn't you know it was replaced?

496
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,020
We've checked

497
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,120
the things in your bag.

498
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,590
They belong to Jun Zichen.

499
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,590
So, you killed him in the show

500
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,170
and ran away with his money.

501
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,380
I didn't kill him!

502
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,190
Then why did you run away
during the show?

503
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,380
Because...

504
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,430
Because I had a gambling debt,

505
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,990
and I saw them

506
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,880
waiting for me before the show.

507
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
I knew they were after me.

508
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,300
If I didn't pay the debt,

509
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,640
they'd definitely kill me.

510
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,230
I was distracted the whole time

511
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,680
and made a few mistakes,

512
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,380
so I wanted to escape before it ended.

513
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I remembered Zichen

514
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,860
put his money in the locker.

515
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,020
I was out of my mind

516
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,860
and...

517
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,520
I really didn't know that prop...

518
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,520
had been replaced.

519
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,640
Take him down.

520
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,860
- Aye.
- My Lord!

521
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,130
- My Lord!
- Next time.

522
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,500
I... I'm innocent!

523
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,620
I didn't kill him!

524
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,000
My Lord! My Lord!

525
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,070
I don't think

526
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,070
Qiao Qi was lying.

527
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,880
If he's not the murderer,

528
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,620
someone must've used him

529
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,920
to kill Jun Zichen.

530
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,680
The prop was replaced.

531
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,350
The person must be
familiar with the show.

532
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,430
It must be a staff of Zhubo Theater.

533
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,310
Let's find out.

534
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,430
Lord Xu.

535
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,900
We're going to Zhubo Theater

536
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,570
(Justice Department)
for investigation.

537
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,410
Let's go together.

538
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,530
My Lord,

539
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,690
I want to report

540
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,590
something.

541
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,170
Tell me.

542
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,780
My sister

543
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,350
Xu Bingbing works

544
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,310
at Zhubo Theater.

545
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,860
You're a Deputy Lord Chancellor.

546
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,520
How can you let your sister...?

547
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,450
Let my sister

548
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,700
travel around and suffer

549
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,310
with the troupe,

550
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,700
right?

551
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,820
A few years ago,

552
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,260
she had an accident during a hiking

553
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,000
and became a cripple.

554
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,070
She was so upset,

555
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,070
so I took her to a theater,

556
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,120
and she fell in love with it.

557
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,160
I didn't stop her.

558
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,070
Now I want to stop her,

559
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,590
but she won't listen to me.

560
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,310
I need to talk to Lord Xu.

561
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,340
You go first.

562
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,340
Okay.

563
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,190
Let's go.

564
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,760
We're lucky.

565
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:50,980
Let's go.

566
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,860
Lord Xu.

567
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,320
My Lord.

568
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,950
Xu Bingbing is your sister,

569
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,590
so you shouldn't

570
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,760
participate in this case.

571
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,170
I got it.

572
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,310
I should avoid suspicion.

573
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,700
(Justice Department)

574
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,120
Did Qiao Qi and Jun Zichen
have any beef?

575
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,500
How's his relationship

576
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,590
with the rest of you?

577
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,430
We started Zhubo Theater five years ago,

578
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,020
and Zichen and Jiulian

579
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,310
are both the original members.

580
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,070
Zichen is pretty and sings well.

581
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,450
He can also write songs.

582
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,680
We all admire him.

583
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,330
Did he write

584
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,830
all the songs of Zhubo Theater?

585
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,090
Exactly.

586
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,060
Zichen

587
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,170
is really a talented young man.

588
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,680
He didn't finish school,

589
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,120
but somehow

590
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,810
he was enlightened

591
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,350
and learned to write songs.

592
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,700
After that,

593
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,800
he became so arrogant

594
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,000
and began to mock me all the time.

595
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,290
Xu Bingbing,

596
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,590
Qiao Qi and you
are in charge of the props.

597
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,640
Did you see anyone

598
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,550
move the props before the show?

599
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,550
I'd been in the backstage

600
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,230
since the morning

601
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,190
and never seen anyone suspicious.

602
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,060
However, before it started,

603
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,310
we went out for dinner.

604
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,950
It took about an hour.

605
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,640
I think that was the only time
when the backstage was empty.

606
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,430
Who left during dinner?

607
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,640
I think...

608
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,230
our boss left once.

609
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,230
And Jiulian.

610
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,280
Are you suspecting me?

611
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,950
If I had the chance,

612
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,120
I wouldn't have only stabbed him once.

613
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,950
I'd stab the intestines

614
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,760
out of him.

615
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,250
Bingbing.

616
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,050
Come on.

617
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
Bingbing.

618
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,760
Be careful.

619
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,290
Bingbing,

620
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,470
please come home.

621
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,120
I've told you I won't go home.

622
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,820
Bingbing,

623
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,680
someone was murdered.

624
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,120
Why don't you quit?

625
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,590
That's why I should

626
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,120
stay with my people.

627
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,620
Bingbing!

628
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,050
You can take your time.

629
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,900
No need.

630
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,740
Let's go.

631
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,980
(Justice Department)

632
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,880
It turns out Jun Zichen and Xie Jiulian
are brothers

633
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,970
who learned acting

634
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,920
and grew up together.

635
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,210
They were so close

636
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,190
when they were young

637
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,210
and went through

638
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,350
the tough times together.

639
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,970
Why did they turn against each other

640
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,550
after being famous?

641
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,400
In terms of motivation,

642
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,470
Xie Jiulian is the top suspect.

643
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,860
Xie Jiulian,

644
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,070
Do you think you can steal my thunder

645
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,230
just because you get
the leading role tonight?

646
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,020
How do you know

647
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,070
I can't?

648
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,710
Now that Jun Zichen is dead,

649
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,830
he'll become the leading actor.

650
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,520
But Boss Ma also left during the dinner.

651
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,090
Jun Zichen

652
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,120
is his biggest cash cow.

653
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,130
What's the benefit

654
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,680
of killing him?

655
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,310
You've worked hard lately.

656
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,040
It seems you're barely home.

657
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,760
I'll be frank with you.

658
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,800
Every time I go home,

659
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,970
my father will ask

660
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,310
about our relationship.

661
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,130
You haven't told him?

662
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,710
I wouldn't dare.

663
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,950
He'll tear me apart!

664
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,190
But you can't keep

665
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,470
stalling for time.

666
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,580
My Lord.

667
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,020
Here are the letters from their fans.

668
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,860
What should I do?

669
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,860
Let me see.

670
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,590
Can I read them?

671
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,340
Lan Che.

672
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,710
Come with me.
