=Episode 19=

3
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,700
Three fried rice balls.

4
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,660
No problem.

5
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,500
Look.

6
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,740
Master used to buy
fried rice balls for us

7
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,700
every year at the Lantern Festival.

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,300
He said

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,220
the festival isn't complete
without this.

10
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,460
Have a bite.

11
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,100
Boss,

12
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,700
say something.

13
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,860
Luo,

14
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,900
there's something I can't figure out.

15
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,060
Why would such a cautious person

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,860
kill someone in public

17
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,540
and burn his bridges?

18
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
I also find it strange.

19
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,300
Boss!

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,700
I heard the Justice Department
was on fire last night.

21
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,620
That's great.

22
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,980
I wish it turned into ashes.

23
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,340
But it was the morgue!

24
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,860
Master was in there!

25
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,580
What's the cause?

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,060
It's said the weather was dry,

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,500
and a candle fell.

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,820
No.

29
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,060
It's too coincidental.

30
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,260
Dao, why did you buy the lanterns?

31
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,140
I wanted to hang them at night

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,060
so that Master

33
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,940
can find the way home.

34
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,460
At the Lantern Festival,

35
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,420
people will release the lanterns
by the river.

36
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,710
Shall we

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,780
do it together this year?

38
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,540
Okay.

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,180
(Lou Mingye,)

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,780
(you promised)

41
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,580
(to enjoy lanterns)

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,260
(with me tonight.)

43
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,180
(Do you remember?)

44
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,660
Darling, let's release our lanterns.

45
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,620
Look. So beautiful.

46
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,460
Yes.

47
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,580
Let's keep going.

48
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,220
Over there.

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,260
Look.

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,660
That one is good.

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,580
Lanterns.

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,940
Customized Lanterns.

53
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,580
Lanterns.

54
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,660
Come on, take a look.

55
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,740
All kinds of customized lanterns.

56
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,500
Sir,

57
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,020
I booked

58
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
a butterfly lantern here.

59
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,220
Do you remember me?

60
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,460
Of course,

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,420
but it was claimed.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,140
Who took it?

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,780
Well...

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,020
There were a lot of people.
I can't remember.

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Lanterns.

66
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,700
Any other options?

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,980
Okay. Thanks.

68
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,690
- Sister,
- Lanterns.

69
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,100
Come on. Take a look.

70
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,980
Is this for me?

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Yes.

72
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Lanterns.

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,020

(King of Yan's Mansion)

- My Lord.
- My Lord.

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,940
My Lord.

123
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,780
Father!

124
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,990
Why are you in a hurry?

125
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,260
Did you make trouble?

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Huo Feng and his people

127
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,860
surrounded Lou Mingye and shot him.

128
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,980
He fell into the water and went missing.

129
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,630
Lan Che was also
arrested and imprisoned.

130
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,220
Huo Feng was so cruel to his godson.

131
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,580
He's not simple.

132
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,700
Father, I want to save her.

133
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,380
What did you say?

134
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,980
I want to borrow your patrol troops

135
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,100
to save Lan Che
from Huo Feng's posthouse.

136
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,220
Nonsense!

137
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,220
Don't you know Huo Feng

138
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,320
is the governor of Liangzhou?

139
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,900
Liangzhou is at the border.

140
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,620
It safety and stability

141
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,450
can affect the entire Qi.

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,940
But he can't just arrest her like that.

143
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,180
Because he's the governor of Liangzhou,

144
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,980
he can do whatever he wants.

145
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
The death of Lou Huaiyun

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,230
was so strange,

147
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,260
but the court never ordered them
to investigate it.

148
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,460
What else could it be?

149
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,180
And the fire in the Justice Department.

150
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,260
Don't let it happen again.

151
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,180
Mind your own business

152
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,620
and stay out of their affairs.

153
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,630
Understand?

154
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,220
- Father.
- Get out.

155
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,300
My son

156
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,780
is so simple.

157
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,020
I have to take care of him,

158
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,980
or

159
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,940
he'll be used.

160
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,940
Your Highness,

161
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,380
I don't think you helped me
out of kindness.

162
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,260
Someone wants to keep you alive.

163
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm just following the order.

164
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,860
(Changjing Station)

165
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,060
No matter what,

166
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,540
I can't leave Lan Che alone.

167
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,500
Even if I have no allies,

168
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,990
I have to rescue her.

169
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,140
How long are you going to lock me here?

170
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,260
I won't let you go

171
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,370
until I find Luo Mingye.

172
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,620
Even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs.

173
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,140
Lou Mingye treats you like his father.

174
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,940
And you?

175
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,780
You treated him like a target

176
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
and shot him.

177
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,140
He's still missing.

178
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,700
How can you be so cruel?

179
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,860
I knew what I was doing.

180
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,460
He won't die.

181
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,540
I just can't figure out

182
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,180
what's so good about him.

183
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,660
You still care about him

184
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,180
after he killed your master.

185
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,620
Since you know he killed my master,

186
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,620
you should realize

187
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,460
I mean

188
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,300
nothing to him.

189
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,700
Fine.

190
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,740
Then let's make a bet

191
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
to see which one of us

192
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,500
knows him better.

193
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,420
You'd better hope I can win,

194
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,020
because if I lose,

195
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,940
you'll die.

196
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,860
Huo Feng was behind
the Forbidden Drug Case 10 years ago?

197
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,740
Does that mean it was he who killed

198
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,180
Lou Huaiyun and Leng Quji?

199
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,620
Exactly.

200
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,310
Unfortunately, there's no evidence.

201
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,500
But weren't you making drugs
in Liangzhou?

202
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,340
How could you not know?

203
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,410
Back then,

204
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,540
Tuo Jiduo was the one giving orders,

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,260
and Huo Feng never exposed himself.

206
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,180
Otherwise,

207
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,490
how could the cautious Lou Mingye

208
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,180
have been his godson for ten years?

209
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,060
Lord Lou faked my death

210
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,060
to help me get rid of Huo Feng

211
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,780
and let him admit

212
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,620
he's always wanted the recipes.

213
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,020
When did he start to suspect you?

214
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
He...

215
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,950
Actually, he had suspicions

216
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,420
a long time ago.

217
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,020
When Tuo Jiduo was killed in the prison,

218
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,540
I suddenly realized

219
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,820
he wasn't

220
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,020
the real mastermind.

221
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,940
I wanted to protect Lan Che,

222
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,460
so I told Lord Lou my identity.

223
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,510
My Lord, wait a minute.

224
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,860
But he wasn't surprised at all.

225
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,020
You're finally willing to

226
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,420
tell me who you are.

227
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,740
If I'm right,

228
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,620
except for Wu Ming, you're also
one of the pharmacists

229
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,390
who made drugs

230
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,570
for Tuo Jiduo.

231
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,620
Then I'll be straight with you.

232
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,500
A storm is coming.

233
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,100
No matter what happens,

234
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,620
please take care of Lan Che.

235
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,620
Since then,

236
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,900
our plan has started.

237
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,860
If Huo Feng takes action on me,

238
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,860
it'll verify his ambition
for the recipes.

239
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,660
Father, do you want

240
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
to convict him

241
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,620
or make a deal with him

242
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,620
for the recipes?

243
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,900
Shut up!

244
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,220
So you lit the incense to count the time

245
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,580
so that he could pretend to kill you

246
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,380
before the pill took effect.

247
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,220
It was going well

248
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,860
according to our plan,

249
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,980
Lord Lou shouldn't have

250
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,700
appeared at the Lantern Festival.

251
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,780
He's still missing.

252
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,340
If Huo Feng finds him first,

253
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,900
we'll be over.

254
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,500
I'll send people to look for him.

255
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,520
Who?

256
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,900
It's me.

257
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,770
Open the door.

258
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,620
My Lord!

259
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,420
You're finally back.

260
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,740
What happened?

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,340
Luckily,

262
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm still alive.

263
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,580
Li Mo, I was looking for you.

264
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,940
What's wrong?

265
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,220
Save Lan Che

266
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,260
and arrest Huo Feng.

267
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,900
(Changjing Station)

268
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,660
Qingyao.

269
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,780
Father...

270
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,020
Come on, Qingyao,

271
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,420
take the medicine.

272
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,340
Father, it's bitter.

273
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,940
Good girl,

274
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,580
take the medicine,

275
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,540
and I'll buy you plum candy,

276
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,630
- Okay?
- Okay.

277
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,260
Father.

278
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,140
I'm not feeling well.

279
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,380
Come on. Lie down.

280
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,900
Qingyao,

281
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,700
it's all my fault.

282
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,740
I'm so sorry.

283
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,190
Father!

284
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,060
Is Lan Che in there?

285
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Get out of my way!

286
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,540
General has said

287
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,700
no one can get in.

288
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,380
Do you know who I am?

289
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,300
Do you know my father?

290
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,500
My Lord, I...

291
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,340
Move!

292
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,820
Lan Che!

293
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,860
I'm here to save you.

294
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,180
Let's go.

295
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,180
Move!

296
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,500
My Lord.

297
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,180
My Lord,

298
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,620
what are you doing?

299
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,100
Get out of my way.

300
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,540
Are you going to break out?

301
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,740
Didn't your father teach you manners?

302
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,740
Manners don't work for you.

303
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
I'm going to take her anyway.

304
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,660
His Majesty ordered me
to arrest Lou Mingye,

305
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,060
and Lan Che is a witness.

306
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,780
Unless you have the Imperial Edict,

307
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,180
or I won't let her go.

308
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,980
What if I insist on taking her back?

309
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,220
Then don't blame me
for having no mercy on you.

310
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,860
My Lord!

311
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,980
I have something important!

312
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,300
Tell me.

313
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,620
We've found traces of Lou Mingye.

314
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,180
- Are you sure?
- So sure.

315
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,900
He's in the woods outside of town.

316
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,420
Li Mo.

317
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,940
Just go.

318
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,100
I'll be fine.

319
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,820
Don't let them
get something against you.

320
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,020
Lan Che.

321
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,860
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,420
I'll pick you up later.

323
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,300
Let's call it a day.

324
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,900
I'll come back next time.

325
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,500
Take her back.

326
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,460
Summon my Tiger Roar Army.

327
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,140
Follow them.

328
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,580
Aye.

329
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,380
Lou Mingye, Fang Tingge,

330
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
we were ordered

331
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,060
to arrest both of you.

332
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,380
Surrender now.

333
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,020
Wait.

334
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,700
It's Liangzhou's case.

335
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,020
No matter what,

336
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,700
I should take him back to Liangzhou
for investigation.

337
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,220
You should

338
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,980
stay out of this.

339
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,940
Lou Mingye,

340
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,900
we've worked together on many cases.

341
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,940
Come with me.

342
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,340
I won't hurt you.

343
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,460
Are you serious?

344
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,260
When did we work together?

345
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,620
If it wasn't for me,

346
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,460
what could you use to solve the cases?

347
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,260
Your temporizing attitude?

348
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,580
Or Li Mo's obvious stupidity?

349
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,300
You...

350
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,620
Don't go too far!

351
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,340
Come with me.

352
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,340
After all, I'm your godfather.

353
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,820
I won't give you a hard time.

354
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,140
You shot me and made me fall
into the water.

355
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,220
I nearly died.

356
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,660
How can I trust you?

357
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,820
Do you think you can run away?

358
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,180
Get off me!

359
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,980
Get off me!

360
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
Lan Che!

361
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,100
Lou Mingye.

362
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,860
Now,

363
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,860
give me the recipes and come with me,

364
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,060
or

365
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,540
you'll watch her die right here.

366
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
Choose.

367
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
Let her go.

368
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
I'll give you the stuff.

369
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,580
Okay.

370
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,980
The recipes?

371
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,180
Huo Feng.

372
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,180
Leng Quji?

373
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,900
Brother Lou?

374
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,900
I've treated you like my brother.

375
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,220
Why did you kill me?

376
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,540
I...

377
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,460
I...

378
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,980
It's all your fault!

379
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,860
You listened to him and stopped me

380
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,180
from making Distortion Pill.

381
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,820
Liangzhou has always been at war.

382
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,020
The enemy wants to invade us.

383
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,540
Only a powerful army

384
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,100
can bring peace to Liangzhou!

385
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,020
It's very poisonous.

386
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,340
The soldiers will die!

387
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,110
There will always be sacrifices
for the bigger picture!

388
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,930
You're born an evil snake.

389
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,900
You only wanted my position.

390
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,170
Huo Feng,

391
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,420
I'll kill you for revenge!

392
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,300
Brother Lou,
I shouldn't have killed you!

393
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,380
Did you take the cure Li Mo gave you?

394
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,660
I took it in advance.

395
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,500
What happened?

396
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,700
Aren't all the Oblivion Flowers dead?

397
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,020
General, you were careless.

398
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,260
Yu Xie?

399
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,100
Didn't you die?

400
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,860
Master...

401
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,420
If

402
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,020
I hadn't faked my death to buy time,

403
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,860
how could I have planted

404
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,940
the only Oblivion Flower left?

405
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,180
Lord Xu of the Justice Department
can prove

406
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,060
that you've admitted
that you tried to make Distortion Pill

407
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,090
and sent Tuo Jiduo to kill them
after you were exposed.

408
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
General.

409
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,540
Are you going to deny it?

410
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,100
Mingye.

411
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
I've treated you

412
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,500
like my real son
over the past ten years.

413
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,340
Do we have to

414
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,780
end up like this?

415
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,660
You raised him

416
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,940
only because he's

417
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,300
the last ingredient.

418
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,140
If he didn't have
the purest yang energy,

419
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,620
you would've killed him
ten years ago.

420
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,300
My father and you

421
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,940
were like brothers.

422
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,980
He saved you many times in the war.

423
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,060
Do you remember?

424
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,580
Swords have no mercy.

425
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,420
He told me

426
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,980
if something happened to be,
you'd be my father.

427
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,540
General,

428
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,620
have you ever

429
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,780
appreciated the brotherhood?

430
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,340
Huo Feng.

431
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,460
You're suspected of killing Lou Huaiyun,
the former governor of Liangzhou.

432
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,660
We're ordered to arrest you.

433
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,630
Justice Department?

434
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,970
How dare you be so arrogant

435
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,860
in front of me?

436
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,140
Do you really think

437
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,900
I only have these people?

438
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,900
You must be familiar

439
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,340
with the Tiger Roar Army, right?

440
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,420
Justice Department!

441
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,620
- Aye!
- Aye!

442
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,900
Kill them.

443
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,900
All of them!

444
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,340
Why isn't it here?

445
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,060
Are you looking for this?

446
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,920
No.

447
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,900
How dare you try to steal
the token of my patrol troops?

448
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,140
You're way out of line!

449
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,380
Father, I have no choice this time.

450
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,620
How can you get yourself
into Liangzhou's affair?

451
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,060
You're not going anywhere.

452
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,460
Stay in this house!

453
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,900
No problem!

454
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,780
Idiot! Stop!

455
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,700
Qingyao!

456
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,860
Lan Che.

457
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,540
My Lord, where's the reinforcement?

458
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,780
We can't hold it.

459
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Lou Mingye!

460
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,020
Is the rich stupid boy
your reinforcement?

461
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,500
His Majesty won't allow anyone

462
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,540
to harm the people and the country.

463
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,140
However, Huo Feng has an army.

464
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,740
His Majesty hasn't got
the chance to wipe him out.

465
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,530
Now it's time,

466
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,340
and you'll be

467
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,140
His Majesty's knife.

468
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,160
My Lord!

469
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,140
Do it.

470
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,300
Isn't revenge your lifelong aspiration?

471
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,940
Listen.

472
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,140
Over the past ten years,

473
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,900
I've only wanted

474
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,450
to use you.

475
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,830
Do it!

476
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,990
What are you waiting for?

477
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,180
Father...

478
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,230
Father!

479
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,380
Mingye.

480
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,940
- Mingye...
- Father...

481
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,740
You got soft after all.

482
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,140
Mingye,

483
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,580
can you

484
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,220
promise me one thing?

485
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,260
Say it.

486
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Don't let King of Yan catch me.

487
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,540
I want to die with dignity.

488
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,900
I promise.

489
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,140
One.

490
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,540
(Xieshan Pavilion)
Two.

491
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,380
Three.

492
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,620
Four.

493
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,340
Stand still

494
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,500
and act fast.

495
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,420
You're so weak. Are you a girl?

496
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,340
Again!

497
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,700
Mingye, when you grow up,

498
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,340
you'll become

499
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,740
an incredible young general.

500
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,300
Naughty boy.
