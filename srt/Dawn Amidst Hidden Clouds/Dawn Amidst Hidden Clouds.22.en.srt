=Episode 22=

3
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,890
This mission is extremely dangerous.

4
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,690
Once failed,

5
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,540
not only you will be accused of treason,

6
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,250
but your family will suffer as well.

7
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,810
If you have doubts,

8
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,500
step forward.

9
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,380
I won't

10
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,940
blame you.

11
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,060
We were General Lou's

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,500
suicide soldiers when he was alive.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,660
Lord Lou, since you've
made up your mind,

14
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,300
we're willing to die for you!

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,900
Die for you!

16
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,370
My Lord!

17
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,890
I want to go to

18
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,690
King of Yan's mansion with you

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,810
to avenge my sister.

20
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,450
Wait a minute.

21
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,170
My Lord, it seems

22
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,660
you're going to break in
to rescue Lan Che.

23
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,580
Read this

24
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,250
before you make the decision.

25
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,140
Lou Mingye,

26
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,300
the mansion is heavily guarded.

27
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,500
Don't get yourself killed for me.

28
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,140
I'm so lucky to have met you

29
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,140
and reunite with you.

30
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,090
Unfortunately,
we can't grow old together.

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Life is long.

32
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,900
Wish you

33
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,250
happiness and peace.

34
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,690
Even if she says so,

35
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,660
I'll rescue her anyway.

36
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,700
I knew it.

37
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,860
If so,

38
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,500
you must've come for

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,060
more than just delivering the message.

40
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,580
I've been waiting for you.

41
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,380
Whether we can succeed or not

42
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,730
is up to you.

43
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,980
Hold on for four hours.

44
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,940
I'll come back

45
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,980
in four hours.

46
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,290
My girl.

47
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,780
Master...

48
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,500
If you want to live,

49
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,010
make the pill for me.

50
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,940
How's it going?

51
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,500
We can start on time.

52
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,540
Do you think

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,470
Lou Mingye will show up?

54
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,690
Well,

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,340
are you scared?

56
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,540
I'm worried that he won't come.

57
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,130
If not,

58
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,060
how can I get rid of him rightfully?

59
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,290
Hypocrite.

60
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,940
Your Highness,

61
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,010
Lord Li

62
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
went to the court.

63
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,260
My Lord,

64
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,060
His Majesty has been waiting for you.

65
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,010
Please.

66
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,610
Just let him be.

67
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,080
If he doesn't fail,

68
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,060
he'll never know

69
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,540
a son can never defeat his father.

70
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,410
My Lord,

71
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,660
it's not the way to the court.

72
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,500
His Majesty isn't there.

73
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,820
Stop.

74
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,010
Where are we going?

75
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,940
I've promised His Highness

76
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,340
to stop you

77
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,980
from seeing His Majesty,
no matter what it takes.

78
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,820
Aren't you afraid of death?

79
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,010
Just do what you want.

80
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,730
If I can't fulfill my mission,

81
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,780
His Highness will kill me

82
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,700
anyway.

83
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,410
All these years,

84
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,410
you've held great power in the court

85
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,130
with my father's support.

86
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,010
However, if you want

87
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,010
to maintain your power,

88
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,540
you'd better think it through.

89
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,780
My Lord, what do you mean?

90
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,010
Lou Mingye has entered
King of Yan's Mansion.

91
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,170
with the Liangzhou army.

92
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,450
You know

93
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,890
him well.

94
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,130
He won't stop

95
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,060
until he gets what he wants.

96
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,820
Today is going to be a big day,

97
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,130
My Lord.

98
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,170
Do you want to bet?

99
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,380
Who do you think will be in charge of

100
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,260
King of Yan's mansion?

101
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,660
Are you rebelling?

102
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,250
My Lord!

103
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,610
Get in with Fang Tingge.

104
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,170
The secret room in my father's study

105
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,060
leads to his alchemy altar.

106
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,650
Twist the pen holder
in the second row of the bookcase

107
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,530
to open the door.

108
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,940
Time is up.

109
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,170
Do it.

110
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,410
It's all my fault.

111
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,690
Qingyao!

112
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,610
I almost

113
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,140
got you killed

114
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,940
because of my cowardness,

115
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,010
but you

116
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,340
gave me a second chance to live.

117
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,730
- Help!
- I won't make

118
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,850
the same mistake again.

119
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,780
Master!

120
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,310
I asked you to draw her blood

121
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,880
to keep her alive for a few more years,

122
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,610
but you ruined the chance.

123
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,770
Then don't blame me.

124
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
Do it.

125
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,100
No!

126
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,500
Lou Mingye,

127
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,530
I knew you'd come.

128
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,340
Li Xun,

129
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,900
His Majesty has prohibited
alchemy many times,

130
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,700
and you've disobeyed the order.

131
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,060
Are you ignoring

132
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,820
the power of His Majesty?

133
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,260
To make the country thrive,

134
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,650
sacrifices are necessary.

135
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,340
However,

136
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,610
you just don't understand it.

137
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,610
Your Majesty, I have to report
something important.

138
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,290
What's so important

139
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,210
that your father can't solve it,

140
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,610
and you have to turn to me?

141
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,970
I'm accusing my father of
breaking the law,

142
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,850
defining Distortion Pill,
and deceiving Your Majesty.

143
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,730
You sacrificed lives

144
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,020
for your own nasty desire!

145
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,700
How dare you talk about the country?

146
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,970
His Majesty is so weak,

147
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,530
and I'm just trying
to defend the country for him.

148
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,640
Am I wrong?

149
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,980
I

150
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,260
believe King of Yan.

151
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,340
If he thinks the drug is useful,

152
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,580
maybe we should give it a try.

153
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,340
Your Majesty,

154
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,500
during the former emperor's reign,
alchemy was a big trend,

155
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,730
but most of the drugs
could only harm the people.

156
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,060
You just claimed the throne.

157
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,710
Please don't let it happen again.

158
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,560
How dare you

159
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,140
criticize the former emperor?

160
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Everyone knows

161
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,260
King is Yan is a loyal servant.

162
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,840
He won't harm Qi.

163
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,460
- Your Majesty!
- Stop talking.

164
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,740
Just go.

165
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,850
My Lord,

166
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,370
please.

167
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,340
Lou Mingye.

168
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,440
Where do you think you are?

169
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,230
Do you think you can

170
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
come and go whenever you want?

171
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,820
In that case,

172
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,580
I won't let you down, Your Highness.

173
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,870
Go.

174
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,450
Get them.

175
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,260
Kill them all!

176
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,020
Your Majesty, the ocean

177
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,730
looks calm on the surface,

178
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,050
but there are many undercurrents.

179
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,170
What do you mean?

180
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,610
Qi is like

181
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,580
the ocean,

182
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,530
which looks peaceful

183
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,290
but is balkanized.

184
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,650
The fate of the country

185
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,770
is unpredictable.

186
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,290
How dare you?

187
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,340
Your Majesty,

188
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,210
people say you're conservative,

189
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,140
but I don't think so.

190
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,940
I'm convinced

191
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,530
that you're preparing for the future,

192
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,780
and one day, you'll bring peace to Qi

193
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,850
and win people's hearts
with powerful measures

194
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,140
and become the Emperor of Prosperity.

195
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,410
Leave us alone.

196
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,490
Aye.

197
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,370
Look at you.

198
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,940
What do you really want?

199
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,380
You Majesty, I want

200
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,410
to show you something.

201
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,970
- Stop!
- Come with me.

202
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,340
There's a secret path out.

203
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,780
Hurry!

204
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,100
Go!

205
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,460
- Hurry!
- Lan Che, go!

206
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,450
My Lord!

207
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,530
Lan Che!

208
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,450
My Lord,

209
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,020
I don't know if I should say this.

210
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,090
Later.

211
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,090
Are you okay?

212
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,610
I'm fine.

213
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,860
Let's get out.

214
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,060
Fang Tingge!

215
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,700
Fang Tingge...

216
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,330
My Lord...

217
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,410
I don't know

218
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,250
if I should say this.

219
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,340
Let's get out.

220
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,330
I've always known

221
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,010
your entire life

222
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,940
is based on revenge.

223
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,530
Can you promise me

224
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,210
one thing?

225
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,290
When this is over...

226
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,940
stop making that poker face.

227
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,420
Fang Tingge...

228
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,700
Don't cry.

229
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,660
You look ugly.

230
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,820
My Lord...

231
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,700
Do you know

232
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,220
why I helped you

233
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,820
to pursue Lan Che?

234
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,980
Actually,

235
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,140
I also did it for myself.

236
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,500
I really like...

237
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,020
Luo.

238
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,740
My Lord,

239
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,660
you went...

240
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,380
to Lingxi Lake together.

241
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,660
Is it beautiful?

242
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,300
I want to watch it with Luo...

243
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,500
Fang Tingge.

244
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,740
Fang Tingge!

245
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,970
Fang Tingge!

246
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,060
Lou Mingye.

247
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,260
Even if you kill me,

248
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,660
my guards and soldiers

249
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,540
won't let you get out alive.

250
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,580
I never expected myself
to get out alive.

251
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,540
Before we die,

252
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,740
I have a question for you.

253
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,100
Were you behind
the Distortion Pill's case

254
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,620
ten years ago?

255
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,390
They say

256
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,780
Distortion Pill is just a myth,

257
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,620
but I know it isn't.

258
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,580
Because I've seen it!

259
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,460
Before the former emperor died,

260
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,970
he ordered them
to destroy the pills secretly.

261
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,800
Everyone in the court knows that.

262
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,830
I tried so hard

263
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,380
and ordered Huo Feng

264
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,980
to make the pill
in the remote area of Liangzhou.

265
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,500
I was so close to success.

266
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,680
But a loser is always a loser.

267
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,140
He ruined everything!

268
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,060
So,

269
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,900
it was you who ordered Huo Feng

270
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,940
to kill my father and Uncle Leng!

271
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,780
He had it coming!

272
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,310
He released Leng Quji

273
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,910
and even intended to

274
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,580
sabotage my plan!

275
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,820
How the hell is he?

276
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,540
You've killed so many people

277
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,620
just for your lingering desire

278
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,140
of Distortion Pill?

279
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,420
Do you think His Majesty doesn't know?

280
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,800
Think about it.

281
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,240
If you kill me,

282
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,480
you'll be accused of treason.

283
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,710
Lan Che,

284
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,550
Huanxi,

285
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,550
they're all going to die for you.

286
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,130
Do you really want them to die?

287
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,330
We both have desires.

288
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,630
I want the pill.

289
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,500
and you want revenge.

290
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,780
I've killed many people.

291
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,140
So have you.

292
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,940
Mingye.

293
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,700
Mingye.

294
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,860
Mingye.

295
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,940
Move on.

296
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,380
It's all in the past.

297
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,060

Li Xun, King of Yan!

328
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,020
Aye!

329
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,180
Claim the edict!

330
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,020
The Emperor,

331
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,500
by the Grace of Heaven, decrees that

332
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,420
Li Xun, King of Yan,

333
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,500
made the forbidden drug
Distortion Pill,

334
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,700
broke the law,

335
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,460
and harmed the people.

336
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,340
From now on,

337
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,260
he shall be deprived of his position

338
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,260
and become a common person.

339
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,220
Your Majesty,

340
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,460
I'm doing this

341
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,820
for the country and the people.

342
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,740
Your Majesty, if you can
take the first step,

343
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,900
I'll do whatever I can

344
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,140
to eliminate all the obstacles

345
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,980
and help you regain the glory.

346
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,460
Why

347
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,260
should I believe you?

348
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,380
Because I can't wait to witness

349
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,060
a real prosperous country!

350
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,780
His son Li Mo reported this.

351
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,710
From now on,

352
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,700
he shall take over the position

353
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,580
as King of Yan.

354
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,300
Granted by His Majesty!

355
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,460
From now on,

356
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,540
I'm the real King of Yan.

357
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,860
Whoever disobeys the edict

358
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,820
shall be executed immediately.

(Huanxi Clinic)

360
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,380
My Lord,

361
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,020
I'm afraid she doesn't have much time.

362
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,540
I can save her.

363
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,380
I also have the purest yang energy.

364
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
If we exchange our blood,

365
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,220
she'll survive.

366
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Are you serious?

367
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,140
If you do this, you'll...

368
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,900
She gave me a second life.

369
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,700
It's time to pay it back.

370
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,940
My life is like a dream.

371
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,220
I used to think my biggest wish

372
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,980
was to avenge my father.

373
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,300
Now it seems so stupid.

374
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,940
If I could go back in time.

375
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,300
I'd only spend time

376
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,060
talking and arguing

377
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,460
with her.

378
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,300
We'd eat plum candy together.

379
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,660
If I'd given up those

380
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,020
meaningless obsessions,

381
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,940
would we have left

382
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,820
more memories?

383
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,620
I love you.

384
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,380

00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,300
managing Wuhou District.

576
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,070
He wants us back.

577
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,220
For what?

578
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,500
Exactly.

579
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,380
The place hasn't changed,

580
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,860
but the people are gone.

581
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,690
It's not worth it.

582
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,540
Have you arranged enough people
for the Lantern Festival tonight?

583
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,500
Don't make any mistakes,

584
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,420
understand?

585
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,580
No problem.

586
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,140
I assure you everything

587
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,300
will be fine.

588
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,340
You're not going?

589
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,580
No.

590
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,260
Take him away.

591
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,740
Don't stand here.

592
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,580
- Let's go.
- Okay.

593
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,490
Hey, guys.

594
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,020
Come back quickly.

595
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,900
I just got some new herbs.

596
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,620
Help me when you're back.

597
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,580
(Huanxi Clinic)
Fine. You're so annoying.

598
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,740
- Bye.
- Have dinner first.

599
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,140
You can work later.

600
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,570
- You...
- Hurry up.

601
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,650
- Let's go.
- Lan Che.

602
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,980
- Go.
- Help me dry the herbs.

603
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,980
Sorry to keep you waiting.

604
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,220
This one, right?

605
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,700
Yes.

606
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,980
It's not serious.

607
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:43,980
(Huanxi Clinic)

608
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,460
Sorry,

609
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,820
I didn't mean to break your lantern.

610
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,740
Give this to me, and I'll forgive you.

611
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,260
My father made this when he was alive.

612
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,180
You can't have it!

613
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,660
What a miser.

614
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,580
Don't be angry.

615
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,580
I can make you a better one.

616
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,820
Okay, then.

617
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,300
Don't lie to me.

618
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,000
Lan Che,

619
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,900
if you can't remember who you are,

620
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,020
what will you do?

621
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,970
I'll live a life as Lan Che.

622
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,180
Don't you feel sorry for that?

623
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,180
Of course I do.

624
00:52:59,020 --> 00:52:59,940
However, compared to

625
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,620
the unknown identity,

626
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,220
the current life of Lan Che
is much more important.

627
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,180
In other words,

628
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,260
luminous pearls are beautiful,

629
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,860
but I prefer

630
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,860
the real stars in the sky.

631
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,700
Yes.

632
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,820
Luminous pearls are beautiful

633
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,820
but they can never compare to the stars.

634
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,020
My Lord,

635
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,300
you look like a fool when you smile.

636
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,100
You're adorable when you're quiet.

637
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,950
Master Lan Che,

638
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,100
are you sure
you're not coming back for the job?

639
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:22,660
