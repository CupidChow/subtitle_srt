3
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,540
(Huanxi Clinic)

4
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,480
Treat Jiuxiang?

5
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,280
Did Lord Lou agree?

6
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,840
Yes.

7
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,500
Jiuxiang was forced to use
Carefree Powder

8
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,620
for many years.

9
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,720
She's highly addicted.

10
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,980
Master, you managed

11
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,680
to make the cure for Carefree Powder,

12
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,160
so I believe you can help her.

13
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,880
You didn't know Jiuxiang before.

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,240
Why do you care about her so much?

15
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,420
I don't know.

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,420
But the first time I saw her,

17
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,780
it felt like a deja vu.

18
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,540
Lord Xu said you wanted
to tell me something.

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,820
My Lord,

20
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,340
you don't recognize me?

21
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,180
Do you remember

22
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,140
the pharmacist Leng Quji
who treated you in Liangzhou

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,220
ten years ago?

24
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,420
Ci,

25
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,790
take care of Qingyao.

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,500
No matter what happens,
don't come out,

27
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,340
understand?

28
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,700
Take him down!

29
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,550
What are you doing?

30
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,540
Get off me!

31
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,980
Go!

32
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,740
My Lady, I'm worried about your father.

33
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
Stay right here.

34
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,300
Check over there.

35
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,620
Is anyone in there?

36
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,580
Get over here.

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,380
Here's another one!

38
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,820
Jiuxiang!

39
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,340
You're Leng Quji's little apprentice.

40
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,860
You're Ci.

41
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,380
Tell me,

42
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,460
why did Leng Quji kill my father?

43
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,100
I can't believe you think

44
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,380
my master killed General Lou.

45
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,980
General Lou invited my master
to his mansion

46
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,500
to treat you.

47
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,140
If he wanted to kill him,

48
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,100
why would he try his best

49
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
to heal you?

50
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,380
But he was the only one at the scene

51
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,100
when my father was killed.

52
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,380
My Lord,

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,060
you used to be
the Grand Warden of Liangzhou.

54
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,420
Ask yourself,

55
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,700
does Master Leng

56
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,980
really look like a criminal?

57
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,180
If he didn't kill my father,

58
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,300
why would he
escape from Liangzhou at night?

59
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,100
I'm afraid my master

60
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,860
and the other people

61
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,420
were buried under the land of Liangzhou

62
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,580
a long time ago.

63
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,380
What?

64
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,340
If they really suspected my master

65
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,220
of killing General Lou,

66
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,260
why would they try
to eliminate all of us

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,180
instead of taking us back
for investigation?

68
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,220
Leng Quji is dead?

69
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,860
Let me in.

70
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,060
No visits at night.

71
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,940
I want to see Jiuxiang.

72
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,740
I'm afraid it's too late.

73
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,140
That girl

74
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,740
couldn't resist the drug's side effects.

75
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,540
She suffered a lot.

76
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,700
She might

77
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,620
find peace in heaven.

78
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,060
Wait a minute!

79
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,420
Jiuxiang!

80
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,700
Jiuxiang!

81
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,460
I know I'm dying.

82
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
My Lord,

83
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,540
can you fulfill my last wish?

84
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,820
Tell me.

85
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,260
I lost Qingyao

86
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,300
and failed my master,

87
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,860
but I believe

88
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,300
she's still alive.

89
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,820
She's been all alone

90
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,740
in this world all these years.

91
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,620
She must've suffered a lot!

92
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,820
My Lord,

93
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,780
promise me...

94
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,020
you will find Qingyao.

95
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
(Don't worry.)

96
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,900
(I've found her.)

97
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,020
Jiuxiang

98
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,780
is already gone.

99
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,940
Are you okay?

100
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,260
I told you

101
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,580
I grew up in Changjing.

102
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,900
That was a lie.

103
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,500
My master said...

104
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,060
he found me

105
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,140
at the foot of a mountain
in the suburbs.

106
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,340
When he found me,

107
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,500
I got bruises all over my body.

108
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,860
He asked about my name

109
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,140
and my home,
but I couldn't remember anything.

110
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,820
Therefore, he assumed

111
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,860
I fell off the mountain by accident

112
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,100
and hurt my head.

113
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,740
That's why I lost my memories.

114
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,820
Can't you remember anything?

115
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
Actually,

116
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,420
I've been dreaming about

117
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,540
being hunted

118
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
by many masked men

119
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,060
and being saved by a lady.

120
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,540
However, I couldn't remember

121
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,940
her face until today.

122
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,500
It was Jiuxiang.

123
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,700
I only know she saved me.

124
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,900
If I had remembered this earlier,

125
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,220
she wouldn't have been so lonely!

126
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,340
I'll buy you a new one someday.

127
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,540
It's raining hard.

128
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,220
Let me send you back.

129
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,580
I didn't have

130
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,860
many doubts about my identity

131
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,780
because I've always regarded

132
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,940
my master, Dao, and Luo

133
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,100
as my family.

134
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,380
However, now I've finally got a clue

135
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,900
of my past.

136
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,940
I'm starting to wonder

137
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,860
what happened back then.

138
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,140
Don't be upset.

139
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,980
Maybe it's just not the right time.

140
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,580
(What's wrong with him?)

141
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,540
(Is he feeling guilty or something?)

142
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,940
My Lord.

143
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,460
Your umbrella

144
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,980
looks pretty.

145
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,380
Little Patient, let's catch butterflies.

146
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,580
I have a gift for you.

147
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,660
Open it.

148
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Now you can avoid the sunshine

149
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,820
and catch butterflies with me.

150
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,940
My Lord?

151
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,740
What's wrong?

152
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,860
My Lord,

153
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,820
your umbrella is very pretty.

154
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,820
No wonder you carry it all the time.

155
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,780
Tell me.

156
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,540
What do you want this time?

157
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,340
(He's so kind today.)

158
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,260
I do have a favor to ask.

159
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,020
Can you show me

160
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,220
Jiuxiang's file?

161
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,260
No.

162
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,700
Maybe her file

163
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,940
can remind me of the past.

164
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,140
My Lord, just let me take a look.

165
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Please.

166
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,260
(Perhaps...)

167
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,100
(it will work.)

168
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,540
(Lou's Mansion)

169
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,700
Thanks, My Lord.

170
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,580
You're really a good Lord Chancellor
who cares about the people.

171
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,060
(Indenture, Second Party: Lan Che)

172
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,620
Indenture?

173
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,500
Only our staff can read the files.

174
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,660
If you can be my assistant,

175
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,260
maybe I'll share

176
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,580
some information with you

177
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,340
someday.

178
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,900
Lou Mingye,

179
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,540
did I know you before?

180
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,780
Do you have a grudge against me?

181
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,380
Why are you always
giving me a hard time?

182
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,700
Don't you know

183
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,740
what you've done?

184
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,300
What could it be?

185
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,180
Confess now,

186
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,340
or you'll have to go to another room

187
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,060
when I interrogate you.

188
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,540
(Oh, no.)

189
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,740
(Did he find out everything?)

190
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,620
Fine.

191
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,500
I admit...

192
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,220
I did say bad things about you,

193
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,820
but it's not that serious.

194
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,180
I only said

195
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,020
you had weak arms and shoulders,

196
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,860
so you might be sick.

197
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,450
Besides, you use

198
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,950
an umbrella even when it's sunny.

199
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,910
I said you were dramatic,

200
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,140
and handsome but useless.

201
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,550
I said maybe you paid

202
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,380
for this job.

203
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,110
That's all.

204
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,380
Slandering an official is a felony.

205
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,540
Lan Che, how dare you?

206
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,740
My Lord,

207
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,260
everybody's been talked
behind their back.

208
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,180
Do you really care?

209
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,740
That's so petty.

210
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,540
In my opinion,

211
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,940
you should be generous

212
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,460
and forgive a humble citizen

213
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,420
like me.

214
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,460
Fine.

215
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,060
I won't fuss about it.

216
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,980
If I sign this,

217
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
can I see Jiuxiang's file?

218
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
It depends.

219
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,700
Are you playing with me?

220
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
I never force people to do something.

221
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,300
It's up to you.

222
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm a leader.

223
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
You don't deserve to be my boss.

224
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,660
My Lord,

225
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,060
have you made up your mind?

226
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Are you really going to keep her
as your servant?

227
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,140
I'd rather keep her around

228
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,340
than let her run around
and make trouble.

229
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,140
My Lord, how about this?

230
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,420
Give me three months.

231
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,980
I'll visit the best doctors

232
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,860
and find a way to bring her memory back.

233
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,700
If you find her,

234
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,980
don't tell her anything about the past.

235
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,420
Just take care of her

236
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,860
for me and my master.

237
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,240
We don't need to rush.

238
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,540
My Lord, do you have a plan?

239
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,180
(Huanxi Clinic)

240
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,060
He really treats me

241
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,740
better now,

242
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,060
but a man never changes.

243
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,180
Serving a devil

244
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,900
will not do me any good.

245
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,620
Oh, no.

246
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,180
Lord Fang,

247
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,340
what are you doing?

248
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,460
Trimming flowers.

249
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,500
Do you want to try?

250
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,900
My Lord,

251
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,060
you're finally here.

252
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
How could do this to my flowers?

253
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,620
You're fined.

254
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,540
My Lord, look at the dirty floor!

255
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,060
How dare you slack off?

256
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,140
Even a pig works harder.

257
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,420
He scattered the leaves!

258
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,660
He's still got them!

259
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
Is that so?

260
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,460
- Eating all day.
- Boss.

261
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,660
What about your work?

262
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,500
You're fined!

263
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,380
Lou Mingye, I'll kill you

264
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,260
and avenge my boss!

265
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,980
No, no, no.

266
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,940
(Lou's Mansion)

267
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,100
Put it on your tab?

268
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,700
Okay.

269
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,300
Fang Tingge.

270
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,700
Do the math.

271
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,820
20 taels of sliver for the file,

272
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,260
and the monthly interest is

273
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,260
half a tael.

274
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,420
How can you raise the price?

275
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,020
We talked about
black market price yesterday,

276
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,100
but this is not a black market.

277
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
Next month,

278
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,540
it'll be 20 and a half taels,

279
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,660
and after that...

280
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,140
Loan shark, huh?

281
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
I'll report you!

282
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,260
You'd better figure it out.

283
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,860
What's the sentence for owing money

284
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,260
according to Qi's law?

285
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,740
20 years.

286
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,580
I'm afraid she'll be

287
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,900
an old lady when she gets out.

288
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,260
If she works for me,

289
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,180
she'll pay off the debt
in two years, right?

290
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,820
If I were her,

291
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,100
I'd be your servant.

292
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Then be a servant.

293
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,980
I don't owe him money.

294
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,180
Did I read the file?

295
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,580
I never read it,

296
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,260
so I don't owe you money.

297
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,580
Do you mean

298
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,060
you don't want to read it?

299
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,060
Fine.

300
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,620
I'll be your servant,

301
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,700
but we need to set the rules.

302
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,660
Tell me.

303
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,980
I don't trim flowers or sweep the floor,

304
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,140
and you can't feed me leftovers

305
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,660
or use me as a punching bag.

306
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,820
What is she talking about?

307
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,100
What else?

308
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,400
That's all.

309
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,580
Fang Tingge.

310
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,740
(Second Party: Lan Che)

311
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,860
From now on,

312
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,780
I'm your owner.

313
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,580
Can I

314
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,820
read Jiuxiang's file now?

315
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,780
I'll show you when the case is over.

316
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,820
What?

317
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,500
You just said...

318
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,500
What did I say?

319
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,860
You said...

320
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,540
I said I'd show you,

321
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,900
but did I say when?

322
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,740
No.

323
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,860
Fine.

324
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,300
Good.

325
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,980
I said I'd be your servant,

326
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
but I didn't say
what kind of servant I'd be.

327
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,260
(Lou's Mansion)

328
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,100
Your Highness.

329
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,220
My Lord, I've heard a lot about

330
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,700
what you've accomplished in Liangzhou.

331
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,900
You just came to Changjing,

332
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,620
but you've solved
the Carefree Powder's case.

333
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,780
You're worth the name.

334
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,020
I'm so flattered.

335
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,940
Unfortunately, my son...

336
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,660
has never accomplished anything big.

337
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,900
I sent him to the Justice Department

338
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,380
to train him.

339
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,460
That's right.

340
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,660
Young people

341
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,580
should work hard.

342
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Who's this?

343
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,460
Are you asking me?

344
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,260
She's my servant.

345
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,980
Your Highness,

346
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
the Justice Department
is short of hands,

347
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,860
and your son is right on time.

348
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,060
My Lord, please teach him for me.

349
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,980
By the way, My Lord,

350
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,540
have you walked around the city
since you came?

351
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,940
Not yet.

352
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,660
Lord Lou

353
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,780
only went to Yuyan Tower.

354
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
Yuyan Tower?

355
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,020
I've been busy.

356
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,740
I only went there for the case.

357
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,980
I haven't got time

358
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,500
to walk around.

359
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,860
Went there for a case?

360
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,940
Well...

361
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,580
My Lord, you're young.

362
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
I understand.

363
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,860
You're a young man.

364
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,420
But remember to take a break.

365
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,620
This way, please.

366
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,660
Get off me!

367
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,780
Enough. Stop!

368
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,460
What are you doing?

369
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,500
Lan Che, you've never been
a servant before, right?

370
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,380
Of course not.

371
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,140
I've always been a boss, okay?

372
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,940
Then let me teach you

373
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,220
how to be a servant.

374
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
Tell me.

375
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,020
First,

376
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,340
obey the rules.

377
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,340
You're here.

378
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,420
Are you tired?

379
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,620
Do you need water?

380
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,600
Come on,

381
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,500
I've never seen you being so humble.

382
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,820
I'm a guard, and you're a servant.

383
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
It's different.

384
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,580
How?

385
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,380
A guard needs skills,

386
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,420
and a servant

387
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,500
only needs to please the boss.

388
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,740
What's the next point?

389
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,380
Second, take stock of the situation.

390
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,300
When we were in the hall,

391
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,860
you should've prepared tea and water
to serve them.

392
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,940
How could you

393
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,900
disrespect the lords?

394
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,020
What's next?

395
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,940
Third, do as your master says.

396
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,780
You can't do anything
without his permission.

397
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,540
If he asks you to drink,
you can only drink.

398
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,300
Then will you kill yourself if he asks?

399
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,620
Servant is just my job.

400
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,020
I never sold my life to him.

401
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,580
Obey the rules, or you'll be fined.

402
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,900
Anyway, more fines,

403
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,980
more work.

404
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,580
If I were you,

405
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,020
I'd behave myself

406
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,820
and get freedom as soon as possible.

407
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,020
Then behave yourself.

408
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,840
My Lord, please stay here.

409
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,380
I hired a chef from Liangzhou.

410
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,340
You can visit me someday and try

411
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,940
- your hometown dishes.
- Your Highness.

412
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,060
Your Highness, are you hungry?

413
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,300
Are you thirsty?

414
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,700
Would you like some tea?

415
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,340
I can get some water for you.

416
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,460
Are you hungry?

417
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,580
- Are you thirsty?
- Stop!

418
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,730
I can get some water for you.

419
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,620
- Are you thirsty?
- You...

420
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,660
Are you...?

421
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,820
Your Highness, sorry for that.

422
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,060
She's new here,

423
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,460
and she's got mental issues.

424
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,060
I need to do

425
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,500
as my master says.

426
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,740
My Lord, you're right.

427
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,660
I do have some mental issues.

428
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,240
It suddenly occurred to me

429
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,290
that I have work to do.

430
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,220
Goodbye.

431
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,420
Are you leaving?

432
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,100
- Are you hungry?
- No.

433
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,380
- Are you thirsty?
- No.

434
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
- Would you like some food?
- This...

435
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,140
- Are you hungry?
- Stop.

436
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,980
Are you...?

437
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,300
Lord Fang taught me.

438
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,140
I didn't.

439
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,180
I only taught her how to be a servant,

440
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,020
but she's a stiff.

441
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,620
You can learn the rules later.

442
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,700
But you don't look like a servant

443
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,580
in this outfit.

444
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,040
(Zhang's Clothing Store)

445
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,900
Tell me,

446
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,220
what should I wear?

447
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,140
This is our new arrival...

448
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
My Lord, come in.

449
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,220
You can look around.

450
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,420
Pick one for yourself.

451
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,940
My Lord?

452
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Little Patient.

453
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,180
Am I pretty?

454
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,900
Is it good?

455
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,420
