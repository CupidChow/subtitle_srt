=Episode 7=

3
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,500
(Lou's Mansion)

4
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,260
(He looks)

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,780
(quite handsome up close.)

6
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,620
(Isn't this Lord Chancellor's Token?)

7
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,370
(It's a rare opportunity.)

8
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,140
Master Lan, no wonder you're a gangster.

9
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,540
You're so wild.

10
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,100
My Lord...

11
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,460
You're awake.

12
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,620
My Lord,

13
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,780
if I tell you

14
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,260
this token

15
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,140
slipped into my hand,

16
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,460
will you believe me?

17
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,610
No.

18
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,460
My Lord!

19
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,100
Please show me Jiuxiang's file.

20
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,540
Please!

21
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,580
Remember to give it back.

22
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,380
Thanks, My Lord.

23
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,660
Well...

24
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,260
Did you

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,960
see anything?

26
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,020
Stars.

27
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Maybe something unusual?

28
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,380
No.

29
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,060
Did you?

30
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,020
Me...

31
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,860
Me neither.

32
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,060
I'm leaving.

33
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,260
Thanks, My Lord.

34
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,180
(Lou's Mansion)

35
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,700
My Lord.

36
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,380
The servants said

37
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,300
Lan Che went to the library

38
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,020
with your token last night.

39
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,860
Yes.

40
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,420
How did she get your token?

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,340
She wanted to read Jiuxiang's file,

42
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,460
so I gave it to her.

43
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,780
My Lord, you really did it?

44
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,820
Yes.

45
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,820
She'll find out everything!

46
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,220
All the people are under pseudonyms,

47
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,660
and I omitted the illegal drug case

48
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,620
of that year.

49
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,220
Even if she reads it,

50
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,620
she won't find out anything.

51
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,580
What's this?

52
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,100
The kitchen made herb soup for you,
My Lord.

53
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Pour it out.

54
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,260
I thought you didn't have
a sense of taste.

55
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,100
Wait.

56
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,140
Do you have plum candy?

57
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,460
Lan Che left this.

58
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,260
My Lord, I'm always defending you
in public,

59
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,540
but I don't know if I should say this.

60
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,700
Then don't.

61
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,260
My Lord, don't be a love-struck fool.

62
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,260
Get out.

63
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,460
(Huanxi Clinic)

64
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,300
Boss,

65
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,380
have you found anything important?

66
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,180
It says

67
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,580
Jiuxiang was adopted by Doctor Leng

68
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,260
when she was little.

69
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,660
When she was 15,
they were hunted by their enemies,

70
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
and she was sold to Huaisha Village.

71
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,100
In that case...

72
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,860
Boss, maybe you came from Liangzhou.

73
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,780
But Liangzhou was too big.

74
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,380
Where should we start?

75
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,740
Liangzhou is too far.

76
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
We should start with Huaisha Village.

77
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,220
Jiuxiang was sold

78
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,620
to Chen Zhisong there,

79
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,500
so I'm sure

80
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,180
we can find some information.

81
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,980
But it's been so many years.

82
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,460
Besides, Huaisha Village is also big.

83
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,420
I don't think

84
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,100
you'll find anything useful.

85
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,540
But how can we know

86
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,700
if we don't try?

87
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,740
Well, you've really grown up.

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,540
Master,

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
even if I figure out my real identity,

90
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,980
you'll always be my dear master.

91
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,540
Master!

92
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,980
But remember

93
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,540
to be careful.

94
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,500
Of course.

95
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
My Lord,

96
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,100
I've checked every staff's
household register,

97
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
but none of them come from Liangzhou.

98
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,900
Wu Ming wasn't the only pharmacist

99
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,130
who went missing back then.

100
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,100
Someone must be behind
my father's death.

101
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,380
Wu Ming was assassinated,

102
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,460
so it means someone knows
what we're up to.

103
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,980
I know what you're trying to say.

104
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,940
I promised Jiuxiang
to take care of Lan Che

105
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,340
and hide the past from her.

106
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,540
But what if Jiuxiang lied?

107
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,580
A dying person

108
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,580
has no reason to lie.

109
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,340
My Lord, you'd wanted

110
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,820
to hear the truth from Jiuxiang
in the first place.

111
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,980
Now Lan Che is trying to figure out
who she is,

112
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,500
but you're stopping it.

113
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,420
If her memory comes back one day,

114
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,540
what will you tell her, My Lord?

115
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,500
My Lord, are you there?

116
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,740
My Lord!

117
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,900
My Lord?

118
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,780
My Lord...

119
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,460
(Resilient as Pine, Elegant as Bamboo)

120
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,660
My Lord.

121
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,860
My Lord,

122
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,660
can I take some days off?

123
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,860
Why?

124
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,900
When I was reading the file,

125
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,140
I found she was sold to

126
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,260
Huaisha Village 7 years ago.

127
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,300
I'm wondering if I can
find some clues there.

128
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,380
Are you going alone?

129
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,700
With Dao and Luo.

130
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,940
It seems you know nothing

131
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,500
about Huaisha Village.

132
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,980
That place

133
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,780
is full of danger.

134
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,980
There are even
monsters and wild foxes.

135
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,700
You can get in,

136
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,140
but...

137
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,140
it's hard to come back.

138
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,980
Are you serious?

139
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,700
You must be kidding me.

140
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,060
Just do what you want.

141
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,300
However, I'm afraid from now on,

142
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,660
there won't be a gang

143
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,620
named Greater World anymore.

144
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,700
(Lou's Mansion)

145
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,780
I won.

146
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,580
It doesn't count.

147
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,740
It's the eighth round.

148
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,660
My Lord, why are you still cheating?

149
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
I'm good at the game of Go,

150
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,700
but Five in a Row...

151
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,980
You're being a child.

152
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,500
Don't make excuses.

153
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,580
My Lord.

154
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,540
My acting wasn't bad,

155
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,620
was I?

156
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,220
Not bad.

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,050
She seemed freaked out.

158
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,940
But why hasn't she come?

159
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,780
That's right.

160
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,460
Maybe we should call it a day.

161
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm exhausted. I want to go...

162
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,340
My Lord.

163
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,660
My Lord.

164
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,940
My Lord, you're a genius.

165
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,980
I can never defeat you.

166
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,580
Practice more.

167
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,220
(Five in a Row)

168
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,420
Well,

169
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
My Lord,

170
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,980
can you do me a favor?

171
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,860
Say it.

172
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,940
Well...

173
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,210
Can I

174
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,920
go to the village with Li Mo?

175
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,980
Lord Li?

176
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,740
He's been busy.

177
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,740
No time.

178
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
No time?

179
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
What should I do?

180
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,940
I guess someone

181
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,060
is right in front of me.

182
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,580
Brother Fang,

183
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,460
aren't you the best martial arts master?

184
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,200
Those monsters in Huaisha Village

185
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,220
must be a piece of cake.

186
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,200
The best martial arts master?

187
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,580
I'll always be Lord Lou's loyal servant

188
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,820
even when I'm dead.

189
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,420
I'll never leave him alone.

190
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,820
It's okay if you don't go,

191
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,100
but you don't have to talk about death.

192
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,300
My Lord,

193
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,140
I have you, right?

194
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,540
But as Lord Chancellor,

195
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,410
you must be very busy

196
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,540
and have no time, right?

197
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,260
We intended to investigate
human trafficking anyway.

198
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,500
Whether you go or not,

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,220
I'll go to the village.

200
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,340
What a coincidence!

201
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,540
Lord Fang?

202
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,660
Don't you think

203
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,770
it's a coincidence?

204
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,410
It is.

205
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,260
It's really

206
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,020
the biggest coincidence

207
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,300
I've ever seen.

208
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,860
(Huaisha Village)

209
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,620
My Lord, what would you like?

210
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,020
Your specialty would be fine.

211
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,700
Okay! Come in!

212
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,740
Please take a seat

213
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,780
and wait a minute.

214
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,340
My Lord.

215
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,450
Isn't it supposed to be
a dangerous place

216
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,900
without bandits and monsters?

217
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,500
Why are we here alone?

218
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,700
We're here for the case.

219
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,620
I don't want to alert them.

220
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,460
I see.

221
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,100
Here's your tea!

222
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,700
Dear guests, you're such

223
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,140
a great couple.

224
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,540
Our specialty Birds of a Feather

225
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,940
is perfect for you.

226
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,660
Here you go.

227
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,060
Birds of a feather,

228
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,820
their love will last forever.

229
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,820
Good name.

230
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,420
Tell me if you need anything.

231
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,220
Lou Mingye,

232
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,820
you took advantage of me.

233
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,300
When did I do that?

234
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,500
We're nothing like

235
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,940
birds of a feather.

236
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,300
What great couple?

237
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,180
I should be complaining.

238
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,500
Help!

239
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,660
Stop!

240
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,940
Don't run!

241
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,100
What's happening?

242
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,500
Don't run!

243
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,660
Stop!

244
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,820
The wedding is still on.

245
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,140
Where are you going?

246
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,740
Take her back!

247
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,180
Stay back!

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,380
Stay back,

249
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
or I'll kill myself!

250
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,060
It's not a big deal.

251
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,820
Why give up your life?

252
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,020
My Lord,

253
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,760
may I know your name?

254
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,060
It doesn't matter.

255
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,500
What matters

256
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,980
is that you want
to kidnap a woman in public.

257
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,660
Oh, no.

258
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,980
Please don't get us wrong.

259
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,780
This is our lord's legal wife.

260
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,940
No.

261
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,980
I was forced!

262
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,340
They want me to marry a dead guy!

263
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,700
Kidnapping and ghost marriage,

264
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,180
this is unacceptable.

265
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
Outsider,

266
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,980
you have no right

267
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,340
to mind our business.

268
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,860
Do you think we want this?

269
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,980
If you hadn't interrupted

270
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,620
my lord's tea time,

271
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,580
we'd never noticed you.

272
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,220
My son's wedding isn't finished.

273
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,540
It's our family affair.

274
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,020
We don't need your help.

275
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,100
Wait.

276
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,740
You can go,

277
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,460
but she'll stay.

278
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,660
My Lord, what do you mean?

279
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,820
Don't you understand?

280
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,020
My lord likes her.

281
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Idiot,

282
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,780
don't go too far!

283
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,900
Who are you?

284
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,700
Just a passerby.

285
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,620
So, you're

286
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,460
from the Tuoba Family in Liangzhou.

287
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,100
Sorry for the trouble.

288
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,240
My Lord, if you

289
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,500
really like this woman,

290
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,100
you can

291
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,500
take her back.

292
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,420
Let's go.

293
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,580
Lan Che.

294
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,580
Are you okay?

295
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,740
Come with us.

296
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,420
Dear guests.

297
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
I'm so sorry.

298
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,020
We're full.

299
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,860
Please leave.

300
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,860
There are many seats.

301
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,780
Do you think I'm blind?

302
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,700
Like I said, we're full.

303
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Just go!

304
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,340
You're rejecting us

305
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
because you're afraid of
the Huangs, right?

306
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,410
My Lord, since you get it,

307
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,940
please have mercy.

308
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,670
You'll only stay for a while,

309
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
but I need to do business here.

310
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,580
Sir,

311
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,620
do you own this inn?

312
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,620
Name a price.

313
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,620
I'll buy it.

314
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,980
My Lord, are you...?

315
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,500
Down payment.

316
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,580
Is it enough?

317
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,780
Of course.

318
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,380
Please come in.

319
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,660
- This way.
- Nailed it.

320
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,300
Let's go.

321
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,860
Come in.

322
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,100
This way, please.

323
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,860
Boss,

324
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,500
the rooms are ready.

325
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,200
My first name is Teng.

326
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,500
Just call me Teng.

327
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,580
Teng, you can leave.

328
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,700
Talk to you later.

329
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,860
Okay.

330
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,620
Lord Li, why are you here?

331
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,180
I'm here to protect Lan Che.

332
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,660
I'm here. She doesn't need you.

333
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,140
Anyway, I'm already here.

334
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,180
You can't get rid of me.

335
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm Huali. Thank you for saving me.

336
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Huali,

337
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
who tricked you here?

338
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,220
Chen Zhisong

339
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,260
from Shude School.

340
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,020
That old goat.

341
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,700
Karma is real.

342
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,060
Now he's dead.

343
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,580
You're not safe here.

344
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,060
You should leave.

345
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
Lan Che,

346
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,820
get her changed.

347
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,620
Okay.

348
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,300
Let's go.

349
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Lan Che,

350
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,740
I'll come in a minute.

351
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Make yourself at home.

352
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
Lan Che!

353
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,900
I'm waiting downstairs!

354
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:44,780
(Huaisha Village)

355
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,100
Okay.

356
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,140
You can go back.

357
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,420
Where do you live?

358
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,700
My parents died.

359
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm homeless now.

360
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,020
If you can't find a place,

361
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,140
go to Guiyi District, Changjing

362
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,780
to find Doctor Huanxi.

363
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,100
Tell him I asked you to come,

364
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,940
and he'll find a place for you.

365
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,100
Thank you.

366
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,180
Goodbye.

367
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,660
We did a good thing today.

368
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,180
Lord Lou told me you had a mission.

369
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,580
But you're more important.

370
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,340
Hurry.

371
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,980
We've arrived.

372
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,700
This is so beautiful.

373
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,740
I know, right?

374
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
I've heard

375
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,860
Lingxi Lake in Huaisha Village
has the best view.

376
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,380
I've always wanted

377
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,820
to see it with you.

378
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,260
So, it's called Lingxi Lake.

379
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,980
Lan Che.

380
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,300
I...

381
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,540
I want to tell you something.

382
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,100
Well...

383
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,620
I...

384
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,940
Who are you?

385
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,780
You're so hesitant and annoying.

386
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,700
You woke me.

387
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,780
Who the hell are you?

388
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,420
I don't know you.

389
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Outsiders,

390
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,660
get out of Huaisha Village.

391
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,340
You shouldn't have come.

392
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,910
What do you mean?

393
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,940
Listen to the elders. Have a meal...

394
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,620
and go home.

395
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,540
I have work to do.

396
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,900
Selling flowers...

397
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,020
I'm always selling flowers.

398
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,180
Bye.

399
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,620
I think he's drunk.

400
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,820
He's talking nonsense.

401
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,260
Just forget it.

402
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,610
What did you want to tell me?

403
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,980
Maybe later.

404
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,100
My Lord! I found something.

405
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,460
The bandit leader Tuoba Family

406
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,940
was eliminated in secret

407
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,220
half a month ago.

408
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,780
The Tuobas were eliminated?

409
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,460
Who did it?

410
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Lord Lou,

411
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,380
the living devil in Liangzhou.

412
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,220
Is the person we met today

413
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,980
a phony?

414
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,700
Even if he's the heir
of the Tuoba Family,

415
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,420
considering their current situation,

416
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,580
we don't need to be sacred.

417
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,660
He insulted me in public.

418
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,060
He must pay for this!

419
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,660
Ghost!

420
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,780
My Lord!

421
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,740
Wake up! My Lord!

422
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,820
My Lord!

423
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,180
Lan Che.

424
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,380
What happened?

425
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,260
I think...

426
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,940
I just saw a ghost!

427
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,180
I can't see it.

428
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,540
I really saw it.

429
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,060
It was right there,

430
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,900
staring at me.

431
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,460
Okay. Don't be afraid.

432
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,780
I think someone played a ghost.

433
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,780
Played a ghost?

434
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,420
Today,

435
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,620
we interrupted
Huang Fuxing's son's ghost marriage.

436
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,260
From what I know about the Huangs,

437
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,980
they won't just give up.

438
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,700
So, I think

439
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,580
they were trying to scare you.

440
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,780
He colluded with Chen Zhisong
to kidnap women.

441
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,180
Maybe we should act first.

442
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,700
Let's go to their house.

443
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,380
Now?

444
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,540
Should we call Lord Lou?

445
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,780
We'll tell him after we find something.

446
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,140
Living devil?

447
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,540
He's completely off guard.

448
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,580
Right?

449
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,530
Let's go.

450
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Stop, stop!

451
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,180
Stop!

452
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,460
What are you doing?

453
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,660
I've told you many times.

454
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,340
Don't water flowers at night.

455
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,620
Why can't you remember it?

456
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,140
- Isn't he
- Look at you.

457
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,920
- the drunk man by the lake?
- You won't get away next time.

458
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,540
My girl-seeking flowers

459
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,100
- I can't believe
- are very effective.

460
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,580
- they plant these flowers
- They can

461
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,830
for women trafficking.

462
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,080
make your dreams

463
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,870
- come true
- Let's check on

464
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,020
- and become rich.
- Huang Fuxing.

465
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,860
Okay.

466
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,220
Girl-seeking flowers,

467
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,460
more girls, more fortune.

468
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,100
Daping,

469
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,380
please bless our family.

470
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,020
Father...

471
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,980
Daping?

472
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,980
You said you'd find me a wife.

473
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,380
Where is my wife?

474
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
Daping, I'm so sorry!

475
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,980
I'll get a wife

476
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,660
or even steal a girl for you!

477
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,900
Daping!

478
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,500
Don't worry.

479
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,700
- Who
- As long as I'm here,

480
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,860
- is he talking to?
- I'll find you a wife.

481
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,020
- I don't think anyone else is here.
- Don't worry.

482
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,300
I agree.

483
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Daping, I'm so sorry!

484
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,740
I'm here.

485
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,940
- Who are you?
- We...

486
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,380
We're...

487
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,500
What a great show tonight.

488
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,620
Who are you?

489
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,110
What should we do?

490
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,420
- Split up.
- Split up.

491
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,300
Run!

492
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,780
Don't run!

493
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,820
Stop!

494
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,180
Over there!

495
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,380
- My Lord, is Li Mo going to be alright?
- Aye!

496
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,780
Why don't you help him?

497
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,180
My Lord,

498
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,660
considering my ability,
I'd better stay with you.

499
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,260
What's the noise?

500
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,180
My Lord,

501
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,020
some people sneaked in.

502
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,560
Who are they?

503
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,300
I've sent people to get them.

504
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,500
They looked like

505
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,300
the people we met on the street.

506
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,620
My Lord, don't worry.

507
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,970
Old Lady is in the room.

508
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,260
She's alright.

509
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,620
My Lord, don't be angry.

510
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,900
It's bad for your health.

511
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,930
Time to take the medicine.
