=Episode 11=

3
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,540
Here's the secret letter.

4
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
Okay.

5
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,700
(The poison is detoxified.)

6
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,540
The poison of oblivion flowers
is detoxified.

7
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,900
I knew

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,730
he wouldn't be that cruel.

9
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,860
(Xieshan Pavilion)

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,930
The general is going to report
to the court soon.

11
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,340
It's time to meet our old friend.

12
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,460
(Mingsha Inn)

13
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,840
Boss,

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
you'll take the carriage

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,460
with Lord Lou.

16
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,060
Don't miss the chance.

17
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,490
Good morning, My Lord.

18
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,210
It's late.

19
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,180
Let's set off now.

20
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,520
My Lord,

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,620
are we in the same carriage?

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,010
You're my servant.

23
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,100
Who else's carriage

24
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,850
do you want to take?

25
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,420
Of course

26
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,210
my carriage.

27
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,350
Lou Mingye,

28
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,010
you're the Lord Chancellor.

29
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,490
Why is your carriage so shabby?

30
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,440
If you have a problem,

31
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,650
why don't you rent it yourself?

32
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,260
Who says I didn't?

33
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,650
My Lord!

34
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,570
My Lord!

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,570
My Lord, I'm here!

36
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,000
This is the best carriage
in the village.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,700
I got it for you. Do you like it?

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Don't ask me.

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,210
Ask my boss.

40
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,470
This...

41
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,420
Whatever.

42
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,180
I don't want to share the seat anyway.

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,010
Boss, let's go.

44
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,770
What should I do?

45
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,150
Go!

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,910
My Lord, I'm...

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,490
Why are you here?

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,210
I'll follow you wherever you go.

49
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,140
That's my duty as a servant.

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,400
My Lord,

51
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,420
I'm here too.

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,020
Please don't mind.

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
Master,

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,490
aren't you supposed to be with Li Mo?

55
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,720
Li Mo

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,580
is so loud.

57
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,260
He makes my head ache.

58
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,600
My Lord,

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,350
you won't reject

60
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,820
an old man's request, will you?

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,370
I'll be right here.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,450
This is so nice.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,490
It's quiet.

64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,300
By the way, My Lord,

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,820
how are your eyes?

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,450
Thanks for your medicine.

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,890
I can see things

68
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,910
clearly

69
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,760
without an umbrella.

70
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,350
Good.

71
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,650
Keep taking the medicine, okay?

72
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,310
Snacks?

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,760
Lan Che is so silly.

74
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,740
She gave up this luxury ride

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,890
for Lou Mingye's shabby carriage.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,610
Maybe it's because Lord Lou is charming.

77
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,210
Can I eat them?

78
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,420
My back is going to fall apart
because of the bumps.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
My back...

80
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,490
I told you to do some exercise,

81
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,610
but you wouldn't.

82
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm just old

83
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,700
and feeble.

84
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,780
(Justice Department)

85
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,510
Brother Feng.

86
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,420
Don't worry.

87
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,100
The Huangs started it.

88
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,060
Lord Lou will be fair in the judgment.

89
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,890
I've fulfilled my wish.

90
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,770
It doesn't matter

91
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,060
how I'll end up.

92
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,060
Huang Gui once told me

93
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,540
you were looking for

94
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,940
a girl named Jiuxiang.

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,450
Do you know her?

96
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,130
I saw her seven years ago

97
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,420
when she was sold to the village.

98
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,650
I've never heard of her

99
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,620
since Baixue died.

100
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,130
Oh, but I do remember

101
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,940
she wore a tiger pendant.

102
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,380
It's engraved

103
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,810
with three flame patterns.

104
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,520
That's the special mark

105
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,860
of Liangzhou's local pharmacists.

106
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,560
Let's go.

107
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,210
Liangzhou's

108
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,770
local pharmacists?

109
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,940
You're finally back.

110
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,860
Chaozhi,

111
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,770
- I miss you.
- My Lord,

112
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,110
you're finally here.

113
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,770
King of Yan has been waiting for you.

114
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,450
What is he doing here?

115
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,210
I'm leaving.

116
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,650
Why are you leaving?

117
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,890
Isn't he your backer?

118
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,860
I have an emergency.

119
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,010
Goodbye.

120
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,980
Where are you going?

121
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,590
Your Highness.

122
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,770
Guess you found your way back.

123
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,740
You're here.

124
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,080
Father.

125
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,980
- Father?
- Father?

126
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,340
(Clear as Mirror)

127
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,400
We've solved Huaisha Village's case.

128
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,550
The murderer Feng Qing wanted
to avenge his wife.

129
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,690
He posed as a gardener

130
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,770
and worked with the butler Huang Gui

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,890
to kill Huang Fuxing and his mother.

132
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,590
He used the pollen of oblivion flowers

133
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,420
and created an illusion of a ghost.

134
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,710
I heard Huang Gui

135
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,640
and his mad sister

136
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,500
were killed on the way out.

137
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,380
What happened?

138
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,500
I believe

139
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,760
someone used Feng Qing
to scatter the pollen

140
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,690
in the village,

141
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,940
and Huang Gui might know something,

142
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
so...

143
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,770
they shut his mouth.

144
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,060
Know something?

145
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
What is it?

146
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,300
It's under investigation.

147
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,540
I won't ask more questions

148
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,570
until the case is solved.

149
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,060
As for you,

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,540
who told you to go to Huaisha Village?

151
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,150
It's because

152
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,310
when I was working on
Carefree Powder's case,

153
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,430
I found out Chen Zhisong

154
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,570
took many girls to Huaisha Village

155
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,110
and believed there was

156
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,200
a human trafficking network.

157
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
I wanted to check it out.

158
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,230
Then

159
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,420
tell me what you found.

160
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,010
At least I didn't make trouble.

161
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
I...

162
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
Your Highness,

163
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,210
the Huangs are the bullies
in the village.

164
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,770
They're monsters.

165
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,500
If it weren't for

166
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
Lord Li's help,

167
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,060
we wouldn't have

168
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,450
made it that far.

169
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,020
My Lord,

170
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,210
don't defend him.

171
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,280
I know

172
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,690
my son very well.

173
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,770
Stupid boy,

174
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,790
I tried so hard

175
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,570
to get you into the department

176
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,480
because I wanted you
to learn to behave yourself.

177
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,320
However, you didn't follow orders

178
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,380
and took action alone.

179
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,300
Today, I'm asking you
in front of Lord Lou.

180
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,130
Do you want this job or not?

181
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,040
If not, I'll take you home right now

182
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,120
and save trouble for them!

183
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,420
You're right.

184
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,400
At first, I didn't

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,030
take this job seriously.

186
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,890
I only wanted to have fun.

187
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,720
However, after Huaisha Village's case,

188
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,060
I've realized

189
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,920
there's so much injustice

190
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,570
and so many wronged people
in this world,

191
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,060
and I want to do my best
to help them.

192
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,770
I assure you

193
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,520
I'll work hard

194
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,540
and fulfill my duty.

195
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,060
I won't let you down again.

196
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,570
Please let me stay, Father.

197
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,640
I hope you can remember

198
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,810
your promise.

199
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,650
Don't let me down.

200
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,010
I shouldn't have spoiled him.

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,250
It's time

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,420
to ask someone to keep an eye on you.

203
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Okay.

204
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,650
Hey, Li Mo,

205
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,570
I thought we were friends.

206
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,060
How could you lie to me?

207
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

208
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
By the way,

209
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
where is

210
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,630
the girl

211
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,470
named Huali?

212
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,100
We dropped her off on the way.

213
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,980
She went to Huaisha Village
to find her relatives

214
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,250
but got into a ghost marriage
and almost died.

215
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,540
I'm worried about her.

216
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
You should

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
care more

218
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,070
about yourself.

219
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,500
Come on, let's eat.

220
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,980
Lan Che.

221
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,620
You're having dinner.

222
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,130
Isn't this

223
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,010
the heir of King of Yan?

224
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,690
Our little store

225
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,130
doesn't deserve to have you, My Lord.

226
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,320
Please leave.

227
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,120
My Lord, why did you

228
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,980
suddenly come?

229
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,650
I'm here to apologize.

230
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,270
Sorry,

231
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,100
I didn't mean to lie.

232
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,910
It's okay.

233
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,740
We

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,500
wouldn't dare to be angry at
the heir of the king.

235
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,130
Don't call me an heir.

236
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
When I'm with you,

237
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,650
I'm always Li Mo.

238
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,270
Okay.

239
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,590
Li Mo,

240
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,910
tell me,

241
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,960
did you take us for friends?

242
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,860
Of course.

243
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,330
But friends should be honest
with each other.

244
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,810
Why did you lie to us?

245
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,940
I didn't mean to.

246
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,420
I knew you didn't like officials,

247
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,770
so I lied at that point.

248
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,430
If we didn't meet your father today,

249
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,060
would you keep lying to us?

250
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm so sorry.

251
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,910
I swear,

252
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,540
if I lied on purpose,

253
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,350
I'd never get married

254
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,450
or have children.

255
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,130
I can't be responsible

256
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,250
for ruining your family's blood.

257
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,770
Lan Che,

258
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,540
don't be angry.

259
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,210
Anyway,

260
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,440
everyone is equal

261
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,890
in Greater World.

262
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,910
You're the heir of King of Yan,

263
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,370
- but you still
- My Lord, here.

264
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,040
have to finish your work.

265
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,880
Okay.

266
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,130
No problem.

267
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,740
That's more like it.

268
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Okay.

269
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,810
Get yourself chopsticks

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
and join us.

271
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,690
Look at them.

272
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,920
My Lord,

273
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,380
I'll make another dish for you.

274
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,860
My Lord, try this. Come on.

275
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,380
My Lord, have a drink.

276
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,480
My Lord.

277
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,330
I didn't expect you

278
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,860
to see me off.

279
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,450
She wanted to come.

280
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,270
Brother Feng.

281
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,450
I prepared some wine.

282
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,290
Drink it on the way.

283
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,360
Good wine.

284
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,020
Girl, you know me the best.

285
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,450
With this,

286
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,260
even if I die halfway,

287
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,320
it'll be worth it.

288
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,980
Brother Feng, don't say that.

289
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,930
You have to live.

290
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,290
Live for Lady Fang.

291
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,480
My Lord, time is up.

292
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,530
We should set off.

293
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
Girl,

294
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,810
If I can

295
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,450
see you again in this life,

296
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,780
I'll definitely

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,210
have a great meal with you.

298
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,690
We will.

299
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
Let's go.

300
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,840
Let's go.

301
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,560
My Lord,

302
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,450
are we really going to
exile him to Shanyin Pavilion?

303
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,870
What's wrong?

304
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,660
When we were in danger
at Huang Daping's grave,

305
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,140
he saved us.

306
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,100
He's a good man.

307
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,410
But after all, he's a murderer.

308
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,620
He has to pay the price.

309
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,990
Besides, he should've

310
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,330
been sentenced to death.

311
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,100
I had mercy on him

312
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,380
and only sentenced him to exile.

313
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,570
Are you going to rescue Feng Qing?

314
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,260
Shanyin Pavilion is on an island.

315
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,640
The climate is harsh,

316
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,760
and it's full of

317
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,100
evil criminals.

318
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,830
I'd rather die

319
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,290
than go to that place.

320
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,810
But it's a felony.

321
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,110
Why if they catch you?

322
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,950
It's okay.

323
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm the heir of King of Yan.

324
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,020
They wouldn't dare to hurt me.

325
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,130
By the way,

326
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,050
I've invited my godfather
to the banquet tomorrow.

327
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,500
Don't mess it up.

328
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,170
So soon?

329
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,170
What so soon?

330
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,960
Nothing.

331
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,800
My Lord,

332
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,740
Lord Li is following Feng Qing.

333
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,230
I've sent someone.

334
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,260
Don't worry.

335
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,930
Ensure their safety.

336
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,530
They already killed Huang Gui,

337
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,690
so they won't let Feng Qing get away.

338
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,860
I sentenced him to exile

339
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,050
only to lure the person
behind the scenes.

340
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,810
Keep them alive.

341
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,980
My Lord, don't worry.

342
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,050
We won't make mistakes this time.

343
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,450
By the way, the post station
has got the information

344
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,860
the governor is only
ten miles outside the city.

345
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,530
They'll arrive tomorrow.

346
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,230
By the way,

347
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,980
if General Huo asks about Lan Che,

348
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,140
what should I say?

349
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,630
Anyway,

350
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,100
keep the secret for now.

351
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,480
Okay.

352
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,660
What's happening?

353
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,660
It's crowded.

354
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
I've never seen

355
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,570
a big scene like this.

356
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,710
Lan Che.

357
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,020
Give me a hand.

358
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,960
Lan Che.

359
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,600
You

360
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,410
became Lou Mingye's servant

361
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,410
for Jiuxiang's file.

362
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,240
Well,

363
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,390
you saw the file

364
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,930
and went to Huaisha Village.

365
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,690
Can you

366
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,660
quit this job?

367
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,900
Master,

368
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,690
didn't you often criticize me
for being so lazy?

369
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,200
Look,

370
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,690
now I have a well-paid job.

371
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,410
You should be happy for me.

372
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,640
We don't need that money.

373
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,480
Besides,

374
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,380
even if you don't have a job,

375
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,400
I can still feed you well,

376
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,240
right?

377
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,140
Master,

378
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,020
I just want to make money
and pay you back.

379
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,170
Is that what you really want?

380
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,020
You just want to stay with Lou Mingye.

381
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,210
Lord Lou...

382
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,880
He's strong

383
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,860
and capable.

384
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,800
I can learn a lot and broaden

385
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,860
my horizons.

386
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,740
How can I find

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,900
a better boss?

388
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,990
Do you...

389
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,780
really like him?

390
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,050
I just think he's a nice guy.

391
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,410
Then do you know his feelings for you?

392
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:20,990
What if

393
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,740
he doesn't like you?

394
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,170
What will you do?

395
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,710
Why did you

396
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,050
refuse to take medicine?

397
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,930
I took so much medicine

398
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,330
that I couldn't forget

399
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,450
the bitterness.

400
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,390
However,

401
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,530
this is so sweet.

402
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,860
(Lou's Mansion)

403
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,720
Mingye,

404
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,000
the last time we had a meal together

405
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,980
was on your father's memorial.

406
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,780
How time flies.

407
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,100
My father died early.

408
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,000
I've always kept in mind

409
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,380
how you've raised me.

410
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,020
Since I took office as the governor,

411
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,900
I've been so busy.

412
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,860
You've come so far by yourself.

413
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,860
If General Lou were here,

414
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,140
he'd be so happy

415
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,810
to see you like this.

416
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,600
Come on.

417
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,750
Here's

418
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,260
to Brother Lou.

419
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,500
What's your name?

420
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,110
General,

421
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,260
I'm Lan Che.

422
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,810
Lan Che?

423
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,600
Good.

424
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,690
Good name.

425
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,290
Smart and pretty,

426
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,500
it suits you well.

427
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,810
Thanks, General.

428
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,450
I took her as a servant
after I got here.

429
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,050
She's smart

430
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,140
but often makes trouble.

431
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,910
Really?

432
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,140
But I think she's a good girl.

433
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,530
She's outgoing and graceful.

434
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
She's as good as the girls

435
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,450
in Liangzhou.

436
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,270
General.

437
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,740
I've heard a lot about you.

438
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,680
Since the girl

439
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,260
Leng Qingyao left,

440
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,680
Mingye has never been

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,410
so close to anyone else.

442
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,930
Seeing you in person,

443
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,900
I found you

444
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,660
quite similar to her.

445
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,480
Mingye refused to take medicine
when he was a kid,

446
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,930
and no one could persuade him.

447
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,620
However, Qingyao could always

448
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,900
magically get him to take it.

449
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,050
How time flies.

450
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,410
It's been ten years.

451
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,500
Unfortunately...

452
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,840
Lan Che,

453
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,410
get the soup.

454
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,740
My godfather has stayed in Liangzhou.

455
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,620
Remember to add some pepper.

456
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,230
Okay.

457
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,140
He needed to be persuaded
to take medicine.

458
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,140
No wonder she left you.

459
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,500
My Lord.

460
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:50,990
Here you are.

461
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,960
Mingye,

462
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
have you suffered a lot

463
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,900
during this time?

464
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,360
No.

465
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,810
But you shed tears

466
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,570
when you had Liangzhou's soup.

467
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,660
Are you homesick?

468
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,500
It's so hot.

469
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,230
Waiter.

470
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,430
- My Lord.
- Tea, please.

471
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,740
This way, please.

472
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,600
Have a seat.

473
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,930
It's our new arrival.

474
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,440
Drink.

475
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,880
It's only been a while.

476
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,290
What a long trip.

477
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,140
My Lord.

478
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,170
Home-grown pears,

479
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,830
big, crunchy, and sweet.

480
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,050
- Go away.
- Go away.

481
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,740
Why don't you

482
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,620
try it first?

483
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,750
Try?

484
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,080
Okay then.

485
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,600
It's sweet.

486
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,910
I know, right?

487
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,470
My Lord, you...

488
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,330
I'm here to save you.

489
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,330
You don't have to do this!

490
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,840
This...

491
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,170
- Let's go.
- My Lord,

492
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,530
what are you doing?
