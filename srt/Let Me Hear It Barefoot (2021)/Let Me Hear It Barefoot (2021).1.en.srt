<i>We'll pick up any unwanted items.</i>

00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,930
<i>Such as TVs, computers,
washing machines, fridges...</i>

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,190
- Hi.
- Hey.

13
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,160
- It's so loud.
- I know.

14
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,260
It's an old car. I don't
know how to stop it.

15
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,090
- Are you coming tonight?
- Yes.

16
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,460
See you later.

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:32,500
LET ME HEAR IT BAREFOOT

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm back.

19
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,130
Hi.

20
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,390
- Hi there.
- Hi.

21
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,090
I'm glad she left the hospital.

22
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,590
I was shocked when I heard it.

23
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,030
She has more tests to do.

24
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,030
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

25
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,430
Please tell your mother to take care.

26
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,130
I will.

27
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,130
- Sir...
- Huh?

28
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,260
I'll pay you back.

29
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,460
There's no need to rush,
don't worry too much.

30
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,630
- Naomi.
- Huh?

31
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,130
I'm off to the bank.

32
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,830
See you later.

33
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,090
- Kurihara.
- Yes?

34
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,260
If you're in need,
come and eat at my place anytime.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,090
Thank you so much.

36
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,860
- Here.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,690
The green one's mine.

38
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,390
- Which one?
- This.

39
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,590
- Cheers to us.
- Cheers.

40
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,690
Cheers.

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,760
So he was like this on the highway.

42
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,590
She didn't wanna switch driving.

43
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,330
It was after work.

44
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,130
How's college?

45
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,030
I'm waiting to graduate.

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,730
I thought you'd repeat again.

47
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,730
I can't waste two years.

48
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,560
You still don't have a job.

49
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,460
I'm taking it slow.

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,590
It'll work out somehow.

51
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,760
Maybe.

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,360
- Where are you gonna live?
- In Toronto.

53
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,760
Awesome, I wanna go there too.

54
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,590
Come, I'll be your guide.

55
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,730
- Really?
- Sure.

56
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,360
- Let's go to Canada.
- I'm in.

57
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,390
Let's do it.

58
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,190
When will we see each other again?

59
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,960
Where are we going?

60
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,730
Hmm... I wanna go to a beach.

61
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,560
- That's fun.
- It's cold.

62
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,330
It's her last chance.

63
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,760
- You love swimming too.
- Don't tease me.

64
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,890
What was your best record?

65
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,330
The crawl, 15 meters.

66
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,760
That's not much.

67
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,130
You just kicked the wall.

68
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,560
I'll swim.

69
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,560
You said it.

70
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,590
- You better swim.
- I will.

71
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,890
- You're the same.
- Why?

72
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,590
- I can swim good-long 25 meters.
- Only 25 meters.

73
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,630
The crawl is hard,
I can do a dog paddle.

74
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,860
I'm home.

75
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,890
You're pretty late.

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Sorry, I had dinner.

77
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,060
What?

78
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,360
Sakuko's leaving soon,
so we got together.

79
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,460
- You ate already?
- Yes.

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,760
I see.

81
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,960
Sorry, I'll eat.

82
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,730
- Thank you.
- Don't bother.

83
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,590
I'll have it.

84
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,860
I guess you could've said something.

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,560
As you know I'm preparing it for you.

86
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,130
Huh?

87
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,930
Am I wrong?

88
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,190
No, I'm sorry.

89
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,760
Thanks.

90
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,190
The backstroke is easier.

91
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,430
Huh?

92
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,060
- Sorry, I have so many.
- Not at all.

93
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,130
- That's it for today.
- Okay.

94
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,430
That was my dad's hobby.

95
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,330
I see.

96
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,930
You can't touch it.

97
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,390
That's Hiroyuki's.

98
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,630
You must ask him first.

99
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,430
I told you that I'm cleaning
out Dad's belongings.

100
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,130
What?

101
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,890
Why?

102
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,030
Oh, I have to water my flowers.

103
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,390
You just did that.

104
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,060
Are you sure?

105
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,460
They're no use here.

106
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,160
Okay.

107
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,890
Thank you.

108
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,830
Maki?

109
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
Maki!

110
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,530
Don't worry, Midori. I'm here.

111
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,390
Oh!

112
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,130
The bad swimmer.

113
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,560
Follow the road.

114
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,890
Okay.

115
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm sorry, you're so kind.

116
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
No problem.

117
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,390
Why do you have so many?

118
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,890
I collected them for work today,

119
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,390
- But I'm keeping them.
- Hmm.

120
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,190
- It's a record.
- Okay.

121
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,530
The Turtles, "Happy Together."

122
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,330
Leonardo Va... Ve?

123
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,230
- "Salvation Daughters."
- Ah!

124
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,860
What was it? I've heard of it.

125
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,890
You do?

126
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,060
I've heard of it, too.

127
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,530
That was a theme song of a film.

128
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,830
Film...

129
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,430
The one they visit Iguazu Falls?

130
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,730
Yes, that's it.

131
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,560
Which one is that?

132
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,060
There's a film that they visit
South America.

133
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,930
This was the theme song.

134
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,390
I see.

135
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,230
- You've been to that Falls.
- Yes

136
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,260
- She's traveled around the world.
- How cool.

137
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,030
Iguazu Falls were amazing.

138
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,690
Falls are loud, you can't
even hear your voice.

139
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,860
And you get completely
wet by the spray.

140
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,460
I can imagine.

141
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,530
You can borrow it.

142
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

143
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,190
- Thank you.
- Sure.

144
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,030
It was in summer
but it was still so cold.

145
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,190
But I wanted to see the aurora badly.

146
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,530
- So I stayed up late.
- How fun.

147
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,460
Where was it?

148
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,960
Something-banks...

149
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,460
Fairbanks.

150
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,930
That's it.

151
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,190
- Yes.
- You fought off sleepiness, right?

152
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,090
Exactly, it finally came out
around three in the morning.

153
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,460
But it was so hard to stay awake.

154
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,330
But...

155
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,590
It was surely beautiful.

156
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,590
It's a good memory.

157
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,860
Yes.

158
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,460
I wish I could go there again.

159
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,260
The crawl is tiring.

160
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,060
I know.

161
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,390
Maki is a nice name.

162
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,060
Naomi is, too.

163
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,460
It's rare to call your grandma
by first name.

164
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,630
She adopted me.

165
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,830
Really?

166
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,230
Yeah.

167
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,090
She goes off often and I
usually find her at the bus stop.

168
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,690
- No buses come and go anymore.
- Hmm.

169
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,190
It still works.

170
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,690
- What is it?
- A recorder.

171
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
I see.

172
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,930
- Looks good.
- You can't have it.

173
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I better go, thanks.

174
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,190
See you again.

175
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,360
I can't do the backstroke.

176
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,630
He's cheating.

177
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,830
He's using the swim ring.

178
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,630
He's only floating.

179
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,090
He can't swim after all.

180
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,390
What are you making?

181
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,330
The Castle of Cagliostro.

182
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,030
That sounds familiar.

183
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,960
We made it the night
before our graduation.

184
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,460
Oh, that one.

185
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,460
Yano got sick on the day.

186
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,830
- It was me.
- Was it?

187
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,260
Anyway, I'm glad
everything worked out for you.

188
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,330
Are you missing me already?

189
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,690
Keep writing songs,
I'd love to hear more.

190
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,360
We'll see.

191
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,630
I kind of liked your song
at the school festival.

192
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,390
You remember that?

193
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,930
Yours was the best.

194
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,390
It was a cover song of
"Salvation Daughters."

195
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,390
Huh?

196
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,030
It's such an old song.
It was hard to find, the original copy.

197
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,060
Good.

198
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,760
- Let's make a tunnel.
- Okay.

199
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,730
I don't see you.

200
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,390
I don't see you either.

201
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,360
It's no good.

202
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,330
Hey.

203
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,060
Yes?

204
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,430
- I may have the record.
- For real?

205
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,030
You can have it.

206
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,890
It was a cool song.

207
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,060
Huh?

208
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,230
The record.

209
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,630
Oh.

210
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,690
Huh?

211
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,630
Midori.

212
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,230
You hear me?

213
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,890
To tell you the truth,

214
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,830
I've never left this country.

215
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,960
There was a person who told me
those stories in the past.

216
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,060
So I lied.

217
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,430
I'm sorry for lying all these years.

218
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,960
No worries.

219
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,360
Listen.

220
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,690
There's a jacket in the stuff
you brought me.

221
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,730
Can you check the inner pocket?

222
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,590
Your jacket?

223
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,460
I found something.

224
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,030
It's a bankbook, isn't it?

225
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,760
Yes.

226
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,260
I was saving when I was young
but I didn't use it after all.

227
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,590
If I remember correctly,
there are two million yen.

228
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,530
Come closer.

229
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,230
Use this...

230
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,960
to see the whole world for me?

231
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,530
When you have time.

232
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,500
Then, when you come home

233
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:35,960
if I'm still alive,
tell me how things were.

234
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,630
Go anywhere you like.

235
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,530
I wanna hear your stories.

236
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,760
How is she?

237
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,830
She was in bad shape.

238
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,430
But she got better.

239
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,760
I'm glad.

240
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,530
Hey.

241
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,230
Can I borrow your recorder?

242
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,660
Mr. Takahashi is going to sail his ship.

243
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,460
- He invited you.
- Wow.

244
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,360
- Really?
- Yes.

245
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,260
- I'm so excited.
- I bet.

246
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,990
What was it?

247
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,990
Um... a sort of like a school event?

248
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,360
Maybe a birthday party.

249
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,930
When you were asked
your dream, you answered

250
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,590
- "I wanna become Dad's ship."
- I was in preschool.

251
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,160
You told me already.

252
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,060
What?

253
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,030
- Did I?
- Yes, many times.

254
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,830
Everyone was laughing.

255
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,430
But it almost made me cry.

256
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,090
- Hey Dad.
- Huh?

257
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,160
- I've been thinking.
- Yes?

258
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,460
- I'm leaving...
- I got something!

259
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,460
What's this?

260
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,760
It's huge.

261
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,090
Sorry, you were saying?

262
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,030
No, it's nothing.

263
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,260
What is it?

264
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,590
Can you take it off?

265
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,090
It's all tangled up.

266
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,730
It won't come off.

267
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,130
<i>Um... can you hear me, Midori?</i>

268
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,460
<i>I'm in Taiwan now.</i>

269
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,160
<i>The local time is nine twenty at night.</i>

270
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,790
<i>It's noisy here.</i>

271
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,990
<i>I'm at Raohe Night Market,
the one you told me.</i>

272
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,490
<i>People are fighting.</i>

273
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,530
<i>Geez.</i>

274
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,990
<i>I'll send you another one
once I get to the next country.</i>

275
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,960
<i>I'll see the whole world for you.</i>

276
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,630
He's gone to see the world.

277
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,430
Instead of me.

278
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,360
He went for real.

279
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,130
I can't stop listening.

280
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,960
This will be it.

281
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,130
- Electric guitar?
- Yes.

282
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,090
- You're not taking it?
- Huh?

283
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,860
The guitar.

284
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,530
I couldn't sell it
because it's way used up.

285
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,290
I see.

286
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,630
What time is your flight?

287
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,630
- Seven in the morning.
- So early.

288
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,660
Thanks.

289
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,590
I'm okay, you can go now.

290
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,860
See you tomorrow.

291
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,630
I'll bring the record.

292
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,960
Don't forget.

293
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,960
Why are you here?

294
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,260
You're not in Taiwan?

295
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,790
Why?

296
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,260
I visited Midori and heard your tape.

297
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,860
What are you doing?

298
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,030
Sahara Desert.

299
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,630
Huh?

300
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,930
Do you feel the desert?

301
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,360
It means you didn't go?

302
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,430
It's the only way.

303
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,960
Give it to me.

304
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,590
Um... do you hear me, Midori?

305
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,260
I came to the Sahara Desert in Morocco.

306
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,930
I'm walking in the desert.

307
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,360
The sands feel great to walk on.

308
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,530
The sun just came out.

309
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,290
The dune is filled with light.

310
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,130
A troop of camels is
marching in the distance.

311
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:03,030
<i>I'm about to reach the oasis.</i>

312
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,330
<i>I can't see it at all.</i>

313
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,830
<i>But I'm sure I'm almost there.</i>

314
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,330
<i>I'll send you one
from the next destination.</i>

315
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,330
<i>Please wait for it.</i>

316
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,860
Will you check on her? You
don't need to go every day.

317
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,230
I have a favor to ask you, too.

318
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,530
Eh?

319
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,260
Too slow.

320
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,260
Look!

321
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,130
It's big.

322
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,430
Wow.

323
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,660
- You live here?
- My shelter.

324
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,030
Eh?

325
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,460
It used to be a warehouse of my dad's.

326
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,260
Hmm.

327
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,230
- It doesn't work anymore.
- I know.

328
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,290
You watched all?

329
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,560
No, not all.

330
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,560
You know you can rent films?

331
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,830
I like to own them.

332
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,090
Hmm.

333
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,460
Is that so?

334
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,630
They're safe here even
they're gone from the world.

335
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,960
That won't happen.

336
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,630
We never know.

337
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,430
This obsession makes me collect things.

338
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,130
Memories will stay.

339
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,930
That's not good enough.

340
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,790
It's useless if it's not here.

341
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,160
That's the beauty.

342
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,830
Hmm...

343
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,330
I only trust what I can touch.

344
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,090
I see.

345
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,660
I found it!

346
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,590
Why did you pull it out?

347
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,590
Let's go to the Blue Grotto.

348
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:08,390
Um... can you hear me, Midori?

349
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:15,560
I'm in Capri now.

350
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,330
I'm on the boat...

351
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,030
inside of the Blue Grotto.

352
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,530
The Grotto echoes.

353
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,090
You ready?

354
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,030
You heard it?

355
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,230
Wait!

356
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,930
Hey.

357
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,660
Do the backstroke.

358
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,960
No, I won't.

359
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:36,390
If you do like this, you only
hear the sound of water.

360
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,260
I love it so much.

361
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,030
How would the real one look like?

362
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,260
I bet it's small.

363
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,230
I have claustrophobia.

364
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

365
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,560
I can't stand caves.

366
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:15,030
My ex told me to conquer it.

367
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,960
Yeah?

368
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,590
She dragged me to caves.

369
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,160
Wow.

370
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,130
She dumped me afterward.

371
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,130
That's great though.

372
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,160
Nothing is great.

373
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,930
I couldn't overcome it.

374
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:56,830
How does it feel to have
someone whom you can hold?

375
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,830
What do you mean?

376
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,800
How do people manage to attract others?

377
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,890
What?

378
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,830
I feel a magnetic field around me.

379
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,330
People are within my reach

380
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,730
but I could never touch them.

381
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,060
Why?

382
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,060
Huh?

383
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,630
I feel the same.

384
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,630
You're swimming again?

385
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,390
- Nope.
- Then why the goggles?

386
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,290
I get to cry secretly.

387
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,460
That's dumb.

388
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,960
Wait up.

389
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,030
What?

390
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,290
What's there?

391
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,460
That's awesome!

392
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,790
"The Iguazu Falls."

393
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,060
- Wow, it's so cool!
- Isn't it?

394
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,330
I'm excited.

395
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,260
Midori.

396
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,160
Can you hear me?

397
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,690
I came to see the Iguazu Falls.

398
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,030
This is incredible.

399
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,330
It's just like how you described.

400
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,830
You feel it?

401
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,060
I'm covered with waterfall spray.

402
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,730
There.

403
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,730
I can touch it if I reach out.

404
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,590
This is cool.

405
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,660
I'm loving it.

406
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,630
Ouch.

407
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,290
Let's go back.

408
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,460
There's so much noise.

409
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,160
Eh?

410
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,330
Why?

411
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,230
Wind?

412
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,130
Or the microphone?

413
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,530
Oh, you have a tattoo?

414
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,030
Huh?

415
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,130
I can see numbers on your shoulder.

416
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,430
What does it say?

417
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,630
I've forgotten.

418
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:48,790
Okay.

419
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,660
- Don't answer it.
- Eh?

420
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,760
Sit down.

421
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:42,490
<i>Hello, this is Sugo.
I'm calling for Mr. Ari.</i>

422
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,360
<i>I called you regarding your payment
in June. Please call me back when...</i>

423
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,430
Where do you guys go every day?

424
00:54:59,130 --> 00:54:59,990
What?

425
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,660
I know you're ditching work.

426
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,130
- Sorry.
- I didn't ask that.

427
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,260
I'm asking where you go.

428
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,260
Hello.

429
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,230
Oh, who is this?

430
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:04,130
My bad. I can't remember
things these days.

431
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:12,260
I guess it was here somewhere.

432
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,930
- Where's your son?
- Eight, four...

433
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,060
- Naomi?
- Yes.

434
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,030
- What the heck are you doing?
- Huh?

435
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:43,730
- We kept it here, right?
- Move away, let me close it.

436
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,760
Life is tough, huh?

437
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,090
Geez.

438
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,730
Come on.

439
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,760
Stop that!

440
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:05,090
Hinata, Karin, wait!

441
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,030
I said, wait.

442
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,660
It's bad what you did.

443
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,060
How is it?

444
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,030
Not bad.

445
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:19,560
Um... I'm in Canada now.

446
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,560
I came to see prairies.

447
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:29,230
I'm sneaking into a wheat field.

448
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,830
It's beautiful.

449
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:39,230
The prairies are endless
and looks like a huge golden carpet.

450
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:47,630
Whoa, it scared me.
I see a big bird flying.

451
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:01,330
Another one's here!
There are so many actually.

452
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:34,890
Um... it's three in the morning.

453
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,030
I'm in Alaska now.

454
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,090
My ears hurt so much.

455
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:54,090
It's minus 20 degrees Celcius here.

456
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,790
Whoa, listen!

457
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,430
Aurora!

458
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,530
You're heavy.

459
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,430
Heavy, I said.

460
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,560
She can leave here soon.

461
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,730
Hey.

462
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:10,830
Huh?

463
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,230
Look.

464
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,260
It's swollen.

465
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,430
It's fine.

466
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,660
Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

467
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,330
I don't mind.

468
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,760
You know Midori has...

469
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,660
Huh?

470
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,990
A tattoo. On her shoulder.

471
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,430
Yeah.

472
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:06,890
She got it young.
She won't tell me much more.

473
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,760
I think they're coordinates.

474
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:14,360
Coordinates?

475
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,190
Around here.

476
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,330
Where's that?

477
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,530
Antelope Canyon?

478
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,730
I think.

479
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,960
Oh...

480
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:42,860
I had no idea.

481
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,230
It's called a "beam."

482
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,260
Huh?

483
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,390
That light.

484
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,860
A beam of sunlight enters the canyon.

485
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,560
Like a spotlight.

486
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,230
Cool.

487
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:03,960
What does it mean to her?

488
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,530
I don't know.

489
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,260
Hey.

490
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,130
Yeah?

491
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,360
We can take her there, for real.

492
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,630
Maki.

493
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,360
Look.

494
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,560
Hmm?

495
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,130
It's Antelope Canyon.

496
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:42,530
Midori.

497
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:48,760
I arrived in America two days ago.

498
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,330
Guess what?

499
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,060
I'm at...

500
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,230
Antelope Canyon.

501
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,690
The sun is about to enter.

502
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:12,960
Listen.

503
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,890
Maybe you can feel it.

504
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,890
Now.

505
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,330
It's here.

506
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,190
It's lighting up my hand.

507
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,330
The light of Antelope Canyon.

508
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,930
Thank you for picking me up.

509
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,390
Glad you're better.

510
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:23,860
Maki sent you another tape.

511
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,030
Antelope Canyon.

512
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:33,030
No! Seriously?

513
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:34,730
I guess.

514
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:44,330
He really did it.
He went to America.

515
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,960
Your tattoo.

516
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,330
It's Antelope Canyon, right?

517
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,860
What?

518
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,090
Why, there?

519
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,860
Oh! Don't remind me.

520
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:15,060
Antelope Canyon...

521
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,630
I loved that place.

522
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,230
Not that I've been there.

523
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,000
He...

524
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,060
He was like a talking encyclopedia.

525
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:44,390
I loved how his eyes smiled
when he talked.

526
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,960
He'd never even been abroad.

527
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:54,560
"There's so much to see in this world!"

528
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:58,060
He never stopped talking.

529
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,630
So...

530
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,930
Even though I never traveled,

531
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:11,690
it stuck in my mind.

532
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,060
One day...

533
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,960
we'd go together.

534
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,590
We had said so.

535
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,260
But he left without a trace.

536
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,030
Still...

537
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,930
We'd promised.

538
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:47,960
We made a promise.

539
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,360
So I didn't want to forget.

540
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,730
Enough! It was a long time ago.

541
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,960
Come on. Drive me!

542
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,760
We still can.

543
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,560
Can what?

544
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,690
We can make it.

545
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:23,960
Huh?

546
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,090
I'll take you there.

547
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,930
Let's go there with Maki.

548
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,360
Hi.

549
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,730
Fishing with Mr. Takahashi.

550
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,230
Why didn't you come?

551
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,490
Sorry.

552
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,230
You didn't even call.

553
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,960
- I need to talk to you.
- Now is not the time!

554
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,630
- Why...
- I'm moving out.

555
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,790
Going abroad.

556
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,460
Huh?

557
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,190
And...

558
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,930
I may not come back here.

559
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:04,360
Wait a minute.

560
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,990
What's up?

561
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,860
What are you going to do for money?

562
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,960
I'll be fine. I saved up.

563
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:19,190
What?

564
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,960
I have enough to live for a few months.

565
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,160
You decided on your own again.

566
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,930
Why didn't you tell me?
We're family.

567
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,790
Are you going to quit work?

568
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,330
- Like you quit uni...
- I'm sorry!

569
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:54,930
- It needs to be now.
- That's your problem!

570
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:56,990
You promised me.

571
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:04,960
You promised not to quit again.
Does that mean nothing to you?

572
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:08,830
Promise...

573
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,160
- Huh? Am I wrong?
- No.

574
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,690
- See?
- Of course.

575
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,560
You're always right.

576
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:23,430
You've never doubted yourself.

577
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:25,730
Not once.

578
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,060
What?

579
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,190
By the way, I hate fishing.

580
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,230
Hey.

581
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:34,230
I'm walking on a beach.

582
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:38,160
No, no, no, no.
It sounds nothing like a beach.

583
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,930
Breadcrumbs suck.

584
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,530
They work.

585
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,190
No, they don't.

586
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,460
They do.
Let me show you.

587
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:01,790
You see?

588
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,430
You have to step into it more.

589
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,990
Do it barefoot.

590
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,230
- No point.
- Just do it.

591
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,360
Let me hear it barefoot.

592
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:29,660
I just arrived at a Caribbean Island.

593
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,230
There's a beach by the airport.

594
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:38,560
I'm walking on it right now.

595
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,130
I didn't know the sea could be so blue.

596
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,490
Had no idea.

597
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:00,960
Whoa! A jumbo jet!

598
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,190
Damn!

599
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,490
Sorry. We need to start over.

600
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:31,830
Stop!

601
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,030
Sorry.

602
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,360
<i>Midori.</i>

603
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:59,530
<i>I arrived in America two days ago.</i>

604
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:02,790
<i>Guess What?</i>

605
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:04,960
<i>I'm at...</i>

606
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:10,030
<i>Antelope Canyon.</i>

607
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:18,330
<i>The sun is about to enter,
so keep listening.</i>

608
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,790
<i>Maybe you can feel it.</i>

609
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,160
<i>Now.</i>

610
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,860
<i>It's here.</i>

611
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,990
<i>It's lighting up my hand.</i>

612
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,490
<i>The light of Antelope Canyon.</i>

613
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,330
What are you doing?

614
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:47,990
Don't know anymore.

615
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,860
Know what?

616
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:57,590
If I had been there,
she might still be alive.

617
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:02,990
If I...

618
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,990
was home that day.

619
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:10,730
No.

620
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:17,660
If I hadn't...

621
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,330
been recording.

622
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:25,660
Don't!

623
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,360
If I...

624
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,660
If I hadn't lied.

625
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:37,730
Not true!

626
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,530
Maki!

627
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:44,960
It's my fault.

628
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:53,360
What have I done?

629
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,430
I couldn't stop recording.

630
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:44,590
To be with you.

631
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:04,590
Antelope Canyon...

632
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,990
Let's take her there.

633
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,030
No.

634
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:20,260
Not just there.

635
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,960
Let's take her around the world.

636
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:40,290
Where will we go?

637
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,630
We can go anywhere.

638
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:59,360
There's nothing?

639
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,730
The balance was withdrawn
from your account.

640
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:15,160
You scared me.

641
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,660
What are you doing?

642
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,160
What happened to your face?

643
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,960
It was you.

644
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:35,430
Huh?

645
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,730
You took my money, didn't you?

646
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:58,790
Hello?

647
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,290
I borrowed it.

648
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,860
Why?

649
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:23,760
I was going to tell you.

650
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:25,330
The company...

651
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,330
really needed it.

652
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:30,430
To repay?

653
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,260
What?

654
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,790
To repay debts?

655
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,760
You may be too young.

656
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,760
Hmm?

657
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:50,360
You may not understand yet.

658
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:53,590
But I need to protect you all.

659
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:58,790
Not just you. My employees
are family, too.

660
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:21,330
You can go abroad anytime.

661
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:30,790
It'll take time, but I'll pay you back.

662
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,460
Besides...

663
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:40,730
I didn't want you to leave so soon.

664
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,490
You know?

665
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,160
I can't...

666
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,760
stand being alone again.

667
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,460
Why am I so weak?

668
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:22,760
You okay?

669
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,490
Hiroyuki, dear.

670
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,960
You're late.

671
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,290
I waited for you.

672
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:17,060
I cooked mackerel.
It's your favorite, isn't it?

673
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:24,830
Yeah.

674
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,790
Thanks.

675
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:34,930
Well, come on downstairs then.

676
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:28,290
Hey.

677
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,160
Look.

678
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:36,060
What?

679
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:37,790
Now, we can leave.

680
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,630
There's enough to get us started abroad.

681
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,430
How'd you get this?

682
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:48,960
Borrowed it.

683
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,360
Why?

684
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:57,960
"Why?"
Because we promised.

685
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,230
Where can this stuff go?

686
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:11,730
In the garage?

687
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:17,790
What?

688
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:22,660
We can't repay it.

689
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,330
I got it.

690
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:29,990
What do you mean?

691
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,830
Let's return it.

692
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,990
- Seriously, there's no need.
- Let's go.

693
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:40,960
Don't worry.

694
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,990
Stop it!

695
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:53,460
Don't you know...

696
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:06,130
How I feel?

697
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:14,760
What's wrong?

698
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:19,730
What's the rush?

699
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:28,960
Listen, we can save up together.

700
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:32,290
We can go anytime.

701
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,630
Why?

702
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:45,090
How can you say that?

703
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:54,260
We need to go now!
We might not even be alive tomorrow!

704
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:01,930
So what?

705
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:12,790
I realized this.

706
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,090
Please...

707
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,790
just stay with me.

708
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,830
I don't get it.

709
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,530
I don't need a reason

710
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:34,460
to be with you.

711
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,830
I said I don't get it!

712
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:52,990
Stop...

713
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:55,630
Naomi...

714
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,590
Let's stop this!

715
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,760
Come on, do it back.

716
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:26,730
I can't.

717
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:42,130
Why?

718
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,030
It's...

719
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,290
It's the only way.

720
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:57,130
Come on. Touch me!

721
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,190
That hair doesn't suit you.

722
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:01,590
I know.

723
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,130
How's your arm?

724
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:14,960
It's hard to bathe.

725
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:17,230
I'm sorry.

726
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:20,130
Better be.

727
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:29,930
What?

728
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:36,730
I don't want to forget.

729
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:44,060
Will you go bald?

730
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:48,430
What?

731
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,860
I can't watch you grow bald.

732
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:01,090
We won't meet again.

733
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:18,760
I wonder...

734
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:24,730
how it really sounds.

735
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:31,390
The Sahara desert.

736
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:39,460
And the aurora.

737
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:44,030
That tape...

738
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:50,960
that we made.

739
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:58,090
Sounded so fake.

740
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,860
But the snow was amazing.

741
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,930
I was good at that.

742
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,730
The real Iguazu.

743
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,560
The Blue Grotto.

744
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:29,360
Antelope Canyon.

745
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:39,690
We haven't seen anything.

746
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,590
Maki...

747
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,890
But it's okay.

748
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,930
Some day,

749
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:02,930
we'll go together.

750
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,390
Get a car,

751
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,190
and go anywhere.

752
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:49,060
How was Canada?

753
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:52,530
Umm... it was fun.

754
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:53,930
Yeah?

755
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,060
Kind of.

756
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:02,260
Do you live on your own?

757
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,430
Yeah. I even cook.

758
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:09,630
- I can't believe it!
- What do you mean?

759
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,560
And you?

760
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,330
Me? You know...

761
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,190
They found me a job.

762
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,760
Right.

763
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,090
I heard.

764
01:58:25,330 --> 01:58:26,190
Yeah.

765
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:34,460
Hey, you still owe me that record!

766
01:58:34,830 --> 01:58:36,590
Oh yeah.

767
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:38,230
Do you have it?

768
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,330
I do.

769
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:43,030
See me again, then.

770
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:47,530
Hey.

771
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,090
Aren't you scared?

772
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:55,190
Huh?

773
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,030
Aren't you scared of me?

774
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:04,060
Why? I'm not scared of you.

775
01:59:08,030 --> 01:59:08,890
Okay.

776
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:14,060
I'm not scared.

777
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:58,860
I didn't cry.

778
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,630
Seriously? You win again.

779
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:10,190
Shall we?

780
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,230
Yeah.

781
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:29,430
I cried at the last scene,
where they reunite in the fields.

782
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:32,060
- That was a great scene.
- It was.

783
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:33,760
I almost gave in.

784
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:36,730
- Close game.
- Great scene.

785
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:40,030
Hey, what color sofa?

786
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:43,730
Navy would suit the place.
Don't you think?

787
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:46,830
Hmm...

788
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,690
Let's go brighter.

789
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,390
Like orange?

790
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:51,830
Yes, like orange.

791
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:53,330
You love orange.

792
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:55,430
- Yellow, then.
- Yellow?

793
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:57,230
Yellow is like orange.

794
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:00,230
- No it's not.
- It's not?

795
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,830
Oh, and the curtains.

796
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:05,030
Yeah. When should we go?

797
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:07,530
Next weekend?

798
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:12,060
- Sunday?
- Sunday it is.

799
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:18,460
<i>We'll pick up any
unwanted items such as</i>

800

Oops, sorry.

805
02:03:54,530 --> 02:03:58,590
<i>Um... do you hear me, Midori?</i>

806
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:06,360
<i>I came to the Sahara Desert in Morocco.</i>

807
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,830
<i>I'm walking in the desert.</i>

808
02:04:09,730 --> 02:04:11,530
That truck is so loud.

809
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:12,960
Yeah.

810
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:14,960
<i>The sands feel great to walk on.</i>

811
02:04:15,730 --> 02:04:16,930
<i>The sun just came...</i>

812
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:20,260
<i>Um... can you hear me, Midori?</i>

813
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:24,390
<i>I'm in Capri now.</i>

814
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,190
<i>On the boat.</i>

815
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:31,190
<i>Inside of the Blue Grotto.</i>

816
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:37,190
<i>There's a beach by the airport.</i>

817
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,360
<i>I'm walking on it right now.</i>

818
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:46,890
<i>I can touch it if reach out.
I came to see prairies.</i>

819
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:52,560
<i>I'm sneaking into a wheat field.</i>

820
02:04:53,530 --> 02:04:55,960
<i>Listen! Aurora!</i>

821
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,200
<i>Midori.</i>

822
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:18,830
<i>The sun is about to enter,
so keep listening.</i>

823
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:20,730
<i>Now.</i>

824
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,430
<i>It's here.</i>

825
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:27,430
<i>It's lighting up my hand.</i>

826
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:33,160
<i>The light of Antelope Canyon.</i>

827
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:40,530
<i>Whoa! A jumbo jet!</i>

828
02:05:59,130 --> 02:06:02,530
Hey, are you okay?

829
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:07,860
It's a draw.

830
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:15,390
