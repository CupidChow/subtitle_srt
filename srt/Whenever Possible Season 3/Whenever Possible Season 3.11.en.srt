00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,949
Summer is here.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,279
It's summer now.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,979
I'm craving a cool iced Americano.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,519
(This season calls for a cool iced Americano.)

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,449
This is Songnidan-gil.

(Today's spare time, Jamsil)

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,889
Is that so?

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,020
Have you never been here?

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,189
I haven't been to Songnidan-gil.

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,429
But I've been to Songpa and Seokchon Lake...

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,329
- many times. - Good restaurants and cafes...

13
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,029
- are clustered here. - I see. Really?

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,200
Yes. This street is famous as the cafe street.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,040
- Go ahead, sir. - Okay.

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,410
You should go up first.

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,310
(2 men are walking up to the 2nd floor.)

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,249
They did a great job integrating plants and interior design.

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,980
- They're already here. - My gosh.

20
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,619
- Hello, Yo Han. - Kye Sang.

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,189

- Yo Han. My gosh. - Hello.

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,660
It's god.

(The idol star and actor on the rise, Kim Yo Han)

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,259
- Hello. - Take the inner seats.

38
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,760
- Okay. - Hello.

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,929
Kye Sang and Yo Han should sit together.

40
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,559
- Should I sit here? - Yes.

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,830
Yes. Let's face each other.

42
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,630
Like a group blind date?

43
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,040
- A group blind date? - Seriously.

44
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,599

Nice to meet you.

47
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,379
- Hello. - I don't think we've met before.

48
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,109
- Right. - Right?

49
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,850
But I saw you a lot in the dramas.

50
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,319
- So you never met in person, right? - Right. We've never met.

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,019
- Yo Han. You must be careful. - Right.

52
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,319
- He only saw me on TV. - You guys never met.

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,619
- So you saw him on TV? - Yes. On TV.

54
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,689
What about you, Kye Sang?

55
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,819
- We've never met in person. - Right. I think so too.

56
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,289
- Really? - Yes.

57
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,189
- How... - We never got to work together.

58
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,190
- Right. - Yes.

59
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,529
- Not even once? - No.

60
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,959
I always wanted to work with him,

61
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,700
- but I never got a chance. - Right.

62
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,130
Right.

63
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,570
Well, I grew up watching him.

64
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,139
I watched his movie.

65
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,500
- When you were young? - Yes.

66
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,639
I should be saying that. I grew up listening to god's songs.

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,810
Come on, guys. Why are you trying to one-up the other?

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,079
- No. - You're both saying...

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,216
you grew up watching each other.

70
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,649
- What's going on with them? - I...

71
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,056
He made his debut when he was young.

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,219
- I made my debut... - I see.

73
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,979
Playing the younger version...

74
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,919
of Yoo Ji Tae's character in "Oldboy."

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,489
My gosh. His acting was amazing.

76
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,789
- I still remember your shaved head. - Right.

77
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,819
- How do you know that? - Yes.

78
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,389
- I couldn't remember that at all. - Wait.

79
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,229
Maybe, you weren't just interested in my character.

80
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,659
I only remember seeing Yoo Ji Tae in the movie.

81
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,729
- But that was him. - Were you born in 1999?

82
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,699
- I was born when he debuted. - Or in 2000?

83
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,869
- Really? - I was born in 1999.

84
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,469
He's the same age as Jae Min.

85
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,876
(He's the same age as Jae Min from "god's Babysitting Diary.")

86
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,640
- Jae Min was born in 1999. - He was.

87
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,609
My gosh, that's crazy.

88
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,640
Jae Min?

89
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,286
- You don't have to know who he is. - Jae Min...

90
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,049
- You don't have to know. - He was on "Babysitting Diary."

91
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,979
There was a show named "god's Babysitting Diary."

92
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,249
- He had a child. - Well...

93
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,149
- Our group raised a child together. - I see.

94
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,520
The show was sensational.

95
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,120
To make a time-appropriate analogy, it's the same as BTS...

96
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,319
- Right. BTS... - The show was about raising kids.

97
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,789
- It was a parenting show. - raised a child on a show.

98
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,030
- And the child's name is Jae Min? - That's right.

99
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,829
You know what?

100
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,729
Kye Sang is shy about it.

101
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,500
His group, god, practically ruled...

102
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,269
our country back then.

103
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,199
- So... - Right. Everyone watched it.

104
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,869
- Kye Sang was super popular. - My gosh.

105
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,609
- I know about that. - You do, right?

106
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,010
- He's the first celebrity... - Okay.

107
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,079
- to ask for an autograph. - Really?

108
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,279
I had never asked anyone for an autograph.

109
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,820
My mom is a huge fan.

110
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,550
I wanted to ask him for an autograph.

111
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,189
- Hey, your mother? - You should've kept that out.

112
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,459
You should've skipped that...

113
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,159
- even if it were true. Yo Han. - Okay.

114
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,659
When you're asking for an autograph, don't mention that.

115
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,029
- Just ask for the autograph. - Okay.

116
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,959
Just say you're his fan. That would be nice. You know? Yes.

117
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,529
- I was so nervous back then. - Okay.

118
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,230
So many girls all over Korea wanted to be his wife.

119
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,269
- I think they were all lying. - What do you mean?

120
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,570
Everyone said they wanted to be my wife.

121
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
- I wondered if they meant it. - My gosh.

122
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,680
- Everyone had the same nickname. - Of course, they meant it.

123
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,609
(Spotting something)

124
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,949
Were you one of his fans, Jin Ah?

125
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,819
- Did you aspire to be his wife? - Were you his fan?

126
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,479
- Your fan is here. - She's so happy.

127
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,519
(The writer wore a sky blue outfit.)

128
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,719
- Today... My gosh. - "Sky Blue Balloon"

129
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,220
(Kye Sang's fan in the flesh)

130
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,559
See? Did you see that, Yo Han?

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,259
- He has a lot of fans. - See?

132
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,589
- His fans are everywhere. - Right.

133
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,530
- Gosh, it's all a coincidence. - My gosh.

134
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,899
- It's just... - No.

135
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,399
- She's got something in her bag. - Does she have their merchandise?

136
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,776
- Did you bring their merchandise? - Merchandise?

137
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,360
(Here's the sky blue balloon stick, god's official light stick.)

138
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,540
My gosh. She really did.

139
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,170
- It's the light stick. - She really brought it.

140
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,939
- My gosh. Both of you will feel... - That's the light stick.

141
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,420
Uncomfortable during the shoot today.

142
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,249
- Take a picture with him. - Did you see that?

143
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,949
- She should get an autograph. - I'm not lying. So god...

144
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,889
Their fans from the old days...

145
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,049
started to establish their careers in many fields.

146
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,389
So many of them are working now.

147
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,889
- Right. That's true. - Right?

148
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,029
- You see them at hospitals too. - I see them at hospitals.

149
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,829
Some of them became lawyers.

150
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,759
- Right. They're everywhere. - When I go to the borough office,

151
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,069
they print the copy of my family register fast.

152
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,699
I'm serious.

153
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,370
- This is a true story. - Right.

154
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,939
- What? - You have nothing to worry about.

155
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,969
- Yes. It's so convenient. - You have nothing to worry about.

156
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,039
It's true that this is good for me.

157
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,670
- Right. - My gosh.

158
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,139
- I'd like to thank... - I'm grateful.

159
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,909
- god's fans from all across Korea. - Yes.

160
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,979
- Yes. - Yes.

161
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,879
By the way, they are joining us today...

162
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,049
to promote their drama, "The Winning Try."

163
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,079
- Right. - Right?

164
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,349
When I heard Kye Sang and Yo Han were joining us today,

165
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,489
I looked up their drama. But when I typed in, "Try,"

166
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,370
I kept getting results for the underwear brand.

167
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,559
- What? - The thing is...

168
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,759
- Right. That's a famous brand. - Yes.

169
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,259
- The drama hasn't aired yet. - Yes.

170
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,629
So when I looked it up,

171
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,669
- that brand kept showing up. - Our drama hasn't aired yet.

172
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,739
- Right. It hasn't aired yet. - Once our drama airs,

173
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,369
- Right. Yours will show up first. - things will change.

174
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,869

177
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,209
- Yes. He's a rugby coach... - A retired rugby player.

178
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,119
Who retired dishonorably.

179
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,560
(The first Korean drama about rugby)

180
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,149
The MVP of the Asia Rugby Championship.

181
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,719
(This comedy-meets-coming-of-age sports drama centers around...)

182
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,319
(an eccentric, off-the-wall coach...)

183
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,219
(as he attempts to lead...)

184
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,306
(the lowest-ranking high school rugby team to a national title.)

185
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,130
(This may turn out to be one of his most iconic characters.)

186
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,830
I can't accept you as my coach.

187
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,259
("The Very First Korean Drama About Rugby to Premiere")

188
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,230

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,846
- Winning the national championship. - Winning the national championship.

190
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,910
("The Winning Try" will show the viewers heartwarming moments.)

191
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,809
- It's like a comic book. - Yes.

192
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,810
- That's the plot, right? - Yes.

193
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,839
- It's like watching anime. - I see.

194
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,986
- And you're the player, right? - He's the ace, the team captain.

195
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,079
- I'm the captain. - You're the rugby player.

196
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,149
Yes. My character grew up...

197
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,619
watching the coach.

198
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,219
But he crossed the line by doing something he shouldn't have.

199
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,319
My character messed up and was kicked out of the team.

200
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,589
Then he came to my character's school as the coach.

201
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,590
So in the beginning...

202
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:29,029
- So your character rebelled. - Yes, his character hated mine.

203
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,829
- That's how it all starts. - That's right.

204
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,959
- Right. - Yes.

205
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,840
My gosh. You basically watched the whole drama.

206
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,799
- Gosh, you shouldn't say that. - It's over.

207
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,969
You shouldn't say that.

208
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,369
I'm not saying this because he's on our show today.

209
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,670
One day, I was just watching TV. And coincidentally,

210
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,510
his movie was on. I saw his character, Jang Chen.

211
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,409
- My gosh. - So I started to watch it.

212
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,890
I ended up watching the entire movie.

213
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,300
My gosh. Seriously. Jang Chen was an impressive character.

214
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,319
- I mean it. Jang Chen was amazing. - Yes, he was the best.

215
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,990
- I almost changed my name. - My gosh.

216
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,559
I thought that was a better name than my real one.

217
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,089
- Instead of hearing this... - You were just Jang Chen himself.

218
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,589
- My gosh, Jang Chen. - What's the name of your role...

219
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,659
in the drama?

220
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,129
It's Ju Ga Ram.

221
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,170
- Ju Ga Ram. - Ju Ga Ram.

222
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,170
- It doesn't sound that strong. - Slightly...

223
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,569
- Compared to Jang Chen, - Ga Ram sounds soft.

224
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,800
Ga Ram sounds weak.

225
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,340
Ju Ga Ram.

226
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,579
We're filming in Songpa. Do you have any ties to this area?

227
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,709
Yo Han, do you have ties to this area? Or is it you, Kye Sang?

228
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,919
I grew up here from age 7 to my early 20s.

229
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,319
- My gosh. - You're from Jamsil.

230
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,849
- That's why we're here. - Yes. I lived here for a long time.

231
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,289
Jamsil feels like my hometown.

232
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,389
I bet. You grew up in Jamsil.

233
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,760
I graduated from Seoul Physical Education High School.

234
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,530
- I see. SPEHS? - Yes.

235
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,029
- Yes, the one in Bangi-dong. - What was your major?

236
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,159
It was taekwondo.

237
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
- Taekwondo? - Yes, he did taekwondo.

238
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,499
- Really? - He's so talented. It's no joke.

239
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,099
- He must be good with his feet. - Yes, of course.

240
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,699
- Wait. - Yo Han can carry the team...

241
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,540
- if we have to play with our feet. - Yes.

242
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,769
Yes. You can count on me.

243
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,910
Yes. Great.

244
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,350
Anyway. Let's get going and meet our first Whenever Guest.

245
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,810
- "Kim Sang Hyun." - Sang Hyun.

246
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,379
"I eat alone. I go for a walk alone."

247
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,020
Wait. They sound like lyrics.

248
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,849
"I start sweating..."

249
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,460
- "in a crowded area." - What?

250
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,059
"I'm a super introvert."

251
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,119
I see. He's an introvert.

252
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,629
"In these quiet moments of carving, polishing, and sanding,"

253
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,329
"I'm happy because no one tells me what to do."

254
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,829
- Wait. Does he work... - Does he run a workshop?

255
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,830
- in carpentry? - I think he's in carpentry.

256
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,339
"Just like its owner, this place is always quiet."

257
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,870
"Make this place come alive with noise for the first time."

258
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,080
Personally, I like introverts.

259
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,609
I seem to identify with them.

260
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,209
- You're also an introvert. - I'm an introvert too.

261
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,649
- What about you, Kye Sang? - Me too.

262
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,819
- I'm like that too. - Are you an introvert?

263
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,389
- I'm very introverted. - Same here. I'm also introverted.

264
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,189
- He's super introverted. - Really?

265
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,290
Yes. But he changes when he drinks.

266
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,159
People like that can be dangerous.

267
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,859
- No. Not at all. - No?

268
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,959
- No? Really? - He changes in a good way.

269
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,969
He relaxes. He becomes cheerful.

270
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,099
- I get cheerful. - I see. You get cheerful.

271
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,340
Yeon Seok. You're an extrovert, right?

272
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,340
This is what everyone tells me.

273
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,409
- I seek to be an introvert. - I see. Yes.

274
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,209
- But you seem very kind. - Yes.

275
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,879
- My gosh. He's got a kind heart. - Okay.

276
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,279
Let me give you an example.

277
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,119
His friend from abroad was visiting Korea.

278
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,749
He let his friend stay at his house for three weeks.

279
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,230
- Right. - This kind of generosity...

280
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,219
is no joke. This is a hard thing to do.

281
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,759
- I live alone, so... - That can't be easy at all.

282
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,629
- Even so. It's a hard thing to do. - Okay.

283
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,600
- But... What? - Was it a woman?

284
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,460
- Was it a woman? - What?

285
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,600
- I'm sorry. I was joking. - Kye Sang...

286
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,940
- He knows how to crush his juniors. - You...

287
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,169
- He turned Yo Han into a drunk. - Kye Sang is...

288
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,330
- determined to ruin someone today. - Right. And he...

289
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
- I was joking. - You were surprised too. "What?"

290
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,026
- You sounded very surprised. - No.

291
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,850
We've been friends since elementary school.

292
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,480
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

293
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,719
- Hold on. - You know?

294
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,359
His spare time starts at noon.

295
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,859
- We must hurry. - Hold on.

296
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,460
- Let's get going now. - Are we leaving?

297
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,959
How old are you?

298
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,359
- I was born in 1984. - I see.

299
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,100
- Really? - You can drop the honorifics.

300
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,329
- So this is Songnidan-gil. - Yes.

301
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,330
I've never been here.

302
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:57,569
- There are many good cafes... - I see a lot of good places.

303
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,769
And restaurants.

304
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,939
I see a lot of good places here.

305
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,609
You know what? When I go to restaurants these days,

306
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,909
I'm so impressed. I wonder,

307
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,209
"How did the owner come up with this?"

308
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,650
There are so many moments like that.

309
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,779
Right.

310
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,149
I've been to other countries, but Korea has to be the best...

311
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,309
- when it comes to food. - Right. That's so true.

312
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,020
There are so many good restaurants here.

313
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,620
- Kye Sang. - The car...

314
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,289
Do you know him?

315
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,660
(Is that Kye Sang's friend?)

316
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,819
- Hello. - Who is he? Do we know each other?

317
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,090
- No. - I see.

318
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,660
- He just called your name. - We never met before.

319
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,481
He sounded casual as if they knew each other. "Kye Sang."

320
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,469
It was the way he called you.

321
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,599
- It was as if you hadn't met... - Right.

322
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
- Yes. - each other in a while.

323
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:33,769
It was the way he said it. "Kye Sang."

324
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,039
- "Kye Sang." - That's how it sounded.

325
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,210
So Kye Sang was like...

326
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,539
"Do we know each other?"

327
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,379
(The fate of a national idol star)

328
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,909
I bet so many people recognize you.

329
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,910
- They do. - Right?

330
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:43,149
You've been in this industry...

331
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,379
- for a very long time. - Yes.

332
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,820
I've been working as long as he has.

333
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,549
I made a debut before you.

334
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,849
I debuted in 1991.

335
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,319
(Kye Sang debuted in 1999, and Jae Suk debuted in 1991.)

336
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,390
- It's been that long for you? - Yes. Of course.

337
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,036
We can go straight. And his place will be on the right.

338
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,459
- This way? - Straight down and on the right.

339
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,499
Jae Suk.

340
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,830
Hello. My gosh.

341
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,659
You just saluted them.

342
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,276
(People are calling Jae Suk after Kye Sang.)

343
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,429
Gosh, this is crazy.

344
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,576
(They're as popular as anyone can be.)

345
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm on a national TV show like this because I filmed a drama with you.

346
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,970
Is this the place?

347
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,179
By the way, are we going to a workshop or something?

348
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,309
- It may be a woodworking workshop. - A workshop?

349
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,826
(In these quiet moments of carving, polishing, and sanding...)

350
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,050
This is a saju-reading cafe.

351
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,780
- Wait, this place... - "Rest in Tree."

352
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
- It's a woodworking workshop. - This is the place.

353
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,220
- This must be the place. - Bread?

354
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,589
- I can already feel it. - No, not that.

355
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,989
- The entrance... - How beautiful.

356
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,559
It suits the name of his place, Rest in Tree.

357
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,360
- It suits the name. - My gosh, this place...

358
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,060
- Come in. - Okay.

359
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,430
My gosh.

360
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,530
- Go in. - This is...

361
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,499
Am I smelling sage? What is this?

362
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,969
(The scent of trees wafts through from the entrance.)

363
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,110
It smells great.

364
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,839
My gosh. Hello.

365
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,869
- Hello. - Are you Sang Hyun?

366
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,339
- Are you Sang Hyun? - Hello.

367
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,940
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

368
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,679
- Hello. - By the way,

369
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,149
- the entrance was tiny. - Hello.

370
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,620
But it's so spacious inside.

371
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,189
More than anything, it's so cool inside.

372
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,790
And I love this scent.

373
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,389
I love the smell of wood.

374
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,919
Is this the scent of phytoncides?

375
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,419
- It's from a diffuser. - Did you spray something?

376
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,389
- He has air fresheners. - I have diffusers here.

377
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,659
(He's an honest type.)

378
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,299
- It smells great here. - Yes.

379
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,870
The three of you look like a choir.

380
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,569
(Spare Time Trio)

381
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,239
- We're all wearing white shirts. - Right.

382
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,870
You guys look like an ensemble. Are you guys a trio?

383
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,286
- You look like a trio. - Today...

384
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,909
- We're dressed similarly today. - Yes.

385
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,079
- Your outfits... - Yes.

386
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,520
- Shall we sit down first? - How should we arrange the seats?

387
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,579
(They sit down for a chat.)

388
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,479
I used to work with woodworking machines too.

389
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
- Really? - Really?

390
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,849
You worked with woodworking machines too?

391
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,950
Yes. I used that.

392
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,359
- I learned it briefly. - I knew he learned carpentry.

393
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,089
- But I didn't know you did too. - I also learned carpentry.

394
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,159
I had to build the stage when I was in college.

395
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,029
That's when I learned it.

396
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,929
I once played a character who did carpentry.

397
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,829
- We all have ties to carpentry. - Yes. That's true.

398
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,590
- I'm the only one who never tried. - You...

399
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,940
I'm not dexterous at all.

400
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,709
You wrote that you were an introvert.

401
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,109
Yes. Sweat is dripping...

402
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,479
- on my back right now. - I see. You're sweating?

403
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,549
This is great because we're all introverts here.

404
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,450
- Really? - We're all introverts.

405
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,430
- He's... - See? I'm not talking.

406
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,820
- He's not talking much. - Right.

407
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,350
- We're all introverts. - I see.

408
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,119
I learned how to operate woodworking machines...

409
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,660
because I could do it alone.

410
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,129
- That's right. - I didn't have to meet people.

411
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,236
- I could do it alone. - Right.

412
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,159
I'm not generalizing this.

413
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,929
But I noticed that calm people often get into mechanical woodworking.

414
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,930
- Right. - Yes.

415
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:17,229
- My teacher didn't talk much. - Okay.

416
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,239
- Right. - I see.

417
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,269
"Just do this."

418
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,339
- "Don't do this." - Right.

419
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,460
- He... - "You'll get hurt!"

420
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,820
- "You'll get hurt." - "That's dangerous."

421
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,280
Seriously.

422
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,479
- Aren't I right? It's dangerous. - That's right. Yes.

423
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,049
- Of course. You work with machines. - It's so dangerous. Yes.

424
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,979
What about you, Yo Han?

425
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,919
- You're an introvert. - Yes.

426
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,249
How do you handle attending meetings with people you don't know?

427
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,160
As for people like me,

428
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,689
being pointed out... No, I meant to say "singled out."

429
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,429
"What about you?" When I'm asked to speak up,

430
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,229
- I'm singled out. - That's what I just did.

431
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,560
His ears are already red.

432
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,699
- No. - I can relate.

433
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,299
- His ears are red. - I see.

434
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
- They're getting redder. - No.

435
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:52,699
My ears are red, to begin with.

436
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,539
No. They weren't red before.

437
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,609
You put him in the spotlight.

438
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,669
- So they keep getting redder. - Look.

439
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,909
- They're getting super red. - This is crazy.

440
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,379
(All eyes are on him.)

441
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,610
- They're redder. - My gosh.

442
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,349
(His attention level maxes out.)

443
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,679
- They're so red. - Hey.

444
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
Look.

445
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,749
- Why put him in the spotlight? - My gosh.

446
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,050
His ears are at 100°C now.

447
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,859
- That's fascinating. - That's right.

448
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,489
Sang Hyun. Do you have interesting physical features like that?

449
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,559
- Like ears getting red. - Right now,

450
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,729
- my lips are getting very dry. - I see.

451
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,829
- Right. - So you keep...

452
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,430
- smacking your lips. - That's right.

453
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,390
Right. Or your lips get stuck on your gums.

454
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,639
It happens unknowingly when you talk.

455
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,479
- Your lips are way too dry. - Right. They get stuck here.

456
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,809
So you're an introvert.

457
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,579
- How did you apply to our show? - Right.

458
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,579
It sounded like you wrote the letter yourself.

459
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,079
- Because I'm introverted, - Yes.

460
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,589
- talking to people is the hardest. - Yes.

461
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,759
But to run my business, I must hold classes.

462
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,959
- Right. You should. - I bet you have to teach...

463
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,229
new people every time.

464
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,459
Ever since I started running these classes,

465
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,129
I've been having a tough time.

466
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,570
- I see. You're struggling with it? - So...

467
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,969
I applied to be on the show...

468
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,769
to learn from you, Jae Suk, as you're the expert at this.

469
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,969
And I also wanted to learn your sense of humor, Yeon Seok.

470
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,239
- I'm a big fan of yours, Jae Suk. - I see.

471
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,410
But I'm everyone's fan.

472
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,610
- It's all right. - Wait.

473
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,170
- This is all new to me. - I'm his fan too.

474
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,479
- It's okay. - They have a lot of fans too.

475
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,189
Yes! Thank you.

476
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,320
Don't worry about it.

477
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,119
Yo Han. Wait. That's the wrong name.

478
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Yes?

479
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,359
- Okay. I won't worry. - Sang Hyun, don't worry.

480
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,129
- It shows that he's an introvert. - My gosh.

481
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,559
- Right. He wants... - It shows.

482
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,959
To be nice to everyone.

483
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,399
- Don't worry about that. - Okay.

484
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,429
(He doesn't want to disappoint anyone.)

485
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,099
How long have you been running this workshop?

486
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,440
It's been about nine years.

487
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,510
By the way...

488
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,339
A lot of people wear wooden glasses nowadays.

489
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,210
- How cute. - They're shaped like cookies.

490
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,109
Do you also make glasses here?

491
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,479
Yes, after I began running classes.

492
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,509
Kye Sang. Try these on.

493
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,580
It's hard to pull off glasses like these.

494
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,619
- They might look good on you. - If you can pull these off...

495
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,819
See? They look good on him.

496
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,120
(They're perfect for him.)

497
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,889
- They look good on you. - Right.

498
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,989
They look great on you.

499
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,089
- You know what? If I wear them, - This color...

500
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,259
- they'll look weird on me. - Try them on.

501
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,059
- Seriously. They'll look so weird. - Try them on.

502
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,670
I'll put them on to show you how awful I look with them on.

503
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,299
(A big-nose man has joined the show.)

504
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,040
- Jae Suk. - See?

505
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,269
- You... - You know?

506
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,469
I look like a traitor.

507
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,769
- You sort of do. - Right?

508
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,069
- Right. You do look sly. - Did you see that?

509
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,109
Kye Sang. They look great on you.

510
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,409
- Really? - Look.

511
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,379
(A good model for wooden glasses)

512
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,880
- Gosh, the wooden frames... - Yo Han, try them on too.

513
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,626
I bet they look good on him too.

514
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,319
- Glasses don't look good on me. - Let me see.

515
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,449
- Wait. - Try them on.

516
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,620
- Put them on properly. - Let me see.

517
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,960
I wouldn't say they're perfect on you.

518
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,030
I wouldn't say they're perfect on you.

519
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,959
- I like the size of this. - Let me see.

520
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,399
(Snapping)

521
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,430
- Wait. - Let me see.

522
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,469
Wait.

523
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,369
(Speechless)

524
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,610
- You need to buy that. - Wait.

525
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,210
- Buy 1. We sold 1 pair. - I'll buy 1.

526
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,909
You just sold 1 pair.

527
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,579
(A new way of increasing his sales)

528
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,510
- We sold a pair. - It's fine.

529
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,709
- Buy one. - You know what?

530
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,549
- Did you do this on purpose? - They were narrower than my face.

531
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,180
Did you put out a bad pair to hook us?

532
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,050
- Did you plan this? - No.

533
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,659
- Well... - Gosh, something is off.

534
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,690
No.

535
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,090
- Let me pay for them first. - Buy it.

536
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,129
- He'll pay before we leave. - Okay.

537
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,759
- Yeon Seok will buy that pair. - Okay.

538
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,929
- My gosh. - This is...

539
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,439
Anyway, now that we're here, we ought to win you some presents.

540
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,900
- So... Yes. - He learned carpentry.

541
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,710
There.

542
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,910
There.

543
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,310
- One. - One.

544
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,520
Great.

545
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,919
The first fortune cookie will tell you what your prize is.

546
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,289
- Crack the fortune cookie here. - What? This is the thing.

547
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,319
Yes. The prize...

548
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
He touched the wooden box.

549
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,089
He checked the finishing.

550
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,330
- It comes with the job. - Yes.

551
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,459
"Whenever possible, I walk the Jeju Olle Trail..."

552
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,900
"as it's my hobby."

553
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,069
"A round-trip business class ticket to Jeju."

554
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,539
(The present for Round 1, a round-trip plane ticket to Jeju)

555
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,940
You can take your girlfriend there.

556
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,646
- Great. These are the tickets. - This is a great present.

557
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,410
What game are we playing with the plane ticket on the line?

558
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,609
(Bottle Cap Domino)

559
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,009
(They will flick the bottle caps...)

560
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,319
(to knock down the domino pieces.)

561
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,649
(Round 1)

562
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,390
(Knock down 4 domino pieces.)

563
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,649
- My gosh. - We have to flick them?

564
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,419
- Wait. This... - This won't be easy.

565
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,759
If 1 of us knocks over 2 pieces,

566
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
the rest of us have to knock over the remaining two.

567
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,499
I used to play this a lot...

568
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,629
- back in school. - Right.

569
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,059
Our caps can't go over the line...

570
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,460
- Right. - when we place them down?

571
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,699
Gosh, this isn't easy.

572
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,970
Didn't we play it like this back in the day?

573
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,650
(It flung right next to the pieces.)

574
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,240
He got the closest.

575
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,179
I'm good with my hands. They're still useful.

576
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,580
Hold on. How did I do it back then?

577
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,960
- My gosh. It's... - Hitting the pieces is key.

578
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,120
I should move slightly to the left. So this...

579
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,659
- Hold on. - Just like that.

580
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,980
- Is it better to go slowly? - I'm getting the hang of it.

581
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,560
(His aim was precise.)

582
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,469
Gosh, if this happens, we'll be in trouble.

583
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,150
- From the side... - The pieces are heavy.

584
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,700
So...

585
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,070
It jumped.

586
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,279
(He knocks them down by skipping the cap.)

587
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,380
It jumped.

588
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,479
- What... - I knew it. He's indeed the ace.

589
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,809
- Great. - The ace of "The Winning Try."

590
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,279
- Hold on. Why... - Let's give it a try right away.

591
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,949
- I could've gotten lucky. - Even so, we must try it...

592
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,149
when we're on a roll.

593
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,819
- All right. - Great.

594
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,100
Let's try it for the first time.

595
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,319
Great.

596
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,929
- Let's do a group cheer. - Let's do a group cheer.

597
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,459
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

598
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,489
- Let's go! - Let's go!

599
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,290
- Okay. It's our try number one. - All right.

600
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,170
Here's what I'll do. First off...

601
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,429
We might end up succeeding more easily than we anticipated.

602
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,599
Just now,

603
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,846
- You got a good feeling, right? - I got a good feeling about this.

604
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,069
- I... - I got that feeling just now.

605
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,810
- Okay. - The domino pieces look super big.

606
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,180
- "Super?" - Yes.

607
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,850
They looked so big just now.

608
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,719
- They looked so big just now. - He got it.

609
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
This is perfect. You got it.

610
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,760
(Yeon Seok failed.)

611
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,319
I guess that was an ominous feeling.

612
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
(He ruins the anticipation.)

613
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,801
- That was anticlimactic. - Kye Sang.

614
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,589
But I had a good feeling.

615
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,799
- We might succeed out of the blue. - Right.

616
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,959
When I was in elementary school, I used to do this.

617
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,306
- I didn't know about that trick. - Right between the fingers...

618
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,529
That's a good idea.

619
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,776
(Utilizing his strategy from his schooldays)

620
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
- That's a good idea. - It'd be funny...

621
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:00,840
if it hits his finger.

622
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,310
I got it. I told you I had a good feeling about this.

623
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,409
(He knocks down 2 pieces.)

624
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,126
I told you I had a good feeling about this.

625
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,280
- My gosh. - This is like...

626
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,379
using the backsight when shooting.

627
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,950
Yo Han, this is all you now.

628
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,410
- Do what you did earlier. - Okay.

629
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,489
- Get it to jump like before. - Yes.

630
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,490
(If he does what he did during practice, )

631
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:19,611
(they can complete Round 1.)

632
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,960
Move it slightly to the left.

633
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,560
(Get it to jump like before.)

634
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
We have one person left. Finish it up.

635
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,810
- Jae Suk, you still have a shot. - Gosh, I'm last?

636
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,139
- I noticed that... - I think he'll do well.

637
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,839
- it flew over to that side, right? - Move slightly to the right.

638
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,009
(He deviates from his aim on purpose considering the bouncing direction.)

639
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,279
- Gently. - Gently.

640
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,350
Gently.

641
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,920
(Their first attempt failed.)

642
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,490
Jae Suk, that was the direction you were aiming.

643
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,160
- Really? - Yes.

644
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,730
Then you should've told me.

645
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,770
- Wait. Kye Sang's idea was good. - This is hard.

646
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,470
- It helps you zero in on it. - Right.

647
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,570
- Like the backsight on a gun. - Right.

648
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,410
If it passes through my fingers, it will hit the pieces.

649
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,480
(Groaning)

650
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,120
Step back, Yeon Shik.

651
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,749
- This isn't it. - It's making me bow down.

652
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,590
- This isn't it. It's not working. - Yeon Shik. Come on.

653
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,190
Not everyone can do it.

654
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,290
- We should flick it like this. - Right.

655
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,359
- Yes. We can't flick it like this. - Okay. Vertically.

656
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,499
- Flicking it vertically is better. - You can do it that way.

657
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,980
- We must flick it vertically. - Yes.

658
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,800
Just like that.

659
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,440
(One and done)

660
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,609
Just like that.

661
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,669
(He finally gets his first strike.)

662
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,880
- That was the best attempt. - Okay. I got it.

663
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,610
I do well during practice.

664
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,779
You're good.

665
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,480
- So this is it. - Yes.

666
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
All right. Let's go with our second try.

667
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,389
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Let's go.

668
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,489
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

669
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,519
I did it here earlier.

670
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,796
- I should do it here. - You'll go first.

671
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,420
- It was about here, right? - Yes.

672
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,359
Around here.

673
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,330
(Try number two, Jae Suk)

674
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,640
It moved to the side when I did it from here, right?

675
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,139
(He failed.)

676
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,199
(Try number two, Jae Suk)

677
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,960
- My gosh. - He messes it up when it counts.

678
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,640
Why do you always do this?

679
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,240
Come on!

680
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,340
(Taking out his anger on an innocent machine)

681
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,209
(Try number two, Yo Han)

682
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,530
(He barely managed to calm down.)

683
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,150
Yo Han could succeed.

684
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,489
(The second player, Yo Han)

685
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,650
But this is hard.

686
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,740
I have a good feeling about this.

687
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,729
- He did it! - Yes, I told you so.

688
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,450
- I had a feeling you could do it. - Great.

689
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,120
- He did it! - Yes, I told you so.

690
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,399
(Yo Han knocks down 2 pieces.)

691
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,199
- I had a feeling you could do it. - Your aim was good.

692
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,739
- I had a feeling you could do it. - Great.

693
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,969
(Kye Sang goes next.)

694
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,570
- Your aim was good. - Kye Sang.

695
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,169
That's Kye Sang's killer move.

696
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,239
(Getting his killer move ready)

697
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,310
Please.

698
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,020
(If it passes through the backsight, it will hit the domino pieces.)

699
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,789
(Groaning)

700
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,420
You haven't gone yet then. Right?

701
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,690
You haven't gone yet then. Right?

702
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,730
Well, I was watching him from the back.

703
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,930
His finger was blocking the cap.

704
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,570
But this is really hard.

705
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,300
- You must finish this. - I still have to go.

706
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,869
Okay. I...

707
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,269
(Try number two, Yeon Seok)

708
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,410
I still have to go.

709
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,779
- We must complete Round One. - All right.

710
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,220
I always have one move up my sleeve.

711
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,280
No need to worry.

712
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,420
- What? - My gosh.

713
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,890
(Second attempt, failed)

714
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
This... I see. It was slightly...

715
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,930
- Gosh, hold on. - Should we use the bonus coupon?

716
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,800
This...

717
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,500
- My gosh. - It goes the other way.

718
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,699
(Correcting his course to a diagonal angle)

719
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,740
It's not easy.

720
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,899
This...

721
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,670
Why won't it go straight?

722
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,040
Hey, you're good.

723
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,910
So should I hold it down?

724
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,650
What?

725
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,289
- You got it. - You got it.

726
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,320
Let's do this.

727
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,249
- My gosh. - We got this. Let's go.

728
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,860
So hold it down and then flick it?

729
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,489
(Cheering)

730
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,650
Let me try it just like this.

731
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,690
Here I go. I'll try right now.

732
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,959
All right. Let's give it a try.

733
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,499
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

734
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,460
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

735
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,669
All right. Hold it down.

736
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,640
(Try number four, Yeon Seok)

737
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,856
It doesn't work when it's time to deliver, right?

738
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,940
What was that?

739
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,410
Considering his disposition, he just...

740
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,680
- He mocked me. - Yes.

741
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,719
- He mocked you. - Yes, he mocked me.

742
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,196
He must've run out of patience if he couldn't bite his tongue.

743
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,049
- Yo Han, do what you did earlier. - Okay.

744
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,819
(Try number four, Yo Han)

745
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,890
It looks great.

746
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,730
(Assisting him with the aim)

747
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,060
It looks great.

748
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,969
(He failed.)

749
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,330
My gosh, it must've hit something.

750
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,109
This is...

751
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,790
- Can someone help me with my aim? - Okay.

752
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,880
You must aim farther to the right than you think.

753
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,010
Great.

754
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,579
Only my body moved. My fingers didn't move.

755
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,690
- Hey. - Jae Suk.

756
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,949
- I was checking everything. - Really? Okay.

757
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,190
- Isolation. - All right.

758
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,650
I have a good feeling about this.

759
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,930
I guess not.

760
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,400
- I guess I have no talent. - Okay.

761
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,230
Show us.

762
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,669
Is my direction good?

763
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,846
- Hold on. - What do you think?

764
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,170
Move slightly to the right. Yes.

765
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,739
- Here? - Slightly.

766
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,110
Around here? Good?

767
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,040
A little bit more.

768
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Did you just...

769
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:42,750
Don't resist.

770
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,010
Why...

771
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,419
I'm helping you with the aim.

772
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,100
(He couldn't let go of his stubborn side.)

773
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,919
(Dumbfounded)

774
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,990
Gosh, that's funny.

775
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,720
All right, I'm ready. Yes.

776
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,710
- I'll go for it. - It's like playing pool.

777
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,090
Flick it.

778
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,760
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

779
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,269
(Fourth attempt, failed)

780
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,370
That was so close.

781
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,769
Should we have tilted it slightly more?

782
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,140
(Beating himself up)

783
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,110
I would've hit it if I followed your advice.

784
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,549
- But I moved slightly. - Why did you do that?

785
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,650
Why can't you trust me?

786
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,220
- I couldn't trust you. - Why not?

787
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,149
- I lined you up for the shot. - But...

788
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,649
it felt like I was too far too the left.

789
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,190
You were right.

790
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,990
- Your advice was right. - Gosh.

791
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,930
- Gosh. - We have to win him the tickets.

792
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,630
- Let's use the coupon. - Let's use it.

793
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,330
- We'll use the coupon. - Okay.

794
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,600
One of us has to step out.

795
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,699
If you quietly stare at one of us,

796
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,199
that person will step out.

797
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
(Staring at the person that will not be playing)

798
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,410
(Carefully)

799
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,210
(Flinching)

800
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:47,640
He chose Kye Sang.

801
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,909
(Kye Sang is chosen.)

802
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,550
I'm not sure if this is reliable.

803
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,649
(He was doubtful about Kye Sang's aiming method.)

804
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,950
- You were doubtful about this. - He was doubtful.

805
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,859
- He doesn't beat around the bush. - No, he doesn't.

806
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,489
- Sang Hyun, come join us. - Come this way.

807
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,789
Let's gather our hands.

808
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,670
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.

809
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,230
Sang Hyun.

810
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,670
- I'll put it here. - I hope it works this time.

811
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,110
I'll be disappointed if we don't succeed.

812
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,399
Can you check my aim from behind too?

813
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,269
You're aiming for the far left.

814
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,609
Flicking it like this is way less precise than this.

815
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,640
- Is it? Should I do this? - Yes.

816
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,780
(Looking around)

817
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,810
- You can't see, can you? - No.

818
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,650
I told you.

819
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,020
(He uses the aiming method.)

820
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,350
That's mine. Gosh!

821
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,419
(He now admits its reliability.)

822
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,489
This works.

823
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,660
(Feeling proud)

824
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,660
I'll do it my way.

825
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Goodness.
(He failed.)

826
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:41,870
That was too...

827
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,400
- I'm sorry. - Get over here.

828
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,200
"Get over here."

829
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,139
- Show us, Yo Han. - I have to hit it.

830
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,009
- You hit it earlier. - Just do what you did earlier.

831
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,690
- Think of this as practice. - Just do it.

832
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,350
- It's nothing once you hit it. - Right.

833
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,250
- You can do this. - Do what feels right.

834
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,650
But you seem to be aiming in the wrong direction.

835
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,920
- Do you see it? - I can see it.

836
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,890
(Shaking)

837
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,260
Yo Han isn't budging.

838
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,430
Wait. I was like that too.

839
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,859
- Is this right? - I acted just like you.

840
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,570
I was stubborn too, but this is right.

841
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,310
You have to be here to hit it.

842
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,010
- Should I flick it? - Go ahead.

843
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,760
(He flicks it, trusting Jae Suk.)

844
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,019
(Coupon round: Sang Hyun, Yo Han)

845
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,526
If you moved a bit more, you would've hit it.

846
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,819
- Right? - That was nice.

847
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,890
(He failed.)

848
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,219
You have to trust the person behind you.

849
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,589
I'll have to relax.

850
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,590
Is this right?

851
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,160
(Pushing him)

852
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,629
This will go to the right.

853
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,100
Trust him, Jae Suk.

854
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,970
This looks about right.

855
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,770
I'm flicking it.

856
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,069
Gosh.

857
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,610
(He misses by a hair and fails.)

858
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,709
- I'll trust you, Jae Suk. - Okay.

859
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,439
(Coupon round: Sang Hyun, Yo Han, Jae Suk, Yeon Seok)

860
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,510
Like this?

861
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,649
- Is this right? - This looks right.

862
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,950
(The collaboration of the two MCs, Jae Suk and Yeon Seok)

863
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,050
- I'm flicking it. - Okay.

864
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,390
Please.

865
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,790
Are you serious?

866
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,029
(Fails unbelievably)

867
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,630
We're in trouble.

868
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,970
Seriously?

869
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,899
You're supposed to flick it forward.

870
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,839
Why did you flick it to the side?

871
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,510
It was a mistake.

872
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,009
The bonus round was a failure.

873
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,739
(The bonus round ends meaninglessly.)

874
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,380
We're in trouble.

875
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
- We have to succeed. - I mean...

876
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,180
This is too light.

877
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Look.

878
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,680
- We'll get hurt if it's heavy. - Really?

879
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,220
I have to flick it from up close.

880
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,489
I have to flick it from up close.

881
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,530
(Angrily)

882
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,299
I just gave that a try.

883
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,630
- What are you doing? - It's Jang Chen.

884
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,100
- I just gave it a try. - What are you doing, Jang Chen?

885
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,400
- Nothing was working. - All right.

886
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,540
(They start feeling anxious.)

887
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,280
(He knocks them all over again!)

888
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,609
- It works when you're practicing. - When we're practicing.

889
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,350
- What was that? - Let's give it a try.

890
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,020
Was he acting?

891
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,479
I should stop practicing.

892
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,690
Practicing is harmful to me.

893
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,860
Let's clear Round One.

894
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,219
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

895
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,360
Here we go.

896
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,200
Don't you think the dominoes are too crooked?

897
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,959
- Push it in. - I'll do it for you.

898
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,170
Please reorganize it for us. You're a fan of god.

899
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,270
(Glancing at her)

900
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:32,500
There aren't any benefits.

901
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,239
(Kye Sang's wife is merciless.)

902
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,870
What kind of benefit did you expect?

903
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,840
I'm sorry.

904
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,009
Just like I practiced.

905
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,450
(Try number seven, Yo Han)

906
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,110
His hand is trembling.

907
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,690
Why did it suddenly go to the right?

908
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,990
It's okay.

909
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,359
I'm starting to get angry.

910
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,030
- Go ahead. - I have to stay focused.

911
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,569
Kye Sang, you are our only hope. Hit it.

912
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,240
Why won't this work?

913
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,870
- You give it a try. - Gosh.

914
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,910
Seriously.

915
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,970
Show us.

916
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:12,679
(Kye Sang gets ready.)

917
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,560
(Try number seven, Yo Han, Yeon Seok, Kye Sang)

918
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,950
Knock them over, Kye Sang.

919
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,559
(Gasping)

920
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,530
I love you, god.

921
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,430
I remember you, god.

922
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,600
(She forgives him.)

923
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,369
Even Kye Sang is human.

924
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,370
I'm sorry.

925
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:40,670
Of course he can get angry.

926
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,899
We've practiced enough.

927
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,139
My finger hurts from all the practice.

928
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
(Jae Suk is the last player.)

929
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,910
I think he'll knock them over.

930
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,071
(Please knock them over like you did when practicing.)

931
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,090
They're still standing.

932
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,489
(Swaying)

933
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,960
(The bottle cap brushed against the dominoes.)

934
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,360
You hit it.

935
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,199
(Seventh attempt, failed)

936
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,880
- Do we have one person left? - It's over.

937
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,299
- Really? - How many tries do we have left?

938
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,100
- What should we do? - How should we do this?

939
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,899
- This is driving me crazy. - Everything we tried isn't working.

940
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,240
Focusing doesn't help.

941
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,880
We can't even get past Round One.

942
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,909
(Succeeding in Round 1 seems just out of reach.)

943
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,910
Seriously, I...

944
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,150
This is so hard.

945
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,820
Is this it? I think this is it.

946
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,360
This is it.

947
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,959
(He hits the dominoes every time.)

948
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,659
- Let's try. - Let's try.

949
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,430
Line them up quickly.

950
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,130
- Right now. - Go ahead.

951
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,829
Okay, it's ready.

952
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,100
- Here we go. - Here we go.

953
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,840
This is try number nine. Here we go.

954
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,080
Here we go.

955
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,710
(Yeon Seok knocks over 3.)

956
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,420
(Now there are three people left.)

957
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
I think you have to do it from here.

958
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
(There is only one domino left.)

959
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,719
- Yo Han. - Yes.

960
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,960
- That's impressive. - I just tried it.

961
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,789
- Why is there one left? - The other dominoes...

962
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,399
- They're blocking it. - Pretend they aren't there.

963
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,170
- You made the cap jump earlier. - Pretend they aren't there.

964
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,099
(He tries to avoid the obstacles as he aims.)

965
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,799
- Is this okay? - That's good.

966
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,170
- That's good. - It looks good.

967
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,690
(It fell over!)

968
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,120
(Yo Han did it!)

969
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,360
(His voice has never been louder today.)

970
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,960
We did it.

971
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,060
- We did it. - We did it.

972
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,299
We succeeded.

973
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,470
(Round 1, success!)

974
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,539
Round One, the tickets to Jeju Island.

975
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,709
- Success. - Success.

976
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,969
(They win the plane tickets to Jeju Island.)

977
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,609
- How many tries do we have left? - We have one try left.

978
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,609
- We have 1 try left. - For Round 2.

979
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,909
You can go to Round Two if you want.

980
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,319
- Okay. - But if we go to Round Two...

981
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,719
and fail,

982
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,589
you will lose your present from Round One.

983
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,089
- Okay. - Sang Hyun.

984
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,460
Will you go to Round 2 or stop? In 1, 2, 3.

985
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,359
Are your nails okay?

986
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,399
- They're okay, but... - Are you thinking of...

987
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,430
Go.

988
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,200
- Let's continue. - This can't be real.

989
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,239
- Wait a minute. - Wait.

990
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,409
Why did he say, "go?"

991
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,540
I made up my mind after seeing how you knocked it over.

992
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,610
- Still... - We succeeded after so many tries.

993
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,509
Am I seeing clearly?

994
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,879
This is unbelievable.

995
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,280
- Are you really introverted? - Gosh.

996
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,519
He said, "go."

997
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,719
Unbelievable.

998
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,519
- Let's check the present first. - Okay.

999
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,619
- This is for Round 2. - Yes, Round 2.

1000
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,960
I don't believe it.

1001
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,890
He's fearless.

1002
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,459
"I always listen to music when I'm working or taking a walk."

1003
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,669
"AirPods Max."

1004
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,729
(I always listen to music.)

1005
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,900
(AirPods Max)

1006
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,299
- Round 2. - We only have 1 try.

1007
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,109
Okay, this is an intense situation.

1008
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,739
(Round 2)

1009
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,910
(The number of dominoes increases.)

1010
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,779
- I knew it. - This is ridiculous.

1011
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,980
I knew it.

1012
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,080
Each person has to knock over two dominoes.

1013
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,149
- That's right. - You have to hit the center.

1014
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,396
- You could hit it from the side. - This is very difficult.

1015
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,920
(Or we could hit it from the side.)

1016
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,389
- But... - That might actually be better.

1017
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,860
- You're right. - Yes.

1018
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,490
This is...

1019
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,159
(Surprised)

1020
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,499
- Let's try. - I'd like to practice.

1021
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,530
Give it a try.

1022
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
I got the hang of it.

1023
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,070
- That's right. - Gosh.

1024
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,039
After you and I do this...

1025
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,209
and either Yo Han or Kye Sang knock over the last domino,

1026
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,479
- that'd be amazing. - It'd be a miracle.

1027
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
- It'd be a miracle. - Give it a try.

1028
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,749
- Today's mission isn't easy. - I think I flick it too hard.

1029
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,320
Push them closer together.

1030
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,150
(The direction is precise.)

1031
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,290
(He tries again.)

1032
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,659
- You did it. - I was flicking it too hard.

1033
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,859
- I got the hang of it. - Don't you have to try, Yo Han?

1034
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,489
- I have to practice. - Are you aiming for the side?

1035
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,259
We're doing better than I expected.

1036
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,500
- It's because we practiced a lot. - You're right.

1037
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,430
A miracle could happen.

1038
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,499
- Let's go. It's our last try. - Let's go.

1039
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,839
It's try number ten. Come on, Sang Hyun.

1040
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,909
(Their 1st and last try in Round 2.)

1041
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,840
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

1042
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,040
Let's go. Be confident and do what you did just now.

1043
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,779
Let's go.

1044
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,049
(Using the side strategy like he did during practice)

1045
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,080
(Last try: Kye Sang)

1046
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,150
(Kye Sang failed.)

1047
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,149
- It's okay. - Wait.

1048
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,719
I think I know what to do now.

1049
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,000
We still have three people left.

1050
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,429
Hopefully, I'll hit either side.

1051
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,560
- Imagine they're spread out. - Okay.

1052
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,629
- I don't feel pressured. - Please.

1053
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,330
(Just do it the way you practiced.)

1054
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,630
Gosh.

1055
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,070
You have to feel pressured.

1056
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,139
I'm sorry, but it's true.

1057
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,869
Starting with you, we need to feel pressured.

1058
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,010
Come on.

1059
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,879
Yo Han and Yeon Seok might pull off a miracle.

1060
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
(There's no room to back down.)

1061
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:52,210
Imagine they're spread out.

1062
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,319
Knock over either row.

1063
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,350
That's right.

1064
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,159
- That was... - Okay.

1065
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,500
Yeon Seok...

1066
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,269
can hit up to three targets at once.

1067
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,899
Don't say things like that.

1068
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,069
Suk Ku and Seung Won...

1069
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,539
- set a precedent. - I see.

1070
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,639
(The history of miraculously hitting several targets at once)

1071
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,080
I think...

1072
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,049
- it's about time you did it. - You're right.

1073
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,750
- It's today. - You're amazing.

1074
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,279
- All right. - We've been building up...

1075
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,896
- That's right. - to the dramatic climax.

1076
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
It's about time I knocked them over.

1077
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,220
I'll show you.

1078
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,520
- Yoo One Shot. - I'll knock it over at once.

1079
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,729
Deciding to continue when we only had one try left...

1080
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,860
was to make it more dramatic, right?

1081
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,440
- You did so well. - He was amazing.

1082
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,839
(Final failure)

1083
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,309
If the three of us knocked over those dominoes...

1084
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,550
You should've gone first and let us knock over the rest.

1085
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,580
- It's okay. - Goodness.

1086
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,789
- We did our best. - Of course. I'm okay.

1087
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,459
- Well... - This really is...

1088
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,490
(Staring at something)

1089
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
They quickly took away the presents.

1090
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,430
This is disappointing.

1091
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:12,736
(The presents suddenly disappeared.)

1092
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,860
Well...

1093
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,069
This is how it ended.

1094
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,930
Yeon Seok did so well...

1095
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,169
at the end.

1096
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,570
- He did a good job. - I should've knocked them over.

1097
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,010
Why don't you give Sang Hyun these souvenirs, at least?

1098
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,210
This is cruel.

1099
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,110
It's like putting a person...

1100
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,320
on an emotional rollercoaster.

1101
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,689
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1102
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,749
I made the choice.

1103
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,950
Please accept these souvenirs.

1104
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,059
- Thank you. - It's a Whenever Possible clock...

1105
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,559
- and a T-shirt. - I'm sorry.

1106
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,489
I'd like to thank Sang Hyun once again.

1107
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,830
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1108
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,159
(It's even more disappointing because it seemed possible.)

1109
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,430
This is disappointing.

1110
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,729
- I knocked those over. - It wasn't easy.

1111
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,769
I knocked a few over.

1112
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,850
- Yeon Shik did a good job. - That was really close.

1113
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,940
Where is our next Whenever Guest?

1114
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,869
I feel discouraged to start the day with a defeat.

1115
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,180
This makes it hard.

1116
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,850
I feel so bad.

1117
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,149
I really feel bad.

1118
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,550
It leaves you feeling drained.

1119
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,949
- I bet it does. - Yes.

1120
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,249
- My heart is heavy. - I feel sad.

1121
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,820
- The next guest is at 3pm. - Okay.

1122
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,319
- Let's have lunch first. - We have plenty of time.

1123
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,389
There are so many places to eat around here.

1124
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,989
What do you like to eat for lunch?

1125
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,559
- I eat everything. - Me too.

1126
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,200
Have you gone to any restaurant nearby?

1127
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,599
- No. - Around here? Not really.

1128
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
(He isn't the type to look for good restaurants.)

1129
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,209
There are so many good restaurants.

1130
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,869
- Should I give you a few options? - Yes.

1131
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,370
There are so many good restaurants.

1132
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,809
There is jokbal over rice,

1133
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,450
Japanese food, an udon place...

1134
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,860
Everything you mentioned is Japanese.

1135
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,390
- You must like Japanese food. - He does.

1136
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,660
- That isn't true. - He's Goo Dong Mae.

1137
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,860
You totally looked Japanese when you tried the glasses on.

1138
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,380
- Goo Dong Mae. - Seriously.

1139
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,400
Since we have Jang Chen with us today,

1140
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,700
let's have either Chinese or Japanese.

1141
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,740
(Japanese for Goo Dong Mae or Chinese for Jang Chen?)

1142
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:03,869
There's also a Thai restaurant.

1143
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,039
(Gasping)

1144
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,479
Thai food sounds good.

1145
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,709
We have to turn over there.

1146
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,549
- I feel... Wait. - They're all Japanese restaurants.

1147
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,649
- Next time. - There are so many here.

1148
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,296
- There are many Japanese places. - There are many Japanese places.

1149
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,480
Eel pot rice.

1150
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
That sounds tasty.

1151
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:18,390
Pot rice sounds good.

1152
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,119
Can we choose whatever we want?

1153
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,719
- Yes, go ahead. - What do you like?

1154
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,189
- Let's eat whatever you want. - Seriously.

1155
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,550
Let's eat somewhere that's nearby.

1156
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,060
- What? - No.

1157
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,960
I like how you choose.

1158
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,970
(The closest restaurant)

1159
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,576
- Yeon Shik is different. - Let's have pot rice.

1160
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,669
- Let's go. - Eel pot rice.

1161
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,369
What about Thai food?

1162
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,539
Do you want to see photos?

1163
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,939
- No, let's go here. - We can have Thai food.

1164
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,409
- Let's just go here. - It looks nice.

1165
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,509
What do you want to do?

1166
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,909
- Jang Chen, - Let's go.

1167
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,579
- you and Goo Dong Mae decide. - Let's go.

1168
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,079
- Let's go. - I'm curious.

1169
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,520
You're both good at fighting.

1170
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,549
Jang Chen and Goo Dong Mae decide.

1171
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,219
(Two grand universes meet.)

1172
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,220
- Jang Chen. - No.

1173
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:56,289
I feel bad having lunch comfortably.

1174
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,759
- Let's go, then. - After failing at the game.

1175
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,830
- Okay. - Right.

1176
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,699
Let's turn right.

1177
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
(They decide to go to the Thai restaurant.)

1178
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:03,141
- Turning right. - The restaurant...

1179
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,269
is unique.

1180
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,300
You're right.

1181
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,310
You haven't even seen it yet.

1182
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,170
It was an automatic response.

1183
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,840
Just let it go.

1184
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,710
I don't feel like talking right now.

1185
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,650
The disappointment is quite big.

1186
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,320
When Sang Hyun said "go..."

1187
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,759
with only one more try left, I was honestly shocked.

1188
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,560
- I was really surprised. - I was shocked.

1189
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,390
It would've been nice if one of you knocked them over.

1190
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,400
You aren't very competitive, are you, Kye Sang?

1191
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,469
I used to be competitive,

1192
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,470
- You used to be, right? - but not anymore.

1193
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:38,600
- Not anymore? - No.

1194
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,999
I'm not very competitive either.

1195
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,769
What about you, Yeon Seok?

1196
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,039
I'm not that competitive.

1197
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,539
- You don't seem overly competitive. - I'm not.

1198
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,540
What about you, Yo Han?

1199
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,280
- I'm not very competitive. - Right?

1200
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,309
It seemed like that today.

1201
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,080
We're doomed today.

1202
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,279
Let's find our competitive spirit after having lunch.

1203
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,919
- Yes, let's bring it out. - Okay.

1204
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,789
Even if we aren't competitive,

1205
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,589
- let's try our best. - We have to succeed next time.

1206
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,989
- We have to succeed. - Yes.

1207
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,889
If we go home after failing again,

1208
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,189
- we'll feel horrible. - I bet.

1209
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,230
I can't go home like that.

1210
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,759
We're here.

1211
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,699
Is it gone? No, it's over there.

1212
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,330
- Where? - Seobu Power.

1213
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,439
- That's it? - That's the restaurant.

1214
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,640
It must be a good restaurant.

1215
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,609
- There's a line. - It has an interesting vibe.

1216
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,610
But it's crowded.

1217
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,770
It's crowded.

1218
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,410
- Hi. - Hi.

1219
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,949
Yeon Shik.

1220
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,049
- There's a wait. - It won't be easy to eat there.

1221
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,880
Should we go over there then?

1222
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,619
- Jeolla Province. - Should we try it?

1223
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,649
Jeolla Province food.

1224
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,789
- This looks amazing. - Okay.

1225
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,359
- Set meal, - Let's have the set meal.

1226
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,620
Okay, the set meal.

1227
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,030
- Hello. - Hello.

1228
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,589
We only accept meal tickets.

1229
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,829
- Excuse me? - We only accept meal tickets.

1230
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,260
- Then... - Then...

1231
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,130
- Okay. - Okay, have a nice day.

1232
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,769
They must be...

1233
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,929
They only accept set meals.

1234
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,039
Then...

1235
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,400
What about that driver diner?

1236
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,570
The driver diner sounds good.

1237
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,239
- They're... - Wait a minute.

1238
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,910
Now we're going anywhere we see.

1239
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,280
Let's just go there.

1240
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,949
When we're in Songridan-gil.

1241
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,480
What are we supposed to do when there is nowhere else to go?

1242
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,119
(The four are lost.)

1243
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,756
There is also an instant udon and jjajang place.

1244
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,219
What do you think...

1245
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,390
- of the Hong Kong restaurant? - Let's try it.

1246
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,190
We have to make a left there to go back to that place.

1247
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,929
- We'll see the eel place. - That's right.

1248
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,260
- Should we go here? - Come on.

1249
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
(Marveling)
Let's go.

1250
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,399
- Hello. - Goodness.

1251
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,120
(They end up going to a nearby udon place.)

1252
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,680
This is hilarious. We wandered around and ended up here.

1253
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,240
- It looks tasty. - Thank you.

1254
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,479
I'll have something simple.

1255
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,640
The fried shrimp udon.

1256
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,649
- I'll have the same. - Okay.

1257
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,509
I'll have a zaru udon.

1258
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,279
- I'll have a cream udon. - All right.

1259
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,290
Thank you.

1260
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,549
(Looking around)

1261
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,790
This is hilarious.

1262
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,060
Can we have four aprons?

1263
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Here's an apron for you.

1264
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,159
- Since we're wearing white. - He brought several.

1265
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,259
(Yo Han gets everyone aprons.)

1266
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,500
You're so considerate.

1267
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,929
- Yo Han. - Yes, he is.

1268
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,100
I don't wear aprons.

1269
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,100
I let it splash on my clothes if it happens.

1270
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,399
I'm sure you'll get it on your clothes.

1271
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,569
(His expression says, "Sure.")

1272
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,569
Since we're wearing white.

1273
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,810
I spilled something on my pants before the shoot.

1274
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,510
Your face was funny.

1275
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,580
(He responds with a look when Jae Suk acts tough.)

1276
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,449
You said you weren't wearing it.

1277
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,489
I should be ready.

1278
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,926
(He gets ready faster than anyone else.)

1279
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,890
- What's that? - Gosh.

1280
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,390
What is this?

1281
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,860
It looks good.

1282
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,929
- It looks like sashimi. - What is this?

1283
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,060
It looks like rope.

1284
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,860
It's rope.

1285
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,730
It's a ssireum belt.

1286
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,870
The noodles are very thick.

1287
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,099
It's very springy.

1288
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,370
- It's squid ink. - They used too much.

1289
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,279
- It's to attract young people. - Gosh.

1290
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,026
- So they can post on social media. - Look how much that is.

1291
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,310
It's unique.

1292
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,420
Let me give it a try.

1293
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
(Slurping)

1294
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,290
(Focusing)

1295
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,320
It looks fake.

1296
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,289
The noodles are really chewy.

1297
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,859
- They are? - The fried shrimp udon.

1298
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,089
You can hand it to me.

1299
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,389
(The next dish is served.)

1300
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,530
- That's fried batter on top. - Okay.

1301
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,859
This looks tasty.

1302
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,970
It looks fake.

1303
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,540
(He tries the pollack roe cream udon.)

1304
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,640
It's so thick.

1305
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,910
(A sip of fried shrimp udon)

1306
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,650
It's good, isn't it?

1307
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,749
The soup is incredible.

1308
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,850
Do you want a sip?

1309
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,819
- The soup is so good. - Can I get some of that?

1310
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,020
(Slurping)

1311
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,429
- The soup is amazing, right? - Yes.

1312
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,430
It is.

1313
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,760
They make good broth.

1314
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,259
Try this.

1315
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,730
(He begins eating in earnest after offering them the soup.)

1316
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,640
Yo Han, you must've been craving udon.

1317
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,040
- I was hungry. - Really?

1318
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,340
And this tastes so good.

1319
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,310
- The soup is good. - It is.

1320
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,280
(He eats well.)

1321
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,480
He's really enjoying it.

1322
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,449
This makes me so happy.

1323
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,170
When the restaurant I just walked into turned out to be a great one.

1324
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,159
(They finish eating in no time.)

1325
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,360
- I am full now. - I got full in no time.

1326
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,890
What game should we...

1327
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,499
Right. Should we start the game?

1328
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,999
Let's think.

1329
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,770
Why don't we play a simple game...

1330
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,269
of Zero?

1331
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,400
Zero!

1332
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,340
Should we use our hands for once?

1333
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,139
- The classic version. - Yes, the classic way.

1334
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,309
- Okay. - That's a good idea.

1335
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,790
- Do you know this game? - Of course.

1336
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,240
All right. Let's play.

1337
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,880
If you win, you're exempted.

1338
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,109
The one who guesses right is out?

1339
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,980
- Yes. - The last one pays.

1340
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,549
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to decide.

1341
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,866
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1342
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,350
Rock, paper, scissors.

1343
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,989
- We're going counter-clockwise. - Counter-clockwise?

1344
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,490
- Okay. - All right.

1345
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,130
- All right. Three. - Wait.

1346
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,299
- Hang on. - I got it.

1347
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,369
- No. - No.

1348
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,329
- I did it! You guys are so... - No.

1349
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,239
- That doesn't count. - You guys are cheaters!

1350
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,000
- Please calm down. - What is this?

1351
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,769
- You... - I actually won.

1352
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,469
- That was on camera, right? - No.

1353
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,879
- He's nodding. - That doesn't count.

1354
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,320
You're supposed to say, "Here I go."

1355
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,079
What? This is how you treat your guests?

1356
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,579
Are we going counter-clockwise?

1357
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,680
- I think so. - You're taking his side?

1358
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,790
- All right. - Let's start.

1359
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,120
- Be careful. - Here I go.

1360
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,960
Three.

1361
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,160
See?

1362
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,260
Thank you for the meal.

1363
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,660
You don't have to leave.

1364
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,559
- Why did I do that? - My turn, right?

1365
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,160
(The remaining three will keep playing.)

1366
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,470
No, it's just the three of us now.

1367
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,040
(Kye Sang is exempted.)

1368
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,269
(Jae Suk's turn)

1369
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,370
Two.

1370
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,080
(Jae Suk is exempted.)

1371
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,680
Wait. How did it turn out like this?

1372
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,196
It might end before I even get a chance to play.

1373
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,450
You can defeat him.

1374
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,649
- I can't defeat a younger guy. - Right.

1375
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,820
- Yo Han can be... - What number are you going to say?

1376
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,620
- What? - It's a mind game now.

1377
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,029
I can't...

1378
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,929
I'll say, "Two."

1379
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,230
- Two? - Yes.

1380
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,660
(Nodding)

1381
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,070
Yes.

1382
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,070
One, two. Zero.

1383
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,840
Zero.

1384
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,680
Zero.

1385
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
(I survived.)

1386
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,249
(He said "zero" after telling him he'd say "two.")

1387
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,350
- You're so cunning. - How cunning.

1388
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,589
Yo Han.

1389
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,590
(His cunning mind game failed.)

1390
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:07,559
I was going to say "two" with both thumbs up.

1391
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,660
Yo Han's turn.

1392
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,230
- What are you going to play? - Me?

1393
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,490
(The 2nd mind game)

1394
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,760
I'll put up the number you say. I mean it.

1395
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,800
How many thumbs do you want me to put up?

1396
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:18,899
One.

1397
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,269
- One? Okay. I got you. - Yes.

1398
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,670
- Just one. Please. - Okay.

1399
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,509
- I'll only put one thumb up. - Just one.

1400
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,270
I'm serious. I wouldn't cheat a junior.

1401
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,340
- Do you mean it? - Yes.

1402
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,080
Let's see if he means it.

1403
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,020
Two.

1404
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,150
Two.

1405
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,549
(Yeon Seok loses.)

1406
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,320
That was so ugly.

1407
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,760
(Laughing)

1408
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,330
He threw another curveball.

1409
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,070
- He still... - He's also impressive.

1410
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,730
- He switched. - He's...

1411
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,029
also a competitor.

1412
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,230
He switched.

1413
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,670
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1414
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,899
- Here it is. - Yes.

1415
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,069
Your total is 82.5 dollars.

1416
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,440
He's really paying.

1417
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,540
- Do you need a receipt? - That's okay.

1418
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,049
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

1419
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,210
Thank you.

1420
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,156
- Thanks for the food, Yeon Shik. - No problem.

1421
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,279
Thank you for the food.

1422
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,350
Thank you.

1423
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,120
Let's do a better job in the second one.

1424
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,489
Sure.

1425
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,959
(Let's do a better job.)

1426
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,896
- Let's do well, Kye Sang. - It does make me feel competitive.

1427
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,159
It does.

1428
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,290
- When you fail in the first one... - Oh, no.

1429
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,699
Let's go and crush it this time.

1430
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,899
(Headed for the next spare time with determination)

1431
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,229
The weather's not so bad...

1432
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,190
- to walk there. - Yes, the weather's not so bad.

1433
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,070
I feel better now that my belly is full.

1434
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,069
The path around Seokchon Lake is so beautiful, though.

1435
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,770
(Excited)

1436
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,810
Do you think we're out on a picnic today?

1437
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,910
Yeon Shik.

1438
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,180
Jae Suk!

1439
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,080
Hi. There are...

1440
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,449
many places that read your saju and tarot cards.

1441
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,990
(The master of communication can't take a break.)

1442
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,919
Eel pot rice would have tasted good.

1443
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,060
I wonder...

1444
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,690
what it feels like having the whole country recognize you.

1445
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,229
(He wonders what it's like to be Jae Suk.)

1446
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,200
- That's... - The whole country knows you.

1447
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,300
- They all look so happy today. - Right?

1448
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,700
Good afternoon.

1449
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,209
- There are many couples here too. - Yes, there are.

1450
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,880
This is a great dating spot.

1451
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,980
That's why there are so many fortune tellers.

1452
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,810
There were times when I used to...

1453
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,850
roll down the windows in my car...

1454
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,689
and let people outside listen to my songs too.

1455
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,390
- You're lying. - I'm serious.

1456
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,819
When you first buy a car,

1457
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,490
you have to play music loudly.

1458
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,960
- You can't do that nowadays. - Never.

1459
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,830
I used to love driving...

1460
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,430
and cars.

1461
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,669
So, I enjoyed driving.

1462
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,870
Now...

1463
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,910
Maybe it's because I'm getting old. I keep saying this.

1464
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,009
- I try not to drive now. - It's natural.

1465
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,940
- That's natural, right? - Very natural.

1466
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,350
Everyone ages.

1467
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,250
But you haven't aged a bit.

1468
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,020
That's what old people say to each other.

1469
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,390
But I think you're a little special.

1470
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,759
But your beards look so cool, Kye Sang.

1471
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,360
- They do. - They didn't grow until I was 24,

1472
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,859
- but I once applied... - Yes.

1473
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,420
A hair growth product with Kim Tae Woo.

1474
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,206
- And we both grew the same beards. - Really?

1475
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,399
- Really? - Our beards look exactly the same.

1476
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,740
Hair growth products were a thing once.

1477
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,040
Was it to grow beards?

1478
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,669
Yes, to get beards.

1479
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,679
I didn't know they did that back then.

1480
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,839
And your beards actually grow.

1481
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,649
- Beards were a trend. - That's right.

1482
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,079
So, Haha also applied hair growth products.

1483
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,879
- Yes! And it actually works. - Yes.

1484
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,080
Male actors have a dream of growing a nice beard.

1485
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,190
Also, it's easier to act in historical dramas with a beard.

1486
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,080
- That's true. - You can use your own beard.

1487
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,789
I had to attach a beard every time I played Goo Dong Mae.

1488
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,929
- In the summer... - It's tough, isn't it?

1489
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,990
It sounds tormenting.

1490
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,029
With glue and everything. I kept eating the fake beard.

1491
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,099
It gets into your mouth when you eat.

1492
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,370
And it falls.

1493
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,370
Yeon Seok, how long will it take from here?

1494
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,139
(They've been walking for 15 minutes.)

1495
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,980
I feel like we're in a different neighborhood.

1496
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,480
- I mean... - There's a kalguksu place now.

1497
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,679
It's right across the street.

1498
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,010
Are you sure we're still in Songpa-gu?

1499
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,350
At this rate,

1500
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,980
we might have to get a taxi.

1501
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,250
You know?

1502
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,290
- Yoo Joo Ha. - Joo Ha.

1503
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,659
"I moved to Jamsil..."

1504
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,230
"for 10 points instead of 100 points."

1505
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,129
"Everything felt unfamiliar at first,"

1506
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,136
"but my friends were the ones who reached out to me."

1507
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,829
"As we sweated together,"

1508
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,029
- "we've truly become a family." - Really?

1509
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,369
"I hope to make unforgettable memories..."

1510
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,540
"with the nine friends who are always by my side,"

1511
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,569
"before class and during vacation."

1512
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,010
The person is in a group.

1513
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,709
- That means... - It must be a student.

1514
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,350
- Maybe. - It's an academy.

1515
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,880
An academy!

1516
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,019
(They hurriedly called a taxi.)

1517
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,180
Good afternoon, sir.

1518
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,750
Let's do a good job this time.

1519
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,059
- Yes. - I'm going to succeed.

1520
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,419
I bet it's going to get physical.

1521
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,830
Yes, let's do a better job.

1522
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,990
Kye Sang, you like to work out, don't you?

1523
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,729
I do, but I can barely work out now.

1524
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,370
- Why not? - My body is all worn out.

1525
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,630
I'm serious.

1526
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,639
He must have exercised so much.

1527
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,199
- You tried... - You were so fit.

1528
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,769
It was because I thought...

1529
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,910
getting in shape would bring me success.

1530
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,820
I don't know why I thought that.

1531
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,250
Exercising was the only thing I could do at the time.

1532
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,779
You were preparing yourself for anything.

1533
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,950
- Exactly. - Right?

1534
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,680
But it was useless.

1535
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,549
(Laughing)

1536
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,760
I have to lose some muscles if I get too big.

1537
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,159
- Right. To fit the role. - Yes.

1538
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,259
I only get the roles that require me to get smaller.

1539
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,620
- Right. - So, I lost the muscles.

1540
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,560
From talking to him today, I realized...

1541
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,230
that he's reached a state of inner peace.

1542
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,269
That's why he enjoys...

1543
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,516
- being on variety shows now. - You're right.

1544
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,409
- It's like he's let go of things. - Indeed.

1545
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,840
- It feels like... - Yes.

1546
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:28,309
- I'm no longer tense. - Good.

1547
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,410
I feel relaxed.

1548
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,880
If you could be tense when we play the game...

1549
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,920
How about I start obsessing over it?

1550
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,280
Start doing that today.

1551
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,826
- You won't be able to go home. - Bring out your competitiveness.

1552
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,860
You have to show us today.

1553
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:45,129
He used to be so competitive back in the day.

1554
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,560
- Way too competitive. - Right.

1555
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,330
I feel like they're kids.

1556
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,530
- Let's make it this time. - So, this is what it feels like.

1557
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,300
Don't be too obsessed...

1558
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,409
- with winning, though. - Right.

1559
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,510
We should just let go of it.

1560
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,180
We're in a school zone.

1561
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,080
All right? Good.

1562
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,579
- It's a good mindset. - It really is.

1563
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,679
It's a great mindset.

1564
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,819
- Good. - Yes.

1565
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,249
I think we're almost there.

1566
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,349
Wait. It's a school.

1567
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,649
It's a school zone.

1568
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,720
This is...

1569
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,410
- It's an elementary school. - Are they elementary school kids?

1570
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,429
- We've arrived. - Thank you, sir.

1571
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,399
- Oh, it's... - It's an elementary school.

1572
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,199
- Seriously? - How do we keep getting kids?

1573
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,570
I'd feel terrible if I lost.

1574
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,969
It's an elementary school.

1575
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,770
- Another elementary school? - Oh, boy.

1576
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,870
- I'll feel terrible when I lose. - It's Bangi Elementary School.

1577
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,639
- Another school. - Yeon Seok,

1578
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,910
- I'm so nervous. - We talked about it earlier.

1579
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,309
What if we fail?

1580
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,396
(They failed in Dochang Elementary and Yangjae Elementary.)

1581
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,050
When I fail to give the students their prizes...

1582
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,650
It makes me especially nervous.

1583
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,690
It's more pressure for us.

1584
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:49,860
That's cute.

1585
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,060
"Archery Team?"

1586
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,289
(They went to the address.)

1587
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,000
It's the school's archery team.

1588
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,230
Yoo Joo Ha.

1589
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,000
(Is it an elementary school kid in an archery team?)

1590
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,770
- Is this it? - They're archers.

1591
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,909
It's an archery team room.

1592
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,239
- Hello. - Good afternoon.

1593
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,639
- Hello. - Hello, ma'am.

1594
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,479
Is Yoo Joo Ha here?

1595
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
That's me.

1596
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,749
- Hello. - Hi.

1597
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,920
- Wait. - Hello.

1598
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,820
- This is... - They were an archery team!

1599
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,149
- Shall we head inside? - Yes.

1600
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,150
(Carefully entering)

1601
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,660
- You can shoot your last shot. - Yes, go ahead.

1602
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,690
(Concentrating instantly)

1603
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,060
Goodness.

1604
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,830
Oh, my.

1605
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,170
(Amazed)

1606
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,899
(This is where they pull the bowstring back every day, )

1607
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,870
(aiming straight for a perfect 10.)

1608
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,210
(Bangi Elementary School's archery team with vigor)

1609
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,779
(Observing silently)

1610
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,150
They're very serious.

1611
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,320
They have plushies on all of them.

1612
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,729
- They must be their bow stands. - I guess so.

1613
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,450
(There's a stuffed toy on every bow stand.)

1614
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:02,500
Last shot.

1615
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,100
(They stay focused until the end.)

1616
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,139
They're all so passionate.

1617
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,699
- They are. - During practice,

1618
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,939
they have fantastic concentration.

1619
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,079
- We're celebrities, - Right.

1620
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,680
- yet they're unaffected. - Indeed.

1621
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,210
They only stare at the target.

1622
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,349
(However...)

1623
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,519
- No way. - It's Yoo Jae Suk.

1624
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,049
- It's actually Jae Suk. - I know, right?

1625
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,189
I just saw Jae Suk.

1626
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,790
Am I dreaming?

1627
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,089
(They were hiding their excitement behind the calmness.)

1628
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,060
- Awesome. - They're cleaning up.

1629
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,259
I guess you're putting them here.

1630
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,989
Are you Joo Ha in fifth grade?

1631
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,730
- Yes. - It's so nice to meet you.

1632
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,729
Where should we talk?

1633
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,930
Do we sit here?

1634
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,130
Take your seats.

1635
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:40,139
(Shy)

1636
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,700
I just saw their names.

1637
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,409
There's Yu Ju and Joo Ha.

1638
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,679
- They have similar names. - Yu Ha and Yu Ju.

1639
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,439
Yu Ju, Joo Ha, Seo Yun...

1640
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,910
- There's Jong Min! - He's Jong Min.

1641
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,349
- That's a very familiar name. - We're familiar with it.

1642
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:54,550
I see.

1643
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,179
His name is different.

1644
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,890
Bo Gil.

1645
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,120
- Seo U. - Well...

1646
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,519
- Sorry? - It's a one-syllable name.

1647
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,719
Are you Hwangbo Gil?

1648
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,829
(Hwangbo Gil)

1649
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,960
- You always... - My bad, Bo Gil.

1650
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,029
You also called Namkoong Min by Koong Min.

1651
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,030
I just...

1652
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:13,130
I've made a tiny mistake.

1653
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,239
Joo Ha, you sent us a story.

1654
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,309
- Yes. - Yes.

1655
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,310
How long have you been practicing archery?

1656
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:19,909
It's been over two years,

1657
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,950
but it's only been a year since I joined this team.

1658
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,949
Did you move here because the archery team...

1659
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,949
of Bangi Elementary School was famous?

1660
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,649
How should I put it?

1661
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,219
I liked the atmosphere here.

1662
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,349
The atmosphere?

1663
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,019
- What kind of atmosphere? - What's it like?

1664
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,380
Atmospheres are crucial in sports.

1665
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,159
Seo U is friendly and cheerful.

1666
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,299
He's the team's energizer.

1667
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,830
Yes, he is.

1668
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,229
Really? Seo U sets the mood?

1669
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,970
- Yes. - How do you lift their spirits?

1670
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,769
- Talent show. - Talent show?

1671
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,509
- Really? - He has great party tricks.

1672
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,410
- What's your party trick? - Let's see.

1673
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,809
He stood up right away.

1674
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:54,980
There's always one in class.

1675
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,380
(Doing his little dance)

1676
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,879
That's a very old dance move.

1677
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,349
- That's from our generation. - That's adorable.

1678
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,496
- It's from our generation. - It's from our generation.

1679
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,889
They were standing in a line, and... I know this stuff.

1680
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:09,020
The first two kids had a shirt that said, "Seoul."

1681
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,480
Those two represent Seoul, right?

1682
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,690
- Yes. - Yes.

1683
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,000
- Who are they? - In the upper grades?

1684
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,559
(Da Hyeon and Jong Min are Seoul's representatives.)

1685
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,099
Has either of you won any competitions?

1686
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,829
Aren't you preparing for the National Junior Sports Festival?

1687
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,069
- We already competed. - We already competed.

1688
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,770
What was your record?

1689
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,409
I placed second overall in the individual category.

1690
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,769
That's impressive.

1691
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,280
And I took 1st place in both the 25m and 30m events.

1692
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,186
- National Junior Sports Festival. - What about you, Jong Min?

1693
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,910
I didn't win any.

1694
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,249
- You can do better next time. - That's okay.

1695
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,789
You can do better next time.

1696
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,319
- He used to be a Taekwondo athlete. - I see.

1697
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,960
Can you show them some of your kicks?

1698
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,859
Just a few. Maybe a side kick.

1699
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,189
- But I... - Your pants are pretty tight.

1700
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,599
It's been a while since I last trained, so...

1701
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,700
- Just a simple one. - Great.

1702
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,199
He was also an athlete,

1703
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,560
- so he has to show them. - I'll give them a demonstration.

1704
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,140
Maybe a kick like this.

1705
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,469
Maybe a kick like this.

1706
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,239
(Amazed)

1707
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,779
- His foot went up so high! - Yes.

1708
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,809
He really was an athlete.

1709
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,310
That was incredible.

1710
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,950
Among the junior athletes here,

1711
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,089
we might see some of them...

1712
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,789
in the Summer Games in a few years.

1713
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,620
- Exactly. - We will.

1714
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,530
- Definitely. - See what happens in a few years.

1715
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,759
This clip will be used on TV.

1716
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,759
- That's right. - "I was on Whenever Possible!"

1717
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,299
- Yes! - "I'm Joo Ha."

1718
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,499
- We'll be like, "Really?" - That's true.

1719
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,460
And you'll be invited to "You Quiz on the Block."

1720
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,599
(Spoilers for their future)

1721
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,709
Do you have more fun when you're in class...

1722
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,379
or when you're shooting arrows here?

1723
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,410
- Shooting arrows! - Shooting arrows!

1724
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,719
I can tell...

1725
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,450
that they're bright...

1726
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,749
and have good concentration.

1727
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,290
You can see...

1728
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,159
that none of them are losing posture.

1729
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,389
Normally, kids scream when they see Jae Suk.

1730
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,829
But they were incredibly calm.

1731
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,359
So, I thought they might not know who I was...

1732
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,330
- Were you disappointed? - No.

1733
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,899
- Do you know me? - Yes!

1734
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,199
- You know me? - Yes.

1735
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,540
My mother is a huge fan.

1736
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,539
- Yes, that's the right age. - Her mother.

1737
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,779
Yes. Your mother is probably...

1738
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,240
a fan of mine.

1739
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,880
Joo Ha, do you know Kye Sang and Yo Han?

1740
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,620
No.

1741
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,120
- But... - We're just regular citizens.

1742
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,719
We just wandered in because we were bored.

1743
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,420
"Citizens!"

1744
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,589
- We're all citizens. - Just a couple of locals.

1745
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,529
Do any of you know god?

1746
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,689
What's that?

1747
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,730
- god? - What is it?

1748
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,230
It's the Lord.

1749
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,600
It's spelled G-O-D.

1750
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,309
It's time to start the game.

1751
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,639
Yo Han, why don't you roll the dice this time?

1752
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,640
- I'll give it a go. - Yes.

1753
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:42,280
The former athlete will roll it.

1754
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,579
What number do you want?

1755
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,050
- Two. - Two.

1756
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,350
I shouldn't have asked.

1757
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,350
The senior athlete.

1758
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,050
All right.

1759
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:52,650
All right.

1760
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,390
- Two! - Two!

1761
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,590
- Two! - Two!

1762
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,260
(They get 2 coupons.)

1763
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,569
(Yo Han has done it!)

1764
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,869
This is great.

1765
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,639
- You gave them a gift. - Yes.

1766
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,670
Fantastic.

1767
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,210
- This is going great. - Awesome.

1768
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,710
(Drum rolls)

1769
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,779
"What we crave the most after practice is fried chicken."

1770
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,109
"We want one fried chicken per person."

1771
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,449
"A 300-dollar voucher for fried chicken."

1772
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,890
(The present in Round 1 is a 300-dollar voucher for chicken.)

1773
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,490
(Cheering)

1774
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,419
- You... - A 300-dollar voucher!

1775
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,180
Isn't that the franchise that you advertise?

1776
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,630
(Bowing)

1777
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,000
All right. You can get delicious fried chicken.

1778
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,769
(They get a fried chicken voucher by accomplishing this mission.)

1779
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,740
(Archery)

1780
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,669
(They take turns to shoot arrows, )

1781
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,370
(and they succeed if the total is 30 or higher.)

1782
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,640
(They're newbies, so they shoot from 15m away.)

1783
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,779
(And the target is 1.5 times bigger than that for children.)

1784
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,879
- It's 30 points? - The 4 of us have to get 30 points?

1785
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,149
Thirty points or higher.

1786
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,756
- All we need is 3 arrows. - Just 3 shots.

1787
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,219
They can get that in three shots.

1788
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,050
Yes, definitely.

1789
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,520
They're saying they only need three shots.

1790
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,560
Because they can shoot a ten.

1791
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,290
Goodness.

1792
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,460
Oh, we need equipment.

1793
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,430
I've always wanted to try archery, though.

1794
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,470
- I see. - I think I can do it.

1795
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,439
(Confident)

1796
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,900
- Good luck. - I think so too.

1797
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:20,370
I've always been good at shooting.

1798
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,509
(Amazed)

1799
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,709
When I was in the military.

1800
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,610
- Shooting? - Yes, firing rifles.

1801
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,580
Nice.

1802
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,920
You look good.

1803
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,850
Good.

1804
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,189
Put it under your chin.

1805
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,220
(They start training with the arrows.)

1806
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,190
Under your chin.

1807
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,390
Fire.

1808
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,259
That's good.

1809
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,200
- What's his point? - Nine.

1810
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:45,670
- Nine points. - Nine points!

1811
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,700
- Great. - Wait.

1812
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,200
Let's go for it.

1813
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,410
- That was a good shot. - Amazing.

1814
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,440
And you pull it.

1815
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,780
Just like you did before.

1816
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,310
In 1, 2, 3.

1817
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,410
Fire.

1818
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,080
At least, we all hit the target.

1819
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,420
In 1, 2, 3. Fire.

1820
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,790
What's my score?

1821
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,420
Fire.

1822
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,030
(It was close, but he hit a 9.)

1823
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:13,490
This is good.

1824
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,630
Nine points.

1825
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,030
Fire.

1826
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,130
(9 points)

1827
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,040
What's the score?

1828
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,910
- Nine. - Nine?

1829
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:25,609
This is good.

1830
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:26,916
(If they keep this up, they can pass Round 1.)

1831
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,279
- Now... - Have faith in me.

1832
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,609
- Okay. - All right?

1833
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,749
- I'll show you something. - Okay.

1834
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,449
I'll show you what I've got in Round Three.

1835
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,519
Thank you.

1836
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,550
(Laughing)

1837
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,189
Let's go for Round 1.

1838
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,849
The four of us have to shoot an arrow each...

1839
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,249
to get 30 points, and we pass Round 1.

1840
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,260
- That's right. - Let's do a chant.

1841
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,289
In 1, 2, 3.

1842
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,830
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1843
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,559
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

1844
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,860
- Just fire after counting to three. - Okay.

1845
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,500
The one that's sticking out should be near your body.

1846
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,200
Jae Suk. Give us a seven, at least.

1847
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,440
- I should hit higher than seven. - Yes.

1848
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,580
At least a seven.

1849
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,979
(Finally, the first shot)

1850
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:08,549
(Try number one, Jae Suk)

1851
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,550
What's the score?

1852
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,519
What's the score?

1853
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,249
- Six? - Six.

1854
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,689
- Six. - Six.

1855
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,720
(Regretful)

1856
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,929
(He wanted at least a 7, but he fell short.)

1857
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,130
It's not half bad.

1858
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,659
Six isn't that bad.

1859
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,760
Right.

1860
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:27,640
One of us can hit an 8 or a 9.

1861
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,940
Here goes Kye Sang.

1862
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,270
Good luck.

1863
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:38,250
(Jae Suk: 6, Kye Sang, Total: 6)

1864
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,320
Eight!

1865
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:45,150
- He hit an 8. The total is 14. - Yes!

1866
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,490
Fourteen?

1867
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,090
Let's go!

1868
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,520
Good. Yo Han.

1869
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,760
Our current total is 14.

1870
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,330
You need to hit at least an eight, Yo Han.

1871
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,830
You need to hit at least an eight, Yo Han.

1872
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,699
- This is intense. - It's tough to hit an eight.

1873
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,299
- Yo Han. - Yes?

1874
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,639
(Try number one)

1875
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,870
Let's cheer them up.

1876
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,179
You can do it.

1877
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,740
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1878
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,989
One, two, three. Shoot.

1879
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,290
- Hold on. Don't do that. - My gosh.

1880
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,690
Three. Shoot.

1881
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,259
(His calm voice breaks him down.)

1882
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,299
Is it bad if it takes longer than three seconds?

1883
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,699
- Shooting after three seconds is... - It's hard to hold longer.

1884
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,400
- That's the best? It's stable? - Yes.

1885
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,850
- Don't do that. - But that puts him under pressure.

1886
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,009
(Try number one)

1887
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:42,810
(He got 8 points.)

1888
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,450
It's 8. You got 8 points.

1889
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,420
Hold on.

1890
01:05:48,421 --> 01:05:50,380
- Then you need to get 8. - I need an 8?

1891
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:52,589
- You need to get 8 points. - Gosh.

1892
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:54,820
- You got precisely eight. - You need to...

1893
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,189
- Let's get eight. - Let's go!

1894
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,789
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1895
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,790
(Try number one)

1896
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:00,759
Hold on. Goodness. I need eight?

1897
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,730
You just need to get an eight.

1898
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,430
If you get 8 points, we win Round 1.

1899
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,269
What happens if they win right away?

1900
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,499
What do we do if they succeed right away?

1901
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,060
What do we do if they do it right away?

1902
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,579
(He got 6 points.)

1903
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,620
(It's 28 points in total. They failed by 2 points.)

1904
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,719
(Sighing)

1905
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,720
Gosh, they're so nice.

1906
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,359
(Sighing)

1907
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,729
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1908
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,900
Gosh, they're so nice.

1909
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,769
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1910
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,870
It was your first try.

1911
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,400
Goodness. They did this without knowing.

1912
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,040
(They sighed without knowing.)

1913
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,039
- This is hard. - It was close.

1914
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,410
But we're just beginning.

1915
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,909
- We've seen the possibility. - We could see that it was possible.

1916
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,550
You feel pressure when you go last.

1917
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,220
Kye Sang should be the last shooter.

1918
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,950
Gosh, no.

1919
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,219
Let's practice some more.

1920
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,419
We should practice.

1921
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,296
- I think we need practice. - We need to practice.

1922
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,030
(Yeon Seok goes first.)

1923
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,699
(He got 9 points.)

1924
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,730
Good.

1925
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,430
You should've done that earlier.

1926
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,670
(Jae Suk practices too.)

1927
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,370
- You got 8. It's 8 points. - What did I get?

1928
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,710
You did great.

1929
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,409
(He got 6 points.)

1930
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,379
- This is... - You should aim for the 6 below.

1931
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,779
- Right. - Imagine aiming seven on the clock.

1932
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,896
(Try aiming at the wrong point.)

1933
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,390
(He tries to aim at the wrong point.)

1934
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,289
(He got 10 points.)

1935
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,290
I got this.

1936
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,200
I know where to aim now. Seriously.

1937
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Gosh, he got ten points.

1938
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:46,930
He learned from me.

1939
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,439
- This is our third try. - What?

1940
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,200
He learned from me, and he got ten points.

1941
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,769
- Will you start, Kye Sang? - Aim a bit lower.

1942
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,279
- Okay. - All right. Let's go.

1943
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,679
Kye Sang who got the hang of it.

1944
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,339
This is our third try.

1945
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,309
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

1946
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,310
I got it.

1947
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,250
- Ready. - Let's go.

1948
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,349
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1949
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,619
(Try number three)

1950
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,860
I think he'll get ten points.

1951
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,769
(Try number three)

1952
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,170
(He got 10 points.)

1953
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,369
I couldn't see it well though.

1954
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,530
(He's the master of archery.)

1955
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,440
- Good job. - Kye Sang, it was amazing.

1956
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,980
(He got a clean shot.)

1957
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,980
(He looks so cool.)

1958
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,050
(Kye Sang did it.)

1959
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,090
That's legendary.

1960
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,590
He's cool.

1961
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,429
- Good job. - Kye Sang, it was amazing.

1962
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,790
- I know where to aim now. - Good.

1963
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,499
- Should I go? - Then...

1964
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,599
- You want to go next? - No, you should go.

1965
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Me?

1966
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:56,939
Actually, I'm not confident.

1967
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,370
Gosh. Shooting after someone who got a ten is...

1968
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,339
All right. We don't know what will happen though.

1969
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,479
He might get a ten.

1970
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,709
- Of course. - Right?

1971
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:04,850
- Yes. - Yes.

1972
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,619
- You can do it. - Let's go.

1973
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,219
- Let's go. - You got this.

1974
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,420
Let's go, Yeon Shik.

1975
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,989
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1976
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,089
(He got 5 points.)

1977
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,160
My goodness.

1978
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,060
What did he get?

1979
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,570
He got 5? So it's 15?

1980
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,640
- I'll go next. You go last, okay? - Okay.

1981
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,239
We got 15 points now.

1982
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,070
- We need 8 and 7. - Yes. We need 8 and 7.

1983
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,139
So we need 8 and 7.

1984
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,139
(Try number three)

1985
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,480
It shakes if you hold it for long.

1986
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,750
Right.

1987
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,050
(Sighing)

1988
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,819
Let's go.

1989
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,750
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1990
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,400
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1991
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,070
(He got a perfect shot.)

1992
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:01,870
(It's a ten!)

1993
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,340
(Exclaiming)

1994
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,650
Gosh, you did so great.

1995
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:17,419
- Gosh! - It's a ten!

1996
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,100
- That was so cool. - So we need five now.

1997
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,589
(They have 5 points left to go.)

1998
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,119
- We need 5 more points. - Just 5 more points.

1999
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,119
- We need 5 more points. - We just need to get more than 5.

2000
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,259
- He needs to get five points. - Five more points.

2001
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,759
If he gets 5 points, we win Round 1.

2002
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,080
He just needs to get five points.

2003
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,980
The prize is 300 dollars for chickens.

2004
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,100
This is driving me crazy.

2005
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:34,970
Please save our chickens.

2006
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,609
(He's under pressure to the max.)

2007
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,670
It made me even more nervous. What do I do?

2008
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,280
- Getting five points is easy. - Of course.

2009
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,580
Yo Han, your junior athletes are watching.

2010
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,989
Let's go.

2011
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,620
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2012
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,059
Their cheer sounded quite desperate.

2013
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,560
(Their cheer sounded more serious.)

2014
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:02,100
(The area where he can get more than 5 points)

2015
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,569
(He got 8 points.)

2016
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:11,610
You got it!

2017
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:14,279
- All right. - You got it!

2018
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,910
(They got 33 points. They succeed in Round 1.)

2019
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,550
(Thrilling)

2020
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,279
(The students were nervous too.)

2021
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,820
- It's a success. - We did it.

2022
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,960
- We did it. - We won in Round One.

2023
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,389
- All right. - We won in Round One.

2024
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,189
So we'll give you a chicken voucher worth 300 dollars.

2025
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,260
(They won the chicken gift voucher.)

2026
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:35,930
(I love chicken.)

2027
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:38,400
All right. Now, Joo Ha,

2028
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,399
you need to decide if you want to go for the second round.

2029
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,600
You need to choose.

2030
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,840
We have many tries left.

2031
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,070
- All right. - So...

2032
01:11:46,071 --> 01:11:47,169
- We have to do it. - Shall we go for it?

2033
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,209
Round Two, at least?

2034
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:49,339
- Joo Ha, we should go to Round Two. - We have many tries left.

2035
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,509
- Right. Round Two, at least. - Yes.

2036
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,509
- We should try Round Two. - I choose to go.

2037
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:53,809
- You choose to go? - It's a go.

2038
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,380
Now, check the prize.

2039
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,020
- Please read it. - What is it?

2040
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,589
"SD is hot these days."

2041
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:01,519
"Shoes decorating is most popular at Bangi Elementary School."

2042
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,889
"Nine pairs of Crocs."

2043
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,560
(Round 2 Prize, 9 Pairs of Crocs)

2044
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,020
- Nine pairs? So one for each? - Nine pairs.

2045
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,860
(Exclaiming)

2046
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,899
Gosh, they really love it.

2047
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,730
- Their reaction is amazing. - My goodness.

2048
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,869
They really love it.

2049
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,939
My goodness.

2050
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,239
They have the national flag too.

2051
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,240
(Shoes decorating is popular.)

2052
01:12:20,241 --> 01:12:21,279
9 pairs of Crocs

2053
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,340
- I'll take that one. - That's mine.

2054
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,449
(Round 2)

2055
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,009
(It's the same as Round 1.)

2056
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:31,550
(But the target gets smaller.)

2057
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,460
We need 30 points, and the target got smaller.

2058
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,460
That's the one we use to practice.

2059
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,689
Gosh, it got so small.

2060
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:39,129
- It's a lot smaller than before. - I know.

2061
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:40,189
It got so small.

2062
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,199
(The target for Round 2 is used by the archery team.)

2063
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,329
But we now got the hang of it a little bit.

2064
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,769
- Right. - Shall we try it?

2065
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:46,770
Let's go for the second round.

2066
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:48,769
- We should go for it. - In 1, 2, 3.

2067
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,070
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2068
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:52,710
- Well, should I go first? - Okay.

2069
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:53,909
All right.

2070
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,340
(Yeon Seok, who's in a slump, goes first.)

2071
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:00,209
It looks much smaller as we've seen the big one earlier.

2072
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,419
- It's so small. - Goodness.

2073
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,219
(Try number four)

2074
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,280
My goodness.

2075
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,049
- As the target got smaller... - It puts me under pressure.

2076
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,089
It puts us under pressure.

2077
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,410
(Smaller target, bigger pressure)

2078
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,229
- Breathing is important. - Right.

2079
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:13,390
I need to breathe moderately.

2080
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,759
Think that you're in the Summer Games.

2081
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,760
(He's the furious coach.)

2082
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,369
(He got 8 points.)

2083
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,370
- You got 8 points. - I got 8?

2084
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:22,769
- Good. - I did well enough.

2085
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,450
- That wasn't bad. - You got eight points.

2086
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,639
All right.

2087
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,770
(Happy)

2088
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,739
- That wasn't bad. - We might go to Round Three.

2089
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,780
Right. We might get there.

2090
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,309
(Try number four)

2091
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,610
I think I should shoot fast.

2092
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,649
After three seconds, my arms started to shake.

2093
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:37,989
(Master Archer Kye Sang shot a 10 earlier.)

2094
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,350
Kye Sang, get ten points for us.

2095
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,199
(He got 3 points.)

2096
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,229
Kye Sang totally lost...

2097
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,910
- He got three points. - his aiming point.

2098
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,769
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2099
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,570
Then, we have 11 points?

2100
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,069
Goodness. We need to get 9 and 10?

2101
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,580
We just need to get 9 and 10, right?

2102
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,179
- Yo Han. - Yes?

2103
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,749
You need to get a 10 or a 9.

2104
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:07,049
(They fail if he gets less than 9 points.)

2105
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,219
(Try number four)

2106
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,220
Please.

2107
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:12,050
Goodness. The Crocs.

2108
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,099
(He got 8 points.)

2109
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,580
- He got 8 points. - He got 8 points.

2110
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,070
(Even if Jae Suk shoots a 10...)

2111
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,369
This wasn't easy.

2112
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,346
(Even if Jae Suk shoots a 10, they still fail this round.)

2113
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,940
(But you've done a good job.)

2114
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,100
Kye Sang, you should find the aiming point.

2115
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,409
- Gosh. What's going on? - You should adjust your aim.

2116
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:41,419
I think I should do that.

2117
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,719
By the way, we...

2118
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,919
We have two chances where Joo Ha can shoot for us.

2119
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,289
- Oh, right. - That's right.

2120
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,519
- Okay. - Then it means...

2121
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,860
we can get a ten at least.

2122
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,859
- Let's use the coupon. - Finally, it's time for the coupon.

2123
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,990
Joo Ha.

2124
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,829
Before using the coupon,

2125
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,729
Joo Ha needs to replace one of the players.

2126
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,500
- Take the bow from him. - Pardon?

2127
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,269
Tell him, "Why don't you take some rest?"

2128
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,070
Tell him to take some rest and...

2129
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,600
- Take the bow from him. - No.

2130
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,340
The one behind you.

2131
01:15:05,341 --> 01:15:07,640
- The one behind you. - I think it's 1 of the 2.

2132
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,510
- The older one. - Right.

2133
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:10,980
The older one.

2134
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,549
- Brother Jae Suk. - Pick one. It's okay.

2135
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,680
The one with the green bow.

2136
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,080
(The green bow)

2137
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:19,620
The green bow.

2138
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,320
One with the green bow? Okay.

2139
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,759
- The green bow. Okay. - He's the one?

2140
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,066
- Do you want to practice? One shot? - Maybe just one shot?

2141
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:27,090
Okay.

2142
01:15:27,091 --> 01:15:28,300
Joo Ha will go.

2143
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,630
- All right. - Okay.

2144
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,330
Joo Ha, aim it well, okay?

2145
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:34,646
- Joo Ha, take the shot carefully. - Her posture is good.

2146
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,099
- She's standing firmly. - Goodness.

2147
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,140
(Calm)

2148
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,610
Focus until the end.

2149
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:46,810
Joo Ha, I think you're okay.

2150
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,750
(Exclaiming)

2151
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,789
(Her shooting skill shocks them.)

2152
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:52,820
What was that?

2153
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,460
Joo Ha, what's up with you?

2154
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,020
All right.

2155
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,629
- You don't need to practice more? - No. I'll stop here.

2156
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:00,959
- She doesn't need to. - She'll stop here.

2157
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,900
(One shot is enough.)

2158
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,099
It was a clean shot.

2159
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,000
All right. How about Joo Ha shooting first?

2160
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:08,869
- Right. - To have a good start.

2161
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,169
Joo Ha, you got this!

2162
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,140
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2163
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,739
(The Coupon Round)

2164
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,050
(She suddenly becomes serious.)

2165
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,419
(She got 9 points.)

2166
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,980
- I think it's a 9. - She got 9 points?

2167
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,460
- You got nine points? - Yes.

2168
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:31,870
Why? You should've gotten a ten.

2169
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,499
- Kye Sang. - You can't get a ten all the time.

2170
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,760
- But she did great. - It's all right.

2171
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,469
We can do this comfortably. We need 21 points from 3 people.

2172
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,646
- We just need to get more than 7. - I hope all of them shoot 7 points.

2173
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,939
If 1 of us gets an 8,

2174
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,439
- we have one point to spare. - This is driving me crazy.

2175
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,839
It's okay if it's in the target.

2176
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,940
That's right.

2177
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,910
Please get a seven.

2178
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:54,509
(The Coupon Round)

2179
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,050
Because this makes us nervous...

2180
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,379
Gosh, it makes me so nervous.

2181
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,789
- It's driving me crazy. - This is hard.

2182
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:04,319
(The Coupon Round)

2183
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,430
I feel so nervous.

2184
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,060
My goodness.

2185
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,430
My goodness. I'm sorry.

2186
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,269
- I'm sorry. - Yo Han, you were shaking too much.

2187
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:14,840
You just need to get 17 points.

2188
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,100
- Goodness. - My gosh.

2189
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,469
- You can do this. - But if I miss, it's over.

2190
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,480
No, Jae Suk. You can do it this time. Seriously.

2191
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,779
Show us what you got.

2192
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,580
(The man who shot a 10 appears.)

2193
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,849
Okay, Jae Suk?

2194
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:27,850
(The last one to go is so nervous now.)

(The Coupon Round)

2196
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,320
Hurry. Do it right.

2197
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,450
Just get an eight.

2198
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,160
We have a chance.

2199
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,020
- You can do this. - You can do it.

2200
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,670
Gosh, I feel so nervous.

2201
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,579
- It's a 7. - I got 7 points?

2202
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:58,660
Then he needs to get a ten.

2203
01:17:58,780 --> 01:17:59,910
Hey, Kye Sang.

2204
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,920
Kye Sang. I know you can make this happen.

2205
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:05,789
(The Coupon Round)

2206
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,650
- Sure. I can do this. - Let's get a ten.

2207
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,559
- Let's taste the success. - Let's go!

- Let's go! - Let's go!

2209
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,989
Goodness. This is a drama.

2210
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,529
(It's a chance to make a drama like "The Winning Try.")

2211
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,900
You got a ten earlier.

2212
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,930
Do as you want.

2213
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,039
It's okay.

2214
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,080
(They failed with 23 points.)

2215
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,609
Goodness. We're in trouble. What do we do?

2216
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,279
We lost Joo Ha's bonus round.

2217
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,520
Gosh, I should practice.

2218
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,990
I think I'll have a dream about this for the next 30 years.

2219
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,390
It would be a nightmare.

"Please get five more points."

2221
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,829
We have 13 more minutes to spare with the students.

2222
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:49,999
- Okay. We'll do it in 13 minutes. - We need to use all the tries.

2223
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,300
We have 13 minutes left.

2224
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,099
All right. Shall we try it?

2225
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,169
Yes. We don't have much time left. There's no more spare time.

2226
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,450
- We have no time left. - Right.

(Try number six)

2228
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,109
(They failed.)

2229
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,509
Since we don't have much time left...

2230
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,079
We have four tries left.

2231
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,949

- That's it? - Don't worry about it.

(They failed)

2238
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,966
- It's okay. - He did a good job though.

2239
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,589
We should use the coupon again.

2240

- Let's do it right away. - Let's do it now.

- The coupon. - We'll use the coupon.

01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:24,530
- Two will shoot first. - Yes.

2244
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:25,770
Yeon Seok will go first.

- My gosh. - Joo Ha couldn't even...

(Joo Ha didn't get a chance to shoot.)

2251
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,180
Joo Ha couldn't even shoot.

2252

There's no time left.

2253
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,619
We have no time left.

2254

There's no time left.

2255
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,179
We got 14 points.

2256
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,620
You need 16 more points.

2257
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,450
- My goodness. - We need 16 more points?

2258
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,089
- Let's go! - Please.

2259

(The 2 need to shoot 8 points each.)

2260
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,260
Just this once.

2261
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,630
He did really well earlier.

2262
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,229
Get a ten for us.

2263
01:19:57,230 --> 01:20:00,029
(Try number nine)

2264
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,129
- It's a 7. - He got 7 points?

2265
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,170
- He got a 7. - It's a 7.

2266
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:04,099
Goodness. He needs to get a nine?

2267
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,140
(It's a success if Jae Suk shoots a 9.)

2268
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,710
My goodness.

2269
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,110
We still have a chance.

2270
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:10,770
If we can just get it this once...

2271
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,310
I really want to cry now.

2272
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,910
Please.

2273
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,920
On their tenth try, they'll be worse because of the pressure.

2274
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,649
Jae Suk. Try getting a nine.

2275
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:22,059
(Try number nine)

2276
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,296
- Where is it? - What did he get?

2277
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,929
- It's a six. You failed. - Goodness.

2278
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,189
(They failed their ninth try.)

2279
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:28,700
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2280
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,430
I didn't know archery was this hard.

2281
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,830
Seriously. This isn't easy.

2282
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,640
This is our last chance.

2283
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:36,770
My gosh.

2284
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,340
Our last chance.

2285
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:41,710
- Gosh. We're in trouble. - But we need to go for it.

2286
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,340
But you guys are doing really great.

2287
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,550
- Let's go! - All right!

2288
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,979
Let's go.

2289
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:49,150
Let's succeed this time.

2290
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,920
Just this once. Please.

2291
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,149
In 2, 3. Let's shout together.

2292
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:54,790
(This is their last cheering.)

2293
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,489
In 1, 2, 3.

2294
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:00,230
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2295
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:01,930
- Let's go. - My goodness.

2296
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,729
It's become desperate.

2297
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:04,759
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their last try.)

2298
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,129
(The last try)

2299
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,410
Yo Han, do you want to go first?

2300
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,770
I'll go first.

2301
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,180
Please.

2302
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:27,590
- I'm so nervous. - I think he'll do it.

2303
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,559
(He got 6 points.)

2304
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,530
- What did I get? - You got six points.

2305
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,590
- He got six points. - Gosh, that was close.

2306
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:40,200
- Getting a six is okay. - That's not bad.

2307
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,669
Let's go!

2308
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,070
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2309
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,339
Let's go!

2310
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,709
(The last try)

2311
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,740
Why did you bring me to an elementary school?

2312
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,339
I told you, right?

2313
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,949
You feel too much pressure when you are...

2314
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,826
- at an elementary school. - So this is how you feel.

2315
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:55,920
Yo Han.

2316
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,266
Gosh. I feel more nervous than the time I was in a match.

2317
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,319
- Really? - Yes.

2318
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,419
Let's go.

2319
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,290
(Kim Yo Han who used to be an athlete)

2320
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,830
- It's a seven. - He got seven points.

2321
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:13,130
He got seven points.

2322
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:14,529
It's 13 points now?

2323
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,540
If he gets a 10, we'll need a 7 next.

2324
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,470
If he gets a 9, we'll need an 8.

2325
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:19,770
(Shouting)

2326
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:21,269
(The last try)

2327
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,280
(Shouting)

2328
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,739
Let's do this!

2329
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:24,879
(Archery is all about your spirit!)

2330
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,980
- This is our last try. - Let's do this!

2331
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,380
Let's go!

2332
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:30,750
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2333
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,620
Seriously. Let's make a miracle.

2334
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,760
We should give them the Crocs.

2335
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,660
- Of course we should. - Please.

2336
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,860
The Crocs...

2337
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,389
My Crocs...

2338
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:42,660
I want the Crocs.

2339
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,630
Please. My goodness.

2340
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,570
- Okay. Here I go. - All right.

2341
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:49,239
Please.

2342
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,969
(The last try)

2343
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,070
Please.

2344
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,240
I hope we can do this.

2345
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,150
(He got 9 points.)

2346
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,779
- He got 9 points? - Yes, it's a 9.

2347
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,780
(He got 9 points!)

2348
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,380
- My goodness. Good job. - We need eight now.

2349
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,919
- Good job. - We need eight now.

2350
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,519
It's 8. We just need 8 more points.

2351
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,960
(They just need 8 more points.)

2352
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,590
It makes you so nervous, right?

2353
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:13,030
I was so nervous earlier.

2354
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:16,629
If he gets an eight, we win.

2355
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,569
(This one shot will decide everything.)

2356
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:20,229
In 1, 2, 3.

2357
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,299
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2358
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,499
- All right. - Eight points.

2359
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,909
(The last try)

2360
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:27,470
Please.

2361
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,340
We have no time now.

2362
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,749
Elementary school is...

2363
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,409
(The last try)

2364
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:34,480
I can do this.

2365
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,120
I can do it.

2366
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,060
I want a blue one or a white one.

2367
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,620
I want the pink one.

2368
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,410
The purple one looks pretty too.

2369
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,400
(There are only 8 points left to give gifts to the archery team.)

2370
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,240
Hold on.

2371
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,739
Hold on.

2372
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,969
- That's 7 points. - That's 7 points.

2373
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,239
(They fail the mission by 1 point.)

2374
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,209
- We're 1 point short. - We're 1 point short.

2375
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:05,479
You failed.

2376
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,309
(Jae Suk:6, Yo Han: 7, Kye Sang: 9, Yeon Seok: 7)

2377
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:09,179
(Total: 29)

2378
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,850
If only I had scored seven points...

2379
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,890
(They missed a miracle just by 1 point.)

2380
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,429
- We're 1 point short. - We're 1 point short.

2381
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:19,760
(The 1 point of despair)

2382
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,060
Gosh, that was so close.

2383
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,630
Gosh.

2384
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:30,369
(Keeping his head down)

2385
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,770
- We did well. - We did well.

2386
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,210
Can we get just one more try?

2387
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:36,740
(Taking away the presents)

2388
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,480
The Crocs shoes have been taken back.

2389
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,120
It's okay.

2390
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,750
Yes!

2391
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:46,889
This is crazy.

2392
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,690
(The children comfort the adults instead.)

2393
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,190
There are souvenirs.

2394
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:53,590
I think those are nice too.

2395
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:55,659
I think those are better.

2396
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,960
Those look better.

2397
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,529
- Gosh. - These are our souvenirs.

2398
01:24:58,530 --> 01:24:59,699
These are our souvenirs.

2399
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,369
I'm sorry. Sorry, Joo Ha.

2400
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,399
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2401
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,469
- I'm sorry, Seo Yun. - Right.

2402
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,940
- I'll give the clock to Joo Ha. - Thank you.

2403
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:08,909
- And... - We're really sorry.

2404
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:12,009
You all say it's okay and are comforting us, but...

2405
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:14,010
(They really wanted to succeed with this mission.)

2406
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:15,320
We're sorry.

2407
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:18,590
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2408
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:20,490
We're really sorry.

2409
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,550
Anyway,

2410
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,659
we wish you the best in your competition.

2411
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,660
- Thank you once again. - We hope you all do well.

2412
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,636
- You should say something too. - Yo Han.

2413
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,030
I hope you all work hard...

2414
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,469
and win gold medals after becoming a national team member.

2415
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,469
Thank you so much for today.

2416
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:38,070
Thank you for comforting us.

2417
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:42,109
- You seem upset for real. - Of course.

2418
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:44,339
- It's really upsetting. - It's because...

2419
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,509
I've been an athlete myself,

2420
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:49,380
- Right. - but they seem so mature.

2421
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,079
They feel maturer than me.

2422
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,849
- We're sorry. - We're so sorry.

2423
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,250
- We're sorry. - Gosh.

2424
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,390
- Good luck with your competition. - Thank you.

2425
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,120
- We're sorry. - It's okay.

2426
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:00,490
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2427
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,430
- Bye. - Bye.

2428
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,229
(Right when the children get done with their training, )

2429
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:07,799
(Yo Han makes a surprise return.)

2430
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,740
These are drinks.

2431
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,409
These are called protein shakes. You'll need them.

2432
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,770
- Have these together. - Okay.

2433
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:16,640
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2434
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:20,110
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2435
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,579
My goal is to become a famous archer...

2436
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,850
after winning a medal as a national team member.

2437
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,249
I want to become...

2438
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,990
