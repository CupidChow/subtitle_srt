1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,830
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,229
(It's a rainy spring morning.)

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,800
Gosh, it's raining today.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,400
Gosh, this is good.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,630
Hey.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,069
- It has grapefruits and apples. - What is it?

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,470
(The 2 MCs enjoy a cup of tea, sitting on the wooden porch.)

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,370
Having tea instead of coffee is nice too.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,439
- Right. Jae Suk. - Yes?

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,950
When I walked in here earlier,

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,649
you looked like you belonged here.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,110
- Really? - Yes.

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,820
Don't try to force yourself to drink mild coffee.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,249
- This is the perfect pairing. - You should drink tea instead.

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,359
This is excellent.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,660
Hangwa is nice.

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,090
I love hangwa.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,259
This is nice. It's calm and peaceful here.

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,830
- Right? - Yes. It's kind of quiet here too.

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,000
I love it here.

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,199
- Are we in Seongbuk-dong? - Yes, Seongbuk-dong.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,339
(Today's spot for spare time, Seongbuk)

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,669
So today's Whenever Friend is Jin Kyeong.

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,670
- Yes. - Well,

25
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,170
it's contrary to the image she's shown us on TV,

26
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,079
but this is the kind of vibe she seeks.

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,979
(She seeks a tranquil vibe.)

28
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,220
Jin Kyeong still doesn't have a good understanding of herself.

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,119
But her image we see on variety shows...

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Yes?

31
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,719
- I mean, she runs a business too. - That's right.

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,889
- And her business is successful. - She's a CEO.

33
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,660
I bet there's an unexpected charm about her.

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,590
I'm curious about her.

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,529
- So... - You've never met her before?

36
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,659
No. It's my first time meeting her.

37
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,869
- Really? - We've never met before.

38
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,269
- I see. - We've never met. Not even once.

39
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,900
If I'm being honest... Well, I don't know if she'll agree.

40
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,470
But I did help her career a bit.

41
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,139
- I did help her a bit. - Really?

42
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,439
- Yes. - I'm sure you helped her a lot.

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,209
- A lot? So you would agree, right? - Yes.

44
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,680
- You'd agree to that. - Yes.

45
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,449
- You're a mother figure... - Yes.

46
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,249
- in my career as an MC. - Right. Yeon Seok too.

47
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,419
I did raise him a bit too.

48
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,590
- My MC Mom. - Yes.

49
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,720
- He's my MC Mom. - I have a few children. Yes.

50
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,089
(While MC Mom and her son are waiting for Jin Kyeong, )

51
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,130
Hello.

52
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,899
(a strange man heads into the teahouse.)

53
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,269
- My gosh. The film industry... - Yes?

54
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,599
- is having a hard time too. - Right.

55
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040
- What? Dong Hwi! - Dong Hwi.

56
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,269
- What? Dong Hwi! - Dong Hwi.

57
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,339
Hey, are you...

58
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,610
- Dong Hwi. - Are you joining us too today?

59
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Hello.

60
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,949
- I thought Jin Kyeong was coming. - Hold on.

61
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,950
- Right. - I...

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,219
- You should've called me. I... - Nice to see you.

63
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,089
- Do I go this way? - I didn't know he was coming today.

64
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,119
- I didn't know either. - I...

65
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,790
- I didn't tell you. - Right.

66
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,159
- I wanted to surprise you. - So... My gosh.

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,660
Will it be just Dong Hwi today?

68
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,089
- I think there's one more. - Right?

69
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,850
- Jin Kyeong. - Right. Jin Kyeong is coming.

70
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,730
(His surprise visit makes Jae Suk smile brightly.)

71
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,000
- Hello. - Dong Hwi.

72
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,340
My gosh, Dong Hwi.

73
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,139
- My gosh. - All right. Okay.

74
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,140
I thought it was just Jin Kyeong today.

75
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:34,209
But Dong Hwi is joining us too.

76
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,469
So the staff members asked me...

77
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,679
- if I told you... - Yes.

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
That I would join your show.

79
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,109
- You didn't. - I told them that I didn't.

80
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,149
They said you wouldn't know...

81
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,849
about me unless Jin Kyeong told you guys.

82
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,619
- Jin Kyeong and I met... - Yes.

83
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,019
- at the Baeksang Arts Awards. - Yes.

84
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,119
Jin Kyeong said this to me.

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,049
"Jae Suk, see you on Friday."

86
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,619
- I had no idea. - So I knew she was joining us.

87
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,719
But I didn't know about Dong Hwi.

88
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,819
I wanted to be on this show.

89
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,889
Dong Hwi... I'll say this once Jin Kyeong arrives.

90
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,760
- She told me in Japan, Dong Hwi... - Yes?

91
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,829
I'm only borrowing her expression.

92
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,330
- He pulled one over on her. - Right.

93
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,940
- What happened? - So...

94
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,099
- They ran into each other in Japan. - Right.

95
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,510
She suggested a wager to buy each other clothes.

96
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,710
- Right. - Really?

97
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:11,809
- So... - Why?

98
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,179
I'm wearing the clothes she bought for me in Japan.

99
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,679
- This is the outfit? - Yes.

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
- How stylish. - She bought the pants and the top.

101
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,849
I couldn't buy them because they were expensive.

102
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,689
I beat her at every game of rock-paper-scissors that day.

103
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,759
So you've never lost at rock-paper-scissors.

104
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,120
I won every single game of rock-paper-scissors with her.

105
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,829
- But... - Do you have a secret tip?

106
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,859
- What is it? - No.

107
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,799
- I intimidated her with my vibe. - Okay.

108
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,429
- I told her I'd never lose. - I see.

109
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,100
After I said that, Jin Kyeong...

110
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,199
- started to feel... - She got scared.

111
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,139
(Jin Kyeong got scared after hearing him bluff.)

112
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,739
- You defeated her with your vibe. - You...

113
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,969
Yes. And it worked. So...

114
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,509
- That's how you got the outfit. - she bought me a lot of clothes.

115
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,239
She bought me a jacket on top of this outfit.

116
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,379
- Right. That's what I heard. - Yes.

117
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,610
- Really? - Yes.

118
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,549
I also beat her at the last game of muk-jji-ppa.

119
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,150
- Well done. - She's here.

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,480
- Jin Kyeong. - Hello.

121
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,489
- Hello. - Gosh.

122
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,790
- MacGyver. - Hello.

123
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,045
What? MacGyver?

124
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,105
Your hairstyle...

125
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,205
(MacGyver shows up in Seongbuk-dong.)

126
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,875
You know what? Come on.

127
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:02,946
- What? - Gosh.

128
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,315
- I'm wearing the clothes. - Jae Suk.

129
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,485
- CEO Hong, come here. - Okay, Jae Suk.

130
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:08,515
- CEO Hong. - Yes.

131
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,455
- Yeon Seok. It's been a while. - Hello.

132
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,956
- Your previous hairstyle was nice. - My gosh. Look at this.

133
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,196
- You got another haircut. - Gosh.

134
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,595
- Yes. - Did you order tea?

135
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,295
What? No. Yes, I did order tea.

136
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:19,665
Ssanghwa tea... Wait, no. What did I order?

137
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,996
- Because of your outfit, - Gosh.

138
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,566
It looks like a vocalist of a band is joining us today.

139
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,235
- You know? She's got that vibe. - It'd be a funk rock band.

140
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:27,812
- She'd be in a funk rock band. - Seriously.

141
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:30,135
- At rock festivals... - I mean,

142
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,176
she looks like the vocalist of a funk rock band.

143
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,815
- What? - Why did you wear black?

144
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:34,975
Gosh, it looks like...

145
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,115
- Did you perhaps... - we're at a funeral.

146
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,115
- visit Scotland? - Right.

147
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,345
- Are you carrying bagpipes? - No.

148
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,185
(Bagpipes?)

149
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:42,956
(Mimicking the sound of bagpipes)

150
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:45,855
Bagpipes?

151
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,055
(The vocalist who plays the bagpipes)

152
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,095
(Chuckling)

153
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,825
- How could you say that? - Jin Kyeong...

154
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,725
- It's a bag. - Jin Kyeong is a forgiving person.

155
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,726
But she's sensitive...

156
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,935
- when people criticize her fashion. - Right.

157
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,265
- You let it go because I said it. - Right.

158
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,805
So tell us. You said Dong Hwi...

159
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:00,235
pulled one over on you in Japan.

160
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,676
My gosh. He was such a jerk.

161
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:05,775
Seriously. He's a scary guy.

162
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:06,875
I'm wearing them, Jin Kyeong.

163
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:08,675
- So you bought this outfit? - You bought this outfit for him.

164
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,685
My gosh, I was really shocked.

165
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,815
- Jin Kyeong. - Okay.

166
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:14,255
But I heard you were the one who suggested the bet.

167
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:17,086
The budget I had in mind was around 200 dollars.

168
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:21,126
It turned out he was the king of rock-paper-scissors.

169
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:23,395
- But... - He can read his opponent's mind...

170
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:24,965
before playing the game.

171
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,125
He already knew what he needed to play.

172
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,335
- That... - He was famous for this talent.

173
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,965
- Really? - Is that even possible?

174
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:31,435
He was famous for this talent.

175
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:32,635
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors? - Yes.

176
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:33,735
- He's never lost before. - Go ahead.

177
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:34,875
Rock-paper-scissors.

178
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,005
(Jae Suk loses, and Dong Hwi wins.)

179
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,106
You try it, Yeon Seok.

180
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:38,405
Rock-paper-scissors.

181
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,522
(Yeon Seok loses, and Dong Hwi wins.)

182
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:42,675
You let him win. Why did you beat me then?

183
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,016
- He won. - I won.

184
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,616
I just won.

185
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:46,945
- Didn't you play paper? - I just lost.

186
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,115
- Didn't you play paper? - He played scissors.

187
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,255
- I played scissors. - Jin Kyeong.

188
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:50,316
- Why... - Jin Kyeong.

189
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:52,485
- Are you seeing things? - What?

190
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,555
(Her defeat left a lasting impression on her.)

191
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:54,625
- Gosh, thank you. - My gosh.

192
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:55,656
- Thank you. - Sure.

193
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:56,946
I also ordered ssanghwa tea.

194
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:58,795
- This is Jin Kyeong's tea. - You drink it then.

195
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:00,426
Okay. "You drink it then."

196
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:03,765
- Gosh. - I was on social media.

197
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,206
And he was wearing the clothes I bought him in every picture.

198
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,636
It was so annoying to see that.

199
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,306
As if he was rubbing it in.

200
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:13,245
You know what? You bought him the clothes.

201
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,045
- Right. That was partially why. - It's nice to see him wear them...

202
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:16,175
- often. - Of course. My junior, Dong Hwi...

203
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,445
- Of course. - Yes.

204
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,215
- He's more successful than me. - Gosh, no.

205
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,485
- I'm happy he wears them often. - Gosh, don't say that.

206
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:22,455
- Not at all. - But you're a CEO.

207
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:24,085
- Right. - You're a CEO.

208
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,755
She's been going abroad a lot these days.

209
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:28,326
- Right. - Seriously, though. I've been...

210
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:30,695
going back and forth between Korea and Northern Europe.

211
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:33,025
- Northern Europe? Yes. - Around the Scandinavian Peninsula.

212
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,035
Around the Baltic Sea.

213
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,535
- Right. - People there eat kimchi?

214
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,165
- No, I sell dumplings. - Dumplings?

215
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,705
- They eat dumplings? - That's a huge trend there now.

216
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,775
- Really? Yes. - Dumplings are on the rise now.

217
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,275
- It wasn't easy, though. - Okay.

218
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,775
- People there didn't know about me. - I see.

219
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:48,015
There's this particular tendency in Northern Europe.

220
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,545
- Like what? I see. - They're broad-minded.

221
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,915
Yes. People in Norway tend to be broad-minded.

222
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:53,916
(Suddenly feeling small)

223
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,355
They tend to be broad-minded.

224
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:57,325
But it was difficult to launch my business there.

225
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,325
- I had never met them before. - Yes.

226
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,196
It had been tough. But a while ago...

227
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:02,655
Shouldn't it be easy to do business with them...

228
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,895
- if they're broad-minded? - What?

229
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,325
- Right. - If they're broad-minded,

230
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,366
they must be open-minded.

231
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,435
They have traits...

232
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,065
- passed down from the pirates. - Pirates?

233
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,905
- You meant to say the Vikings. - Vikings.

234
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:13,975
- They aren't pirates. - Vikings.

235
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,075
- Is that what they're called? - Gosh.

236
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,905
They were quite tall.

237
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,626
How on earth are you running your business?

238
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,745
(The CEO embarrasses herself.)

239
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,416
Why is he so annoying today?

240
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:25,685
- He knows how to annoy me. - Wait.

241
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:26,985
- You're running a major operation. - Right.

242
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:28,715
You'll be ruling the big market in Northern Europe.

243
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,515
- Hey, you. Seriously. - Why...

244
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,185
Since I bought you clothes, come to Northern Europe and help me.

245
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,526
I'd love to.

246
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,226
So you live around here, right?

247
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:38,495
Over the mountain.

248
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,536
- Yes. - Pyeongchang-dong.

249
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,765
I come to this teahouse often.

250
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,265
- Really? - That's why...

251
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,565
I chose this place as our meeting spot.

252
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,606
I go to Seongbukdong Parish nearby.

253
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:49,706
I attend the 8:30am Mass there.

254
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:51,875
After the 8:30am Mass,

255
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:53,005
I go to a pork bulgogi restaurant.

256
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,315
- Right. Over there. - It's beloved by taxi drivers.

257
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:55,375
- I know the one. - Yes.

258
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,415
- That's a famous restaurant. - I have the pork bulgogi meal...

259
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,936
at the restaurant by myself at 9:30am.

260
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,686
- After the Mass? - After the Mass.

261
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,315
- Do you come here after that? - After the meal...

262
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,325
This teahouse opens at 10:30am.

263
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:05,326
(She comes to the teahouse after having pork bulgogi.)

264
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,402
That's why I have some time to kill before the teahouse.

265
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:10,026
- What do you do then? - I eat the pork bulgogi slowly.

266
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:14,235
I sit at the restaurant for a bit and then come here.

267
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:16,036
Do you know what Jae Suk said earlier?

268
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:19,635
He said that he kind of helped your career...

269
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,535
on variety shows.

270
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,375
- I did. Yes. - Of course, he did.

271
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:24,975
- Do you agree then? - Yes, totally.

272
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:28,676
He made me look so funny when he laughed at everything I did.

273
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,845
- I became his go-to entertainer. - Right.

274
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:33,085
- So I'm having an easy time now. - I see.

275
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:35,485
Wherever I go, people are just ready...

276
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,585
- to laugh. - Right.

277
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,185
- Accepting that made things easier. - Right. Totally.

278
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,125
She's super popular in Japan.

279
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,695
- Really? - Everyone on the street...

280
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,755
recognized her.

281
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,165
- But... - From what do they recognize her?

282
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,966
From her show, "Single's Inferno."

283
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:48,965
- "Single's Inferno." - They recognize her from that.

284
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:50,465
- "Single's Inferno." - Yes.

285
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:53,365
You're acting like you knew the English title.

286
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,405
- Why do you say that? - Someone asked, "Single's Inferno?"

287
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:57,906
She said, "No. Solo Netherworld."

288
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,615
- "Solo Netherworld." - That was a long time ago.

289
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:02,645
That's what she said.

290
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,085
- I don't say that now. - "Inferno..."

291
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,645
You translated the title too literally.

292
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,862
- She didn't know what that meant. - "Solo Netherworld."

293
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:10,016
Must I know the English title too?

294
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,455
"Must I know the English title too?"

295
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:14,525
- I don't know the English title. - Okay.

296
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,895
- You know what? We must get going. - I don't know that.

297
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,395
- Wait. My gosh. - Let's check the letters.

298
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:19,925
- We were busy talking. - We were focused on talking.

299
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,736
- Time flew by. Wait. - Well...

300
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,595
Let's set out to find...

301
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,865
- our first Whenever Guest. - Let's go.

302
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,936
- Yes. - Okay.

303
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:28,776
- The name is Park Jung Su. - Park Jung Su.

304
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,805
- "COSI." - What?

305
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,915
"Cold on the outside, but sweet on the inside?"

306
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,676
- Is that it? - Okay.

307
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,745
"As it's calculated using an inverse matrix,"

308
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,856
"the temperature deviation is less than 1°C."

309
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:43,516
"The texture varies based on the mixture."

310
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,596
"Just a 0.1g difference in sugar can result in complete resistance."

311
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:50,725
"My own version of golden ratio was developed..."

312
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:52,196
"in my 106.75m² lab."

313
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,165
"Please come and have your fill."

314
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,596
- I guess it's about beverages. - Right.

315
00:09:56,766 --> 00:10:00,335
- Right? - The keywords mentioned here...

316
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:01,835
are related to making coffee.

317
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:05,005
- What time do we have to be there? - We must be there by 11am.

318
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,406
- It's time. We must go. - My gosh. We must go. Let's hurry.

319
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,275
- It's 10:47am now. - I see.

320
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,615
The spare time begins at 11am. My gosh.

321
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:11,885
- Let's go. - We lost track of time...

322
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,406
- while talking to each other. - Okay.

323
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,055
There are so many pretty spots in Seongbuk-dong.

324
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,186
- Right. - Yes.

325
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,585
I come here often too.

326
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:18,586
- Right? - Yes.

327
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:20,085
I can see that.

328
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,496
- As for today's weather, - Yes?

329
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:24,965
It's not raining too hard.

330
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,595
- It's raining just enough. - Yes.

331
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:27,995
- Right. - It's perfect.

332
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:28,996
Yes.

333
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,006
I can already smell the pork bulgogi from this street.

334
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,445
- That's the restaurant over there. - What?

335
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:38,975
- I see. That restaurant? - Over there.

336
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,105
- That's my regular restaurant. - No.

337
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,415
- The one with pork ribs. There. - I see.

338
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,475
- Seongbuk-dong Pork Ribs? - Yes.

339
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,685
The previous owner passed it down to her daughter.

340
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,686
She's running it now.

341
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,056
(Staring)

342
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,356
Jin Kyeong, you look especially taller today.

343
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,586
- Why do you look so tall? - Is that so?

344
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:56,426
- You know I'm tall. I'm 180cm. - Isn't your height over 180cm?

345
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,365
- Really? Right. - You're not taller than 180cm?

346
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,366
I'm 178cm tall.

347
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,665
Wait. No, you're not.

348
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,265
- You're taller than 180cm. - My height is about 178cm.

349
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,105
You can't be 178cm.

350
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,206
- I am 178cm tall. Why? - You...

351
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,806
- Wait. - Never mind. Yes, you are.

352
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:10,275
- Gosh, you're 178cm... - All of a sudden...

353
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:11,476
- if you say so. - Wait.

354
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,345
- Do you know what... - There's a height controversy now.

355
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:14,616
Jin Kyeong did earlier?

356
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,146
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk. - Seriously.

357
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:18,285
- Listen. - Sorry.

358
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,815
I must have lost my mind. Seriously.

359
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,355
- Are you as tall as Jae Suk? - I'm 183cm.

360
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,355
- I'm 180cm. - Jae Suk...

361
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,685
- You look taller than me. - You look taller than him.

362
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,725
- Your shoes... - Don't lie about your height.

363
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:30,055
- No, I'm really 180cm. - Don't understate your height. No.

364
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,065
I'm really 180cm.

365
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,195
- Your height must be over 185cm. - You're taller than 185cm.

366
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,535
- I'm 179cm. - Hello.

367
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:37,035
- Hey, you can't be 179cm. - I'm 179cm.

368
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:38,265
- Maybe, you grew a little. - Hey.

369
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,106
No. You're about 185cm.

370
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,805
- She's 185cm. - She is 185cm.

371
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:42,806
(Is she still growing tall?)

372
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:45,167
- Jin Kyeong is a giant. - You must be 182cm or 183cm tall.

373
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:46,545
- Come on, Jae Suk. - She's a giant.

374
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,445
- How can you call me a giant? - Jin Kyeong the Giant.

375
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:49,915
- You know what? - I joined your show today...

376
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,636
- with good intentions. - What do you mean?

377
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,155
- Could you play the bagpipes? - Come on.

378
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:56,485
Bagpipes? Seriously.

379
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:58,185
Play the bagpipes for me.

380
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,086
- Come on. - Seriously.

381
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,186
It's been a while since I saw your daughter.

382
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,466
- La El? - Yes.

383
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,826
- How is she doing? - She's doing well.

384
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:09,336
- What grade is she in now? - She's in ninth grade.

385
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,535
- She's the same age as my son. - Yes.

386
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:12,765
(The conversation of parents whose children are in 9th grade)

387
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,876
- Seriously. - How's your son doing?

388
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,036
- He's doing well. - I see.

389
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,445
But Ji Ho doesn't cause trouble, right? Is he studying hard?

390
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:24,345
Well, he doesn't cause trouble.

391
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,822
- But he doesn't listen to me. - I see. He doesn't listen to you.

392
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,156
La El wears colored contacts all the time.

393
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,056
(Laughing)

394
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:35,796
Gosh, I'd like to see her.

395
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,702
- La El... - She wears colored contacts.

396
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,966
My blood pressure rises whenever I look at her eyes.

397
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,496
My blood pressure rises a lot.

398
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,935
- When she goes to concerts, - Yes?

399
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:47,635
She sometimes meets...

400
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,905
- celebrities there. - Yes.

401
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,346
She tells them she's my daughter.

402
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:54,046
"Hello. I'm Hong Jin Kyeong's daughter."

403
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:56,316
She always drops my name.

404
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,086
That's how she gets a photo with them.

405
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,656
She drives me crazy.

406
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:03,416
My gosh.

407
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,385
I miss Sae Ho. How is he doing?

408
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,386
He's doing well.

409
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,225
- He seemed really happy. - Right.

410
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,795
When my juniors get married 1 by 1 like that,

411
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:12,866
I get disappointed.

412
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,595
- Is that so? - You get disappointed?

413
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:16,195
- Why? - Why do you get disappointed?

414
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,736
There are fewer juniors I can invite out at night.

415
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,435
Jae Suk. By the way,

416
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,775
- you might not expect this. - Okay.

417
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,405
But it's actually quite hard to change Chang Hee's mind.

418
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:25,845
- I know. - I'd call him at night...

419
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,905
to invite him out.

420
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,515
- He doesn't come out, right? - When I call him,

421
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,575
he just tells me this.

422
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,716
"I don't want to go out."

423
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,845
- He's like that. - But actually,

424
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,755
saying no right off the bat is better.

425
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,055
- He's clear about that. - Right.

426
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,756
That way, I can call other juniors.

427
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:43,826
Then I'll call Kwang Hee and other juniors next.

428
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:45,495
Hwang Kwang Hee?

429
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:48,066
Jin Kyeong. You said you'd invite me out too.

430
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:49,565
You said I'd be your close junior.

431
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:50,895
- Okay. - He comes out often.

432
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,835
I became one of her close juniors.

433
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,005
I'm after Kwang Hee.

434
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:55,805
- Okay. - Dong Hwi is great.

435
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:56,905
You take your time with getting married.

436
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:57,946
A long time ago...

437
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:02,175
- Jin Kyeong. This is beautiful. - How nice.

438
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,145
- Right? - I didn't know about this place.

439
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,885
- You'd see this in Northern Europe. - Right.

440
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,516
This is a Scandinavian vibe.

441
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,515
Yes, I can see that.

442
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,616
Is this the place?

443
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:13,286
- Hold on. I think this is it. - What?

444
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:14,926
Park Jung Su?

445
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:16,856
- Park Jung Su? - Is this the place?

446
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,025
- Yes. Let's check. - Jin Kyeong, it's right here.

447
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,986
- This is the place? - I think this is the place.

448
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,865
- Hello. - Hello.

449
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,506
Are you Mr. Park Jung Su?

450
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,206
Yes, I am.

451
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:28,506
- This is the place. - Yes.

452
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,436
- Hello. - This is the place.

453
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,905
- Hello. It's an ice cream shop? - Hello.

454
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,446
- My gosh. - That's right. Hello.

455
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:38,115
- I see. It was an ice cream shop. - Ice cream.

456
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,186
It was an ice cream shop.

457
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:43,485
"Kids, listen to your parents. Promise me that."

458
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,126
That was written on the display showcase.

459
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,186
I guess a lot of kids come here.

460
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:47,995
A lot of kids live in this neighborhood...

461
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:50,226
compared to other neighborhoods.

462
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,765
- A lot of kids come to my shop. - That's good.

463
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,895
By the way, this is a beautiful shop.

464
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:54,896
(Pull)

465
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,695
Should I move there?

466
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,705
(They sit side by side in a cluster.)

467
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,205
- Jin Kyeong, are you okay there? - I'm fine.

468
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:01,566
- I was going to sit there. - Gosh. Don't do that, Jae Suk.

469
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,806
- It's backlit. Is it okay? - Yes.

470
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:06,346
(Feeling awkward)

471
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,875
- Why? - We look better when backlit.

472
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,046
- Is that so? - Yes.

473
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:12,785
All right. I'm sorry.

474
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,285
(He's laughing again.)

475
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,755
- What is it? - Should I prepare some tissue?

476
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:17,925
It's okay. You already know...

477
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,086
- that she always makes me laugh. - You're tearing up.

478
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,196
She always cracks me up to the point of tears.

479
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,595
- All right. Jung Su. - Yes, that's me.

480
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:26,966
You're the owner. And...

481
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,735
My name is Yang Won Mo.

482
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:29,736
Yang Won Mo.

483
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:31,105
- I'm his employee. - He works for me.

484
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,065
- I see. He's an employee. - I see.

485
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,235
He mentioned the weight deviation...

486
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:37,435
- in his letter. - Right.

487
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,345
So I wondered if it had to do with coffee.

488
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:42,045
- I was expecting a cafe. - I see.

489
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:46,045
How did you end up running an ice cream shop?

490
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,015
Well, I'm sure this is the case for everyone.

491
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,185
I loved ice cream ever since I was a kid.

492
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,855
I loved having ice cream.

493
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,525
But I particularly loved its physical properties.

494
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,325
- Physical properties? - When I was a young kid,

495
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:57,102
I didn't focus on the flavor of the ice cream.

496
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:59,925
I wondered why it was so much colder than what we'd normally...

497
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,666
experience in everyday life.

498
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,036
I had been wondering about that ever since I was a kid.

499
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,436
When I scooped up the ice cream with a spoon,

500
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,105
I loved the resistance it had.

501
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:09,405
Judging by the vocabulary he uses,

502
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,675
- He must've majored in science. - he must be an engineer.

503
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,205
- Or engineering. - Did you study engineering?

504
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,875
- Didn't you study engineering? - I had no choice.

505
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,716
- He said, "Physical properties." - Right.

506
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,785
- It's rarely used in liberal arts. - Exactly.

507
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:19,685
- I can't help myself. Right. - Yes.

508
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:20,985
- Did you major in engineering? - Yes.

509
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:22,185
Computer engineering?

510
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:23,815
When I was in school, it was called electrical...

511
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,455
- and electronics engineering. - Electrical...

512
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:26,456
But it's called...

513
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:27,897
- computer engineering now. - Right.

514
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:31,295
How did an engineering major end up opening an ice cream shop?

515
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:32,725
That's the thing.

516
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,195
- I can't cook at all. - Okay.

517
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,535
- I can barely cook ramyeon. - Yes.

518
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,805
But making ice cream isn't a culinary skill.

519
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:39,566
It's closer to an engineering process.

520
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,605
When you freeze water, it's not ice cream.

521
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:44,746
It's just ice as hard as a rock.

522
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,915
Let's say you want to figure out how ice can turn into ice cream.

523
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,746
Based on what you add to the mixture,

524
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,692
- the temperature... - Your facial expression changed.

525
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:55,655
Substances freeze at different temperatures...

526
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,256
based on the materials you add.

527
00:16:57,456 --> 00:17:00,185
So there are things I must add. It could be sugar...

528
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,456
or protein.

529
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:04,726
I have to separate the water molecules.

530
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,026
I must make sure...

531
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:08,347
- they don't stick with each other. - Are we in class now?

532
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,796
Actually...

533
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,505
I'm sorry.

534
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,035
I was thinking about something else while staring at the wall...

535
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,552
when you were talking, although you're our guest.

536
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,735
- I'm sorry. - What were you thinking about?

537
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,305
You know what? I didn't know...

538
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,745
- ice cream could be so scientific. - Me neither.

539
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:22,875
- I didn't know it had... - I thought making ice cream...

540
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,922
- such a profound fundamental. - was a culinary skill.

541
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,085
I studied through books.

542
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,185
To make ice cream,

543
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:29,255
there are formulae I can only learn...

544
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,355
- through books. - I'm sorry.

545
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:32,596
But how did you rank when you were a high school senior?

546
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,695
I graduated early.

547
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,955
I graduated when I was a high school junior.

548
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,665
Did you graduate from a science high school?

549
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,872
No, it was a regular high school.

550
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:41,095
- I know it's off-topic. - He's a genius.

551
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,242
Which college did you attend?

552
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,635
My college doesn't exist anymore.

553
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,665
But I entered ICU first.

554
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,475
Then it merged with KAIST.

555
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:49,952
- I graduated from KAIST. - I knew it.

556
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,246
He has a diploma from KAIST?

557
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,445
Jin Kyeong.

558
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,445
- Yes, I have a diploma from KAIST. - Jin Kyeong.

559
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,245
- KAIST? - I'm disappointed in you.

560
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,915
- Why? - When he talked about...

561
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,185
water molecules, you didn't seem interested.

562
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,306
When he mentioned KAIST, you went like this. "KAIST?"

563
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:05,426
That definitely changes things.

564
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,255
Seriously. How...

565
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:10,456
I know a few things about KAIST.

566
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,466
Isn't there a karaoke near the rear gate?

567
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,665
- That karaoke... - Hey, that's...

568
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,036
- Yes. - The owner is really nice.

569
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,235
Once you start singing there, the owner keeps...

570
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:21,706
giving you free minutes...

571
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,705
- until you can't sing anymore. - The owner sounds great.

572
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:24,745
- The owner gives you free minutes. - Really?

573
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:25,775
You don't know the one I'm talking about?

574
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,645
- I don't. I've never been there. - It's famous there.

575
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,315
- Jin Kyeong. - Are you doubting him?

576
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,816
You said you knew a few things about his school.

577
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:33,645
I thought you knew a professor there.

578
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,215
- She knows what's around it. - It's a famous place.

579
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:37,816
The karaoke is famous for the free minutes.

580
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,185
Did you also major in engineering?

581
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,696
No. I'm in a different field.

582
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:42,926
You have a great voice.

583
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,795
- He has a great voice. - Judging by the voice,

584
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,396
I thought he was the chairman.

585
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:47,695
Chairman?

586
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:48,895
- "Chairman." - Yes.

587
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:52,235
I used to work at a bookstore before this.

588
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,805
Is there a reason you made the transition from a bookstore...

589
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,175
to an ice cream shop?

590
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,605
He published a book.

591
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,906
The bookstore I worked at bought and sold...

592
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,475
his books.

593
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,376
Then he came to the bookstore by chance.

594
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:06,915
I really enjoyed reading his book.

595
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,155
I asked him if there was a way I could work with him.

596
00:19:10,156 --> 00:19:12,386
To learn his trade secrets and open up your own shop?

597
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,625
- Judging by his voice, - His voice...

598
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:18,366
- he's not a regular part-timer. - Right.

599
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,886
- Something is unusual about him. - He must have an agenda.

600
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,535
Since we're here at your ice cream shop,

601
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:24,765
- could we taste your ice cream? - Could we taste some?

602
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,805
- Of course. - Could we?

603
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:27,512
- We'd like some samples. Thanks. - My gosh.

604
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:28,635
Ice cream made by...

605
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,775
- an engineering major from KAIST. - By a KAIST graduate.

606
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:32,375
- He took scientific approaches... - I'm curious.

607
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:33,776
- to make this ice cream. - Right.

608
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,175
- Should I give you a variety of it? - Yes.

609
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,052
- Give us your signature flavors. - We'd be grateful then.

610
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,545
Let's see how different...

611
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,585
the ice cream made by an engineering major tastes.

612
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:41,915
- Yes. - Yes.

613
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,785
If it's tasty, I can introduce your shop...

614
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,706
- to the people in Northern Europe. - Seriously.

615
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:47,725
- You're going there next week. - Right.

616
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,625
A lot of people in Oslo love ice cream.

617
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:51,902
(The CEO specializing in Northern Europe shows interest.)

618
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,596
- My gosh. - Thank you.

619
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,835
- Let us explain the flavors. - Yes.

620
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:57,495
We have many special flavors.

621
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,266
- Yes. Okay. - As for the flavors on the bottom,

622
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,306
they're made with rice from Icheon and mugwort.

623
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,705
- This is banana pudding flavor. - That looks good too.

624
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:06,005
- And this is vanilla. - I see.

625
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,552
- This is rice-flavored? - You take vanilla.

626
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:09,245
- This is vanilla. - Then I'll take it.

627
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,646
- I'll take the rice flavor. - Yes.

628
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:11,885
I'll take...

629
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:12,886
- There are jujubes in that. - the banana pudding flavor.

630
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,655
- My gosh. - The jujubes are on top, right?

631
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:17,556
It's like gelato. It's nice and chewy.

632
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,526
- This is... - And...

633
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,486
- this isn't too sweet. - This is good.

634
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,096
(Humming)

635
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,925
Gosh, the resistance...

636
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,207
- The physical properties... - The physical properties...

637
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,976
- They're unique. - It's a ripe persimmon. My gosh.

638
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,766
Seriously. The particles...

639
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:36,276
- Particles? - They're nanoparticles.

640
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:39,936
If they're nanoparticles, we shouldn't feel them.

641
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:42,115
I don't think we can feel them then.

642
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,176
I don't know.

643
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,545
You wrote in your letter that you had spare time...

644
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,185
- around this time of the day. - Yes.

645
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:51,215
Could you tell us what made you write to us?

646
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,285
We open our shop at noon.

647
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,055
And you guys came here around 11am.

648
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,125
- Right. - So when we open at noon,

649
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,225
that's when we greet our customers.

650
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:02,395
If we're not in the right mood or if things aren't ready by then,

651
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,365
the rest of the day gets ruined,

652
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:05,735
in terms of our condition and so on.

653
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,235
- You have to be in a good mood. - Right.

654
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:10,476
I read books or go out for walks.

655
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:13,045
- For the particles of ice cream? - Yes.

656
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:16,816
I scoop out the ice cream while getting ready to open.

657
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,986
I've been running this shop for 8 to 9 years.

658
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,586
But scooping the ice cream...

659
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,686
makes me happy like an innocent kid.

660
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,886
He's destined to make ice cream for the rest of his life.

661
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,155
- I hope I can do that. - Right?

662
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:29,095
Given how much he likes ice cream...

663
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,416
- Are you reading his saju? - No.

664
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,495
- Saju? - I can tell he loves ice cream...

665
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,102
- just by listening to him. - Gosh, Dong Hwi.

666
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,965
- You're... - He loves ice cream, indeed.

667
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:37,295
- You... - Every time he scoops it up...

668
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,766
You look like a traveling saju reader.

669
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,775
(A traveling saju reader)

670
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:42,905
I'm sorry.

671
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:46,375
Given how much you love ice cream, you should be the Ice Cream Man.

672
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,576
His ice cream is so different.

673
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,946
Here's the important part. Jung Su did write to us, after all.

674
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:52,222
- Before that, - Let's begin.

675
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,785
We must draw the bonus coupon.

676
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:54,855
- Right. - Yes.

677
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:55,985
- This... - CEO Hong, you do it.

678
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,085
- Okay. - Gosh.

679
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:59,367
(The number of bonus coupons lies in Jin Kyeong's hands.)

680
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,696
(What will it be?)

681
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,596
My gosh.

682
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,636
- We get 2 coupons. - We get 2 free tries.

683
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:15,005
- My gosh. - We get two free tries.

684
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:16,135
- I knew she could do it. - Great.

685
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,606
- Nice job, CEO Hong. - Great.

686
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,816
We're off to a great start.

687
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:21,345
- This is the first fortune cookie. - Fortune cookie.

688
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:22,866
You can break it. The paper is inside.

689
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:24,985
"Our relationship began at a bookstore."

690
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,285
"We have the same hobby too."

691
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:27,485
"A 400-dollar bookstore..."

692
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,086
- "gift card." - A 400-dollar gift card.

693
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,355
This is the best present to avid readers.

694
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:34,425
- You guys can get 200 dollars each. - This is great.

695
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:35,426
This is great.

696
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:37,655
Won Mo seems really happy.

697
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,526
- He loves books. - A 400-dollar gift card.

698
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,865
That's the best present for us.

699
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,065
- Right. - Yes.

700
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,835
You can buy things other than just books with the gift card.

701
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,265
The bookstore sells other merchandise too.

702
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,576
- There's a variety of goods. - There's a restaurant too.

703
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:50,935
Why would you say that? They love reading books.

704
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,505
Why would you mention the restaurant?

705
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:53,645
- Well... - Books are food for thought.

706
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:55,275
Yes. But you can do other things...

707
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:57,115
- than just buy books with it. - Right. That's true.

708
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:59,615
- Dong Hwi, you're taking... - Yes?

709
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:00,746
Many shots at Jin Kyeong.

710
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,156
- I'm here as a sniper. - Totally.

711
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:05,726
- He keeps disrupting her flow. - Yes.

712
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,555
He keeps doing that.

713
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:09,255
This side of my neck feels so stiff.

714
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,855
(The bookstore gift card is at stake on their first mission.)

715
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,795
(Bouncing Ball on the Cone)

716
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:14,295
(Let the ball bounce off the floor...)

717
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:17,735
(and land the ball on top of a cone.)

718
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:21,976
(Round 1:2 out of 4 must succeed.)

719
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:23,636
(Feigned laughter)

720
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,145
The owner's hobby is juggling.

721
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,516
So we'll use balls.

722
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:30,976
- You juggle? - I like to juggle.

723
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:32,356
Can you do it with three balls?

724
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:36,356
I think I can do the most basic one with three balls.

725
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:38,115
I can do the basic one.

726
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,085
- Can you do it with four? - I can't.

727
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,246
You can't call that juggling.

728
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:43,826
- Jin Kyeong. - The balls...

729
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,995
- I'm sorry. - Come on.

730
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:48,496
- Our mission isn't juggling. - Can you do it?

731
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:49,736
- What? - Hey, I did it.

732
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,866
- Jae Suk did it. - Should we go for it now?

733
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,935
- You can do it so easily. - He did it.

734
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,816
- We can just... - I don't think it'll be hard.

735
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:00,275
I don't think it'll be hard.

736
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:01,306
Try it.

737
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,815
- We can easily pass Round One then. - What was that?

738
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:06,145
How did you do it? Isn't this what you did?

739
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,245
It's like trapping a soccer ball.

740
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,355
- You have to get the ball... - It's hard.

741
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,785
To absorb the shock.

742
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:11,085
- But I was doing it... - You must do it sitting down.

743
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:12,432
- with this hand. - I must do it sitting down?

744
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,255
Our success made you sensitive.

745
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:15,455
- Did I do it with the same hand? - Am I wrong?

746
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:16,832
- Is this what I did? - He can do it.

747
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,666
- We'll definitely pass Round One. - Yes.

748
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:21,636
- Dong Hwi. - He can't do it.

749
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:25,466
- Here I go. - All right.

750
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:26,766
- No. - No.

751
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,805
- No, that doesn't count. - No.

752
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:30,105
- No. - What are you doing?

753
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,645
- No. - We didn't agree to that.

754
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:32,775
- I'm sorry. - Come on.

755
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,175
- No, not yet. - I didn't know.

756
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,176
- Why would you start? - I...

757
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:36,545
- We have to say it together. - Right. I didn't know.

758
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:37,975
All right. Should we begin our first try?

759
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,545
- Yes. We'll begin now. - I think we can do this.

760
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,285
- Should we go in this order? - Yes, let's do that.

761
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:42,555
- Yes. - So 2 out of 4 must succeed.

762
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:43,556
- Okay. - Yes.

763
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:44,925
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

764
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:46,156
- Here we go. - Let's go!

765
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:47,426
Let's do this.

766
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,455
- I did it. - You failed.

767
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,526
Wait.

768
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,725
- I did it. - You failed.

769
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:54,766
Wait.

770
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:55,996
Why would you say I failed?

771
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:58,536
- Jin Kyeong. - Why would you say I failed?

772
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,766
You used his knee to get the ball on the cone.

773
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:02,975
- No. - You're about to enter...

774
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,206
the market in Northern Europe.

775
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,505
I lost my temper...

776
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,376
- in the heat of the moment. - Yes.

777
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:09,675
Dong Hwi is next.

778
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,616
(First try: Jin Kyeong, Dong Hwi)

779
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:16,356
You did it.

780
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,985
(To succeed, they just need to get one more ball on the cone.)

781
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,426
- They got this. We got it. - They got this.

782
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:22,956
- We got this. - Should I try?

783
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:25,625
- All right. - I threw and caught the ball...

784
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,106
- with my right hand earlier. - Okay.

785
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:31,035
(Do it exactly like we practiced.)

786
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:32,036
There.

787
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:39,176
There.

788
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:43,516
- All right. - Just like that?

789
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:45,486
- We did it. - Wait.

790
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:49,015
(This is amazing.)

791
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,216
- All right. - Just like that?

792
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,225
- We did it. - Thank you.

793
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:53,655
- But it shouldn't go so smoothly. - My gosh, Round One...

794
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:55,895
- We passed Round 1 on our 1st try. - It shouldn't be this easy.

795
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:57,255
Wait. This makes me nervous.

796
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,465
We will give you the 400-dollar bookstore gift card...

797
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:01,665
- as a present. - Thank you.

798
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:02,735
(They win the 400-dollar bookstore gift card.)

799
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:03,795
With this...

800
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:04,865
I think...

801
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,965
I think we should go on to Round Two.

802
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,305
But the cone might change.

803
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,075
- But... - I think the cone will change.

804
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:11,905
- the game becomes more difficult. - Right.

805
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:14,505
- And the present gets bigger. - I see.

806
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,615
You have to choose whether to go on to Round Two or not.

807
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,075
- This is a no-brainer. - They should...

808
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,045
Tell us your decision. In 1, 2, 3.

809
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,116
- Go. - Go.

810
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:22,555
- Open the fortune cookie. - Here it is.

811
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:23,985
- Okay. - Would you like to open it?

812
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:26,185
Yes, the second present is...

813
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:27,662
- He has a nice voice. - Yes, he does.

814
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,555
"We stay standing ten hours a day while working."

815
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,156
"We need comfortable shoes."

816
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,425
"Two pairs of running shoes from Salomon."

817
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,595
- Gosh. - What is it?

818
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:37,066
I'm sorry, but can I do an impersonation of him?

819
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,106
"We stay standing ten hours a day while working."

820
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:42,805
"We need comfortable shoes."

821
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,535
"Two pairs of running shoes from Salomon."

822
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,175
- You sound the same. - That was similar.

823
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:47,646
- He has a nice voice. - All right.

824
00:26:47,846 --> 00:26:49,416
You even get running shoes.

825
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,245
- All right. - We might not get them.

826
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:53,986
If we fail in Round Two,

827
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,815
you lose everything.

828
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:57,955
- Even the gift card? - Yes.

829
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:00,586
- They lose everything. - Watch the show before you come.

830
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,425
Those running shoes are comfortable.

831
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:05,325
- I watched every episode. - They're popular.

832
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,025
We cleared Round One so easily...

833
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,135
- that it makes me nervous. - I feel nervous too.

834
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,236
Round One was way too easy.

835
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,505
(Round 2:)

836
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,336
(All 4 people must succeed.)

837
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,566
- Gosh. - It went straight to all four?

838
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:20,206
It suddenly became hard.

839
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,315
- This is too difficult. - It is.

840
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:24,346
Let's see.

841
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:26,445
I don't think I can do it.

842
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:27,726
- You can do it. - We can do it.

843
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:28,985
All four won't be easy.

844
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:30,932
- Jin Kyeong is a bit... You did it. - That's good.

845
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:31,956
Jin Kyeong can do it.
- That's good. - You can do it.

846
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,885
- I'm scared. - Should we try right away?

847
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,955
- Yes. - We can clear Round Two.

848
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:37,625
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

849
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:38,965
Let's give it a try.

850
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:40,695
- It's Round Two. - Can we start with Jae Suk?

851
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:41,696
- Should I go first? - Yes.

852
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:43,012
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

853
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,406
- It's over if one person fails. - Yes, it is.

854
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:47,606
- So we have to make it work. - That's right.

855
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,205
You're last.

856
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:51,275
(Smiling)

857
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:52,545
The look on your face says...

858
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,666
- You're hoping he'll fail first. - You keep smiling.

859
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,746
Here I go.

860
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:00,216
(It is over if anyone fails.)

861
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,926
I knew it, although I was nervous about going first.

862
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:10,695
Good job. I feel pressured,

863
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:12,125
- knowing we all have to succeed. - It's pressuring.

864
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:14,266
I bounced it and moved the cone to my right hand.

865
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:16,066
You can do it.

866
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:19,706
Just like I practiced.

867
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:21,706
Just bounce it. There.

868
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:23,736
- Gosh. - Gosh.

869
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:26,845
- Fail. - Yeon Seok.

870
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:28,126
(They fail on their second try.)

871
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:32,046
I knew you'd fail when you were joking around.

872
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:35,416
- When it's your turn, - How could you fail?

873
00:28:35,586 --> 00:28:36,715
You feel pressured.

874
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,255
You just have to bounce the ball and catch it.

875
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:39,725
Let's start with Jin Kyeong this time.

876
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,602
- They don't comfort one another. - You go first.

877
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:44,196
- It works well... - This is a lot of pressure.

878
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,826
- when you're practicing. - Right.

879
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,306
But not when it's the real deal.

880
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:48,936
- It works. - Right?

881
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:51,096
Jae Suk is really good.

882
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:52,706
Okay.

883
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:54,735
- Let's start our third try. - What's okay? It's over now.

884
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:55,805
No, we can still play.

885
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:57,335
- We can? - We have several tries left.

886
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,745
- We have several chances left. - Haven't you seen the show?

887
00:28:58,746 --> 00:28:59,976
Please watch the show.

888
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,705
- Jin Kyeong. - Do you want to step out...

889
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,046
and watch the show?

890
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:04,645
We get ten tries.

891
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,215
- And you even won bonus coupons. - I watched all the episodes.

892
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:08,685
Yeon Seok has hip problems.

893
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:10,486
- Hip problems? - I watched all the episodes.

894
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:12,155
- You don't have to be disappointed. - All right.

895
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:13,156
- That's right. - All right.
- This is our third try. - Let's try again.

896
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:15,355
- Third try. - Let's start with Jin Kyeong.

897
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:17,296
- Here we go. - Here we go. In 1, 2, 3.

898
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:18,996
Ta-da.

899
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,566
(She fails.)

900
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:26,966
Jin Kyeong.

901
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,476
- We didn't even get to start. - Ta-da.

902
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,006
You wearing clothes with holes for a reason.

903
00:29:33,576 --> 00:29:35,415
- Are you saying she's in a hole? - He's saying that.

904
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,176
(The sudden criticism of the Whenever Guest)

905
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:39,415
- She's in a hole. - Why am I so bad at this...

906
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,445
when it's the real game?

907
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,315
- Why don't we use a coupon? - Let's do that.

908
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:43,515
- Yes. - We should use a coupon.

909
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:44,885
- I think we should use it now. - What a waste.

910
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:45,986
It's a waste.

911
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,185
We have to take one person out.

912
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,195
- You have to eliminate the hole. - Okay.

913
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:52,025
- We'll change... - That's harsh.

914
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,395
"Eliminate the hole?"

915
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,896
Choose the person you want to change.

916
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:56,566
- You can... - "Eliminate the hole?"

917
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,465
You can stare at the person.

918
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:00,935
(It's a no-brainer.)

919
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,306
- Excuse me. - All right.

920
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:04,236
The lead vocalist will step out for a while.

921
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:06,575
- Our lead vocalist. - I'll step out.

922
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:07,605
Let's practice.

923
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,415
(Practicing)

924
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,375
- Okay, that's good. - You can practice more.

925
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,385
- Okay. - That's good.

926
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,826
(Being a master of juggling, he catches the ball every time.)

927
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,616
You just need to get the knack of it.

928
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:18,686
Right.

929
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:20,155
It isn't difficult.

930
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,885
(Practicing intensely)

931
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,096
- Okay. - All right.

932
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:25,766
We'll use our bonus chance.

933
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,766
In 1, 2, 3.

934
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:28,876
- Here we go. - Here we go.

935
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,216
- Let's start with Jung Su. - Should I go first?

936
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,565
- Nice. - Gosh, that was good.

937
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:37,535
(Coupon Round: Jung Su, Dong Hwi)

938
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,276
Good luck, Dong Hwi.

939
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,316
(He fails.)

940
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:51,485
Come on.

941
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:54,055
- I should've said this earlier. - Come on.

942
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:56,056
- Dong Hwi. - Why didn't you practice?

943
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:58,095
You threw it to the side.

944
00:30:58,096 --> 00:30:59,796
Why didn't you practice?

945
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:02,296
- Answer me. - Why are you so confident?

946
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,235
Why are you so confident?

947
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:05,916
(She takes the opportunity to nag at him.)

948
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,006
Look at Jung Su.

949
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:11,775
We wouldn't have been embarrassed if Jung Su had failed.

950
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:13,645
- Let's... - I have to step out, right?

951
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:16,276
- Yes, go back to your seat. - I'm so sorry.

952
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:18,715
Jin Kyeong is back.

953
00:31:18,716 --> 00:31:19,785
Stop it.

954
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:21,416
(Small hole, Big hole)

955
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:23,416
- This is... - It's difficult.

956
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:26,425
It looks easy when you're watching it from home.

957
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,026
- But it isn't. - I get very nervous.

958
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,495
All right. Stay calm.

959
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:31,755
- This floor is uneven. - Yes.

960
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,276
- Aim for this spot. - The black tile.

961
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:35,536
- That's right. - It worked.

962
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:38,905
- Good job. - I have to aim for the black tile.

963
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:40,235
- We got this. - Okay.

964
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:41,982
- Shall we start with Dong Hwi? - Yes, I'll go first.

965
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:44,205
In 1, 2, 3.

966
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:45,286
- Here we go. - Here we go.

967
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,286
- I'm sweating. - I have to succeed this time.

968
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:48,346
It's Round Two.

969
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,307
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

970
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:54,986
- Okay, I got it. - Nice. It's Jin Kyeong's turn.

971
00:31:55,116 --> 00:31:56,886
- Please. - Aim for a flat surface.

972
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,425
Nice. It's Jin Kyeong's turn. Be cautious.

973
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:00,656
Aim for a flat surface.

974
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:02,955
Nice. It's Jin Kyeong's turn. Be cautious.

975
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,196
Aim for a flat surface.

976
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:05,766
- Okay. - Good job.

977
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:07,416
- Go slowly. - Aim for a flat surface.

978
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,696
- Okay. - Good job.

979
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:14,365
Okay. Here I go.

980
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,005
- Let this be our last try. - I won't fail.

981
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:18,236
- All right. Good luck. - Aim for a flat surface.

982
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:20,206
I got this.

983
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,176
- You did it. - You did it.

984
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,215
(Fifth try: Dong Hwi, Jin Kyeong, Yeon Seok, Jae Suk)

985
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:26,686
I have to overcome the extreme stress and succeed.

986
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:28,715
- You did it. - I have to overcome...

987
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:31,356
- the extreme stress and succeed. - We got this.

988
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,786
I'll be watching you, Jae Suk.

989
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:37,795
Here I go.

990
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:39,796
(If Jae Suk catches the ball, they clear Round 2!)

991
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:41,266
- Jae Suk. - Okay.

992
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:54,706
Jae Suk.

993
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:57,346
(Screaming)

994
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,986
Jae Suk.

995
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,346
(Screaming)

996
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:03,856
Jae Suk.

997
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,656
Come on.

998
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,456
(Sighing)

999
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:11,856
Wait.

1000
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,865
Why do you get nervous at the most critical moment?

1001
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:16,666
You were hard on me earlier.

1002
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,335
- What is wrong with him? - Should I go last?

1003
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:22,205
- What? - Wait a second.

1004
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,635
"What is wrong with him?"

1005
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:25,105
(She criticizes him politely.)

1006
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,775
- Jin Kyeong, how could you? - Come on.

1007
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:31,016
I couldn't overcome the stress at the end.

1008
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:32,986
Still...

1009
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:34,915
We should've been cheering for you.

1010
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,356
I'm sorry.

1011
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,586
We have to succeed...

1012
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,725
- this time. - We have to.

1013
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,855
We might be able to go to Round Three.

1014
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,895
That's right. We can go to Round Three.

1015
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,625
This is our seventh try.

1016
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,425
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

1017
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,266
- I'll go first. - The floor is important.

1018
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,896
This is how I do it.

1019
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,566
- I knew it. - I did it.

1020
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:56,776
Jae Suk is really good.

1021
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,245
- Should I... Okay. - I'll go next.

1022
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,276
In 1, 2, 3.

1023
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:02,646
- Okay. - Good job.

1024
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,675
Good job. You did it.

1025
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,216
(Sigh of relief)

1026
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,416
(The pressure gets bigger.)

1027
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,585
- I'll go next. - Okay.

1028
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:12,662
- You can go last. - That would be too much pressure.

1029
00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:14,025
- Okay. - I'll go first.

1030
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:16,226
(Seventh try: Jae Suk, Jin Kyeong, Dong Hwi, Yeon Seok)

1031
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,195
- That's right. - I did it.

1032
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:22,295
(Seventh try: Jae Suk, Jin Kyeong, Dong Hwi, Yeon Seok)

1033
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,635
This is so much pressure.

1034
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:25,366
- I'm sweating profusely. - He did it.

1035
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:28,635
You got this.

1036
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,876
- Going last is tough. - You got this.

1037
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:34,345
I feel nervous whenever I go last.

1038
00:34:34,346 --> 00:34:35,575
I'm sweating.

1039
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:36,815
- Okay. - Just do what you've always done.

1040
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:38,175
- Just like you practiced. - Okay.

1041
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,446
- Just like you practiced. - Aim for a flat surface.

1042
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:42,116
That's right.

1043
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,286
(Please!)

1044
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,356
- Nice. - Yes.

1045
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,525
(They did it!)

1046
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:55,566
Aim for a flat surface.

1047
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:57,666
- That's right. - Nice.

1048
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,376
(They clear Round 2!)

1049
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:05,206
- We did it. - All right.

1050
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:07,346
- All right. - We did it.

1051
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,145
- That... - That was nerve-racking.

1052
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:11,216
Wait a second.

1053
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:14,986
I was very anxious.

1054
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:17,286
- Gosh. - Then...

1055
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,755
- we have 4 tries left. - We have 4 tries left.

1056
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:23,795
- You have to decide. - Think it over carefully.

1057
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:25,725
- That's right. - Yes, seriously.

1058
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:28,295
- You don't have to be greedy. - That's right.

1059
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:31,266
- You can discuss it together. - Discuss it.

1060
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,046
Don't you think they can do it?

1061
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:37,076
It'll be tougher than the previous rounds.

1062
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:40,245
- You're right. - The ball might get smaller.

1063
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,246
Let's give it a try.

1064
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:44,145
- We've made a decision. - In 1, 2, 3.

1065
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:45,146
- Go. - Go.

1066
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:48,186
- But... - You could lose everything.

1067
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:51,166
How are you confident enough to tell us to continue?

1068
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,125
First...

1069
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:55,625
- You should check the present. - Let's check the present.

1070
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:56,855
"We always have sore muscles."

1071
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,655
"We'd like to get quality rest during our one-hour break."

1072
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,925
- "A massage chair." - What?

1073
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:02,025
That's awesome. A massage chair?

1074
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,036
- A massage chair? - It won't even fit in here.

1075
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,736
- Let's just... - That's the chair.

1076
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,935
- That's awesome. - Gosh.

1077
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,105
(Gasping)

1078
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:13,675
We happen to have a break room.

1079
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:14,705
- You do? - Yes.

1080
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,516
We can fit it in there.

1081
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,415
- That's expensive. - I wanted to buy one.

1082
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,615
- You did? - Yes.

1083
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:22,685
I was hoping to buy one someday.

1084
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:23,955
It's very nice.

1085
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:26,685
- It's expensive. - The important thing is...

1086
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:28,806
- I bet it'll be quite hard. - What do we have to do?

1087
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,095
(Round 3:)

1088
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:33,166
(Bounce the ball and get it on the next person's cone.)

1089
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:39,766
My gosh.

1090
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:41,305
What about Jin Kyeong?

1091
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:43,666
One person will only bounce it, and one will only catch it.

1092
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,276
- I'll bounce it. - That's a relief.

1093
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:47,056
- I'll bounce it. - It doesn't matter who.

1094
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,445
- Should we go this way? - Let's practice.

1095
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:50,676
In 1, 2, 3.

1096
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,246
- Wait. - This is a disaster.

1097
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,955
Can you look at the next person when you bounce it?

1098
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,386
I have to catch the ball.

1099
00:36:58,556 --> 00:36:59,585
You're only...

1100
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:00,855
- You're only focused on your ball. - I have to catch the ball.

1101
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,695
You can't throw the ball carelessly.

1102
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:05,225
- Let's try again. - Think about me too.

1103
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:06,896
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1104
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:08,666
Wait a second.

1105
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,665
- Wait a second. - This is hard.

1106
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,835
- This is hard. - This is hard.

1107
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:13,235
Wait a second.

1108
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:14,865
- Toss it straight down. - Okay.

1109
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,575
- Make sure it comes up straight. - I'll bounce it like this too.

1110
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:17,875
You have to be considerate of the person next to you.

1111
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,046
In 1, 2, 3.

1112
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:21,276
- Nice. - Gosh.

1113
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:22,515
I think this will work.

1114
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:23,615
Let's try that again.

1115
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,886
- This is it. - This will work.

1116
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:27,515
- It'll work. - It'll work.

1117
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:29,455
- It'll work. - Should we try it?

1118
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,015
- Yes, let's try. - Let's try.

1119
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,656
This is our 8th try and we're in Round 3.

1120
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,725
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

1121
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:39,296
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

1122
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:42,266
(Round 3 to win a massage chair!)

1123
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:46,936
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1124
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:54,905
(It was close, but they fail.)

1125
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,275
Jin Kyeong, you...

1126
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,046
Why are you blaming me?

1127
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,245
- You... - Why are you blaming me?

1128
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:01,545
The ball bounced to the side.

1129
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,155
Why are you blaming me?

1130
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,236
- It had to bounce up straight. - It was your fault.

1131
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:07,325
- You were horrible at catching it. - No, wait.

1132
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,425
The ball bounced to the side.

1133
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:12,725
- That was funny. - I couldn't have done better.

1134
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,065
I think I can catch it next time.

1135
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:17,065
Wait. Let's not try right away. Let's use a coupon.

1136
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,165
- All right. - Okay.

1137
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,705
- Practice first. - Okay.

1138
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:20,936
(Coupon)

1139
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:23,405
- Bounce it. - Jin Kyeong threw a curve ball.

1140
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:24,806
- That's good. - Try again.

1141
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:28,046
- Good. - I bounce it well.

1142
00:38:29,946 --> 00:38:31,015
That's good.

1143
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:32,145
- All right. - We can do this.

1144
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,915
- Let's try. - Should we try?

1145
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,385
This is a bonus coupon round. In 1, 2, 3.

1146
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:37,386
- Here we go. - Here we go.

1147
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:39,356
(Bonus coupon round)

1148
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,026
Please.

1149
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:48,896
In 1, 2, 3.

1150
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,636
(They did it!)

1151
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:58,836
Three.

1152
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,376
Three.

1153
00:39:07,086 --> 00:39:08,086
(Screaming)

1154
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,985
- We did it. - We did it.

1155
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:11,986
(They did it easily.)

1156
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:14,526
We did it.

1157
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,956
- It worked. - You did it.

1158
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:20,696
- That's a relief. - Gosh.

1159
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:22,636
It worked when Dong Hwi stepped out.

1160
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:26,406
(Today's hidden MVP)

1161
00:39:26,936 --> 00:39:29,805
With this, you get the massage chair in Round Three.

1162
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:30,935
- Success! - Nice.

1163
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:31,936
(They won a bookstore gift card, running shoes, and massage chair.)

1164
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,775
- Congratulations. - You got the massage chair.

1165
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:35,505
- You really needed it. - Thank you so much.

1166
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,576
Thank you.

1167
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,015
Thank you.

1168
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,486
Can you get up, Jin Kyeong?

1169
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:41,415
She's so tall.

1170
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:42,716
(Watch your head.)

1171
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:44,615
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1172
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,085
- You're a lucky charm. - I will...

1173
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:48,086
- This is a relief. - Congratulations.

1174
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,126
That feels good.

1175
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,695
I didn't expect us to succeed in all three rounds.

1176
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:53,925
- This feels good. - Hello.

1177
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:54,926
- Really. - Hello.

1178
00:39:54,927 --> 00:39:57,035
- Hello. - Hello, ma'am.

1179
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:59,065
The moment we succeeded, I got goosebumps.

1180
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,335
- That's right. - It feels good, right?

1181
00:40:00,336 --> 00:40:01,465
- I felt a burst of dopamine. - Seriously.

1182
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,835
(They get a taste of success.)

1183
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:05,176
- It feels good. - I was nervous.

1184
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:07,975
- Dong Hwi... - It wasn't an easy mission.

1185
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:09,816
- No, it wasn't. - As soon as Dong Hwi left...

1186
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:12,016
- Wait. - It wasn't easy.

1187
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,385
The fact that we succeeded is important.

1188
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:15,815
That's when we succeeded.

1189
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:17,816
I just feel happy.

1190
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:19,755
Where are we headed next?

1191
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,825
I have to check first.

1192
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:24,626
- Should we go under that tree? - Yes, let's do that.

1193
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:27,465
- What time do we have to be there? - By 1:30pm.

1194
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,825
- We have some time. - Then we should have lunch.

1195
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,465
We can go after having lunch.

1196
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,035
What should we have, Jin Kyeong? What is nearby?

1197
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:36,105
Let's go to the pork ribs restaurant.

1198
00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:38,375
Are you okay with that when you have it every Sunday?

1199
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:39,875
- It's okay. - Are you sure?

1200
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:41,775
- The restaurant... - Do you want something else?

1201
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:43,745
No, I wanted pork ribs. I'm just making sure you're okay.

1202
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:45,346
Let's go have pork ribs.

1203
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,515
- Let's have pork ribs. - Yes, let's have it.

1204
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:51,585
But you have pork ribs every Sunday.

1205
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:53,525
- It's really good, Jae Suk. - I have to try this.

1206
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:55,455
- Let's go. - You have to try it.

1207
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:56,955
- Let's have pork ribs. - It's charcoal-grilled.

1208
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,465
Let's go to the place Jin Kyeong recommended.

1209
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:00,696
- Yes. - They use briquettes.

1210
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:02,366
They do?

1211
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:08,306
That place is also nice and tasty.

1212
00:41:09,306 --> 00:41:11,005
He's suddenly taking snapshots.

1213
00:41:11,006 --> 00:41:13,146
I take good photos of her.

1214
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:15,845
- Yeon Seok. - Yes?

1215
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:17,815
You were so good...

1216
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:19,285
- in "The Beauty Inside." - Did you watch it?

1217
00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:22,916
- Really? - I rarely re-watch movies.

1218
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:25,516
- It was directed by Baik Jong Yeol. - That's right.

1219
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,456
I loved that movie.

1220
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:29,255
I was in the latter part of the movie.

1221
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,455
It was so nice.

1222
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:32,325
- In the Czech Republic. - Right.

1223
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,366
Dong Hwi was also...

1224
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:34,795
Yes.

1225
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:36,365
- That's right. - Dong Hwi was in the movie too.

1226
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:38,886
I'm sorry, Jin Kyeong, but I was in a big portion of the movie.

1227
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,305
- Jin Kyeong. - He was in the most scenes.

1228
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:43,305
Han Hyo Joo and I are in the most scenes.

1229
00:41:43,306 --> 00:41:44,635
This is disappointing, Jin Kyeong.

1230
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,445
You're doing this on purpose because you're in a bad mood, right?

1231
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:48,905
Dong Hwi's face was in the most scenes.

1232
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,845
I'm in the most scenes.

1233
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:53,345
- I was in the whole movie. - My voice is in the whole thing.

1234
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:55,215
But my face is only in the scenes in the Czech Republic.

1235
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:56,555
- This is disappointing, Jin Kyeong. - You know what?

1236
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,355
I didn't know Dong Hwi was in it.

1237
00:41:58,356 --> 00:41:59,455
- That's okay. - She didn't know...

1238
00:41:59,456 --> 00:42:01,525
- Don't tell him! - She didn't know he was in it.

1239
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:04,155
- I'm in the entire movie. - Don't tell him.

1240
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:05,696
(Jin Kyeong's selective memory)

1241
00:42:06,466 --> 00:42:08,226
You should keep my secret.

1242
00:42:08,466 --> 00:42:10,866
- I... - How could you share my secret?

1243
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:14,536
Do you know how much she made fun of me in Japan?

1244
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,676
The Japanese people only recognized Jin Kyeong.

1245
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:19,005
I just stood next to her.

1246
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,376
But she asked them, "Do you like him?"

1247
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,345
When they didn't even know who I was.

1248
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:27,345
She kept asking them and gave me a hard time.

1249
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:29,362
- Watch out for that car. - She asked, "Do you like him?"

1250
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:31,516
Jin Kyeong is taller than the Ray.

1251
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:32,955
- You're right. - What?

1252
00:42:32,956 --> 00:42:34,425
I'm sure she's 185cm.

1253
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,625
She was taller than the Ray.

1254
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:36,755
- She's 185cm. - Jae Suk.

1255
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:37,826
Can I punch Dong Hwi?

1256
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,626
I had a medical check-up recently.

1257
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,605
Honestly, I'm 179.8cm.

1258
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,835
- You're over 180cm. - That can't be true.

1259
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:51,175
- I'm 179.5cm. - She's over 180cm.

1260
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:53,746
- You aren't 179cm. - That can't be true.

1261
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,075
- Come on. - You aren't 179cm.

1262
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,415
She's definitely taller than you.

1263
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,075
- How is she... - Jin Kyeong is tall.

1264
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,545
- I'm over 179cm. - No, you aren't.

1265
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:03,355
- I get medical check-ups too. - You aren't 179cm.

1266
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:05,255
Is there an orthopedic clinic nearby?

1267
00:43:05,256 --> 00:43:06,725
- Jin Kyeong. - Let's go to a clinic.

1268
00:43:06,726 --> 00:43:08,155
You were taller than the Ray.

1269
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:09,285
That's true.

1270
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,295
- You're taller than the Ray. - Yes.

1271
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,655
You're taller than that Labo.

1272
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:12,726
You're right.

1273
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:15,695
Of course, I'm taller than the Labo.

1274
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:18,435
You're taller than most cars, right?

1275
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,305
- That's enough. - Yes.

1276
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,112
- I complimented you earlier. - She's taller than SUVs.

1277
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:24,336
Jin Kyeong,

1278
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:26,805
- calm down while having pork ribs. - Jae Suk,

1279
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:29,686
you made it seem like you'd be nice to me when you cast me for the show.

1280
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,245
You made it seem like you'd be kind.

1281
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,145
I am kind to you.

1282
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:35,316
We're kind to you.

1283
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:37,756
We're very kind.

1284
00:43:37,956 --> 00:43:39,116
Wait a minute.

1285
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,525
- This street leads uphill. - Is this the right way?

1286
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:43,425
- It's so far. - We should cross the street.

1287
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:47,025
It's chilly. Can we have spicy pollack stew?

1288
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:48,565
No. Why do you suddenly ask?

1289
00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:50,035
- We're on our way. - Why all of a sudden?

1290
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:52,165
Jae Suk seems to be tired of walking.

1291
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,246
What are you talking about?

1292
00:43:54,136 --> 00:43:56,606
I think we'd be a horrible group to travel together.

1293
00:43:57,006 --> 00:43:58,382
If you want to go somewhere else, let's have seolleongtang.

1294
00:43:58,406 --> 00:44:01,145
- Seolleongtang? - The beef bone soup noodles place.

1295
00:44:01,146 --> 00:44:02,205
Should we have seolleongtang?

1296
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,415
- Where? - Dong Hwi said it's good.

1297
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,775
- It's okay to walk. - No.

1298
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,215
- I can walk. - It's too far.

1299
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:08,885
- We can walk. - Let's have noodles.

1300
00:44:08,886 --> 00:44:11,915
- They have amazing pork bulgogi. - I want noodles.

1301
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,886
- Then... - Okay then.

1302
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,395
- Let's go there then. - Okay.

1303
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:17,896
- It's close. - All right.

1304
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:20,525
- They have amazing pork bulgogi. - Really?

1305
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:22,265
- Yes, the bulgogi. - Bulgogi?

1306
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,946
- That sounds tasty. - It better be tasty.

1307
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:26,835
"It better be tasty?"

1308
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:28,965
- Hello. - You can have seolleongtang.

1309
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,105
I like seolleongtang.

1310
00:44:30,106 --> 00:44:31,586
- Okay. - You can have seolleongtang.

1311
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,706
(While Jae Suk and Jin Kyeong are in the restroom, )

1312
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,875
(the other two get a table.)

1313
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,015
Does Jae Suk like sitting inside?

1314
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,736
- It doesn't matter. - Should I sit inside?

1315
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,085
I always wear a cap and mask. So they don't seem to recognize me.

1316
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:48,426
They don't know you're a regular here?

1317
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,256
Beef bone soup noodles?

1318
00:44:50,526 --> 00:44:52,865
It's a neat restaurant. I can tell...

1319
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:54,726
- that they serve good food. - I agree.

1320
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,136
Rainy days make you crave soup.

1321
00:44:57,596 --> 00:44:59,935
Ma'am, we'll have four beef bone soup noodles,

1322
00:44:59,936 --> 00:45:01,416
one plate of pan-fried fish fillet...

1323
00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:04,436
How much bulgogi should we order for four people?

1324
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,806
- Maybe 3. - We'll order 3.

1325
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:08,206
- Bulgogi. - It's good.

1326
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,776
- Do you often come to this area? - I do.

1327
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:13,046
I come by very often.

1328
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:15,486
I often come here to see Kim Jong Soo.

1329
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,356
I love the vibe of this neighborhood.

1330
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:21,685
There's also a clothing shop that I often visit.

1331
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:22,755
Really?

1332
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,626
I plan on going there after this shoot.

1333
00:45:25,196 --> 00:45:26,666
- To buy clothes? - Yes.

1334
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:29,536
- That's why... - I heard you were watching a show.

1335
00:45:29,736 --> 00:45:32,035
- I have time to kill before that. - Whose show is it?

1336
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:33,066
The Black Skirts.

1337
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,736
(Jin Kyeong is going with him.)

1338
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:37,735
What did you order here?

1339
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,276
- Bulgogi. - That's bulgogi.

1340
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:42,105
- The bulgogi is so good here. - It's a lot.

1341
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,776
- It's nice to eat after a success. - I feel so good today.

1342
00:45:45,016 --> 00:45:46,215
Do you also eat breakfast?

1343
00:45:46,216 --> 00:45:47,516
Not really.

1344
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:49,985
- You always eat breakfast, right? - Yes.

1345
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:52,515
- She has a hearty breakfast. - Really?

1346
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,285
- Are you a morning person? - Yes.

1347
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:55,862
- I go to bed early, and... - What time do you get up?

1348
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,926
- At around 6:30am. - Right.

1349
00:45:57,996 --> 00:45:58,996
Really?

1350
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:00,296
Dong Hwi, do you go to bed late?

1351
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:03,396
I usually go to bed at 1am, but I don't sleep that long.

1352
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:04,695
- So, - What?

1353
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,266
I also wake up at 6:30am.

1354
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:07,935
- You're sleeping so little. - Yes.

1355
00:46:07,936 --> 00:46:09,536
- About 5 hours. - You go to bed at 1am?

1356
00:46:09,606 --> 00:46:11,306
I sleep for 4 to 5 hours.

1357
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,875
And I don't have any blackout curtains at home.

1358
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:14,906
You should get one.

1359
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,315
But I like it without them.

1360
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:18,746
It feels nice to have the sunlight wake me up.

1361
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:22,885
- I saw your house on "Pinggyego," - Your place looked great.

1362
00:46:22,886 --> 00:46:24,985
And it was beautiful! I'd never have guessed...

1363
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:26,856
- a guy lived there alone. - Thank you.

1364
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:28,985
I've been to Yeon Seok's house...

1365
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,986
- and your house. - I've never been to your place.

1366
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:33,165
Your homes were beautiful as well.

1367
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,196
(Pondering)

1368
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:35,596
Do you two know each other?

1369
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:36,635
- Yes. - Of course.

1370
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:38,235
- We've known for a long time. - Oh, the movie.

1371
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:39,735
Ever since "The Beauty Inside."

1372
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:42,065
- He and I have known for... - How many times do we have to...

1373
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,576
I'm sorry, but...

1374
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,145
- we've even been to Dubai together. - That's my bad.

1375
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:48,175
- Lead vocalist. - I'm sorry.

1376
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:49,176
- You're making a lot of mistakes. - I'm sorry.

1377
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:51,276
Sometimes, I don't think you're even Korean.

1378
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,615
You're like a punk rock singer.

1379
00:46:52,616 --> 00:46:54,245
- It's the fish fillet. - Pan-fried fish fillet.

1380
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:56,046
- We ordered it for you, Jin Kyeong. - Great.

1381
00:46:56,286 --> 00:46:57,386
Thank you.

1382
00:46:57,586 --> 00:46:58,786
That looks scrumptious.

1383
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:00,056
Have some, Jin Kyeong.

1384
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:01,956
- It's golden-brown. - Goodness.

1385
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:08,425
- Now I know why you mentioned it. - It's good, right?

1386
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,135
- This is so good. - I usually eat at this table.

1387
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:11,656
- This is a great restaurant. - It is.

1388
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,166
(Trying a piece with kimchi)

1389
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:16,606
It's tender.

1390
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:19,036
- You can tell from their kimchi. - Is that so?

1391
00:47:19,906 --> 00:47:21,145
Their kimchi looks good.

1392
00:47:21,146 --> 00:47:22,276
- Yes. - It is good.

1393
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:23,476
It's delicious.

1394
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:25,636
This restaurant goes on my list today.

1395
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,385
- Ma'am. Do you have more kimchi? - They have great kimchi.

1396
00:47:28,386 --> 00:47:29,386
- Is it good? - Yes?

1397
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:31,085
- She's an expert, after all. - If the CEO of a kimchi company...

1398
00:47:31,086 --> 00:47:33,002
- says so, it means it's good. - It's really delicious.

1399
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:35,186
How old are you, Yeon Seok?

1400
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:38,156
I'm 41.

1401
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:40,642
- Are you two the same age? - Born in 1984.

1402
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,766
He was born in 1984.

1403
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,666
- I'm a year older. - Yes, he is.

1404
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:45,666
Where do you live, Yeon Seok?

1405
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:47,306
I live in Yongsan.

1406
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:48,866
We live pretty close to each other.

1407
00:47:49,206 --> 00:47:50,476
- Really? - In Itaewon.

1408
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:52,236
Jin Kyeong,

1409
00:47:52,906 --> 00:47:54,306
why do you only ask Yeon Seok?

1410
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:58,276
(She forgot about Dong Hwi again.)

1411
00:47:59,786 --> 00:48:01,046
(Eating bulgogi)

1412
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:04,016
I loved "The Beauty Inside."

1413
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,385
Dong Hwi was like the lead actor.

1414
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,686
- This is good. Try it, Jin Kyeong. - Try the meat.

1415
00:48:08,926 --> 00:48:10,196
- It's good. - Yeon Seok.

1416
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,932
You can tell if the meat is good from a glance.

1417
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,296
- The meat is really fresh. - It looks so good.

1418
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,636
- This is... - This is a great restaurant.

1419
00:48:17,036 --> 00:48:19,365
That's what we call a difficult customer.

1420
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:20,882
(Pointing his chopsticks at it as a sign of approval)

1421
00:48:20,906 --> 00:48:22,005
I like how it's not too sweet.

1422
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:23,606
- This is... - It's one of my favorites.

1423
00:48:25,276 --> 00:48:27,005
I could order some to go for the kids at home.

1424
00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:28,576
- Right. - It's so tasty.

1425
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,646
- No wonder Dong Hwi likes it. - It's so good.

1426
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,915
There's a reason it's been around this neighborhood for a long time.

1427
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:36,485
(When Jae Suk likes the food, he makes eye contact with the crew.)

1428
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:38,755
There was this Japanese-style inn.

1429
00:48:38,756 --> 00:48:41,785
(And he stops talking.)

1430
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,895
You know? And this neighborhood...

1431
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:46,495
(He's practically eating with his nose in the bowl.)

1432
00:48:46,496 --> 00:48:48,126
It goes well with the weather.

1433
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,395
Jae Suk is really enjoying the food.

1434
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:51,596
Of course.

1435
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:53,135
- I love this. - He loves the food.

1436
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:55,366
- I can tell he genuinely likes it. - It's so good.

1437
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:56,736
I should order some to go.

1438
00:48:57,006 --> 00:48:58,526
- Sure. - I think Na Eun will like it.

1439
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,075
- Have some of this. - Thank you.

1440
00:49:01,076 --> 00:49:02,906
- Do you want some bulgogi to go? - Sorry?

1441
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:05,716
- Maybe 3 servings each. - I only need 2.

1442
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:06,985
- Just two? - Same for me.

1443
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,486
Two servings each? Okay.

1444
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,486
- Thanks, Jae Suk. - It's nothing.

1445
00:49:10,886 --> 00:49:14,056
Ma'am, we'll take some bulgogi to go.

1446
00:49:14,726 --> 00:49:16,596
Two servings, two servings, and four servings.

1447
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:19,696
- Two, two, and four? - Yes.

1448
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:22,526
I ate too much.

1449
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:24,695
(He needs to adjust the microphone strap.)

1450
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:25,836
It's so good.

1451
00:49:26,906 --> 00:49:28,035
It was way better than I expected.

1452
00:49:28,036 --> 00:49:29,165
- Yeon Seok. - Yes?

1453
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,376
- About the strap... - Yes?

1454
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:33,746
I was on "The Lives of Others,"

1455
00:49:34,046 --> 00:49:35,446
and I had a huge lunch.

1456
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:37,275
As soon as the play began, the strap came off,

1457
00:49:37,276 --> 00:49:38,916
so I had to hold on to it the whole time.

1458
00:49:39,316 --> 00:49:40,985
- Because I was so full. - It came off under your shirt?

1459
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:42,145
It just popped open.

1460
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,715
I can't get off the stage for ten minutes once I'm there.

1461
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,486
You've watched the play, so you know.

1462
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:50,695
I put one hand in my pocket and held on to the microphone.

1463
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,977
And the funny thing is, after the show, Kim Jun Han said,

1464
00:49:53,426 --> 00:49:55,765
"I loved how you started..."

1465
00:49:55,766 --> 00:49:57,006
"with one hand in your pocket."

1466
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,865
As if you discovered a new way of acting.

1467
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:02,466
He thought I had reinterpreted the role.

1468
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,205
So, he took a close look.

1469
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:05,806
He was like, "That was great, Dong Hwi."

1470
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:09,246
- You should think about that. - Should I try a musical?

1471
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:10,745
You're free to try it out.

1472
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,275
There are musicals for children too.

1473
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,786
Children?

1474
00:50:14,286 --> 00:50:15,946
I mean... No?

1475
00:50:16,286 --> 00:50:17,915
- Musicals for children... - But...

1476
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:19,356
- He's right, though. - You know,

1477
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:21,285
like "Jack and the Beanstalk."

1478
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:22,626
- It's like... - But...

1479
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:25,696
Or "My Daddy Long Legs."

1480
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,195
- What Jin Kyeong meant... - Yes?

1481
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:30,295
- was a musical for adults. - Right.

1482
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:32,495
You still need a lot of practice to be in musicals for children.

1483
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,666
I just meant that...

1484
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:36,836
If you're done eating, let's get out of here.

1485
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,176
Right.

1486
00:50:40,146 --> 00:50:42,846
Jin Kyeong, do you still have a desire for acting?

1487
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,075
- Acting? - Yes.

1488
00:50:44,076 --> 00:50:45,775
Well, it's like this.

1489
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,015
When I start something,

1490
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:50,515
I want to be able to reach the top in that field.

1491
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:52,355
If I can get to that level, I want to try it out.

1492
00:50:52,356 --> 00:50:54,556
For instance, being an MC is the peak of entertainment.

1493
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:57,026
And being a CEO is the peak of business.

1494
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:58,636
- There are things like that. - Yes.

1495
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:02,025
To me, the peak of acting is playing the heroine in a romantic movie.

1496
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,295
- To a woman, I mean. - I see.

1497
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:04,895
- So, that's... - Why did you laugh?

1498
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,366
Why did you laugh, Yeon Seok?

1499
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:09,975
Even I was holding it back. Why would you laugh?

1500
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:11,005
Why did you laugh?

1501
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:14,046
- I held back as hard as I could. - Yeon Seok, that made me angry.

1502
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:15,822
- It's very offensive. - Why would you laugh?

1503
00:51:15,846 --> 00:51:17,815
- Just hear me out. - Sorry.

1504
00:51:17,816 --> 00:51:19,846
I wasn't saying that I'd be in a romantic movie.

1505
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:23,355
- It's just... - Anyway,

1506
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:24,915
that's why I stopped thinking about it.

1507
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,886
When Park Ji Eun, the writer, offered me a role,

1508
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,925
I rejected it until the end.

1509
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:32,456
I told her I could never do it.

1510
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,425
And I asked her to convince me why I should play...

1511
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,665
a friend of Jun Ji Hyun's when I'm already doing great...

1512
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,036
on variety shows.

1513
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:42,135
I told her I wasn't convinced,

1514
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:43,305
- so I wouldn't do it. - But I'm convinced...

1515
00:51:43,306 --> 00:51:44,676
that you can play her friend.

1516
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:47,646
That was what I told her, but she convinced me right away.

1517
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,475
(She ended up being convinced.)

1518
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:51,115
I was convinced instantly.

1519
00:51:51,116 --> 00:51:53,585
She didn't exactly try to convince me,

1520
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:55,946
- yet I was convinced right away. - You were convinced.

1521
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:59,685
That's how I stepped foot into the world of acting.

1522
00:51:59,686 --> 00:52:01,825
And it turns out that there's a whole new world.

1523
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:02,986
- There is. - Yes.

1524
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,896
(Her first role in a drama was in "My Love From the Star.")

1525
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:10,695
(Her second role was in "The Legend of Blue Sea.")

1526
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:14,436
As writer Park Ji Eun's alter ego,

1527
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:17,112
- Park Ji Eun and Jeon Ji Hyun... - Do you have permission to say it?

1528
00:52:17,136 --> 00:52:18,705
- That I'm her alter ego? - Yes.

1529
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:21,146
She did nod a few times.

1530
00:52:22,246 --> 00:52:24,315
- I poured her a few drinks, - Really?

1531
00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:25,715
- Then... - and I asked her.

1532
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:28,345
You both have to agree to say that.

1533
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,155
- She did nod. - Did she?

1534
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:33,015
- She nodded. - That means she agrees.

1535
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:36,026
Anyway, I'm open to it.

1536
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,295
- That's great. - I'm open.

1537
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:39,355
- To be in romantic shows? - Yes.

1538
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,766
We should pay for the meal now. How should we go about it?

1539
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,226
Pay for the meal?

1540
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:45,736
Are you open to that as well?

1541
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:46,866
- We should... - Payment...

1542
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:48,135
- We can play a game. - Let's play a game.

1543
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,475
Dong Hwi says he's good at rock-paper-scissors,

1544
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:52,306
- so let's play that. - Let's play that.

1545
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:53,946
Let's do it.

1546
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,776
But don't pay for the takeout. It's just this meal.

1547
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,075
- All right? - Okay.

1548
00:52:58,076 --> 00:52:59,346
- So... - Just one round?

1549
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:01,085
- Single round. - The loser pays.

1550
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:02,245
- The loser pays. - The loser pays.

1551
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,585
Rock, paper, scissors!

1552
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:06,055
(Jin Kyeong played scissors, and the rest played paper.)

1553
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:08,085
Gosh, Jin Kyeong.

1554
00:53:08,086 --> 00:53:09,256
You got lucky for once.

1555
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,456
- She beat Dong Hwi. - Great.

1556
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,465
- No way. - She beat Dong Hwi.

1557
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:14,466
This...

1558
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:15,696
- isn't right. - One more.

1559
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,136
Rock-paper-scissors with Dong Hwi.

1560
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:19,335
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Scissors!

1561
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:21,416
(Jae Suk played rock, and the rest played scissors.)

1562
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:23,606
(Jae Suk is excluded.)

1563
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:27,045
You can't lose when so little is at stake.

1564
00:53:27,046 --> 00:53:28,246
(Angry)

1565
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,945
But you don't know yet.

1566
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,622
- We should've gone to a buffet. - Dong Hwi is...

1567
00:53:32,646 --> 00:53:35,646
- We can't predict it yet. - I used all my luck in the morning.

1568
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,086
You just need to avoid...

1569
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,385
- being the final loser. - Right.

1570
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,262
- Just not the final loser. - That's all that matters.

1571
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:42,326
Okay.

1572
00:53:42,726 --> 00:53:44,055
If I turn it around twice...

1573
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:46,256
It's been some time since the last time Yeon Seok paid.

1574
00:53:47,026 --> 00:53:48,765
- I'll turn it around twice. - Okay.

1575
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:50,636
Ready or not, rock, paper, scissors!

1576
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,896
(Yeon Seok lost.)

1577
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,636
- Rock, paper, scissors! - Nice.

1578
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:57,606
(Laughing)

1579
00:53:58,676 --> 00:54:00,375
- You never lose. - I turned it around twice.

1580
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:02,182
I thought of playing rock when I saw your face,

1581
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,675
but I lost twice in a row.

1582
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:05,192
- I wasn't thinking at all. - So, I changed it again.

1583
00:54:05,216 --> 00:54:07,115
- Then... - I didn't have any plans.

1584
00:54:07,116 --> 00:54:10,186
But he kept saying that he turned it around twice.

1585
00:54:10,616 --> 00:54:13,115
He has a way of getting on your nerves.

1586
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,585
- He plays a game of nerves. - That's accurate.

1587
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:17,126
I was lying when I said I was good at rock-paper-scissors.

1588
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:20,495
- But you won in the end. - It was a joke.

1589
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:22,265
- I was just joking. - He only said that...

1590
00:54:22,266 --> 00:54:23,865
to intimidate you.

1591
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:25,196
He should have lost this one.

1592
00:54:25,836 --> 00:54:27,066
- Shall we get going? - Yes.

1593
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:29,536
- Thanks for the meal, Yeon Seok. - Sure thing.

1594
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:31,536
- Thank you. - Thank you for coming.

1595
00:54:31,537 --> 00:54:33,445
- You can throw out the receipt. - Sure.

1596
00:54:33,446 --> 00:54:34,905
- Thank you. - Thank you for the meal.

1597
00:54:34,906 --> 00:54:36,545
- Thank you. Come again. - Goodbye.

1598
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:37,646
Thank you for the meal.

1599
00:54:37,846 --> 00:54:39,115
It was delicious.

1600
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:40,385
Thanks, Yeon Seok.

1601
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:41,915
Thanks for the meal, Yeon Seok.

1602
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,455
I actually lost in rock-paper-scissors.

1603
00:54:43,456 --> 00:54:45,186
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1604
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,416
That was amazing.

1605
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,985
- The food was so good, though. - It was.

1606
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,946
- Absolutely. - I'm tapping on my belly for once.

1607
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:52,496
It's nine minutes on foot.

1608
00:54:53,096 --> 00:54:54,096
Where is it?

1609
00:54:54,196 --> 00:54:56,125
- We go straight to our right. - Okay.

1610
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,135
That's good.

1611
00:54:57,136 --> 00:54:58,896
- Thanks for the meal. - I ate so much.

1612
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,535
- Are you cold, Jin Kyeong? - Yes.

1613
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:01,705
Do you want my jacket?

1614
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:03,476
- That's fine. - No? Okay.

1615
00:55:03,506 --> 00:55:06,476
- "May I?" - Why did you even ask?

1616
00:55:06,906 --> 00:55:08,505
You said, "Okay," instantly.

1617
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,416
- Well, you said you were fine. - Right.

1618
00:55:10,616 --> 00:55:12,415
- Let me give you my jacket. - No, I'm fine.

1619
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,515
- It's okay. - It makes a huge difference.

1620
00:55:13,516 --> 00:55:15,145
- I'm fine. - Who would ask for your jacket...

1621
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,215
- when you ask her like that? - You can have it.

1622
00:55:16,216 --> 00:55:17,756
- No. I'm fine. - Wait.

1623
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:20,885
(Accepting it right away)

1624
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:22,485
- Okay, then. - He's...

1625
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,056
the meanest person I know.

1626
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:26,196
He's...

1627
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,326
way too glorified by other people.

1628
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:30,635
But...

1629
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:31,865
(Happy to have his laughter trigger)

1630
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:32,966
That's hilarious.

1631
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:37,036
Guys, do you remember this?

1632
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:39,506
The clip is all over the Internet.

1633
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:42,075
I bumped into this pole on "You Quiz on the Block."

1634
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:43,306
- Oh, right. - Did you?

1635
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:45,776
- So, this is the place. - They got rid of a pole.

1636
00:55:46,616 --> 00:55:48,516
(It was 6 years ago.)

1637
00:55:48,886 --> 00:55:50,156
(Screaming)

1638
00:55:53,826 --> 00:55:55,255
(There were exactly 2 poles here.)

1639
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:58,056
(Sae Ho.)

1640
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,696
- So, this is the place. - They got rid of a pole.

1641
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:02,595
That must be why they got rid of it.

1642
00:56:02,596 --> 00:56:04,795
- They got... - That must be it!

1643
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:06,296
They got rid of it because of you.

1644
00:56:07,266 --> 00:56:08,766
One of them is missing!

1645
00:56:09,506 --> 00:56:11,875
It's the place I bumped into.

1646
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:13,976
The government removed a pole just for Jae Suk.

1647
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:15,506
They got rid of it.

1648
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:16,645
(This man makes the government work.)

1649
00:56:16,646 --> 00:56:18,376
Come on. Don't say that.

1650
00:56:18,446 --> 00:56:19,446
I'm sure a lot of people...

1651
00:56:19,447 --> 00:56:20,745
- bumped into it... - Probably.

1652
00:56:20,746 --> 00:56:21,785
Other than you.

1653
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,345
There were two like these ones.

1654
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,455
(The Jae Suk pole is gone now.)

1655
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:26,586
And they got rid of it.

1656
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,185
It's a safety hazard, so...

1657
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:29,586
(Petting it for no reason)

1658
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:31,855
He must be so happy.

1659
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,255
(Spotting some students)

1660
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,796
He was born, and he was Yoo Jae Suk.

1661
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,066
Look at that. Look how popular he is.

1662
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:38,765
(He has fans from all age groups.)

1663
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:39,766
They all still love him.

1664
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:41,966
- Kids. - Goodness.

1665
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:44,305
(Greeting his fans in the bus that stopped)

1666
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:46,306
Look at the bus driver.

1667
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:47,846
(Even the bus driver is a fan of his.)

1668
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:50,327
- Even the driver is waving. - I haven't seen this in so long.

1669
00:56:50,446 --> 00:56:52,045
It's been so long since I last saw that peace sign.

1670
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:53,346
It's been so long.

1671
00:56:53,946 --> 00:56:56,216
The driver must be as old as we are.

1672
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,756
He knows this sign.

1673
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:01,786
The bus is driving really slowly.

1674
00:57:02,326 --> 00:57:03,856
The bus is driving slowly for him!

1675
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:06,455
That rarely happens.

1676
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,966
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1677
00:57:08,096 --> 00:57:10,025
Walking around with Jae Suk...

1678
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,065
- Goodness. - They're about to build...

1679
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:13,965
- a bus station for him. - Even the bus...

1680
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:15,565
The bus won't leave.

1681
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:18,126
- I've never seen that before. - This is going to be a bus stop.

1682
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:20,575
- Even the people... - He won't leave.

1683
00:57:20,576 --> 00:57:22,146
Who were on the bus...

1684
00:57:22,346 --> 00:57:23,545
They don't plan on leaving.

1685
00:57:23,546 --> 00:57:24,915
They're waving too.

1686
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,175
That's hilarious.

1687
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,385
(This is what happens when you walk around with Jae Suk.)

1688
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:29,446
Gosh.

1689
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:31,986
Yeon Shik, are we there yet?

1690
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:34,785
If we turn here...

1691
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:36,106
(Almost at the second spare time)

1692
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:38,695
Jin Kyeong, what are you going to do to kill time before the concert?

1693
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:39,825
- I'm... - Yes?

1694
00:57:39,826 --> 00:57:42,296
- planning on seeing someone. - Okay.

1695
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,095
After the concert,

1696
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:46,465
- I'll drive you home. - You don't have to do that.

1697
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,306
- It's fine, though. - No, but thank you.

1698
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:49,735
It's registered under my name.

1699
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:50,805
I can call a cab.

1700
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:51,905
But I want to drive you home.

1701
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:53,745
- No, it's too far. - It's right nearby.

1702
00:57:53,746 --> 00:57:55,352
Where are you going later today, Jin Kyeong?

1703
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:56,775
- She has a concert. - She said she had a concert.

1704
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:58,576
- So, I wanted to drive her home. - Really?

1705
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,545
I've run into her many times at theaters.

1706
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:03,185
- Yes, you enjoyed cultural life... - Right.

1707
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:05,485
- more than I thought. - Well...

1708
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:06,685
I think you always go when your juniors...

1709
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:07,725
- have performances. - I must.

1710
00:58:07,726 --> 00:58:09,055
- It seems like it. - Yes.

1711
00:58:09,056 --> 00:58:10,696
I'd go if Jin Kyeong had a performance.

1712
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:12,356
The "Jack and the Beanstalk" show...

1713
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:15,172
Is the story about you falling in love with Jack?

1714
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:16,226
It must be.

1715
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,765
- It's "Jack and the Beanstalk." - Stop it, Yeon Seok.

1716
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:20,096
- Jin Kyeong is... - This is our first encounter.

1717
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:23,035
- Why do you do that to me? - He can be mischievous at times.

1718
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:24,805
- We're almost there. - Do you want me to get angry?

1719
00:58:24,806 --> 00:58:25,806
"Do you want me..."

1720
00:58:25,807 --> 00:58:27,105
- He's very mischievous. - I can get angry.

1721
00:58:27,106 --> 00:58:28,646
Play some bagpipes, please.

1722
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:32,376
This is why I avoid standing next to him.

1723
00:58:32,616 --> 00:58:33,946
Gosh.

1724
00:58:34,186 --> 00:58:35,516
Play some bagpipes.

1725
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,255
- Wait. This is... - Is this it?

1726
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:38,556
I think this is it.

1727
00:58:38,686 --> 00:58:39,686
This is the place.

1728
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:41,456
- Kim Dong Gyu. - Okay.

1729
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:44,195
"I come here to listen to music,"

1730
00:58:44,196 --> 00:58:46,825
- "but it's not a music shop." - What?

1731
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:48,865
"Though there are numerous books piled up,"

1732
00:58:48,866 --> 00:58:50,495
- "it's not a bookstore." - What is it, then?

1733
00:58:50,496 --> 00:58:52,035
"Although it's not a dessert shop,"

1734
00:58:52,036 --> 00:58:53,836
"they bake cookies there every night."

1735
00:58:54,066 --> 00:58:57,675
"I invite you to my hideout, which dreams of becoming..."

1736
00:58:57,676 --> 00:58:59,305
"the biggest blank in the world."

1737
00:58:59,306 --> 00:59:01,145
- What goes in the blank? - What could it be?

1738
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:02,875
It's not a coffee shop,

1739
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:05,045
it's not a music shop, and it's not a bookstore.

1740
00:59:05,046 --> 00:59:06,575
- This looks... - This must be the place.

1741
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:07,946
Is it a photo lab?

1742
00:59:08,216 --> 00:59:09,745
- You're right. - I think it's a photo lab.

1743
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,616
"Buy film. Get a camera."

1744
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:13,015
What does it say?

1745
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,085
- Right. - "Just three dollars."

1746
00:59:14,086 --> 00:59:15,225
- And there are books. - Photos...

1747
00:59:15,226 --> 00:59:16,685
- This is it. He mentioned books. - It's related to photos.

1748
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,725
- Hello. - Hello.

1749
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,095
I think he's the one.

1750
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:20,225
- He is. - What was his name?

1751
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:21,565
- Dong Gyu. - Dong Gyu.

1752
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:23,025
- Hello. - Oh, there he is.

1753
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,366
- Hello. - Hello.

1754
00:59:24,536 --> 00:59:25,695
- This place looks unique. - Hello.

1755
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:26,766
- Hello. - Hello.

1756
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:28,135
(Kim Dong Gyu, the second Whenever Guest)

1757
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:30,266
It's beautiful.

1758
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:32,676
- As you said, - Hello.

1759
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:35,145
It's neither a coffee shop nor a bar.

1760
00:59:35,146 --> 00:59:36,775
- It's a photo lab. - That's correct.

1761
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:37,915
A photo lab cafe?

1762
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,756
- That's right. - It's a photo lab and a cafe.

1763
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:42,115
- Gosh. - I love this!

1764
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:44,285
Yes, you can look at photograph collections,

1765
00:59:44,286 --> 00:59:46,315
listen to music, get your photos developed,

1766
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,686
and drink coffee.

1767
00:59:47,886 --> 00:59:50,255
I can already tell that it's a place for hipsters.

1768
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:52,855
There are so many fun shops.

1769
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:54,025
(It's a very trendy photo lab.)

1770
00:59:54,026 --> 00:59:55,225
There's also a turntable.

1771
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:57,295
- It'd be so fun to bring friends... - Right?

1772
00:59:57,296 --> 00:59:59,035
Here at night.

1773
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:01,066
- It is fun. - It's the perfect place for that.

1774
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:02,706
This is...

1775
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,675
- obviously... - It's just as he said.

1776
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:07,205
There aren't many photo labs around nowadays.

1777
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:08,746
- That's true. - Right?

1778
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:11,915
Were you originally in the photography industry?

1779
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:13,945
- I majored in design, - Okay.

1780
01:00:13,946 --> 01:00:16,316
And I took photographs as a living.

1781
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:20,386
Then, I realized that I lacked the edge.

1782
01:00:20,756 --> 01:00:22,685
But I had been developing films as a hobby.

1783
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,355
So, I bought a machine on an online secondhand market.

1784
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:26,595
- A film developer, you mean? - Yes.

1785
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:29,426
And it naturally led to opening this shop.

1786
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,365
(His hobby turned into his profession.)

1787
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,265
Almost all photo labs...

1788
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:35,036
- had disappeared, - Right.

1789
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:40,075
But film cameras became trendy a few years ago,

1790
01:00:40,076 --> 01:00:42,446
and a few photo labs opened up here and there.

1791
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,176
You're right.

1792
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:46,245
How long has it been since you opened your shop?

1793
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:47,645
It's been seven years now.

1794
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:49,385
- That's a long time. - It's been so long!

1795
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:51,985
As you just said, when the photo labs closed down...

1796
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,355
- That's when you began? - Yes.

1797
01:00:53,356 --> 01:00:55,385
So, I was able to get my hands on old film developers...

1798
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:59,056
- that were left unattended. - I see!

1799
01:00:59,696 --> 01:01:03,025
I see some vinyl records too.

1800
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,365
I have a speaker at home which I don't use.

1801
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:08,935
If you need that, can you buy it from me?

1802
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:11,206
- Did you say, "Buy it?" - What are you doing?

1803
01:01:11,576 --> 01:01:14,005
- I mean... - Just post it online.

1804
01:01:14,006 --> 01:01:15,346
Are you selling it?

1805
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:17,675
I was cleaning my warehouse yesterday, and...

1806
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:19,646
He just said, "Are you selling it?"

1807
01:01:20,216 --> 01:01:21,745
- He'll need the price first. - Yes.

1808
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:23,786
We'll have to come to an agreement about the price.

1809
01:01:23,986 --> 01:01:25,115
- It's a must. - So, it's negotiable.

1810
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:26,415
- It's negotiable. - Okay.

1811
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,626
That's right.

1812
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:30,955
Film prices have soared these days, though.

1813
01:01:30,956 --> 01:01:32,656
Really? How much are they nowadays?

1814
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,925
Back in the day, you could buy practically anything...

1815
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:36,125
- for under ten dollars. - Right.

1816
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,696
- They're all higher than that now. - Right.

1817
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:41,205
- Yes. - It's kind of like fried chicken.

1818
01:01:41,206 --> 01:01:43,665
Once the price goes up, it won't go down.

1819
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,336
- Is it like fried chicken? - Yes.

1820
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:47,145
They say the flour price has gone down,

1821
01:01:47,146 --> 01:01:48,852
but they won't lower the price of fried chicken.

1822
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,445
- Also... - Sir,

1823
01:01:50,446 --> 01:01:52,727
I recently started advertising a fried chicken franchise.

1824
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,245
I eat a lot of fried chickens.

1825
01:01:54,246 --> 01:01:56,485
Do you? Good.

1826
01:01:56,486 --> 01:01:58,285
I heard the price of films...

1827
01:01:58,286 --> 01:02:00,285
that have been discontinued kept going up.

1828
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:01,286
- I see. - That's correct.

1829
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:02,525
You know this stuff well.

1830
01:02:02,526 --> 01:02:03,895
I also like photography.

1831
01:02:03,896 --> 01:02:05,755
I've even gone to your exhibition in the past.

1832
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:06,795
- Really? - Yes.

1833
01:02:06,796 --> 01:02:08,466
- You went to his exhibition? - Yes.

1834
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:10,395
- The one held by LEICA... - Yes, "RE: Creation."

1835
01:02:10,396 --> 01:02:11,995
That's the one! You even remember the title.

1836
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,566
What did you think of it? Did you swear in your head?

1837
01:02:15,706 --> 01:02:18,605
- It was for a good cause. - I know. I'm just asking.

1838
01:02:18,606 --> 01:02:20,276
- Before I went... - Yes?

1839
01:02:21,176 --> 01:02:22,945
Well, as we normally think, I assumed...

1840
01:02:22,946 --> 01:02:24,545
- he was only using his fame. - Right.

1841
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:26,945
- That can happen. - But when I saw the photos,

1842
01:02:26,946 --> 01:02:28,745
I realized that he actually had a passion for photography.

1843
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:29,785
- I do. - That's what I thought.

1844
01:02:29,786 --> 01:02:31,915
- I really loved it. - When Yeon Seok gets into a thing,

1845
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,156
- he goes deep. - Yes.

1846
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:37,495
But with the retro trend blowing back up,

1847
01:02:37,496 --> 01:02:41,395
there must be a lot of people visiting your shop now.

1848
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:44,165
Yes. People used to come only to develop photos,

1849
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:46,595
but we started selling coffee last year.

1850
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,165
- Oh, you didn't before that. - You didn't before?

1851
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,865
- No. - What did you do before, then?

1852
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,435
I was only developing photos for people.

1853
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:52,506
Just the development.

1854
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:54,422
That's what we've been talking about the whole time.

1855
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:55,575
Film development.

1856
01:02:55,576 --> 01:02:57,176
- He said he worked on photos. - But...

1857
01:02:57,216 --> 01:02:58,245
You were trying to be funny, right?

1858
01:02:58,246 --> 01:02:59,692
She has several things going on for her.

1859
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:00,716
She has to act...

1860
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:02,115
You were thinking about dumplings, weren't you?

1861
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:03,116
I almost ignored her just now.

1862
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:05,555
You were thinking about Oslo, weren't you?

1863
01:03:05,556 --> 01:03:07,756
(Northern Europe occurred to her for a second.)

1864
01:03:07,956 --> 01:03:09,485
What I say is...

1865
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:10,795
I mean, what I mean is...

1866
01:03:10,796 --> 01:03:12,755
- "What I say is?" - Here's what I mean.

1867
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:14,695
So, you were only developing photos...

1868
01:03:14,696 --> 01:03:15,965
without the coffee shop?

1869
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:17,235
That's correct.

1870
01:03:17,236 --> 01:03:18,565
At most photo labs,

1871
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,905
the customers hand over the films and leave.

1872
01:03:20,906 --> 01:03:22,505
They leave them to us and go,

1873
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:23,905
- and they come back later. - Right.

1874
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:25,205
- The next day, for example. - Yes.

1875
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:27,375
But they all just left after dropping their films...

1876
01:03:27,376 --> 01:03:29,745
when I put all this effort into decorating this place.

1877
01:03:29,746 --> 01:03:31,545
I wanted to find a way to take advantage of it,

1878
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,116
- Right. - and...

1879
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:34,915
Also, I recently got married.

1880
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,885
- Goodness. - Goodness. When was it?

1881
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:38,185
Last December.

1882
01:03:38,186 --> 01:03:39,715
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1883
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:41,525
- You're in the honeymoon phase. - Yes.

1884
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:45,355
I had to put food on the table, so I came up with this idea.

1885
01:03:45,356 --> 01:03:48,266
How did you take your wedding photos?

1886
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:51,535
Everything was decided by my wife.

1887
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,565
- Really? I see. - I see.

1888
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:56,265
Your wife must have had some requests.

1889
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,705
- Yes. - You did well. It's only natural.

1890
01:03:58,706 --> 01:04:02,405
Once I start giving feedback and interfering...

1891
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:03,445
No.

1892
01:04:03,446 --> 01:04:05,515
- I thought it'd lead to a fight. - You can't get anything done.

1893
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:07,815
Did you like your wedding photos?

1894
01:04:07,816 --> 01:04:09,316
Well...

1895
01:04:10,886 --> 01:04:13,255
(He's the type who can't lie.)

1896
01:04:13,256 --> 01:04:15,126
- But... - He's right, though.

1897
01:04:15,526 --> 01:04:16,725
- He can't exactly lie. - Whether...

1898
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:18,325
the husband likes it or not...

1899
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:19,855
- doesn't really matter. - You're right.

1900
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,965
- As long as the wife likes it. - Yes.

1901
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:23,596
As long as one of us is happy with it.

1902
01:04:23,896 --> 01:04:26,065
- Well, I liked it too. - Sure.

1903
01:04:26,066 --> 01:04:27,096
(Laughing)

1904
01:04:27,436 --> 01:04:30,065
How did you come to apply for our show?

1905
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,575
There are so many great shops...

1906
01:04:32,576 --> 01:04:34,345
- in the alleys of Seongbuk-dong. - Yes.

1907
01:04:34,346 --> 01:04:36,176
- You're right. - It's very distinctive.

1908
01:04:36,776 --> 01:04:39,045
I was hoping that I could bring more people...

1909
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:40,475
to this area...

1910
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,945
by talking about it...

1911
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:43,185
- on TV. - Exactly.

1912
01:04:43,186 --> 01:04:45,255
- That's what I'm hoping. - So, you can buy the speaker...

1913
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,526
- and play music with it. - Jin Kyeong.

1914
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:50,055
If the store is shiny at night, people will come.

1915
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:51,925
- Young people will come. - But that's a different vibe.

1916
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:53,525
- But won't it be great? If we... - I think it would be great.

1917
01:04:53,526 --> 01:04:54,965
- If we come to a place like this... - Seriously.

1918
01:04:54,966 --> 01:04:56,765
- Goodness. He is... - I mean...

1919
01:04:56,766 --> 01:04:59,195
- Jin Kyeong. - It's like you're teasing her...

1920
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,996
- while sitting next to her. - The speaker...

1921
01:05:01,836 --> 01:05:03,435
Seriously. He's irritating her in real-time.

1922
01:05:03,436 --> 01:05:04,675
- Well... - Think about it.

1923
01:05:04,676 --> 01:05:06,276
- I'll come no matter what. - All right.

1924
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:09,845
By the way, do you have any speakers or cameras...

1925
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:12,175
that are special or unique?

1926
01:05:12,176 --> 01:05:13,575
- Cameras? - Cameras.

1927
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,986
The best camera I have here is...

1928
01:05:17,686 --> 01:05:18,915
- There's a Rollei. - What?

1929
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,285
- Hasselblad. You know it, right? - Hasselblad?

1930
01:05:20,286 --> 01:05:21,555
- Yes. I have one too. - Right.

1931
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:23,856
- I have one with a digital body. - I see.

1932
01:05:24,826 --> 01:05:26,632
- It's really a precious one. - And this is the film.

1933
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:27,725
- It's... - Is it different...

1934
01:05:27,726 --> 01:05:28,942
if you take a picture with a camera like this?

1935
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,626
(Pure curiosity)

1936
01:05:31,496 --> 01:05:32,536
How is it?

1937
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,105
The film itself is quite big.

1938
01:05:35,106 --> 01:05:36,106
If you see here...

1939
01:05:36,107 --> 01:05:37,505
- You look down from above. - You look from above.

1940
01:05:37,506 --> 01:05:39,036
It has a unique vibe.

1941
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,806
- See it for yourself. - The image is reversed.

1942
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,376
If you've become farsighted because of your age...

1943
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:47,786
Oh, me too. I'm farsighted too.

1944
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,916
So there's a magnifying glass here.

1945
01:05:51,116 --> 01:05:52,585
- My goodness. - I'm serious.

1946
01:05:52,586 --> 01:05:55,285
- I'll leave work early today. - My goodness.

1947
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:57,526
- Let me go. I'm serious. - Let's not...

1948
01:05:57,756 --> 01:05:58,756
say it out directly.
- Let's call it slow focusing. - I mean...

1949
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:01,265
- Yes. Slow focusing. - Slow focusing.

1950
01:06:01,266 --> 01:06:02,326
- Seriously. - I mean...

1951
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,866
- I've been holding back enough. - This is what she did.

1952
01:06:04,896 --> 01:06:06,865
- This is how she did it. - My goodness.

1953
01:06:06,866 --> 01:06:08,805
- That's what it was. - Now, even the guests...

1954
01:06:08,806 --> 01:06:09,966
are teasing me.

1955
01:06:10,606 --> 01:06:12,375
- Seriously. - Everyone is teasing you.

1956
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:13,735
- My goodness. - Everyone is teasing her?

1957
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:16,375
I tried to understand when my peers teased me, but...

1958
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:17,536
(She has enemies everywhere.)

1959
01:06:17,976 --> 01:06:19,575
Jin Kyeong. I can see you well here.

1960
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:20,816
(Calm down and look over here.)

1961
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:23,315
Also, the sound of the shutter is...

1962
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,785
- a little different. - Where should I press?

1963
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:26,155
- If you press this... - Do I press this one?

1964
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:28,156
- No. This one here. - I see. This one here.

1965
01:06:31,226 --> 01:06:33,395
(Click)

1966
01:06:33,396 --> 01:06:35,765
I took a picture of you. You should come to get it later.

1967
01:06:35,766 --> 01:06:37,095
- Do you have a film? - Yes, it's in it.

1968
01:06:37,096 --> 01:06:39,235
- It was in there already? - When I develop the picture...

1969
01:06:39,236 --> 01:06:40,236
- Please give her the picture. - But...

1970
01:06:40,237 --> 01:06:41,405
- I glared at the camera though. - But...

1971
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:42,965
the exposure wasn't set right,

1972
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:44,535
- so there won't be anything. - No. I got it right.

1973
01:06:44,536 --> 01:06:47,005
I focused on Jin Kyeong's nose and took the picture.

1974
01:06:47,006 --> 01:06:48,275
No, this is...

1975
01:06:48,276 --> 01:06:50,205
Jae Suk, with this setting, the picture will be all black.

1976
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,215
- Really? - Is that so?

1977
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,175
It's 20, which means it's almost closed.

1978
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,385
What should I do then?

1979
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,045
I really want to take a picture for Jin Kyeong.

1980
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:57,286
She looks so cool today.

1981
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:59,215
You must stay still when you take the picture.

1982
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,456
Of course, I'll stay still.

1983
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:02,186
(He takes the photo again.)

1984
01:07:02,187 --> 01:07:03,532
That was good. I got a nice picture.

1985
01:07:03,556 --> 01:07:05,195
- Please give her the picture later. - Okay.

1986
01:07:05,196 --> 01:07:07,876
- It's not easy to do it well. - Why are you taking pictures of me?

1987
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:10,595
- Don't you have Polaroids too? - Yes. I have them.

1988
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:11,635
With Polaroids,

1989
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:12,995
- we can get the photos right away. - I got a nice photo.

1990
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:16,035
We took one with this, and it'd be fun to pick it up later.

1991
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,135
I think the one you just took...

1992
01:07:17,136 --> 01:07:18,875
- would be nice. - You think so?

1993
01:07:18,876 --> 01:07:19,876
I'll look forward to it.

1994
01:07:19,877 --> 01:07:22,145
First of all, we have a good energy today.

1995
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:23,806
We succeeded in Round Three earlier.

1996
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,546
So we are...

1997
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:29,985
He suddenly looks so happy.

1998
01:07:29,986 --> 01:07:31,855
- But... - We have a good energy today.

1999
01:07:31,856 --> 01:07:33,255

There you go. It's okay to fall.

2002
01:07:36,826 --> 01:07:37,855
- One. - One.

2003
01:07:37,856 --> 01:07:39,255
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - We got one.

2004
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:41,165
- That's good enough. - Yes. We got one.

2005

Break the first fortune cookie.

2006
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:44,566
- Yes. - It's in it.

2007
01:07:44,836 --> 01:07:45,836
What is it?

2008
01:07:47,236 --> 01:07:50,335

01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:56,676
(A perfect item to use on his way to work by bicycle)

2014
01:07:56,677 --> 01:07:58,252
- Shall we take a look? - These days, it's...

2015
01:07:58,276 --> 01:07:59,315
Gosh, that's a rare item.

2016
01:07:59,316 --> 01:08:01,115
So it looks like this.

2017
01:08:01,116 --> 01:08:02,915
He looks so happy right now.

2018
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,836
- It's an expensive one. - You should try it on.

2019
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:07,056
We don't know if it's going to be yours, but...

2020
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:12,796
- Hold on. - It looks perfect.

2021
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,056
My goodness.

2022
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:16,795
- He kind of looks like... - A singer?

2023
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:18,636
Shim Sin.

2024
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:22,235
- My mother-in-law is a fan of his, - Yes? I see.

2025
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:24,305
So she told me that many times.

2026
01:08:24,306 --> 01:08:26,535
He really resembles Shim Sin.

2027
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:28,445
- He really resembles him. - I could see the resemblance.

Why would you bring this?

2033
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,437
- We failed last week because of it. - We're bad at this.

2034
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:41,825
We need to guess...

2035
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,702
- according to the syllables too. - It's better than food.

2036
01:08:43,726 --> 01:08:45,502
- This one is for food. - Are you good at this?

2037
01:08:45,526 --> 01:08:47,256
- I'm good at it. - Is that so?

2038

I've been on "Beat Coin" for a while.

2039
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:50,826
Oh, right.

2040
01:08:51,136 --> 01:08:54,606
But this is the part that I'm not confident in.

2041
01:08:55,136 --> 01:08:56,966

01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,502
This was difficult at first sight.

2056
01:09:21,526 --> 01:09:23,566
Show them the picture.

2057
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,195
- In 1, 2, 3. - Mosquito coil.

2058
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:27,435
- Correct. - That was good.

2059
01:09:27,436 --> 01:09:29,266
- Now show them... - I like that.

2060
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,676
The picture. In 1, 2, 3.

2061
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:32,906
- Spray. No. - Wrong.

2062
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,975
Humidifier? Isn't it a humidifier?

2063
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,736
- This is a spray, Jin Kyeong. - Jin Kyeong.

2064
01:09:36,846 --> 01:09:37,846
- A spray? - Jin Kyeong.
Jin Kyeong. This is a spray.

2065
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:39,846
Jin Kyeong. My goodness.

2066
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,207
Anyone can tell it's a humidifier.

2067
01:09:42,016 --> 01:09:43,085
- Jin Kyeong. You said... - Gosh, this is crazy.

2068
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:45,392
- you've done it a lot on your show. - Let me switch my seat.

2069
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,985
- Let me switch my seat. - Do you want to go last?

2070
01:09:46,986 --> 01:09:48,855
- I'll change my seat. - Okay. You can be the last.

2071
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:50,425
- I guess you don't click with him. - Right. We don't get along well.

2072
01:09:50,426 --> 01:09:52,195
But you know, you get confused in a moment...

2073
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:53,595
because you think about the number of syllables, and...

2074
01:09:53,596 --> 01:09:55,125
By the way, I didn't know the facial mask.

2075
01:09:55,126 --> 01:09:56,965
- Right? - I thought it was a regular mask.

2076
01:09:56,966 --> 01:09:59,135
- I thought of the hahoetal first. - Right.

2077
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:01,005
- You're right. - Seriously. I thought that first.

2078
01:10:01,006 --> 01:10:03,042
- I thought of a mask too. - I would've said hahoetal.

2079
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,505
- That's how it goes when we play. - I didn't know it either.

2080
01:10:04,506 --> 01:10:06,546
- But Jin Kyeong, a spray is... - But a spray is...

2081
01:10:07,176 --> 01:10:08,376
A spray is used to spray.

2082
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:11,075
(I'm good at it. I've been on "Beat Coin" for a while.)

2083
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:12,745
(She failed even though she had experience.)

2084
01:10:12,746 --> 01:10:14,145
Dong Gyu. Let's cheer up.

2085
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:15,646
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2086
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:17,116
It's the second try.

2087
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,256
Show them the picture.

2088
01:10:20,116 --> 01:10:22,125
- In 1, 2, 3. Correct. - A monkey wrench.

2089
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:23,656
- What's that? - A monkey wrench.

2090
01:10:23,826 --> 01:10:25,225
(Gosh, I would've been in trouble.)

2091
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:27,332
- Gosh, I would've been in trouble. - Show them the picture.

2092
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,695
- In 1, 2, 3. - A compass.

2093
01:10:28,696 --> 01:10:29,896
- Correct. - Good.

2094
01:10:30,366 --> 01:10:31,996
Show them the picture.

2095
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:34,165
- In 1, 2, 3. - Slime.

2096
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:35,686
- Correct. - Gosh. That was difficult.

2097
01:10:36,436 --> 01:10:38,605
- I recently found out about this. - The fourth picture.

2098
01:10:38,606 --> 01:10:39,836
I was going to say chews.

2099
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,445
- That was difficult. - That was hard.

2100
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,845
We would've been in trouble if he had said it was chews.

2101
01:10:42,846 --> 01:10:44,515
- Monkey wrench was hard too. - Slime was difficult.

2102
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:47,075
- Jin Kyeong, sit down. - Let me do this standing up.

2103
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,236
- Jin Kyeong, sit down. - I'll stand up and answer it.

2104
01:10:49,386 --> 01:10:51,486
- What difference does it make? - Show them...

2105
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:56,256
(They succeed in Round 1 if Jin Kyeong gets it right.)

2106
01:10:57,026 --> 01:10:58,026
the picture.

2107
01:10:59,056 --> 01:11:00,125
- In 1, 2, 3. - A spray.

2108
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:01,226
- Goodness. - My gosh.

2109
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:02,996
- Goodness. - My gosh.

2110
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,066
(They succeed in Round 1.)

2111
01:11:07,436 --> 01:11:10,105
- They had a spray. - My goodness.

2112
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:12,076
- You got it right in advance. - My gosh.

2113
01:11:13,276 --> 01:11:14,545
- She said it in advance. - Goodness.

2114
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:15,705
You have a hunch.

2115
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:18,116
I almost said it was a humidifier.

2116
01:11:18,216 --> 01:11:20,015
- Because you teased me. - Goodness.

2117
01:11:20,016 --> 01:11:21,985
- Jin Kyeong. Please sit down. - Gosh, what a relief.

2118
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,046
- My neck hurts. - What a relief.

2119
01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:26,586
She got it wrong before, but it came back.

2120
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:28,955
- We could've been in trouble. - All right.

2121
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:30,426
We succeeded in Round One.

2122
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:32,825
We succeeded in Round One smoothly.

2123
01:11:32,826 --> 01:11:34,565
- Today, it's... - All right.

2124
01:11:34,566 --> 01:11:37,096
Okay. The second round.

2125
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,295
Will the owner...

2126
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:41,035
continue or stop here?

2127
01:11:41,036 --> 01:11:42,705
- In 1, 2, 3. - I choose to continue.

2128
01:11:42,706 --> 01:11:43,865
- Of course. - We should do it.

2129
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,506
- We must go for it. - Of course.

2130
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:47,636
I'll go even if I could lose everything.

2131
01:11:48,206 --> 01:11:50,145
- Why would you say that? - We got the sunglasses.

2132
01:11:50,146 --> 01:11:51,415
- Round 2. - It's Round 2.

2133
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,936
The son-in-law who resembles Shim Sin.

2134
01:11:54,146 --> 01:11:56,585
"You've been collecting your cameras since you were in your 20s."

2135
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:58,415
"We can't let any dust on them."

2136
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:00,086
"A Dyson air purifier."

2137
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,256
- That's so nice. - It's a good one.

2138
01:12:02,426 --> 01:12:04,496
- It's an expensive one. - We must get this.

2139
01:12:05,096 --> 01:12:06,956
- We must get this. - We must get this.

2140
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:08,196
He looks so happy again.

2141
01:12:08,426 --> 01:12:09,965
- We must get this. - He smiling so brightly.

2142
01:12:09,966 --> 01:12:11,266
We have to win this.

2143
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:12,565
(Round 2:)

2144
01:12:12,566 --> 01:12:13,935
(It's the same as Round 1.)

2145
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:16,436
(But like a film, the colors are reversed.)

2146
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:18,875
The colors are reversed like a negative film?

2147
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,005
(The colors are reversed like a real film.)

2148
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:22,106
- I'd be hard to recognize then. - I know.

2149
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:23,866
I don't know what will happen now.

2150
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,845
We're going one way, right?

2151
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:28,546
- Yes, just one way. - Then let's start from Jin Kyeong.

2152
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:31,485
- What if she gets it wrong? - No. That's not it.

2153
01:12:31,486 --> 01:12:33,155
- Shall we go in this direction? - Let's do it this way.

2154
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:34,156
Are you okay, Jin Kyeong?

2155
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,132
- You can do it. - She'll get it right.

2156
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:37,996
- Shall we go now? - Okay. All right.

2157
01:12:38,456 --> 01:12:40,855
- It's Round 2. In 1, 2, 3. - Okay.

2158
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:41,936
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2159
01:12:42,266 --> 01:12:44,426
Show them the picture.

2160
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:46,316
- In 1, 2, 3. Correct. - A globe.

2161
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:48,066
- Okay. - Good.

2162
01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:51,275
(We have a chance.)

2163
01:12:51,276 --> 01:12:52,956
- This is doable. - Show them the picture.

2164
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:54,645
- In 1, 2, 3. Wrong. - What is that?

2165
01:12:54,646 --> 01:12:55,945
- That's not fair. - What on earth is that?

2166
01:12:55,946 --> 01:12:56,946
- What's that? - What's that?
- A puzzle piece? - It's dental floss.

2167
01:12:57,947 --> 01:12:59,015
- We should be able to see it. - What?

2168
01:12:59,016 --> 01:13:00,045
- Gosh. Hold on. - What?

2169
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:01,585
- Wait. That is so... - Time out.

2170
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,286
- That looks like... - Gosh, that is so...

2171
01:13:04,316 --> 01:13:05,685
- That is... - It looks like...

2172
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:07,332
- that thing at night. - How can we get this right?

2173
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:09,455
- Gosh, this is... - How can this be dental floss?

2174
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:10,456
- How can this... - That is not...

2175
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,497
- It looks like a monkey wrench. - That's so wrong.

2176
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:14,155
It's the thing that the two of you use often.

2177
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,665
It looks like a staircase.

2178
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:17,665
- This is dental floss? - How can we get this right?

2179
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:19,235
I thought it was a puzzle piece.

2180
01:13:19,236 --> 01:13:20,436
This one was really difficult.

2181
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,905
It's the dental floss that Cho Sae Ho advertises.

2182
01:13:22,906 --> 01:13:25,205
- I mean, this is a wire saw. - It's a wire saw.

2183
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:27,236
- It's a wire saw. - This is so...

2184
01:13:28,106 --> 01:13:29,606
- Jin Kyeong. - Yes?

2185
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,676
- You're not complaining with them. - No.

2186
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:33,545
- Because you got it right? - Yes.

2187
01:13:33,546 --> 01:13:35,522
- Because you got yours right? - I got mine right.

2188
01:13:35,546 --> 01:13:36,985
- It's not... - You don't want to join them?

2189
01:13:36,986 --> 01:13:38,056
It's not my business.

2190
01:13:40,256 --> 01:13:41,325
She's right, though.

2191
01:13:41,326 --> 01:13:43,685
- But this was too much. - So this is what it'll be like.

2192
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:44,756
All right.

2193
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:46,396
- It was difficult. - Okay.

2194
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:49,765
By the way, the owner is...

2195
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:53,195
Our guests have common characteristics.

2196
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:55,865
Some guests say it's okay even if they don't win the prize.

2197
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:58,206
But it seems like you really want to win the prize.

2198
01:13:58,276 --> 01:14:00,206
- I'm desperate. - I can see that.

2199
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:02,652
All right. The owner who resembles Shim Sin.

2200
01:14:02,676 --> 01:14:04,445
- The 4th try. In 1, 2, 3. - Let's go.

2201
01:14:04,446 --> 01:14:05,515
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2202
01:14:05,516 --> 01:14:06,546
Show them...

2203
01:14:07,346 --> 01:14:08,386
the picture.

2204
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:09,885
- In 1, 2, 3. - Dumbbells.

2205
01:14:09,886 --> 01:14:11,415
- Right. - Correct.

2206
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:13,316
Show them the picture.

2207
01:14:13,556 --> 01:14:15,185
- In 1, 2, 3. - A tambourine.

2208
01:14:15,186 --> 01:14:16,286
That's right.

2209
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:17,656
Good job.

2210
01:14:18,156 --> 01:14:20,726
Show them the picture.

2211
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,295
- In 1, 2, 3. Okay. - A blender.

2212
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:23,795
Goodness. Hold on.

2213
01:14:23,796 --> 01:14:25,796
- All right. - Hold on. Let me get close.

2214
01:14:26,096 --> 01:14:27,096
Good.

2215
01:14:27,097 --> 01:14:28,206
Show them...

2216
01:14:29,406 --> 01:14:32,376
(If Yeon Seok gets it right, they succeed in Round 2.)

2217
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:37,806
The picture.

2218
01:14:38,276 --> 01:14:39,816
- In 1, 2, 3. - A harmonica.

2219
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:41,115
Correct.

2220
01:14:41,116 --> 01:14:42,186
I got it right?

2221
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:45,555
(They succeeded in Round 2 as well.)

2222
01:14:45,556 --> 01:14:47,015
- Gosh, this is... - My goodness.

2223
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,926
- Are we going for Round Three now? - Hold on.

2224
01:14:49,826 --> 01:14:51,126
That was tough. Gosh.

2225
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:53,655
- I was like, "What is that?" - My goodness.

2226
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:54,766
It was confusing.

2227
01:14:54,896 --> 01:14:56,196
All right.

2228
01:14:56,426 --> 01:14:58,295
We won the air purifier too.

2229
01:14:58,296 --> 01:15:00,265
(They won the sunglasses and the air purifier.)

2230
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:01,836
Hold on a minute.

2231
01:15:02,936 --> 01:15:05,105
How many tries do we have left, including the bonus coupon?

2232
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:06,805
We have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2233
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:08,252
- We have 7 tries left. - You've got 7 tries left.

2234
01:15:08,276 --> 01:15:09,405
- We got this. - All right.

2235
01:15:09,406 --> 01:15:11,545
- Would you like to go or stop? - Round Three.

2236
01:15:11,546 --> 01:15:13,176
Do you want to continue to Round Three?

2237
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:14,346
I'll go for it.

2238
01:15:16,146 --> 01:15:18,415
- Hold on. - He'll go for it even if we lose.

2239
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:20,136
You've put a lot of thought into it, right?

2240
01:15:20,186 --> 01:15:21,756
We're saying this because...

2241
01:15:21,956 --> 01:15:23,225
it gets even more difficult in Round Three.

2242
01:15:23,226 --> 01:15:25,155
You seem to have confidence in us.

2243
01:15:25,156 --> 01:15:26,726
We're doing better than expected today.

2244
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,426
- What will it be? - I'm sure he will love it.

2245
01:15:29,766 --> 01:15:31,536
I think all the employees would...

2246
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:34,866
His jaw dropped just now.

2247
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:36,305
What is it?

2248
01:15:36,306 --> 01:15:38,075
"Interior design is your nth hobby."

2249
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:40,606
"We would like to decorate a cozy place for customers."

2250
01:15:42,046 --> 01:15:43,775
"A Louis Poulsen floor lamp."

2251
01:15:43,776 --> 01:15:44,896
- Goodness. - Louis Poulsen?

2252
01:15:45,076 --> 01:15:46,996
- It's an expensive one. - That's a luxury lamp.

2253
01:15:47,546 --> 01:15:49,746
- Is that a luxury lamp? - My goodness.

2254
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:51,886
They were all surprised to see this.

2255
01:15:53,686 --> 01:15:55,726
- It'll look so great in here. - I know.

2256
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:58,056
He would be so upset if we blew it all.

2257
01:15:58,296 --> 01:15:59,595
- Why would you say that? - What?

2258
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,996
- Well, I'm just saying. - What?

2259
01:16:01,326 --> 01:16:03,225
(To win a floor lamp that's worth 1,500 dollars)

2260
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:06,236
(Round Three: Make a Round Trip)

2261
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,876
- We have to go both ways? - Then we need to get seven right.

2262
01:16:10,006 --> 01:16:13,175
- Will you switch places with me? - Right. Jin Kyeong, come over here.

2263
01:16:13,176 --> 01:16:14,705
You only need to get one right since we're making a turn here.

2264
01:16:14,706 --> 01:16:16,845
- That's right. - That would be great.

2265
01:16:16,846 --> 01:16:17,945
- Yeon Seok is really... - Great.

2266
01:16:17,946 --> 01:16:19,075
Are you saying...

2267
01:16:19,076 --> 01:16:20,476
- you can't trust Jin Kyeong? - No.

2268
01:16:21,516 --> 01:16:24,086
- I wanted to relieve her pressure. - Jin Kyeong.

2269
01:16:24,316 --> 01:16:26,332
- I want you to feel less pressured. - To relieve the load.

2270
01:16:26,356 --> 01:16:27,955
- Okay. Round Three. - Right.

2271
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:30,285
- It's our fifth try. - Please.

2272
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:31,595
- We'll start right away. - Okay.

2273
01:16:31,596 --> 01:16:32,955
We can do this. In 1, 2, 3.

2274
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,025
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2275
01:16:34,026 --> 01:16:35,166
Okay. Here we go.

2276
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:36,466
Hold on.

2277
01:16:36,796 --> 01:16:38,636
- Show them... - We can do this.

2278
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:40,436
The picture.

2279
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:44,005
(What is...)

2280
01:16:44,006 --> 01:16:45,175
(that?)

2281
01:16:45,176 --> 01:16:46,435
In 1, 2, 3.

2282
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:47,476
Chainmail scrubbing pad.

2283
01:16:48,006 --> 01:16:49,306
Gosh. That was tough.

2284
01:16:49,746 --> 01:16:51,076
Gosh. That was tough.

2285
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:52,915
- I couldn't tell. - This one was really tough.

2286
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:54,175
- Chainmail scrubbing pad. - I thought of a scrubbing pad,

2287
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,445
but it was a chainmail scrubbing pad.

2288
01:16:55,446 --> 01:16:56,485
- He's amazing. - Okay.

2289
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,786
Show them the picture.

2290
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:01,686
- In 1, 2, 3. - A ping-pong table.

2291
01:17:02,186 --> 01:17:03,286
Good job.

2292
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:05,455
You did well. I didn't know what it was.

2293
01:17:05,456 --> 01:17:06,696
This one was tough.

2294
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:08,066
Okay. Show them...

2295
01:17:08,326 --> 01:17:10,026
Show them the picture.

2296
01:17:10,566 --> 01:17:12,235
- In 1, 2, 3. - Nunchucks.

2297
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:14,435
(Nunchucks)

2298
01:17:14,436 --> 01:17:16,206
- We got this. - Show them...

2299
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,305
Please.

2300
01:17:18,306 --> 01:17:20,306
(It's time to make a U-turn.)

2301
01:17:20,706 --> 01:17:21,746
Please.

2302
01:17:23,006 --> 01:17:24,075
- The picture. - Please.

2303
01:17:24,076 --> 01:17:25,245
In 1, 2, 3.

2304
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:27,616
- You failed. - That's a briquette.

2305
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:28,785
(Casting a spell)

2306
01:17:28,786 --> 01:17:30,286
That's a briquette.

2307
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,385
(Briquette)

2308
01:17:34,386 --> 01:17:35,925
- It's a briquette, Jin Kyeong. - Is that a briquette?

2309
01:17:35,926 --> 01:17:37,186
Jin Kyeong, it's a briquette.

2310
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:38,695
That was so...

2311
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:41,096
I thought it was a lump of concrete.

2312
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:42,795
It was a briquette.

2313
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:44,265
- I'm sorry. - The colors are reversed, so...

2314
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:45,635
- I'm sorry, Dong Gyu. - Goodness.

2315
01:17:45,636 --> 01:17:47,835
The black area appears white because it's a negative image.

2316
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:48,865
From the first question...

2317
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:50,166
Dong Gyu, are you okay?

2318
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:51,635
I'm okay.

2319
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:52,836
What is that?

2320
01:17:53,106 --> 01:17:54,535
- Then... - Gosh, what do we do?

2321
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:56,382
- Should we use our coupon now? - Let's use it now.

2322
01:17:56,406 --> 01:17:58,615
- Then, Dong Gyu. - Yes?

2323
01:17:58,616 --> 01:18:00,616
Pick someone who'll be off the team.

2324
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:02,085
And stare at the person.

2325
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:03,386
Gosh. Look at him.

2326
01:18:03,716 --> 01:18:06,016
(His eyes are fixed on someone.)

2327
01:18:06,686 --> 01:18:08,055
(Staring)

2328
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:09,426
He keeps staring at her.

2329
01:18:09,526 --> 01:18:10,586
Me?

2330
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,656
(Coupon)

2331
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,696
The briquette was really...

2332
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:18,096
My goodness.

2333
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:21,466
You come here and try it yourself. This is...

2334
01:18:21,806 --> 01:18:23,105
- Should I try? - Go ahead.

2335
01:18:23,106 --> 01:18:24,335
- Gosh, Jin Kyeong. - It's no joke.

2336
01:18:24,336 --> 01:18:26,536
It was so funny when she said, "Me?"

2337
01:18:26,806 --> 01:18:29,145
(Jin Kyeong and Dong Gyu switched places.)

2338
01:18:29,146 --> 01:18:30,375
He must be really good at this.

2339
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:33,176
- He has seen negative images a lot. - Right.

2340
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:36,686
- He has seen more than anyone here. - Right.

2341
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:39,416
Show them the picture.

2342
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,455
- Violin. No, cello. - You failed.

2343
01:18:41,456 --> 01:18:42,456
(Violin?)

2344
01:18:42,457 --> 01:18:44,286
- It has 2 syllables. - It has 2 syllables.

2345
01:18:45,556 --> 01:18:48,965
Gosh, it had two blanks. Why did you say violin?

2346
01:18:48,966 --> 01:18:49,966
(He said the answer without even looking at the number of syllables.)

2347
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:51,166
Dong Gyu.

2348
01:18:51,866 --> 01:18:54,296
I can't believe he blamed me.

2349
01:18:55,536 --> 01:18:56,766
Seriously.

2350
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:00,906
You should've checked the number of blanks, at least.

2351
01:19:01,306 --> 01:19:04,506
After he said violin, he was about to say guitar.

2352
01:19:06,016 --> 01:19:08,015
(Chuckling)

2353
01:19:08,016 --> 01:19:11,556
- My goodness. - It feels different from here.

2354
01:19:11,716 --> 01:19:13,716
- I got nervous. - But it was a two-syllable word.

2355
01:19:14,456 --> 01:19:16,055
- It had two syllables. - I was in a hurry.

2356
01:19:16,056 --> 01:19:17,756
My gosh.

2357
01:19:18,356 --> 01:19:20,355
- This is... - Now...

2358
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:22,525
- Dong Gyu. - Can we change the order?

2359
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:23,726
- No, it's over. - It's over.

2360
01:19:23,896 --> 01:19:25,736
- The chance is over. - Is it over?

2361
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:27,065
My goodness.

2362
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:29,165
- Gosh, I'm disappointed. - It's over, Dong Gyu.

2363
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:30,435
- This is bad. - The thing is,

2364
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:32,835
we've done this show for a long time.

2365
01:19:32,836 --> 01:19:36,645
But our guests and we never blamed each other...

2366
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:39,216
- like this before. - Right.

2367
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:40,445
(We haven't seen a relationship like this before.)

2368
01:19:40,446 --> 01:19:44,146
Seriously. Why did he say violin when there were two blanks?

2369
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,086
No matter how flustered he was.

2370
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:49,455
After you blamed her so much for the briquette.

2371
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:51,255
With the prize in my mind,

2372
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:53,095
- it wasn't easy. - Right, he was in a hurry.

2373
01:19:53,096 --> 01:19:54,655
- He couldn't check the syllables. - That's right.

2374
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:55,795
That happens.

2375
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:57,896
(That happens sometimes.)

2376
01:19:58,096 --> 01:20:00,636
- Is this our seventh try? - Yes.

2377
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,505
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Here we go!

2378
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,566
Here we go.

2379
01:20:03,736 --> 01:20:04,866
Okay. Get ready.

2380
01:20:06,336 --> 01:20:08,175
- Take it easy. - Show them...

2381
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:09,176
Okay.

2382
01:20:09,406 --> 01:20:10,505
The picture.

2383
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,115
- In 1, 2, 3. - Clothespin.

2384
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:13,515
- That's right. - Correct.

2385
01:20:13,516 --> 01:20:14,576
- Take it easy. - Okay.

2386
01:20:14,646 --> 01:20:16,145
It's no big deal.

2387
01:20:16,146 --> 01:20:17,485
- Here's the picture. - Okay.

2388
01:20:17,486 --> 01:20:19,155
- In 1, 2, 3. - Cast iron pot.

2389
01:20:19,156 --> 01:20:20,396
- That's right. - There you go.

2390
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,525
- I was about to say caldron lid. - Gosh.

2391
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,125
- I thought of the caldron lid too. - It came to mind.

2392
01:20:24,126 --> 01:20:26,355
- I thought of the caldron lid too. - I would have said caldron lid too.

2393
01:20:26,356 --> 01:20:27,755
- You were amazing, Jin Kyeong. - It looked like a caldron lid.

2394
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:29,496
- I did well, indeed. - Right.

2395
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:30,795
- You did a great job. - I know.

2396
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:32,766
- You did great. - Show them...

2397
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,166
You can do it.

2398
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:35,806
Show them the picture.

2399
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,466
- In 1, 2... Correct. - Janggu.

2400
01:20:37,906 --> 01:20:39,075
- No pressure. - All right.

2401
01:20:39,076 --> 01:20:40,235
- Just answer it easily. - Okay.

2402
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:41,946
- We got this. - All right. Show them...

2403
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:43,945
the picture.

2404
01:20:43,946 --> 01:20:45,615
- In 1, 2, 3. - What is that?

2405
01:20:45,616 --> 01:20:46,645
You failed!

2406
01:20:46,646 --> 01:20:47,875
- Castanets. - Right.

2407
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,156
- That was so hard. - Castanets.

2408
01:20:49,246 --> 01:20:51,315
- That was really... - There are hands.

2409
01:20:51,316 --> 01:20:52,596
There were hands in the picture.

2410
01:20:52,656 --> 01:20:54,015
- They were castanets. - My goodness.

2411
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,085
Gosh. It was so...

2412
01:20:55,086 --> 01:20:57,286
- I couldn't see the hands. - That was...

2413
01:20:58,696 --> 01:21:00,296
- Did you know the answer? - That was...

2414
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:02,496
- Of course. - Goodness.

2415
01:21:03,396 --> 01:21:05,235
- Don't lie. - Gosh.

2416
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:07,236
- Gosh, Dong Gyu. - I knew it the minute I saw it.

2417
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:10,006
- You have to be honest with us. - How could you say that?

2418
01:21:12,176 --> 01:21:13,435
You really got that right?

2419
01:21:13,436 --> 01:21:15,476
I knew the answer as soon as I saw it.

2420
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,176
- Really? - The cello and violin were tricky.

2421
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,646
My goodness.

2422
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:24,516
Everyone here keeps talking about themselves.

2423
01:21:24,816 --> 01:21:26,455
Jin Kyeong, you are...

2424
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:29,085
- I'm sorry he missed it, though. - Right.

2425
01:21:29,086 --> 01:21:30,885
- If he got it right... - That was really...

2426
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,595
- Please. - We have two more tries left.

2427
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,525
It's our ninth try. We can do this!

2428
01:21:34,526 --> 01:21:35,926
- We can do this! - We can do this!

2429
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,495
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2430
01:21:37,496 --> 01:21:39,265
- The ninth try. - Okay.

2431
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:40,466
Get ready.

2432
01:21:40,866 --> 01:21:42,806
Here's the picture, Dong Hwi.

2433
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:44,805
- In 1, 2, 3. - Flippers.

2434
01:21:44,806 --> 01:21:45,886
- There you go. - Flippers.

2435
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,706
Show them the picture.

2436
01:21:49,206 --> 01:21:50,375
- In 1, 2, 3. - Sandglass.

2437
01:21:50,376 --> 01:21:51,416
- Correct. - That's right.

2438
01:21:51,876 --> 01:21:53,636
- Show them the picture. - That was amazing.

2439
01:21:54,016 --> 01:21:55,645
- In 1, 2, 3. - Stethoscope.

2440
01:21:55,646 --> 01:21:56,785
- There you go. - Correct.

2441
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:57,916
That was a tough one.

2442
01:21:58,216 --> 01:22:00,455
Jin Kyeong got the stethoscope right.

2443
01:22:00,456 --> 01:22:02,856
Show them the picture.

2444
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:04,286
In 1, 2, 3.

2445
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,626
In 1, 2, 3. You failed!

2446
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:10,926
- It's a gat. - It's a gat.

2447
01:22:11,096 --> 01:22:12,766
- You failed! - It's a gat.

2448
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,296
- Oh, my gat. - It's a gat.

2449
01:22:14,836 --> 01:22:15,905
My gosh.

2450
01:22:15,906 --> 01:22:17,636
- Jae Suk. - It's a gat.

2451
01:22:18,636 --> 01:22:20,235
- It was so obvious. - What's wrong with him?

2452
01:22:20,236 --> 01:22:22,005
I thought they were earphones.

2453
01:22:22,006 --> 01:22:23,705
- Earphones? - How could it be earphones?

2454
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:25,746
It was my first time yelling at you.

2455
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,075
- I yelled at Jae Suk... - I can't believe this.

2456
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,022
- for the first time in my life. - Dong Hwi yelled, "It's a gat!"

2457
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:32,885
For the distribution... I mean, for the U-turn...

2458
01:22:32,886 --> 01:22:34,606
- Did you say distribution? - Distribution?

2459
01:22:34,856 --> 01:22:36,585
- My goodness. - The U-turn is really hard here.

2460
01:22:36,586 --> 01:22:38,696
- It was a gat. - But gat wasn't that bad.

2461
01:22:39,196 --> 01:22:40,825
- A gat. - Hold on. It's our last try.

2462
01:22:40,826 --> 01:22:42,666
- It's our last try. - He's so bad at it.

2463
01:22:45,496 --> 01:22:46,796
What do we do?

2464
01:22:47,636 --> 01:22:49,066
It's the last try. What do we do?

2465
01:22:49,236 --> 01:22:50,406
- That gat. - Yeon Seok.

2466
01:22:50,606 --> 01:22:51,936
You should do the U-turn here.

2467
01:22:52,336 --> 01:22:53,676
- Me? - It's difficult, you know.

2468
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:54,905
Right.

2469
01:22:54,906 --> 01:22:56,175
This is the last try. Goodness.

2470
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:57,345
Since I'm used to...

2471
01:22:57,346 --> 01:22:58,915
- films and cameras, - That's right. You know them.

2472
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,346
- Right. - I have an advantage.

2473
01:23:00,716 --> 01:23:01,985
- Gosh, this is hard. - I'll try it.

2474
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:03,645
- It's our last try. - So this is our last try.

2475
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,355
All right. Let's cheer up for the last time.

2476
01:23:05,356 --> 01:23:06,555
- Let's make a miracle here. - Right.

2477
01:23:06,556 --> 01:23:08,085
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

2478
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:09,585
- It's our last try. - This is the last try.

2479
01:23:09,586 --> 01:23:10,626
The last try.

2480
01:23:10,756 --> 01:23:11,895
- Let's do this. - All right.

2481
01:23:11,896 --> 01:23:13,016
- Here we go. - We got this.

2482
01:23:13,956 --> 01:23:15,366
- Please. - Let's begin.

2483
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,296
Seriously. Let's give him the prize.

2484
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,165
- The lamp. - We must get it for him.

2485
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:21,536
Why are you changing the pictures?

2486
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,835
- All right. - Let's relax.

2487
01:23:23,836 --> 01:23:25,336
- This is nothing. - Please.

2488
01:23:25,536 --> 01:23:26,675
- Give us an easy one. - Ready.

2489
01:23:26,676 --> 01:23:28,506
- Dong Hwi. This is your last try. - Yes.

2490
01:23:28,806 --> 01:23:30,566
- I'm feeling pressured here. - Show them...

2491
01:23:30,876 --> 01:23:33,246
Show them the picture.

2492
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:34,975
In 1, 2, 3.

2493
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,115
- A plunger. - Okay.

2494
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:37,286
Gosh, that was hard.

2495
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:39,886
- I thought it was a lamp. - That was hard.

2496
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,085
- The plunger was a hard one. - Right. We can do it.

2497
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:45,196
All right, Jae Suk.

2498
01:23:46,656 --> 01:23:48,226
Show them the picture.

2499
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:50,026
- In 1, 2, 3. - Hanger.

2500
01:23:50,196 --> 01:23:52,296
- That one was easy. - That one was easy.

2501
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:53,866
I can get the hanger right.

2502
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,642
- I can get the hanger right. - Let's do it comfortably.

2503
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:58,205
- Think that you're lying down. - This is nothing.

2504
01:23:58,206 --> 01:23:59,535
- I'm lying down right now. - Right. You're lying down.

2505
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:01,705
- I'm rolling around in bed. - Right.

2506
01:24:01,706 --> 01:24:03,205
You're rolling around in bed in your pajamas.

2507
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:04,375
- Rolling around. - Right.

2508
01:24:04,376 --> 01:24:05,696
- Feel very comfortable. - Right.

2509
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:07,846
- All right. - Feel very comfortable.

2510
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:08,986
Show them the picture.

2511
01:24:09,146 --> 01:24:10,586
In 1, 2, 3.

2512
01:24:11,716 --> 01:24:13,216
The thing you stir with.

2513
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,425
- Incorrect. - The whisk!

2514
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:17,156
(Whisk)

2515
01:24:19,196 --> 01:24:21,796
Didn't you touch the telescope earlier?

2516
01:24:22,866 --> 01:24:24,695
- I slightly saw the telescope. - Right.

2517
01:24:24,696 --> 01:24:26,565
- She was preparing for that. - I was preparing for that.

2518
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:27,966
We could slightly see it.

2519
01:24:28,566 --> 01:24:30,536
(Right before Jin Kyeong's question was given, )

2520
01:24:32,636 --> 01:24:37,776
(the picture of the telescope could be seen slightly.)

2521
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:40,446
(It's out.)

2522
01:24:40,946 --> 01:24:42,746
(Pretending not to know anything)

2523
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:45,755
- She was preparing for that. - I was preparing for that.

2524
01:24:45,756 --> 01:24:47,055
We could slightly see it.

2525
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:48,885
- But... - We could slightly see it.

2526
01:24:48,886 --> 01:24:50,685
- Gosh! - Hold on!

2527
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,795
Sir! Hold on!

2528
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,326
- Gosh. - Where are you going?

2529
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,965
- You... - You're playing tricks now.

2530
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:58,265
- Come on. - What was that?

2531
01:24:58,266 --> 01:24:59,565
Hold on!

2532
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:01,165
- I can't believe this. - The telescope was purposely shown.

2533
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,465
- This needs to be mentioned. - What was that for?

2534
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:05,005
- The telescope was shown. - Seriously.

2535
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:06,305
- It was like a card trick. - The telescope was shown.

2536
01:25:06,306 --> 01:25:07,835
I can't believe it.

2537
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,145
That wasn't fair.

2538
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:10,775
You made it obvious...

2539
01:25:10,776 --> 01:25:12,815
- that it was a telescope. - That can't happen.

2540
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,546
- I didn't expect to see the whisk. - Seriously.

2541
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:19,156
Did you really not want to give the lamp to him?

2542
01:25:19,256 --> 01:25:21,015
This should definitely be discussed.

2543
01:25:21,016 --> 01:25:22,225
- But... - This can't be let go.

2544
01:25:22,226 --> 01:25:24,155
- Right. - You're using these tricks too?

2545
01:25:24,156 --> 01:25:26,195
You're playing tricks with your hands now?

2546
01:25:26,196 --> 01:25:27,995
- Unbelievable. - I almost called it...

2547
01:25:27,996 --> 01:25:29,366
the telewhisk.

2548
01:25:29,866 --> 01:25:32,165
I was certain that it was the telescope.

2549
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,195
I slightly saw it.

2550
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:34,965
It was a really dumbfounding way to end things.

2551
01:25:34,966 --> 01:25:37,135
(The dream of getting the presents became an empty dream.)

2552
01:25:37,136 --> 01:25:38,575
- I feel terrible. - Dong Gyu looks...

2553
01:25:38,576 --> 01:25:40,175
- Oh, no. - really disappointed.

2554
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:41,412
- Dong Gyu. - You all tried your best.

2555
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,205
You all tried your best.

2556
01:25:43,206 --> 01:25:44,446
I really wanted to do well.

2557
01:25:46,076 --> 01:25:48,276
Why are you suddenly playing Shim Sin's song?

2558
01:25:48,786 --> 01:25:52,385
("You Are The Only One" by Shim Sin)

2559
01:25:52,386 --> 01:25:54,786
Why are you being like this?

2560
01:25:58,726 --> 01:26:00,425
(A performance that comforts the sad soul)

2561
01:26:00,426 --> 01:26:02,665
- He's the worst! - Jae Suk!

2562
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,825
- That's so mean. - My gosh. He has a better image...

2563
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,336
than what he is really like.

2564
01:26:07,066 --> 01:26:08,336
Unbelievable.

2565
01:26:14,236 --> 01:26:15,376
Join in, Jin Kyeong.

2566
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:20,946
Let's end it.

2567
01:26:22,646 --> 01:26:24,315
(Let's just...)

2568
01:26:24,316 --> 01:26:26,485
- I'm sorry. We weren't able to... - Gosh!

2569
01:26:26,486 --> 01:26:27,756
Win you the presents.

2570
01:26:29,786 --> 01:26:30,855
Whenever possible...

2571
01:26:30,856 --> 01:26:33,025
(Whenever possible, )

2572
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:38,126
(relax your mind and body!)

2573
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:40,896
(Namkoong Min)

2574
01:26:41,096 --> 01:26:43,006
(Lee Sul, Jeon Yeo Been)

2575
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:45,505
(Do you have motion sickness?)

2576
01:26:45,506 --> 01:26:46,706
(I do have a bit.)

2577
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:49,306
(Even if it hurts, )

2578
01:26:49,606 --> 01:26:54,476
(I can do anything.)

2579
01:26:57,216 --> 01:26:58,685
(This is how it's done, right?)

2580
01:26:58,686 --> 01:26:59,916
If it's done at the start...

2581
01:27:00,316 --> 01:27:01,355
You...

2582
01:27:01,356 --> 01:27:02,656
(Magic touch, Namkoong Min)

2583
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:05,396
(Drunk on the taste of success)

2584
01:27:05,426 --> 01:27:06,556
(Shall I give it a try?)

2585
01:27:06,896 --> 01:27:07,896
(Flipping)

2586
01:27:08,096 --> 01:27:09,642
(It isn't because you took the nausea medicine, right?)

2587
01:27:09,666 --> 01:27:11,866
(Yeo Been who feels intoxicated by the nausea medicine)

2588
01:27:12,096 --> 01:27:13,435
You can't do that. That will tear the drum.

2589
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:15,096
(Sul who tears up the drum)

2590
01:27:15,436 --> 01:27:17,235
(I will show you how it's done.)

2591
01:27:17,236 --> 01:27:18,266
(Expectant)

2592
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:19,476
Go!

2593
01:27:23,246 --> 01:27:24,246
(Collapsing)

2594
01:27:24,946 --> 01:27:26,775
(Embarrassing...)

2595
01:27:26,776 --> 01:27:28,546
(and heartbreaking)

2596
01:27:28,846 --> 01:27:30,445
(How will "Our Movie" end?)

2597
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:31,585
(That was the most embarrassing moment I went through...)

2598
01:27:31,586 --> 01:27:32,755
(over the last 5 years.)

2599
01:27:32,756 --> 01:27:35,456
(Whenever Possible)

2600
01:27:37,356 --> 01:27:43,726
(Whenever Possible)
