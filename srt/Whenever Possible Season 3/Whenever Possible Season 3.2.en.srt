(Whenever Possible)

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,350
(Current time, 10:55am)

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,719
(Laughing)

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,589
- My gosh. You know? - Yes.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,290
He chuckles like this now.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,090
He didn't laugh like that before.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,659
- Gosh, it's been ages... - We'll start like this?

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,829
- since we last met. - Seriously.

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,559
- Jung Eun and I met for... - We met...

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,829
- Right? - to film the YouTube video.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,559
- That was two years ago. - It was that long ago already?

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,799
- It's been two years. - It's been a while for us too.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,829
- It was for the drama. - We filmed...

14
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,369
- "A Bloody Lucky Day" together. - We were also in a drama together.

15
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,539
- I see. - That's right.

16
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,540
I haven't seen you around,

17
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,510
- Deok Hwan. - It's been a while, right?

18
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,209
It feels like I haven't seen him around for a while.

19
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,479
Have you guys worked on a project together?

20
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,879
Actually, I met Yeon Seok...

21
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,409
- at movie premieres. - Right.

22
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,249
- We only met at movie premieres. - Right.

23
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,919
- We haven't worked on a project... - Right.

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,079
- together. - We haven't yet.

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,619
I'm sure you guys ran into each other at movie premieres.

26
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,766
- But that doesn't really count. - Right, it doesn't count.

27
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,659
- That's more accurate to say. - Right.

28
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,259
- Yes. - But emotionally speaking,

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,229
- I feel close to him. - Right.

30
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,899
- He makes you feel that way. - Yes.

31
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,099
- Really? - Yes. Totally.

32
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,869
- Why... - We worked on a drama together.

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,239
- I see. - It's "Heavenly Ever After."

34
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,939
Kim Hye Ja and Son Suk Ku play a married couple in it, right?

35
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,909
- Yes. That's right. - It's a romantic drama.

36
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,139
What is your role in the drama?

37
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,409
I'm the sidekick.

38
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,179
(Her role in the drama is the sidekick.)

39
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,079
- Hye Ja and I are on a mission. - Can this air?

40
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,349
- So I follow her around. - I see.

41
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,649
- You follow her around? - Yes.

42
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,919
- What's your role, Deok Hwan? - I'm a pastor in paradise...

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,149
with nothing much to do.

44
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,319
- Pastors aren't needed in paradise. - I'm redundant there.

45
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,129
- You're right. - So the setting is paradise, right?

46
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,729
- Yes. - That's right.

47
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,860
You know what? Your face... And it's quite sunny today.

48
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,569
- It suits you. - I see a halo.

49
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,069
Yes, I can see that.

50
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,169
- He gives off a holy vibe. - There's something holy about him.

51
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,209
- There's a holy vibe about him. - Thank you.

52
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,510
Mr. Amen and a pastor are together today.

53
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,310
- Amen. - They're on opposite ends.

54
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,679
- "Narco-Saints." - "Narco-Saints."

55
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,279
(The wrong encounter of two religious men)

56
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,419
Director Kim Seok Yoon is on the project, right?

57
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,019
- That's right. - Right.

58
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,649
- My gosh, Seok Yoon. - That was quite loud.

59
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,689
He used to direct variety shows.

60
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,019
- Right. - We worked together on a game show.

61
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,359
- The one with Kungkungta. - Yes. Kungkungta.

62
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,689
- He directs amazing dramas now. - Right now,

63
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,089
he's been directing many movies and dramas.

64
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,506
- He's been very successful. - Right.

65
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,459
- Director Shin Won Ho... - Yes?

66
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,799
Of "Hospital Playlist" was a similar case.

67
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,829
- That's right. - Right.

68
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,339
- He used to direct variety shows. - Yes. I've heard of him.

69
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,246
Won Ho was the assistant director of the variety show.

70
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,369
And the chief director of the show...

71
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,739
- was Director Kim Seok Yoon. - Director Kim Seok Yoon.

72
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,909
(The assistant director and director of "Terrifying Kungkungta")

73
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,139
- He was the assistant director. - "Terrifying Kungkungta?"

74
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,579
Yes, "Terrifying Kungkungta."

75
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,079
That was an incredible show.

76
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,109
- It was legendary. - How many years were you on it?

77
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,679
- You'd think it lasted long, right? - Yes.

78
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,879
- It only lasted nine months. - Really?

79
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,779
- Really? - Only nine months.

80
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,189
- Really? - Yes, only nine months.

81
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,190
I thought it lasted a long time.

82
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,359
- Yes. - That's how we remember it, right?

83
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,389
- A lot of people loved the show. - I see.

84
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,829
The show was very popular for some time.

85
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,999
But it only lasted nine months.

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,370
- Did you just brag about it? - Yes.

87
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,399
- Other people won't do it for me. - I like that.

88
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,170
- They won't mention it, so I do. - Right.

89
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,699
Besides, not many people from the show...

90
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,510
still work in the industry.

91
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,910
So I have to brag about it myself.

92
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,580
If I don't mention it, no one will know.

93
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,380
- I see. - Yes.

94
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,779
So it's directed by Seok Yoon.

95
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,779
And Son Suk Ku is in the drama too.

96
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,389
- Right. Hye Ja too. - Hye Ja is also in it.

97
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,949

98
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,389
- Right. - Ji Min.

99
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,929
- Ji Min told us to be on this show. - Yes.

100
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,459
- Ji Min said that? - When she joined our show,

101
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,529
she did...

102
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,059
- She was great with the games. - a great job with the games.

103
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,199
- She was on fire that day. - Yes.

104
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,069
- She was on a roll, right? - Yes, she was.

105
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,999
- She got everyone their presents. - Right.

106
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,769
- I hope we can do that too. - Right.

107
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,039
Anyway, Jung Eun and Deok Hwan are joining us today.

108
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,840
We're filming our episode in Seongsu-dong.

109
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,280
We're in Wangsimni?

110
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,679
We're not in Seongsu-dong?

111
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,379
- Seongsu-dong is across the river. - Yes, across the river.

112
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,779
- Right here. - That's right.

113
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,949

I graduated from Hanyang University.

116
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,349
- I'm a Hanyang graduate. - That's why we're here.

117
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,689
And I also grew up...

118
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,519
around this neighborhood.

119
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,460
- Jung Eun is highly educated. - My gosh.

120
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,959
- Jung Eun studied a lot. - You speak English fluently.

121
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,030
- She speaks English fluently too. - Gosh, no.

122
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,129
Do you also live around here?

123
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,740
Yes. It's slightly far from here. I live in Yongdu-dong.

124
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
- Around Konkuk University? No? - No.

125
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,869
It's around Jegi-dong.

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,109
- Jegi-dong? - Yes.

127
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,580

- She's proud to be... - A Hanyang University graduate.

129
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,249
- Her loyalty is crystal clear. - She's all about Hanyang.

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,949
Where's your hometown, Deok Hwan?

131
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,849
I'm from Anyang.

132
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,119
- Anyang? - Yes.

133
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,619
I went to the same high school...

134
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,319

He was famous when he was in school.

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,129
You made your debut at a young age too.

139
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,569
- You were young then. - Yes, I did.

140
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,646
- He was really young back then. - He has seniority.

141
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,100
What year was it?

142
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,239
I made my debut in 1992.

143
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,169
- Gosh, exactly. - I was only five.

144
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,569
(He's been an actor for 34 years.)

145
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,679
- In 1992. - You debuted before Yeon Seok.

146
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,109
- He debuted way before me. - Yes.

147
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,849
How old are you now, Deok Hwan?

148
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,349
- I was born in 1987. - Yes.

149
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,409
He's older than me.

150
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,920
- I'm older than him. - Yes.

151
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,050
So I feel quite uncomfortable.

152
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,590
- Deok Hwan speaks up his mind. - Right. I'm his junior actor,

153
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,030
- This is nice. Yes. - but I'm older than him.

154
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,560
- I like that. - Yes.

155
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,029
- All right. Let's begin now. - Yes.

156
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,329
Let's go and look for our Whenever Guests.

157
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,629
- We must check the address. - Yes.

158
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,100
It's right here.

159
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,699

165
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,850
"and are in different classes."

166
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,850
"But we unite like magnetic pieces in the hallway."

167
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,479
- Hold on. Are they students? - Are they students?

168
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,319
- Are they? - I think they are students.

169
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,989
"We spend more hours studying than hanging out now."

170
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,460
"So please make our lunch break full of joy and laughter."

171
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,529
We're going there during their lunch break.

172
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,259
- They must be in high school. - They must be.

173
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,300
But...

174
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,170
- Did their teachers approve? - Did they?

175
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,839
- This... - So it's during their lunch break.

176
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,369
We'll be there around their lunch break.

177
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,869
Here's one more thing. "NCT, THE BOYZ, ENHYPEN,"

178
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,870
"and Yoo Yeon Seok."

179
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,739
- So... - Your name wasn't mentioned.

180
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,650
Compared to NCT, THE BOYZ, and ENHYPEN,

181
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,379
Yeon Seok isn't quite the same.

182
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,519
(A man joins the lineup of idol stars.)

183
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,090
So they might be an unusual mix too.

184
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,220
- So... - Wait.

185
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,889
I might belong to a different club,

186
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,890
- but I'm still mentioned. - Right.

187
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,419
- Of course, you are. - You're not even mentioned here.

188
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,090
- I'm not mentioned here. - Okay.

189
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,930
But I can feel it from the letter.

190
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,459
- I may belong to a different club. - Listen.

191
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,799
- They know you're coming. - Okay.

192
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,530
- So they added my name. - Yes, they did.

193
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,299
But hold on. Are they students?

194
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,700
A school nearby...

195
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,969
There's a high school affiliated with Hanyang University.

196
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,179
- There is. - What?

197
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,709
- Is it Hanyang Girls' High School? - Hanyang University...

198
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,149
Back then, it was an all-girls high school.

199
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,649
Now, it became a co-ed school.

200
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,710
Is it my alma mater?

201
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,549
- Did you attend Hanyang High? - Yes, I did.

202
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,849
- That must be it. - I graduated from Hanyang High.

203
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,819
Then I attended Hanyang University.

204
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,259
My gosh. You are indeed the Daughter of Hanyang.

205
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,559
(She's worthy of the nickname, the Daughter of Hanyang.)

206
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,689
Then is it safe to think they're your juniors?

207
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,900
- But they must be in class now. - Right.

208
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,969
Right. We have to be there during their lunch break.

209
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,199
The students might be in class.

210
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,469
- Right. - So...

211
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,270
- You were looking over there. - It's so hot.

212
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,140
Let's move here.

213
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
(Oh, right.)

214
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,039
I sent you a cake.

215
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,940
- To where? - I sent you the mobile voucher.

216
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,809
- Really? I couldn't check my phone. - Yes.

217
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,349
- Really? - It's his birthday today.

218
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,779
- Right. - So I quickly sent it this morning.

219
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,879
- Really? - My gosh.

220
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,600
(She sent him a mobile voucher for a cake.)

221
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,989
Thank you. I...

222
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,419
- Make sure to use it. - I sent it on the app.

223
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,490
This is...

224
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,189
- I like the app. - Why am I starting...

225
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,290
to feel embarrassed?

226
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,529
People wished me a happy birthday.

227
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,199
- It happened last night too. - Yes.

228
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,481
The crew wished me a happy birthday at the shoot and all.

229
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,699
Gosh, it's his birthday today. And we're filming on his birthday.

230
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,329
- Right. - But this is quite common.

231
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,746
- Yes. - Filming on birthdays is common.

232
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,840
Thank you.

233
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,309
Filming shows on birthdays is quite common.

234
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,439
(A moment of objective thinking)

235
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
- So it's not so special? - Right. It's not special.

236
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,509
I wanted it to be special...

237
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,126
- and celebrate it with everyone. - Okay.

238
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,149
- How about seaweed soup for lunch? - I see.

239
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,919
We can just go down toward Wangsimni then.

240
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,089
- Toward the Seongdong-gu Office. - I see.

241
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,560
- Jung Eun. Oh, my. - She knows everything.

242
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,690
- She's the Daughter of Hanyang. - Well...

243
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,610
I spent a lot of time in the downtown area.

244
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,729
Hold on. Didn't Cho Hye Lyun attend Hanyang University as well?

245
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,959
- Yes, Hye Lyun did. - I see.

246
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,680
- She was a year below you? - Yes, she was.

247
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,729
- I see. - I knew she'd be a comedienne.

248
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,799
- How? - Because she wanted to be...

249
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,839
- on every variety show... - Yes.

250
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,370
Like "Korea Sings."

251
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,540
- She was too much to put it simply. - No.

252
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,979
I knew she would make it one day.

253
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,749
- That crossed my mind. - I see.

254
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,619
And Jung Eun has taken an interest in dancing lately.

255
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,789
Jung Eun, you've been dancing for a while, right?

256
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,659
- You took dance lessons a year ago. - Well, I do it to prevent dementia.

257
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
- Okay. - What?

258
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,559
- That's why I dance. - What kind of dance is it?

259
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,729
- K-pop. Yes. - You dance to K-pop?

260
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,259
- I like dancing to K-pop. - What song did you learn...

261
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,599
to dance to recently?

262
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,670
- "like JENNIE." - "like JENNIE?"

263
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,339
(A bold choice of song)

264
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,499
That song is trending now.

265
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,769
But I'm not that good because my knees hurt.

266
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,610
(She pretends she's not a good dancer, but...)

267
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,780
(Jung Eun)

268
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,080
(Powerful)

269
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,780
(Like Jung Eun)

270
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,049
- I dance passionately like this. - I see.

271
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,219
And...

272
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,900
Wait. Does the song have a move like this?

273
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,919
- That's what's called a groove. - A bit.

274
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,019
It's all about the groove.

275
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,129
- Really? - That's what the song is about.

276
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,630
- It goes like this. - Yes.

277
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,329
Deok Hwan, don't you dance as well?

278
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,999
I used to be a b-boy.

279
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,229
- That's right. - My gosh. Right?

280
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,899
- I remembered that. - You used to be a b-boy?

281
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,869
Yes. When I was young, G-DRAGON and I were...

282
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,640
- in the kid version of H.O.T. - That's right.

283
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,509
When SM Entertainment had concerts,

284
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,110
we performed shows as Kid H.O.T.

285
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,780
That's how we joined YG Entertainment together.

286
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,379
Why did you stop? You would've made a good idol star too.

287
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,079
I'm not sure. Back then,

288
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,390
starring in "Country Diaries" was my top priority.

289
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,059
- Gosh, he said "Country Diaries." - That's why...

290
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,159
(Goodness, he's been in the industry for so long.)

291
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
My goodness.

292
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:17,300
I was Kim Soo Mi's grandson.

293
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,230
- I was Il Yong's son. - Even I didn't know.

294
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,769
Right. I suddenly remembered that about Deok Hwan.

295
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,269
- That he was a great dancer. - I see.

296
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,110
- So... - But my joints are busted now.

297
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,039
- You can't dance now? - No.

298
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,409
(Even Soon Gil couldn't avoid the joint problem.)

299
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,039
I danced a few times for my wife.

300
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,449
- And? - She told me not to tell people...

301
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,450
I used to be a dancer.

302
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,110
- You're married too. - Yes.

303
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,979
- You're married, Deok Hwan? - Yes, I am.

304
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,149
- You didn't know? - I didn't.

305
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,419
- I... - He has a child too.

306
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,689
- You have a child too? - Yes.

307
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,190
- No, I don't have a child. - Really?

308
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,100
- My child doesn't exist yet. - Jung Eun.

309
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,159
Please get rid of that.

310
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,290
(Feeling embarrassed)

311
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,199
How long have you been married?

312
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,499
- I've been married for three years. - It was quite some time ago then.

313
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,969
- I got married during the pandemic. - I see.

314
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,100
So we got married quietly.

315
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,869
Gosh, the campus must look so beautiful right now.

316
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,709
- I bet. - It looks beautiful.

317
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,410
Right. That's a great spot for admiring the cherry blossoms.

318
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,780
- Is that the campus? - Yes, that's Hanyang University.

319
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,420
(Spotting something)

320
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,940
She's wearing the varsity jacket.

321
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,849
Hello.

322
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,289
- Hello. - Hello.

323
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,720
(Jung Eun's university junior)

324
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,659
That's the varsity jacket.

325
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,076
- Gosh, the leaves are sprouting. - Look at these college kids.

326
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
(Looking for directions)

327
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:26,229
Where is it, Yeon Seok?

328
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,669
- Hold on. We have to go a bit more. - This is the place.

329
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,929
- It's about 100m... - Yes. We can go a bit more.

330
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,569
- We need to go another 200m. - Right.

331
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,600
- Is that so? - Yes.

332
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,969
So...

333
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,609
the school is in the same location as when you were in school, right?

334
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,809
I think so.

335
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,580
Then they're your direct juniors.

336
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,479
They probably don't know.

337
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,679
They don't know...

338
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,296
- I'm an alumna there. - They don't know.

339
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
You're their senior.

340
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,350
- That must be the campus. - Yes.

341
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,296
- Yes, it's indeed a high school. - This is the place.

342
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,459
(Hanyang University High School)

343
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,289
- Was that your school? - Yes.

344
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,390
Really?

345
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,099
(Chuckling)

346
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,169
- I had no idea we'd be here. - Exactly.

347
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,329
How long has it been since you came here?

348
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,330
It would've been great...

349
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,011
if it had been co-ed when I was in school.

350
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,039
(She suddenly gets worked up while getting nostalgic.)

351
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,569
It wasn't co-ed back then.

352
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,839
Did you only attend all-girls schools?

353
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,779
I went to middle school in a different neighborhood.

354
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,179
(But she still likes her school unconditionally.)

355
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,310
The campus is beautiful indeed.

356
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,980
- This way. - My gosh.

357
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,749
(Entering the school with anticipation)

358
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,789
- Gosh, the students... - Hold on.

359
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,919
- Now, they have this thing... - My gosh.

360
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,236
- at the parking lot entrance. - Seriously. This is...

361
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,559
- It's their lunch break now. - This is the place, right?

362
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,829
"Main Building 3-7."

363
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,299
- This is the main building. - "Main Building 3-7."

364
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
- That's the main building? - Yes.

365
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,729
"Main Building 3-7."

366
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,369
- My class was on the third floor. - Hello.

367
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,170
(Jung Eun also studied in the main building.)

368
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,869
- Things are crazy here. - It's 3-7. The main building...

369
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,469
Was it the same building?

370
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,110
- Yes, it was. - So it hasn't changed?

371
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,840
- The building hasn't changed? - No.

372
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,210
- The paint colors are different. - I see.

373
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,549
(Off to the main building to find the Whenever Guest)

374
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,849
We didn't have this passageway.

375
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,549
They must've built it. The building...

376
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,990
- That wasn't there before? - No.

377
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,920
Look at the students.

378
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,889
- Gosh. - They're so excited.

379
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,560
- Hello. - Hello.

380
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,200
- We came during their lunch break. - Gosh.

381
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,069
(Screaming)

382
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,070
Hello.

383
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,239
(Their lunch break has begun at that time.)

384
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,540
- Hello. - Look at my juniors.

385
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,010
- Hello, my dear juniors. - Hello.

386
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,279
- It has been a while for you. - Right.

387
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,849
This place looks completely new.

388
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,296
(Jung Eun's juniors are in a frenzy.)

389
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,590
- Hello. - Hi.

390
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,989
"The principal's office."

391
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,366
- "The principal's office." - "The broadcasting studio."

392
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,589
There's the principal's office.

393
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,759
(The principal's office still startles them.)

394
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,859
- I'm a bit scared. - The principal's office always...

395
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,229
- Right. - makes you nervous.

396
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,070
- You feel guilty for some reason. - It's odd.

397
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,869
Hold on. It said 3-7.

398
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,099
- Hello. - Hello.

399
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,069
- It said 3-7. - Where is it?

400
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,399
- Where's 3-7? - Is it on the 3rd floor?

401
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,469
- Hello. - Hello.

402
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,739
- You should go upstairs. - Go upstairs.

403
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,979
- Upstairs? - So it must be...

404
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,709
- on the 3rd floor. - Room 3-7...

405
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,980
- Okay. - This is the place.

406
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,410
- Year 3, Class 7. Hello. - Hello.

407
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,519
(They're pop-eyed.)

408
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,949
- So 3-7... - Gosh, the atmosphere here...

409
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,450
- It's 3-7. - Hello.

410
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,789
- Hello. - My gosh. Hello.

411
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,319
- Look for 3-7. - Well, you know...

412
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,360
(Delighted)

413
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,460
She's a big senior.

414
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,399
- Let's introduce you to them. - Hello.

415
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
(Hello, Jung Eun.)

416
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,499
- Let's introduce you to them. - Hello.

417
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,269
(The Daughter of Hanyang is proud.)

418
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,069
Jung Eun, it must feel like you're making a glorious return.

419
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,109
Right.

420
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,539
(The glorious return of the alumna in "Parasite")

421
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,340
I wonder if this is indeed my alma mater.

422
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,740
I love you, Jae Suk!

423
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,910
- Okay. - I love you!

424
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,849
This is the classroom.

425
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,619
- Hey, this is the classroom. - It's 3-7.

426
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,819
- This is the one. - Yes, 3-7.

427
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,849
But no one is here.

428
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,796
- Where did they go? - The students aren't in here.

429
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,319
(The Whenever Guests are on their way back...)

430
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,040
(from their class at a different location.)

431
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,929
- There's an air conditioner too. - The air conditioner.

432
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,059
(Looking around the classroom after many decades)

433
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,700
It was so hot in the classroom back then.

434
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,929
Hey, this is unique.

435
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,169
- There's a standing desk. - I didn't know about this.

436
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,639
- I see. For when they get sleepy, - It's for when they get sleepy.

437
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,239
- they can go to the back... - They can stand here.

438
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,769
- and stand like this. - I thought this was...

439
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,139
- for people with herniated discs. - How interesting.

440
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,140
That must be it.

441
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:01,909
I know since I played a teacher before.

442
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,279
- I see. For sleepy students. - Okay. That's what this is for.

443
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,549
- Students can stand in the back? - Yes.

444
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,019
That's so funny. Check out the class motto.

445
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,249
"I'm doing well. I'll turn out well."

446
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,096
(Class Motto: I'm doing well. I'll turn out well.)

447
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
I think that's a great motto.

448
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,959
When I was in school, it was, "Be diligent and arduous."

449
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,459
- Yes. - That would be a school motto.

450
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,630
- It was more like a school motto. - Yes.

451
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
They have cold seaweed soup with cucumber.

452
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
(Dinner: Cold seaweed soup with cucumber)
Should we eat here?

453
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,640
It's not hot seaweed soup, but...

454
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,639
- Cold seaweed soup with cucumber? - Yes. I can at least have that...

455
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,770
on my birthday. That sounds good, doesn't it?

456
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,840
I should have dinner here.

457
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,649
By the way, what should we have for lunch?

458
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,879
Well, that's the question.

459
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,450
What are you craving? Tteokbokki in a pot? Naengmyeon?

460
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,779
- Udon? - What?

461
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,689
- Happy birthday to you - What's going on?

462
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,719
What?

463
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,190
(Happy birthday, Uncle Yeon Seok!)

464
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,890
(Happy birthday to you)

465
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
(Quickly grasping the situation)

466
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,000
What is this?

467
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,670
(Happy birthday, dear Yoo Yeon Seok)

468
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,940
(Happy birthday to you)

469
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,710
Gosh, this is making me embarrassed.

470
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,209
- My gosh. - They knew it was your birthday.

471
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,540
What is this?

472
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,490
- It's making me feel super shy. - What's that?

473
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,080
- Seriously. Your nieces... - This is touching.

474
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,049
The nieces didn't forget their uncle's birthday.

475
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,249
- My gosh, seriously. - Oh, my.

476
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,789
- They're so cool. - This is...

477
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
(Polite)

478
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,960
You know what? I'm grateful for their effort.

479
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,759
- I'm so grateful. - Gosh.

480
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,490
- This is so special. - Yes.

481
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,429
I used to make this cake too.

482
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,870
- Thank you. Nice to meet you. - They wrote the signs too.

483
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,300
They used extreme honorifics for you.

484
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,169
(Super polite)

485
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,269
- Their choice of words was spot on. - That's right.

486
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
(Jung Eun's juniors are polite.)

487
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,739
- I'm a bit old for them... - Yes.

488
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
- to drop the honorifics. - They added the honorifics.

489
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:40,939
- "Happy birthday." - Yes.

490
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,850
- You should blow out the candles. - Okay.

491
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,450
(Shy)

492
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,880
Thank you.

493
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,319
- Thank you. - This is nice.

494
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,489
- Happy birthday. - I can feel their affection.

495
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,959
- I can't believe they did this. - Seriously.

496
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,760
- Hello. - Hello.

497
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,070
- You should sit there. - I plan to.

498
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,629
- Sit. - Really?

499
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,339
(Sitting down...)

500
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,040
(next to Yeon Seok)

501
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,410
Thank you.

502
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,539
- She's a huge fan of yours. - She's a huge fan.

503
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,209
- Really? - She's a hardcore fan.

504
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,709
She watched every episode of "When the Phone Rings."

505
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,309
- You watched that? - I also...

506
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,349
- watched your musical... - And the musical.

507
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,379
And went to all of your stage appearances.

508
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,940
- You watched my musical too? - Really?

509
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,919
Really? Which one?

510
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,549
I watched "Werther" twice a long time ago.

511
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,019
- You watched "Werther?" - Yes.

512
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,759
- That's amazing. - You're a true fan.

513
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,080
- She must be a true fan. - Gosh.

514
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,689
- She's our guest. Yuk Tae Kyung. - Yes.

515
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,860
- Right. You're Tae Kyung, right? - Yes.

516
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,669
(The first Whenever Guest, Yuk Tae Kyung)

517
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,199
And today, one of your great alumni...

518
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,539
- will be joining us. - Right.

519
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,879
- I watched "Miss Night and Day." - Yes.

520
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,539
(Suddenly naming her drama)

521
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,779
"Miss Night and Day."

522
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,649
- You watched her in the drama. - Yes, in the drama.

523
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,179
And she's your alumna.

524
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,079
- Right. - It was an all-girls school then.

525
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,519
- Right. That's true. - But it became co-ed later.

526
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,220
- Isn't it great that it's co-ed? - Yes.

527
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,819
(Answering her question in 0.1 seconds)

528
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,460
We actually happen to be filming on Yeon Seok's birthday.

529
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,476
He said he didn't even get to have seaweed soup.

530
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,330
But you showed affection through choco pies.

531
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,369
I thought the production crew...

532
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,270
had tipped them off.

533
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,009
- But she prepared it herself. - She's a true fan.

534
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,239
Tae Kyung is a fan...

535
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,609
- and knew it was your birthday. - That's right.

536
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,850
That's right. She didn't reluctantly add my name...

537
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,319
after NCT, although I'm quite different from them.

538
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,790
No, she didn't. But that's what I thought.

539
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,849
- That's what I thought, Tae Kyung. - You were wrong.

540
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,019
Can you introduce...

541
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,359
- yourselves? - Please.

542
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,059
I'm Yuk Tae Kyung, a high school senior...

543
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,269
- at Hanyang High School. - Nice to meet you.

544
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,069
What about your friends?

545
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,400
You said that you gather in the hallway...

546
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,540
during recess to do various things.

547
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,539
Are you part of a club or are you just friends?

548
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,809
We were close ever since we started high school.

549
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,949
- Best friends? - Yes.

550
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,780
But we ended up in different classes...

551
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,520
after the first year.

552
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,090
But we still always meet during recess to hang out...

553
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,859
and talk.

554
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,219
The seven of us...

555
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,929
have always stayed close.

556
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,559
It isn't easy to stay close for three years.

557
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,199
- You're right. - Most people hang out...

558
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,030
with their classmates.

559
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,899
There must be something that keeps you close.

560
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,476
- I feel comfortable with them. - I have fun when I'm around them.

561
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,139
- We're funny. - We're funny.

562
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,340
(We're funny.)

563
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,379
(The 3 years' worth of memories...)

564
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,419
(put a smile on their faces whenever they see one another.)

565
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,520
All right.

566
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,890
Why did you send a letter to Whenever Possible?

567
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,789
Because I love Actor Yoo Yeon Seok,

568
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,330
I was watching Whenever Possible.

569
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,529
Then I thought it would be nice to make a lasting memory...

570
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,130
with my friends during our last year of high school and sent a letter.

571
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
I see.

572
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,169
- They really seem close. - We are.

573
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,739
- I can tell. - Yes.

574
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,240
Since you're high school seniors,

575
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,909
I'm curious about what you plan to do after graduating.

576
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,549
My first goal is to get into a university.

577
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,119
I saw test papers...

578
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,220
on your desk earlier.

579
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,559
We had a practice test for the CSAT in March.

580
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,229
Some of us still have the papers on our desks.

581
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,860
Is it okay to ask how you did?

582
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,230
Is it okay for me to ask?

583
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,000
Were you satisfied with the result?

584
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,469
(Hesitating)

585
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,990
She got the first math question wrong.

586
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,570
- What? - She got the first question wrong.

587
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,579
- Wait. - You only got one wrong?

588
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,079
- No, the 1st question. - No, the 1st question.

589
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,479
- You got the 1st one wrong? - She got the 1st one wrong.

590
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,279
Aren't you allowed to get the first question wrong?

591
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,219
- No, it's super easy. - It's really easy.

592
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,289
- I see. - "It's super easy."

593
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,689
I got everything else I wanted to get right...

594
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,289
except that question.

595
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,519
- That's good enough. - I just got the first one wrong.

596
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
It must've been quite a big deal among your friends...

597
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,959
- that you got it wrong. - Yes.

598
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,869
Did everyone else get the first question right?

599
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,999
- Yes. - It's impossible not to.

600
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,270
- Is it like a warm-up question? - Yes, it is.

601
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,539
If you focus too hard on difficult questions...

602
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,169
- You could get an easy one wrong. - That's right.

603
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,910
Not only is Jung Eun an alumna of this high school,

604
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,279
but she also went to Hanyang University.

605
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,710
(Hanyang University)

606
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,579
(Embarrassed)

607
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,550
She also goes to Hanyang University Hospital.

608
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,949
(Cheering)

609
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,219
She is the Daughter of Hanyang.

610
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,020
(The pride of Hanyang juniors)

611
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,929
Do you want to study...

612
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,559
- different things in university? - Yes.

613
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,329
I want to do many different things,

614
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,069
but my current top choice is media studies.

615
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,390
- Media studies? - Media studies?

616
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,739
- That's what she's interested in. - She might join our field of work.

617
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,070
- That's right. - We might meet.

618
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,710
I started thinking about becoming a producer.

619
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
- These people will be your seniors. - Right.

620
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,949
It may look nice on the outside,

621
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,449
but once you see from the inside,

622
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,250
- It's tough. - You'll see it's pandemonium.

623
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,349
It's sheer pandemonium.

624
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,990
You should brace yourself for it.

625
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,289
What about everyone else?

626
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,730
I like nature.

627
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,529
So I want to major in smart farming or...

628
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,359
- Smart farming? - That's nice.

629
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,599
- It's becoming popular. - You're right.

630
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,829
- Right? - That's what I want to study.

631
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,640
- Smart farming. - I see.

632
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,370
What about you, Eun Seo?

633
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm focusing on the school I want to get into.

634
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,010
- I have a reason to go there. - What is it?

635
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,649
I may be oversharing,

636
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,150
but my tutor goes to Chung-Ang University.

637
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,179
- And he's so handsome. - He went to Chung-Ang University.

638
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,626
- He went to Chung-Ang University. - He went to Chung-Ang University.

639
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,789
Chung-Ang University has so many handsome men.

640
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,720
- You came on the right day. - Yes, you did.

641
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,390
That's why I want to go to Chung-Ang University.

642
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,060
- Good luck. - Because of your tutor?

643
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,929
- Because of her handsome tutor. - Because of her tutor.

644
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,530
Why don't you send him a video letter?

645
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,040
I'm not sure if you're watching this...

646
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,869
Gosh. I'm not sure if you're watching this,

647
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,910
Is she going to cry?

648
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,180
But I'll study hard...

649
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,509
and make sure to show you I can do it.

650
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,150
Eun Seo.

651
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,920
Won't your mother see this if it's aired?

652
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,550
Won't she fire your tutor?

653
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,319
No, she won't.

654
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,920
You should hide your feelings.

655
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,590
I'm not sure you should reveal your true feelings.

656
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,629
Is there anything you want to do...

657
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,599
when you become a university student?

658
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm sure you all have a couple of things in mind.

659
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,799
What do you want to do?

660
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,630
I want to go to a membership training camp.

661
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,869
Membership training camp.

662
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,870
(Camps are fun.)

663
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:15,210
- They used to be... - Camps are fun.

664
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,709
Why do you want to go?

665
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,109
I want to travel with a big group of people.

666
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,310
I'll get a chance when I go to university.

667
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,690
You have school trips in high school. Is that different?

668
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,279
Yes, it's slightly different.

669
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,650
What do you think the difference is?

670
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,849
The alcohol?

671
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,960
(Smiling)

672
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,160
That was clear and concise.

673
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,060
It was clear and concise.

674
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,230
I love how straightforward students are nowadays.

675
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,200
They don't beat around the bush.

676
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,470
Deok Hwan, you debuted early.

677
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,940
But was there anything you wanted to do in university?

678
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,779
I wanted to be a CC.

679
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,479
- CC? - I really wanted to do that.

680
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,879
- You did? - Yes.

681
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,350
- Does that mean "campus couple?" - Yes.

682
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,520
Did you think it was the measurement?

683
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,890
It isn't the measurement for beer.

684
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,320
No, it isn't.

685
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,629
- But when I turned 20, - Did you date anyone?

686
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,400
- I decided I shouldn't - Why not?

687
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,470
It was when "Like a Virgin" became a bit hit.

688
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,839
I became famous at school.

689
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,470
- For what? - That I was in a movie.

690
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,980
I think I had a huge ego at the time.

691
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,110
- You admit it? - I knew I was a star.

692
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,790
Deok Hwan found the courage to tell us.

693
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,489
That could've been the case.

694
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,919
- He can share about it now. - Seriously.

695
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,659
It sometimes happens without you realizing it.

696
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,530
I take my mask off when I go to Hanyang University Hospital.

697
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,070
- Why? - So people can recognize me.

698
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,600
You want people to recognize you?

699
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,230
It's lunchtime, but you didn't have lunch.

700
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,999
- You must be hungry. - Aren't you hungry?

701
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,069
- We're okay. - We're okay.

702
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,969
We need to have lunch too.

703
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,409
- Can you recommend a restaurant? - Something nearby.

704
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,709
- Are there any good restaurants? - There are so many.

705
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,879
- There are tons. - Really?

706
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
What do you like?

707
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,619
When we get together for a meal,

708
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,019
we usually have gukbap.

709
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,449
- Gukbap? - Yes.

710
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,890
- Gukbap? - I realized...

711
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,219
that gukbap is popular among teenagers nowadays.

712
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,619
- Really? - Yes.

713
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,340
Where can we find tasty gukbap around here?

714
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,930
There is a place called Namdo.

715
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,599
It's really good.

716
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,806
I didn't expect to hear this from a high school student.

717
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,499
She recommended a place called Namdo.

718
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,099
What kind of gukbap is it?

719
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,800
It's the authentic type of gukbap.

720
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,509
- It's the authentic type. - It's an authentic gukbap place.

721
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,709
- It's the old-style gukbap. - They have tasty kimchi.

722
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,109
- Their kimchi is amazing. - They have sundae gukbap...

723
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,279
and suyuk gukbap.

724
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,509
- Suyuk gukbap? - Yes.

725
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,179
We should have gukbap.

726
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,849
Yes, since they recommended it.

727
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,779
What if it becomes too popular and difficult to eat at?

728
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,580
It's lunchtime, and...

729
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,489
- I hope it doesn't become popular. - What's wrong?

730
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,789
- We don't want it to become famous. - We don't want it to become famous.

731
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,919
What?

732
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,989
(It's our precious restaurant.)

733
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,689
- We don't want it to become famous. - We don't want it to become famous.

734
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,630
- I see. - We're going to go to it.

735
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,830
No, you can't.

736
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,229
I'm sorry, but we're going.

737
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,029
- Now, I'm very curious. - Go often before this is aired.

738
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,469
(Joking with them)

739
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,570
You still have a month left.

740
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,110
We were thinking of going to Crocodile Tteokbokki.

741
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,080
- It's tasty, right? - Or Smile Tteokbokki.

742
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,179
Or the udon place. What was it called?

743
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,409
- Gajoku Udon? - Yes.

744
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,880
(Sounding uninterested)

745
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,949
- They're only interested in gukbap. - Yes.

746
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,250
Their reaction got very boring all of a sudden.

747
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,819
We want to give you...

748
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,030
- many presents today. - That's right.

749
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,359
- Hopefully. - You have...

750
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,029
the CSAT coming up.

751
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,129
We hope to give you a refreshing experience.

752
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,099
(Bonus Coupon)

753
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,339
(A coupon that allows the Whenever Guest...)

754
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,239
(to participate in a mission in the place of one of the members)

755
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,639
(When the coupon is used, it doesn't count as a try.)

756
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,210
Why don't we have the senior roll the die for the juniors?

757
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,209
The senior will roll the die.

758
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,819
Zero is the smallest number.

759
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,249
- My gosh. - You can get up to two coupons.

760
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,350
- Two coupons? - Yes.

761
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,219
- Please get 2. - Please get 2.

762
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
- There's only one of it. - The bigger the number,

763
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,759
- Start praying. - the more...

764
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,859
- tries we get. - Please.

765
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,989
(Please!)

766
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,360
- Please. - Please.

767
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,899
- Please. - Please.

768
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,359
(Let's see...)

769
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,870
(Will they get two bonus coupons?)

770
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,240
(They get two bonus coupons.)

771
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,210
Nice.

772
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,049
(The senior did it.)

773
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,179
This is good.

774
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,919
- She is the Daughter of Hanyang. - No wonder.

775
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,889
(You're the best.)

776
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,920
Jung Eun did it.

777
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,959
Tae Kyung, open the first one.

778
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,529
Please, Tae Kyung.

779
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,989
- Tae Kyung. - Tae Kyung.

780
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,089
(Clasping their hands together and hoping for a good present)

781
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,129
(Holding his hands out)

782
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,430
- He's smiling. - My heart is fluttering.

783
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,106
- Give me the fortune cookie. - Unbelievable.

784
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,269
"You stand in line for this Gen Z must-have item."

785
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,169
"Decorate your tumblers instead of your diaries."

786
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,740
"Seven Stanley tumblers."

787
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,039
The big tumblers?

788
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,110
- Seven of them? - Yes.

789
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,010
(Gasping)

790
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,749
- Please. - Please.

791
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,880
I want that.

792
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,089
- Here. - This is awesome.

793
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,550
- Awesome. - You get thirsty in this season.

794
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
You can grab a cool drink.

795
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,859
- What game are we playing? - Let's organize the chairs first.

796
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,160
- Okay. - Sure.

797
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,059
- This is awesome. - This is awesome.

798
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,859
- You chose a good one. - You chose a good one.

799
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
(To gain something you don't have, you have to try something new.)

800
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,729
He's so handsome.

801
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,299
- He's so handsome. - Hey.

802
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,370
- I'm sorry. - This is truly unbelievable.

803
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,109
They're all handsome.

804
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,239
The actor that went to Chung-Ang University high-fived me.

805
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,839
- Me too. - Me too.

806
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,379
- He high-fived me too. - Quiet.

807
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,410
Quiet down.

808
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,679
Would you like some water?

809
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,850
- Yes, please. - Yes, please.

810
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,219
- Thank you. - Thank you.

811
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,349
- No worries. - Thank you.

812
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,320
Wait a minute. I'll bring a few more.

813
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,819
- I'm taking a sip. - Okay.

814
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,559
- Hey. - Come over here.

815
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,329
Give that to me.

816
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,960
Gosh.

817
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,729
I'm not going to drink this.

818
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,330
- You're so lucky. - Here is some water.

819
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,529
(Giggling)

820
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,540
Can I have a sip?

821
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,069
Drink your water.

822
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,939
- She doesn't want to drink hers. - She shouldn't.

823
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,086
She doesn't want to open the water Yeon Seok gave her.

824
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,756
- I'm going to save this. - Drink your water.

825
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,080
(Relay Gonggi)

826
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,119
(Each person plays a round of the game.)

827
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,849
(1st player, Level 1, 2nd player, Level 2)

828
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,850
(3rd player, Level 3)

829
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:05,759
(4th player, Level 4 and Toss and Catch 5)

830
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,459
(The time limit is 30 seconds.)

831
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,729
- We get 30 seconds? - It's 30 seconds?

832
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,790
What?

833
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,199
- That's so difficult. - What are we to do?

834
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,029
The last person has to toss and catch, right?

835
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,230
- Do we have to catch all five? - Yes, you do.

836
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,569
- Gosh. - That's too difficult.

837
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,839
(They begin to stir after hearing what Round 1 is.)

838
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,340
I really want the tumbler.

839
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,069
- It's been a while. - You're good at this, aren't you?

840
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,910
It's been too long since I've played it.

841
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,810
I used to be good at it, but not anymore.

842
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,279
You have to...

843
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,849
- continue playing. - She's good.

844
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,350
- You're good. - I made a mistake.

845
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,719
- I can't do that. - If you fail...

846
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,119
We pick up from that level?

847
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
You're good at this, aren't you, Deok Hwan?

848
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:41,290
- I'm really bad at it. - It's a relay.

849
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,690
Let's see.

850
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,830
I think I should play Level One.

851
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,599
- He's good. - That's Level One.

852
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,930
(He's better than they thought.)

853
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,100
- Then... - I have small hands.

854
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,609
- I don't know. - You're good.

855
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,340
(Moving skillfully)

856
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,940
I used to be good at this.

857
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,079
(Their expectations suddenly go up.)

858
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,849
- The toss and catch is hard. - Get five.

859
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,909
Go for it.

860
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,080
(Groaning)

861
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,049
(Their expectations suddenly drop.)

862
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,849
They have big reactions.

863
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,919
(Intimidated)

864
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,519
Why don't you do the toss and catch?

865
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,689
- Good idea. - I'll give it a try.

866
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,960
Should we go in this order?

867
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,259
- He did it. - Let's give it a try.

868
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,029
We will go ahead and try.

869
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,229
- Let's go. - Let's go.

870
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,129
- Let's go! - Let's go!

871
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,970
- I play Level 1. - Level 1.

872
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,939
- Level 2, Level 3. - Level 2, Level 3.

873
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,070
- Level 4. - I play Level 4.

874
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,079
(Their first try to win the tumbler)

875
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,139
Let's go!

876
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,709
- Let's go! - Let's go!

877
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,986
- We don't have time. - Here we go!

878
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,710
- Ready. Set. - We have to go fast.

879
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,750
They're too close together.

880
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,896
- You have to do it over. - No, do it over.

881
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,219
- Do it over. - But I caught it.

882
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,789
- Go faster. - I can't touch it?

883
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,189
Spread it out.

884
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,459
(Level 1)

885
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,589
- Please. - Please.

886
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,729
- Okay. - Nice.

887
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,100
Speed up. We don't have time.

888
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,370
- We don't have time. - That's right.

889
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,629
- She's good. Nice. - She's good.

890
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,469
- That was good. - That was good.

891
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,750
(She clears Level 2 in no time.)

892
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,470
- Please. - She did it.

893
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,439
Nice, that's good.

894
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,580
Hurry up.

895
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,456
- That's perfect. - Nice, that's good.

896
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Nice, that's good.

897
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,379
Deok Hwan.

898
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,696
- That's perfect. - Nice, that's good.

899
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,480
Deok Hwan.

900
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,519
Why didn't you catch the ones that were close?

901
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,989
(Level 3)

902
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,020
That was so close.

903
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,960
No, wait.

904
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
(They fail in Level 3.)

905
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,389
- Look. - Look.

906
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,229
- It was placed like this. - Deok Hwan.

907
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,399
- Why did you catch these? - You shouldn't have gone for these.

908
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,700
- It's okay. - It's okay.

909
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,399
- It's okay. - It's okay.

910
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,969
- Get up. - I couldn't see straight.

911
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,109
- If you fail, - I was so nervous.

912
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,139
- you have to try again right away. - Right away?

913
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,379
- Yes, right away. - I was flustered.

914
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,980
It made me feel flustered.

915
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,949
Do you want to try either Level 1 or 2, Deok Hwan?

916
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,109
- Should I? - We have to move faster.

917
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,950
- Right away? - Yes.

918
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,449
We can't make any mistakes.

919
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,590
Yes, that's right.

920
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,519
I thought the sign said "Yoo Yeon Seok."

921
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,789
But I realized it says, "THE BOYZ."

922
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,866
(The sign in the back was the real one.)

923
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,689
("VVV" by THE BOYZ)

924
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,029
I understand.

925
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,536
(She quickly changes it to the one in front.)

926
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,929
(She's showing support as a fan whenever possible.)

927
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,999
Let's gather our hands in the center.

928
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,499
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

929
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,669
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

930
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,939
- We have to pass Level One. - Ready.

931
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,339
- Thirty seconds is too short. - Here we go.

932
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,239
- Set. - We should get at least 50 seconds.

933
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,639
I know.

934
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
(Level 1)

935
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:16,249
It's... Okay, nice.

936
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,679
- That was good. - That's good.

937
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,749
- Nice. - Okay.

938
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,949
(Level 2)

939
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,880
- Please. - Please.

940
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,289
- Why is it so close together? - That...

941
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,319
This is tough.

942
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,890
- Wait. - Hey.

943
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,659
- Yes! - That was good.

944
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,430
- I'm the problem. - That's right.

945
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,730
Nice.

946
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,000
- Go again. - You have to try again.

947
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,240
- Oh, no. - Nice.

948
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,709
- That's good, Jung Eun. - That's good.

949
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,869
- Okay. - Good job.

950
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,710
- Please. - You did it.

951
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,110
It's all you, Jae Suk.

952
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,310
All right.

953
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,850
Nice.

954
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
All right.

955
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,380
(He just has to toss and catch.)

956
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
You got this.

957
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,390
- No. - Wait.

958
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,559
- Please. - This is the last level.

959
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,259
- Come on. - Three, two...

960
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,160
(Toss and catch 5 stones)

961
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,199
- Gosh! - That was close.

962
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,459
(The time is up, and they fail.)

963
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,800
That was so close.

964
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,599
This is tough.

965
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,929
It's hard to do it within 30 seconds.

966
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,700
- It's too short. - It's nerve-racking.

967
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,269
(The tension is making their hands cramp.)

968
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,139
My hands are shaking.

969
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,570
I don't know what to do.

970
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,209
Wait, let me try Level Four.

971
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,949
Toss 1 in the air, and place 4 on the desk.

972
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,550
- Toss one, and... - No, not like that.

973
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,580
What are you doing?

974
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,050
- That was funny. - What was that?

975
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,890
I'll try Level Four.

976
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,290
- No, wait. - That's wrong.

977
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,520
- How do you do it? - Toss and place.

978
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,830
- Try it. - Level Four...

979
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,759
We're in trouble.

980
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,560
If this is Round 1, how hard will Round 2 be?

981
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,730
This is so difficult.

982
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,099
If we can't do it, we should have one of the students...

983
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,199
give it a try.

984
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,269
That's right.

985
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,939
- She's good. - Me.

986
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,239
- Are you good? - Tae Kyung is good.

987
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,639
- I think she'll be good. - Tae Kyung is good.

988
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,779
- She said she's good. - Are you good, Tae Kyung?

989
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,379
Let's use one of the coupons now.

990
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,449
- Tae Kyung. - You play Level Four.

991
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,719
- I'll do it. - Let's go.

992
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,149
I'll step out.

993
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,549
Levels 1, 2, and 3 are good.

994
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,659
You can do Level Four.

995
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,259
- Let's go! - Let's go!

996
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,420
The bonus coupon.

997
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,759
- We have to be quick. - Also, when you step forward,

998
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,530
- move faster. - Okay, I'll move faster.

999
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,130
- Don't take your time, got it? - Okay.

1000
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,000
We can't waste any time.

1001
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,869
- Okay. - I'm so nervous.

1002
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,569
- Give me the coupon. - Do you understand?

1003
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,846
- Do you get it? - You're so competitive.

1004
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,370
Yes, we have to speed up.

1005
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,310
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1006
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Let's go!

1007
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:30,110
(She's so happy.)

1008
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,080
We have to get those tumblers.

1009
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,250
Ready. Set.

1010
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,750
Please.

1011
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,589
That's good. Good job.

1012
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,589
- Deok Hwan is good. - He's gotten better.

1013
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,590
This is good.

1014
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:43,289
(Level 2)

1015
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,360
Good.

1016
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,630
- That was good. - Okay.

1017
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,070
Tae Kyung.

1018
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,270
Let's go.

1019
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,729
Why did you miss that?

1020
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,039
(Gasping)

1021
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,440
Goodness.

1022
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,469
(He struggles in front of his fan.)

1023
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,540
That was good.

1024
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,079
- That was good. - Okay.

1025
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,209
Five seconds.

1026
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,679
(They only have 5 seconds left.)

1027
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,209
- Okay. - That's good.

1028
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,310
No, please.

1029
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,380
- Three, two... - Please.

1030
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,680
Toss and catch.

1031
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,019
(They fail in the coupon round.)

1032
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,619
- You did a good job. - That was good.

1033
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,360
- Good job. - Good job.

1034
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,959
There wasn't enough time.

1035
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,589
- He high-fived me twice. - This is difficult.

1036
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,730
It's too difficult.

1037
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,429
- Tae Kyung. - Thirty seconds is too short.

1038
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,869
Should we use the other bonus coupon?

1039
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,369
I'll give my friend a chance.

1040
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,669
- Okay. - Who?

1041
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,270
- Go, Chae Won. - What if I can't do it?

1042
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,109
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1043
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,269
(Bonus coupon round)

1044
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,270
(However...)

1045
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:32,309
- You can try again. - Three,

1046
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,910
- Please. - two, one.

1047
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,579
(It was close, but she fails.)

1048
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,550
- This is difficult. - It's okay.

1049
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,920
It's okay.

1050
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,250
(Singing)

1051
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,819
(Their 2 coupons disappeared in a blink.)

1052
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,819
- This is difficult. My hand aches. - Gosh.

1053
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,990
(His face has become gaunt.)

1054
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,430
(Sighing)

1055
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,090
This is annoying.

1056
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,729
- This is... - You surprisingly get nervous.

1057
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,770
I'm so nervous right now.

1058
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,669
Do you want to try the toss and catch?

1059
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,740
The toss and catch?

1060
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,770
Why are your hands shaking?

1061
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,739
- I want to twist my wrist. - He's bad at Level Four.

1062
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,300
- Why can't I do this? - You know what?

1063
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,809
We have no choice. Either Yeon Seok or I have to do it.

1064
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,820
That's right.

1065
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,789
I think this will work.

1066
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,620
(He suddenly becomes skilled.)

1067
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,819
- You do it. - You go last.

1068
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,919
- You go first. - This sometimes happens.

1069
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,430
Yoo One Shot is here.

1070
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,659
- I'll do Level 2. You do Level 3. - I'll do Level 1.

1071
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,230
- This is our fifth try. - Okay.

1072
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,659
- Let's go. - We used all our bonus coupons.

1073
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,169
We don't need to cheer. Let's quickly get to it.

1074
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,570
- Okay. - Go ahead.

1075
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,739
Let's go!

1076
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,839
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1077
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,440
In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.

1078
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,069
Ready. Set.

1079
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:42,079
(Level 1)

1080
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,810
That was nice and fast.

1081
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,050
Split them.

1082
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
"Split them."

1083
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:48,119
- Okay. - Please.

1084
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,589
- Please. - Please.

1085
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,850
(They quickly clear 2 levels.)

1086
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,919
- Okay. - Please.

1087
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,189
- That was fast. - Awesome.

1088
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,059
(Level 3)

1089
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,189
- Nice. - We have enough time.

1090
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,200
We have enough time.

1091
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,830
We have enough time.

1092
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,300
- Slow down. - Slow down.

1093
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,029
- We have enough time. - Slow down.

1094
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,300
- Slow down. - Slow down.

1095
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,839
(Toss and catch 5 stones)

1096
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,809
- We have enough time. - Slow down.

1097
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,870
Do it slowly.

1098
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,510
(He got all five!)

1099
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,120
(Yeon Seok did it!)

1100
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
You got this.

1101
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,990
(They clear Round 1!)

1102
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,060
(Screaming)

1103
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
(Screaming)

1104
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,670
We did it!

1105
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,270
- You did it. - That was great.

1106
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,410
Do it slowly.

1107
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,010
(He catches it in one clean move.)

1108
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,479
We did it.

1109
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,020
(An upper body celebration)

1110
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,690
All right.

1111
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,329
- Tae Kyung and her friends... - No way.

1112
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,789
Get seven tumblers!

1113
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,030
(They won 7 tumblers.)

1114
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,399
- I have that one big blow. - That was so nerve-racking.

1115
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,699
(Yoo One Shot is back.)

1116
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,169
- Uncle. - You've got that one shot.

1117
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,270
That one shot.

1118
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,540
(Touched)

1119
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,470
That was a tough one.

1120
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,540
- That was tough. - Well done.

1121
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,549
And we bought him more time in the previous turns.

1122
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,950
We did.

1123
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,080
- "Split them." - Yes, split them.

1124
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,249
- We had to split them. - "Split them."

1125
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,090
We can go for Round Two.

1126
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,289
- We have five tries remaining. - What do we do?

1127
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,359
- Let's stop. - So, discuss it among yourselves.

1128
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,129
- We're happy to stop here. - Yes.

1129
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,259
- I... - I want the next prize.

1130
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,399
- Guys. - They're happy to stop, so...

1131
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,029
- No! - No, I mean,

1132
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,199
- let's do it. - We didn't have them...

1133
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,639
- in the first place. - Let's go for it.

1134
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,039
- Yes, let's go for it. - You saw how difficult that was.

1135
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,639
- Yes. - That's what I'm saying.

1136
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,769
- Have you come to an agreement? - Yes.

1137
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,639
- Yes. - In 1, 2, 3.

1138
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
- Go! - Go!

1139
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,209
- Good luck! - You can do it!

1140
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,980
(We're in trouble.)

1141
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,219
- My hands are trembling. - Right?

1142
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,520
It's a huge pressure. Look at how her hands are shaking.

1143
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
- Jung Eun's hands are shaking. - Oh, no.

1144
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,490
Let's check out the prizes for Round Two.

1145
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,259
"Comfortable yet trendy."

1146
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,329
"I need something to go with the Y2K fashion trend."

1147
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,929
"Seven Adidas jackets."

1148
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,640
(7 Adidas jackets)

1149
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,970
(Screaming)

1150
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,940
(Explosive response)

1151
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,739
Seriously?

1152
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,310
- We definitely need this. - Please.

1153
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,280
- Seven jackets? - Please.

1154
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,250
Please!

1155
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,579
(They can't stop cheering.)

1156
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,689
Seven jackets?

1157
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,389
(Feeling the pressure)

1158
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,990
- It's what idols wear. - That's...

1159
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,820
- the most popular these days. - I know!

1160
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,129
What?

1161
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,650
- It's at the top of the list. - This?

1162
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,799
- Is it? - It's at the top of the list.

1163
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
- Please win. - Please.

1164
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,929
- We're in trouble. - Please.

1165
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,369
- But this is... - Please.

1166
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,100
- Please. - Good luck!

1167
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,539
- We desperately need them. - We do.

1168
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,709
- What's next? We don't have time. - What's Round Two?

1169
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,739
(Round 2)

1170
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,909
(The same as Round 1)

1171
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,650
(But the first gonggi stone is designated in advance.)

1172
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,020
You must always begin with the stone in a different color.

1173
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,719
- That has to be the 1st one. - Oh, doing this 1st?

1174
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Yes.

1175
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,419
- We have to start with that? - Yes.

1176
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,689
- This is tricky. - And we get 30 seconds?

1177
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,559
- No matter how it's placed... - It's the same 30 seconds?

1178
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,589
We need at least a minute.

1179
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,759
But it's pretty simple.

1180
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Guys.

1181
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,799
Don't even think about going for Round Three.

1182
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,070
- Okay. - I beg you.

1183
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,499
- We'll stop here. - This is it.

1184
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,539
This is amazing.

1185
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,109
A jersey and a tumbler, and you're good.

1186
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,539
- Yes. - Yes.

1187
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,609
(A dramatic agreement)

1188
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,639
We don't even have much time. This is our sixth try.

1189
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,980
The 6th try of Round 2.

1190
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,409
In 1, 2, 3.

1191
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,679
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1192
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,809
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

1193
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,120
Ready. Set.

1194
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,589
Great.

1195
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,989
(Level 1)

1196
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,760
It's fine.

1197
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,130
- We have to take it slow. - He's good.

1198
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,359
- We have to start with that. - It's the same game.

1199
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,029
But it's tougher as we have to start with this.

1200
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,230
No, it's the same as before.

1201
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,229
(They're going fast.)

1202
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,500
It's tricky.

1203
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,220
You always have to start with the pink one.

1204
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,510
- Try again. - Okay.

1205
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,670
- That was good. - That looks pretty good.

1206
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,680
- There. - Please.

1207
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,610
- Get that one first. - Yes.

1208
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,280
- Please. - Please!

1209
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,619
Oh, no.

1210
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,749
(Level 4)

1211
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,050
Come on.

1212
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,390
- Good. - One more time.

1213
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,359
- One more time. Take your time. - Three, two, one.

1214
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,459
(Toss and catch 5)

1215
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,929
- So close. - You can do it.

1216
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,529
- Keep this momentum going. - Yes.

1217
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,530
You've got this!

1218
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,369
Do you have something to dry my sweat?

1219
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,439
Would you like it?

1220
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,816
- It's too nerve-racking. - The powder.

1221
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,770
- Do you mean rosin? - What do I do?

1222
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,380
It's okay.

1223
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,690
- You don't sound okay. - But it's...

1224
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,949
I should just do it. Let's start.

1225
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,080
- Good luck. - Yes.

1226
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,080
It's our eighth try now.

1227
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,790
We have three tries left.

1228
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,989
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1229
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,759
(As always, Deok Hwan goes 1st.)

1230
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,459
- We need to make it fast. - Here I go!

1231
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,289
- Ready. - But it's hard.

1232
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,989
(Level 1)

1233
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,160
- It's okay. - All right.

1234
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,399
He's got it.

1235
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,459
(Level 1)

1236
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,799
- Oh, no. - He's nervous.

1237
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,569
- It's tricky. - Slowly.

1238
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,669
It's all right.

1239
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,139
(Level 1)

1240
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,369
(Level 2)

1241
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,410
Go.

1242
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,520
I have to use this, right?

1243
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,709
(They passed Level 2.)

1244
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,609
- This one? - Take your time.

1245
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,750
This one?

1246
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,220
- You got it. - Yes.

1247
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,189
- Great. - Well done.

1248
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,089
We've got this. It's simple.

1249
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,420
- Five seconds! - Simple.

1250
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,029
- Five seconds! - Catch them.

1251
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,289
- Just one toss. - Yes.

1252
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,300
Three...

1253
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,830
(To be continued)

1254
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,670
- Five seconds! - Catch them.

1255
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,799
- Just one toss. - Yes.

1256
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,840
Three...

1257
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,810
(Is Yoo One Shot coming back again?)

1258
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,470
Three, two...

1259
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,380
(It was a close fail.)

1260
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,750
Two...

1261
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,550
(Everyone drops to the floor.)

1262
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,019
- I'm doing well! - It's okay.

1263
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,289
- I'll turn out well! - It's okay.

1264
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,430
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1265
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,299
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1266
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,360
What do we do?

1267
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,069
- Now, we don't have much time. - We have to keep going.

1268
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,790
- We have two more tries. - Two more tries.

1269
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,940
Let's do this.

1270
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,869
- Let's do this. - Let's...

1271
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,639
- get them those jackets. - Please.

1272
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,140
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1273
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,150
In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.

1274
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,380
Ready.

1275
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,219
(Level 1)

1276
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,889
That was good, Deok Hwan. You've got such delicate hands.

1277
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,890
(Level 2)

1278
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:34,719
- That was great. - You touched it.

1279
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,760
Which one?

1280
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,130
Gosh.

1281
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,229
Please.

1282
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,870
(It's important to save time in Level 2.)

1283
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
(He even makes a mistake in splitting the stones.)

1284
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,739
Oh, please.

1285
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,610
- I can do this. Yes. - That's so funny.

1286
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,210
We've got it.
(Level 3)

1287
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:54,439
That was hard. She's got it.

1288
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,209
(Level 3)

1289
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,680
Oh, please.

1290
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,049
Let's make it this time.

1291
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,119
(Level 4)

1292
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,249
Let's make it this time.

1293
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,320
Five seconds.

1294
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,290
Three, two, one.

1295
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,229
I wasted too much time.

1296
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,330
(Failure)

1297
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,359
Is this our last attempt?

1298
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,070
(They're on their last attempt now.)

1299
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,630
- We're running out of time. - Liven up the mood.

1300
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,599
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1301
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,399
(They're not even in sync when cheering.)

1302
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,540
- It's our last attempt. - It's actually okay.

1303
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,739
- Simple. - Look at him.

1304
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,579
- One minute remaining! - Okay.

1305
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,810
Do you want to go last?

1306
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,550
- One minute remaining? - Yes.

1307
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,849
We should start now.

1308
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,280
Let's leave it up to fate.

1309
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,450
Hold on.

1310
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,490
(What?)

1311
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,159
- Do you want to go last? - Go last.

1312
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,329
Okay. He'll go last.

1313
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,459
Please.

1314
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,859
Wish us luck. This is our last try!

1315
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,470
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1316
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,829
- Good luck. - Please.

1317
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,570
- Get their energy. - Huddle up.

1318
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,399
In 1, 2, 3.

1319
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,570
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1320
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,569
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

1321
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,809
- We're running out of time. - Ready.

1322
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,880
Set.

1323
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,339
Please.

1324
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,980
- We desperately need them. - We need them!

1325
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,379
- We're running out of time. - Ready.

1326
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,380
Set.

1327
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,919
(Level 1)

1328
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,019
Okay.

1329
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,129
(Level 2)

1330
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,130
Great.

1331
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,460
That was good. Well done.

1332
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,060
Great.

1333
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,069
(They're going pretty fast.)

1334
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,130
Great.

1335
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,969
(Praying)

1336
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:26,999
Go.

1337
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,009
(Level 3)

1338
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,639
(Yoo Jae Suk and Yoo Yeon Seok)

1339
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,680
Great.

1340
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,310
Darn it.

1341
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,350
Great.

1342
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,519
(Level 4)

1343
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,480
(Last 10 seconds)

1344
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,790
He's got this. Hold on.

1345
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,190
Okay. Please.

1346
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,959
(Level 4)

1347
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,760
- I have to start with this, right? - Please.

1348
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,629
(Toss and catch 5)

1349
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,930
He's going to make it.

1350
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,880
(He caught them!)

1351
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:13,680
(Jae Suk delivers the finishing blow with 1 second left!)

1352
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,850
(Jae Suk!)

1353
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,060
(A thrilling buzzer beater)

1354
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,660
(It's hard to believe this miraculous success.)

1355
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,370
(He gently gathered the stones.)

1356
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,840
(Jae Suk is the hero!)

1357
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,450
(A dramatic finish)

1358
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
We did it!

1359
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,719
(He returns triumphantly.)

1360
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,159
To the students,

1361
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,720
we present the jackets and tumblers!

1362
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,889
(They won the tumblers and jackets.)

1363
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,930
- Yoo Jae Suk! - Yoo Jae Suk!

1364
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,800
- Yoo Jae Suk! - Yoo Jae Suk!

1365
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,070
- Yoo Jae Suk! - Yoo Jae Suk!

1366
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,800
Jae Suk, the way you gathered them was a work of art.

1367
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,140
Definitely.

1368
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,539
Their class is starting soon, so we need to leave.

1369
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,739
Guys, we hope you fulfill your dreams.

1370
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,809
Thank you for joining us.

1371
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,450
(We hope all of you fulfill your dreams.)

1372
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,949
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

1373
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,120
Thank you so much.

1374
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,880
- Goodbye. - Congratulations.

1375
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,789
You even have me as your wallpaper!

1376
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,819
I do.

1377
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,889
- I'll take the photo. - Okay.

1378
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,220
(Her wallpaper)

1379
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,789
- Thank you. Bye. - Thank you.

1380
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,776
(The moment with her favorite star was like a dream.)

1381
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,499
- Rock-paper-scissors for the color? - Yes.

1382
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,346
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1383
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,640
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1384
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,700
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Wait.

1385
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,309
- Ready. Start. - Ready. Start.

1386
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,409
Whenever possible, sundae gukbap!

1387
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,350
(Whenever possible, sundae gukbap!)

1388
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,380
That was impressive.

1389
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,720
- You look so different. - Jung Eun.

1390
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,020
Jung Eun.

1391
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,689
How did you stay so calm...

1392
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,089
- How did you... - in the end?

1393
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,760
And he gathered them like this.

1394
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,619
(They're still in awe.)

1395
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,129
- That was... - It's a thrill, isn't it?

1396
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,229
This is pretty fun.

1397
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,459
(Giggling)

1398
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,259
- It's a thrill, right? - Indeed.

1399
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,330
(Screaming)

1400
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,730
Let's go!

1401
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,070
Hi.

1402
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,609
Goodbye.

1403
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,290
(They greet him like he's an idol singer.)

1404
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,779
Hi, everyone.

1405
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,809
(Everyone's happy to go home today.)

1406
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,450
- Goodbye. - Hi.

1407
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,080
Thank you.

1408
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,849
- You're my juniors. - I watch your show.

1409
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,950
Thank you.

1410
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,550
Study hard.

1411
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,219
- Yeon Seok! - Good luck on your CSAT!

1412
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,389
- Thank you. - Good luck!

1413
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,520
Good luck.

1414
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,890
Deok Hwan,

1415
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,000
- you started it so stably. - Oh, no.

1416
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,360
He's flattering me.

1417
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,369
- You were amazing. - That was...

1418
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:46,599
- How did you stay so calm? - He was...

1419
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,939
Yoo One Shot just now.

1420
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,000
Indeed.

1421
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,639
- I feel so proud, though. - So do I.

1422
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,309
I kept telling myself, "This isn't a game,"

1423
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,549
when I played it.

1424
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,779
"This is not a game."

1425
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,049
(She hasn't felt this nervous in a long time.)

1426
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,820
How do you do this every week?

1427
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,719
- That was so... - That was...

1428
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,289
- so nerve-racking. - Also,

1429
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,419
we have to go there.

1430
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,759
- Namdo Gukbap. - Namdo Gukbap.

1431
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,960
- It's open for 24 hours. - Where's Namdo Gukbap?

1432
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,729
I think it's on the main street.

1433
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,399
By the way, the energy...

1434
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,099
that this academic district gives off...

1435
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,199
- It's different. - So different.

1436
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,639
- It certainly feels different. - It does.

1437
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,369
Back in the day,

1438
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,509
- I couldn't wait to grow up. - Same.

1439
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,769
How old were you when you thought that?

1440
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,909
I was in high school.

1441
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,909
- You wanted to be an adult. - I couldn't wait.

1442
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,910
- Same. - Right.

1443
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:30,010
What about now?

1444
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,120
Now, I wish I could stay like this.

1445
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,219
- And stay healthy. - I'm at the perfect state.

1446
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,319
- It's perfect overall. - It's perfect right now.

1447
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,360
- Without getting sick. - It's perfect.

1448
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,029
I see it over there.

1449
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,359
- "Namdo Gukbap." - I think we're almost there.

1450
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,530
- I see it. - There it is!

1451
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,699
Hello.

1452
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,899
(This is the gukbap place of the high school girls.)

1453
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,620
The popular place for high school students.

1454
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,439
It smells...

1455
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,570
- It's so good. - Right?

1456
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,170
Take a seat.

1457
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,539
It smells...

1458
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,709
(The smell of gukbap)

1459
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,080
But this place is frequented by students?

1460
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,050
(It's quite homely.)

1461
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,519
Students these days love gukbap.

1462
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,650
- That's bizarre. - Yes.

1463
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,049
Do your children like it?

1464
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,650
Yes, Ji Ho loves gukbap.

1465
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,589
They go to gukbap places by themselves.

1466
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,760
They must enjoy it.

1467
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,560
Thank you.

1468
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,660
Do you have any wet wipes?

1469
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:21,800
That...

1470
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,800
- The kimchi looks scrumptious. - Look at the color.

1471
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,300
They especially praised this kimchi.

1472
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,540
I wonder how good it is for them to recommend it.

1473
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,179
(Trying a piece of kkakdugi first)

1474
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,280
It's sweet.

1475
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,710
They have good kkakdugi.

1476
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,250
It's sweet.

1477
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,049
(The cabbage kimchi is also good.)

1478
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,549
I see why they love this kimchi.

1479
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,459
- It's nice and sweet. - Yes.

1480
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,489
(It's addictive as it's sweet.)

1481
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,789
You can give it to them first.

1482
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,430
- You have to keep trying. - That's true.

1483
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,099
Is this sundae?

1484
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,199
(Jae Suk picked sundae gukbap just like the students recommended.)

1485
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,299
Suyuk.

1486
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,600
(The rest of them chose hot suyuk gukbap.)

1487
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,970
Let's give it a taste.

1488
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,740
It feels...

1489
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
It already smells good, right?

1490
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,250
The gukbap place recommended by the students.

1491
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,250
It's their favorite, after all.

1492
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,520
It's been so long since I last had gukbap.

1493
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,420
It's been so long.

1494
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,490
(Eating a piece of kkakdugi right afterward)

1495
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,100
It must relieve their stress.

1496
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
(Exclaiming)

1497
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,600
- It's very delicious. - Yes.

1498
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,110
Now I get why they mentioned sundae gukbap.

1499
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,420
(Crunchy)

1500
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,120
(The Daughter of Hanyang is in love with kkakdugi.)

1501
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,259
- Ma'am, can we have more kkakdugi? - Sure.

1502
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,929
- It's so good. - You have delicious kimchi.

1503
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,060
It's so tasty.

1504
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,730
You eat so well today.

1505
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,530
I think...

1506
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,170
she tried to hold herself back at first.

1507
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,000
But as she was eating,

1508
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,610
she got into the zone.

1509
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,880
- I can't stop eating this kkakdugi. - Jung Eun.

1510
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,880
You ate so much kkakdugi.

1511
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,949
I keep going back for it as it's sweet.

1512
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,179
- I see... - I see why they like it.

1513
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,050
- why the young ones like it. - Yes.

1514
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,150
I did wonder earlier.

1515
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,660
Does it make you feel good when people call you, "Uncle?"

1516
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,359
You still prefer "brother," right?

1517
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,030
A few years back, there was a post...

1518
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,100
dividing the celebrities...

1519
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,270
- into uncles and brothers. - Yes.

1520
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:43,939
I think...

1521
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,969
(I was clearly a brother back then.)

1522
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,540
I was a brother.

1523
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,380
But it's been a year.

1524
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,810
What?

1525
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,450
This year, I'll be categorized as an uncle.

1526
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,450
- I should accept it now. - Of course.

1527
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,220
I was looking at you earlier,

1528
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,690
and you weren't looking at the choco pies.

1529
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,460
You were looking at the word "uncle."

1530
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,589
I wasn't the only one who felt it.

1531
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,760
Yes, you saw it, right?

1532
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,859
He's at that age.

1533
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,600
That's not true.

1534
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,129
Do they call you "mister?"

1535
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,569
- Mister, Uncle... - Uncle?

1536
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,039
They also call you "brother," right?

1537
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,610
Sometimes.

1538
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,470
But I thought I'd look strange...

1539
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,480
to seem too glad to hear it.

1540
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,180
So, I keep it moderate.

1541
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,179
Like, "I get what you mean."

1542
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,410
(Keeping a straight face)

1543
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,490
But men, no matter how young they are,

1544
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,290
- say, "Brother!" - Right.

1545
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,089
- We're always brothers. - Yes.

1546
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,290
They always call us that.

1547
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,760
When they're a bit older,

1548
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:39,329
you should call them "big brother."

1549
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,459
- Right. - "Big brother."

1550
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,329
And to be more polite to the older ladies,

1551
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,569
- you call them "big sister." - "Big sister."

1552
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,669
I don't like "big sister."

1553
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,300
(She hates it.)

1554
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,969
- No? - No.

1555
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,010
- I prefer "sister." - "Sister."

1556
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,840
What do you think about "madam?"

1557
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,340
Someone called Eun I a madam when we were filming.

1558
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,079
- Seriously? - Yes.

1559
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,109
Really?

1560
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,350
Like, "It's Madam Song Eun I."

1561
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,919
(They finished their gukbap in no time.)

1562
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,690
It gets even more addictive in the end.

1563
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,019
I ate so much.

1564
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,259
- We have... - Should we get going?

1565
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,529
It's 2:30 p.m.

1566
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,029
Where is it?

1567
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,729
- I thought we were having a bet. - Yes.

1568
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,300
No, I'll pay.

1569
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,200
- We won today. - You're paying?

1570
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,299
- I'll pay. Go ahead. - She brought her wallet too.

1571
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,769
I did. You didn't?

1572
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,509
- I did, but... - I did, but...

1573
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,869
- I can pay. - Let's get going.

1574
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,909
- Go. - Shall we?

1575
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,580
(It's on the Daughter of Hanyang!)

1576
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,379
High school students recommended this place, so we came.

1577
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,750
- High school students? - Yes, Hanyang High School.

1578
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,790
- Really? - Please treat them well later.

1579
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,989
- I will. - Thank you.

1580
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,220
Thank you for the food.

1581
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,519
- It's a varsity jacket. - Are you from Hanyang University?

1582
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,589
- Hello. - I was also a theater major.

1583
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,289
I entered in 1988. What year did you enter?

1584
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,899
- We entered in 2025. - In 2025.

1585
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,699
- In 2025? - Yes. In 2025.

1586
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,199
- I'll pay for their table! - She met her juniors.

1587
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,769
She's treating her juniors?

1588
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,870
Gosh.

1589
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,310
- This is why we make money. - You bet.

1590
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,040
Those four.

1591
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,440
- Enjoy your food. - Bye.

1592
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,979
- Careful. - You're so cool.

1593
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,180
I am!

1594
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,679
- Thank you for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1595
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,166
- No, the pleasure was mine. - Thank you.

1596
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,020
Today,

1597
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,590
Wealthy Jung Eun...

1598
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,959
- paid for everything. - Yes.

1599
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,059
We're at Hanyang University, after all.

1600
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,159
Yes, we are.

1601
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,429
This is my area.

1602
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,899
- Hanyang University is her area. - Right.

1603
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,300
I don't think I can come back here.

1604
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,699
This is her town.

1605
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,900
Where should we go next?

1606
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,340
Kim Bang Seop and Lee Ok Hui.

1607
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,510
"Whenever possible, the husband plays the harmonica,"

1608
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,810
"and the wife writes poems."

1609
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,380
"We're the Chief Couple..."

1610
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,949
"that sells luck in Majang-dong.

1611
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,549
"We fell in love because of the voice,"

1612
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,720
"and we ended up saving each other's lives."

1613
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,289
"Would you like to listen to our love story..."

1614
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,989
"that's like the lottery?"

1615
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,129
- Shall we go? - That must be nice.

1616
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,630
We should take the bus, right?

1617
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,530
I think we can take it here.

1618
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,059
- Bus 121. - Over here?

1619
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,200
- Bus 121? - Yes.

1620
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,610
- Bus 121 arrives in 3 minutes. - At Majang Station.

1621
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,439
It arrives in three minutes.

1622
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,570
You're well-informed.

1623
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,539
- That used to be my role. - I see.

1624
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,879
- You're good at this. - Leave it to the youngest.

1625
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,309
- Right. - Let me handle it.

1626
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,409
You're so good.

1627
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,519
Bus 121. This is the one.

1628
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,880
- It comes from Hwagyesa Temple. - Yes.

1629
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,749
Do you want to sit down?

1630
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,019
- We check our phones, - Right.

1631
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,660
- and they check the map. - Oh, right.

1632
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,730
- We look it up on the app. - Yes.

1633
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,199
- And she checks the actual map. - The route map.

1634
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,329
The route map.

1635
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,669
I actually know the route of Bus 121.

1636
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,669
- How? - Because it's Hanyang University?

1637
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,339
My parents used to live in Majang-dong.

1638
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,639
(The Daughter of Hanyang even knows Majang-dong.)

1639
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,709
When we lived separately.

1640
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,809
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1641
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,079
- Thank you. - Gosh.

1642
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,709
- You have to tag the card. - I did.

1643
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,780
Hello.

1644
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,820
Wait. Which way should we go?

1645
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,120
- Give me a minute. - Let's check the address.
Go a bit farther.

1646
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,649
And we turn right.

1647
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,866
- Turn right after this? - Yes.

1648
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,089
- Wait. I think we're almost there. - We are.

1649
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,460
- But this is the address we got. - Isn't it this building?

1650
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,730
- It's here. - We're here.

1651
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,729
- Hold on. - This store?

1652
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,999
- The map says here. - We're here.

1653
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,730
- Here? - Someone's playing the harmonica.

1654
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,230
- Oh, my. - I think this is it.

1655
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,169
Hello.

1656
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,739
- Hello. - Hello. How are you?

1657
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,939
- Hi. How are you? - Hi.

1658
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,569
- Hello. - Thanks for coming.

1659
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,809
- Hello. - Nice to see you.

1660
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,739
- Mr. Kim Bang Seop? Ms. Lee Ok Hui? - Yes.

1661
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,780
- Yes. Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1662
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,849
- It's really nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1663
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,249
(Second Whenever Guests, Lee Ok Hui, Kim Bang Seop)

1664
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,749
- Nice to meet you. - Among all the places...

1665
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,090
we've been to, this place is...

1666
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,319
- the closest to a bus stop. - Yes. It's right by the bus stop.

1667
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,959
This is a station area.

1668
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,789
- You're right. - This is a real station area.

1669
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,529
Where can we sit down and talk?

1670
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,529
The bus stop is right there. It's really a station area.

1671
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,499
- It's very close. - I was really surprised.

1672
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,329
Unless you close your eyes, you can see it.

1673
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,600
Yes, you're right.

1674
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,369
Do you play the harmonica often?

1675
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,939
Yes, I play it quite often.

1676
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,340
You played it as if you had received a cue from someone.

1677
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,810
It made us find him so easily.

1678
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,950
- I was surprised. - I was surprised.

1679
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,420
So what is this place exactly?

1680
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:59,319
We're contributing to the sports business.

1681
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,459
- Sports lottery. - I see. Lottery tickets.

1682
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,559
(The couple runs a sports lottery shop.)

1683
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,329
- It's a lottery shop, right? - Yes.

1684
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,190
- Selling luck. - Also, cigarettes.

1685
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,360
Selling cigarettes?

1686
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,400
Right. I bet some need that.

1687
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,029
So, what time do you usually...

1688
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,339
close the shop?

1689
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,810
We open at 8am.

1690
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,909
We're supposed to open until 11pm.

1691
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,139
- At night? - Yes.

1692
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,679
We're supposed to sell Sports Toto until 11pm.

1693
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,779
But we can't stay that late.

1694
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,179
We open until 8pm.

1695
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,156
- We open it for 12 hours. - They work for 12 hours.

1696
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,090
Isn't today a busy day?

1697
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,950
Today is a slow day.

1698
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,619
- The busiest... - It's the slowest day.

1699
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,460
When is the busiest day?

1700
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,460
We don't have a particularly busy day.

1701
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,089
- What about during the rush hour? - Maybe weekends?

1702
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,059
It's because...

1703
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,199
- You don't have a busy day? - Sports Toto is...

1704
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,269
- When Son Heung Min plays. - Yes.

1705
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,539
- Or when Kim Min Jae plays. - Right.

1706
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,639
Those football games and baseball.

1707
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,969
- It's the baseball season. - That's right.

1708
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,239
- Since the games start at 6:30pm, - Right.

1709
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,709
We're busy only until 6:30pm.

1710
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,910
- After that, it's slow. - I see.

1711
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,849
So it depends on the game schedule.

1712
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,119
- Yes. - It varies with the seasons.

1713
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,620
- Yes, with the seasons. - I see.

1714
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,849
Who applied for this?

1715
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:06,890
I did.

1716
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,240
Since it's always just the two of us here,

1717
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,130
we need something exciting.

1718
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,400
It feels like today is tomorrow,

1719
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,999
- and tomorrow is the same as today. - And tomorrow is today.

1720
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,499
It's quite boring.

1721
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,599
So, I thought it'd be nice to spend time with celebrities.

1722
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,469
- I'm glad you did. - So I applied for it.

1723
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,209
I'm glad you did. Today, we also have Lee Jung Eun...

1724
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,610
and Deok Hwan.

1725
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,609
(Celebrity 1, Celebrity 2)

1726
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:32,409
We've run the shop in this very place for 30 years.

1727
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:33,949
- In this place? - Yes.

1728
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,319
That's why the floor looks like this.

1729
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,049
It's all worn out.

1730
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,590
- It's been 30 years? - Yes.

1731
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,619
It used to be a flower shop.

1732
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,659
- Really? - I see.

1733
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,559
I saw flowers there.

1734
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,160
I kept some of the flowers to show that it used to be a flower shop.

1735
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,269
What made you change your business?

1736
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,029
That was because...

1737
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,899
Because I had severe arthritis.

1738
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,339
- Because you worked with flowers? - Yes.

1739
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,670
That was the reason. Besides,

1740
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,780
- we're a married couple. - Yes.

1741
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,010
We're really one in body and soul.

1742
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,479
Let me give you a quiz. Why are we one in body and soul?

1743
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,680
- A quiz? - He gave us a quiz.

1744
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,020
(A quiz?)
You quiz?

1745
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,989
I'm sorry.

1746
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,720
- I'm on a different show. - It isn't that.

1747
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,990
Why is that?

1748
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,959
- I think I know. - What is it?

1749
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,989
They might've shared a part of their body?

1750
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,999
She's right.

1751
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,159
- Really? - I see.

1752
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,806
- Because he said one body. - How did you...

1753
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,899
- How did you know? - I just had a gut feeling.

1754
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,300
You're great.

1755
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,099
We had a liver transplant.

1756
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,269
Oh, my.

1757
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,039
I received it.

1758
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,239
- Oh, gosh. - Really?

1759
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,340
I was the donor.

1760
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,310
I suffered from late-stage cirrhosis for over ten years.

1761
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,850
I was brought to the emergency room with hepatic coma several times.

1762
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,689
So, my husband decided to do it...

1763
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,990
since he had seen me sick every day.

1764
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,919
Has it been 11 or 13 years?

1765
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,159
- It's been 12 and a half years. - Yes, he's right.

1766
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,890
He was almost in his 60s.

1767
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,230
So, the doctor didn't recommend it,

1768
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,530
although my husband wanted to.

1769
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,069
Because he would lose 70 percent of his liver.

1770
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,669
With only 30 percent of his liver, he could've failed...

1771
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,939
to recover and died.

1772
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,079
- It was dangerous. - He was too old.

1773
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,610
- I see. - Yes.

1774
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,879
I'm grateful for that.

1775
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,079
You're indeed one in body and soul.

1776
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,220
That's right.

1777
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,949
It's not easy at all...

1778
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,290
- to decide to do it. - Not at all.

1779
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,760
I'd rather live together for ten years...

1780
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,990
than live alone for 20 years.

1781
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,789
I've lived with that thought.

1782
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,430
Since it's been 12 and a half years,

1783
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,459
it's the same as living for 25 years if I double it.

1784
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,669
(Living twice as happily together)

1785
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,329
- This is great. - I'm so touched.

1786
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,100
We read your letter earlier.

1787
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,639
- It said you fell in love... - That's right.

1788
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,909
With each other because of the voice?

1789
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,779
What is the story about?

1790
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,539
That is...

1791
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,649
Please tell us.

1792
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,150
He became so shy.

1793
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,419
He's fidgeting with his hands.

1794
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,179
We worked for the same company.

1795
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,119
- We both worked at Nonghyup Bank. - Yes?

1796
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,759
- But in a different branch. - I see.

1797
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,759
So we worked over the phone back then.

1798
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,889
We got closer while we worked over the phone.

1799
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,560
When I got a call from the headquarters,

1800
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,430
I called the branch where she worked.

1801
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,299
- You talked on the phone for work. - It was for work.

1802
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,440
That's right.

1803
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,869
- Then, you fell for the voice? - Yes, I did.

1804
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,369
- And you fell in love with her? - Yes.

1805
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,939
It's like a drama.

1806
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,109
Who fell for whose voice?

1807
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,380
I fell for her voice.

1808
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,450
Did you ask her out?

1809
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,379
- He came to me. - Yes. I went to her.

1810
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,419
To the branch where she worked?

1811
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,420
- He came to me. - Yes. I went to her.

1812
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:23,889
- He went to find her? - To the branch where she worked?

1813
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:24,949
Yes.

1814
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,289
(Bang Seop fell for her voice and went to find her.)

1815
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:29,189
He said he came to me because he liked my voice,

1816
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,430
but something was wrong.

1817
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,059
What do you mean?

1818
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,230
He said it was a mistake.

1819
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,600
He said it was a mistake.

1820
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,669
He thought I was pretty because my voice was pretty.

1821
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,839
So he said he was fooled.

1822
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,640
You went to her only because of her voice.

1823
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:49,779
But still, you kept seeing her. I guess it was because...

1824
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,379
- you became interested in her. - I guess so.

1825
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,680
We talked on the phone every day.

1826
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,680
We talked on the phone several times a day.

1827
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,490
It was not that I wanted to.

1828
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,596
- When the headquarters called... - You didn't need to emphasize it.

1829
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,930
You shared the touching story earlier.

1830
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:05,689
- It's not what you think. - I was touched earlier.

1831
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,659
He started with the story about being one in body and soul.

1832
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,659
What I meant was that you grow attached...

1833
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,269
as you keep seeing.

1834
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,069
I grew attached to her as I kept seeing her.

1835
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,999
You play the harmonica as a hobby.

1836
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,209
I used to play the harmonica...

1837
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,639
when I was little.

1838
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,210
But I don't have sheet music,

1839
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,809
so I registered for classes at the community center.

1840
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,919
Then I learned from Kim Yu Seok,

1841
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,850
the teacher I mentioned.

1842
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,289
I even learned correct notes.

1843
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,120
She's been hesitating to do something.

1844
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,260
What is she getting?

1845
01:02:35,261 --> 01:02:36,689
I think she wants to give us something to drink.

1846
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,230
- Really? - I see.

1847
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,929
(Preparing welcome drinks)

1848
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,690
That's why she's been like that. Can I help?

1849
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,199
It's all right. Here you are.

1850
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,030
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1851
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,030
It's like a product placement.

1852
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,539
Son Heung Min is here.

1853
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,199
- Isn't it a product placement? - No.

1854
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,569
(I bought them with my own money.)

1855
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:52,969
- Thank you for the drink. - Thank you.

1856
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,409
- Please have one. - Thank you.

1857
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,939
I'll have water.

1858
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,849
If you don't mind,

1859
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:00,519
could you play any song that you learned?

1860
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,919
- Do you want me to play it? - Sure.

1861
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,279
There are two harmonicas.

1862
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,296
- We should listen to him play. - Either one is fine?

1863
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,989
"My Starry Love"

1864
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,059
"My Starry Love" has...

1865
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,289
lyrics...

1866
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,789
that relate to my life...

1867
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,260
- with my wife... - It'd suit your story.

1868
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,299
It is relatable.

1869
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,069
So I've played it a lot.

1870
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,869
- Do you need sheet music? - I don't need it, actually.

1871
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:21,999
- Did you memorize it? - He memorized it.

1872
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,140
Just in case.

1873
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,039
I saw your face, but you don't seem...

1874
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,910
to be happy that he plays the harmonica.

1875
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,049
He plays all day.

1876
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,779
- Because he plays all day? - So...

1877
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,950
I'm looking at her face, and I can tell...

1878
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,319
she's not that excited about it.

1879
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,519
It'd be better if we had...

1880
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,920
many customers and little spare time.

1881
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,089
But we have a customer once in a while.

1882
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,490
And the rest is all our spare time.

1883
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,199
- It's all their spare time. - I see.

1884
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,560
We have more spare time than work.

1885
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,799
- Do you? - Yes.

1886
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,299
He plays it whenever we have spare time.

1887
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,699
- So he plays it so many times? - Yes.

1888
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,299
So, he had to apply...

1889
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,039
- to our show. - I know.

1890
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,140
I have every reason to love this show.

1891
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,250
You both are great comedic storytellers.

1892
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,909
- Yes. - Don't you agree?

1893
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,670
- Let's listen to him play. - Let's hear it.

1894
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,260
He's good.

1895
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,499
(He practiced the harmonica in his spare time.)

1896
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,560
He's really good.

1897
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,700
He's good.

1898
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,719
(How precious)

1899
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,089
(You are to me.)

1900
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,020
- He's really good. - He is.

1901
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:54,860
(Now that the years have passed, I think I understand)

1902
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,670
(Glancing)

1903
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,400
(Chuckling)

1904
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,069
Do you want it to be over quickly?

1905
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,210
(Caught red-handed)

1906
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,640
(Continuing to play)

1907
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,250
(Suddenly pretending to be excited)

1908
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,750
They're fun.

1909
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,489
(The serenade of the lover in Majang-dong has finished.)

1910
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,559
- It was great. - He was really good.

1911
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,189
You were really good.

1912
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,559
He was so good.

1913
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,599
(Not perfect, but heartfelt playing)

1914
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,029
It was great.

1915
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:33,400
Her reaction was quite memorable.

1916
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,399
- She was... - She sang along too.

1917
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,970
How was it for you?

1918
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,410
I listen to it every day.

1919
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,879
- You listen to it every day. - I like it.

1920
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,079
Although you like it, listening to it...

1921
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,449
all day is a bit...

1922
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,750
- She could be tired of it. - I see.

1923
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,220
She could be.

1924
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:52,349
I play the harmonica,

1925
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,959
but also do something for her.

1926
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,019
- I take several people in my car. - In your van.

1927
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,329
Every week,

1928
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,459
she goes to Inje on Mondays.

1929
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,506
- Inje, Gangwon Province? - Yes, to Inje, Gangwon Province.

1930
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:02,860
She goes there to study poetry.

1931
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,270
- So you write poems. - Oh, right. It was in the letter.

1932
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:07,969
- You write poems. - Yes.

1933
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,599
- So you said you write poems. - That's right.

1934
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,409
When I was young, I entered writing contests.

1935
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:16,180
I liked to read and write poems for fun.

1936
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,749
- But after the liver transplant, - Goodness.

1937
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,279
I thought I should leave at least one thing in this world.

1938
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,780
It's my second life, so...

1939
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,289
Since then, I started to write them seriously.

1940
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:27,089
You're like Ae Sun in "When Life Gives you Tangerines."

1941
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,119
- Gosh. - That's right.

1942
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,459
- Ae Sun in real life. - Seriously.

1943
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,159
They are like Ae Sun and Gwan Sik.

1944
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,290
- You're right. - Yes.

1945
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,559
- That's true. - Right.

1946
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,529
Can you show us one of your poems?

1947
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,160
- Well, they are... - Okay.

1948
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,769
The ones here...

1949
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,669
- You have a book? - My goodness.

1950
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,199
- So these books are... - The poems you wrote are in it.

1951
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,439
- You published them. - They are translated...

1952
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,069
into different languages.

1953
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,379
They were published.

1954
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,609
It was published, and they were translated into different languages.

1955
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,809
It was translated.

1956
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,449
- They're in different languages. - I see.

1957
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,450
That's number 1, and there are a total of 5 books.

1958
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,749
When we play the game today,

1959
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,049
I hope we can give them...

1960
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,389
- a lot of presents. - Right.

1961
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,666
- All right. Deok Hwan will do it. - It's Deok Hwan's turn.

1962
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:02,119
I noticed that there's only a single two on this dice.

1963
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,059
- Yes. And she got that. - Right.

1964
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,159
- Seriously. - Yes.

1965
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,590
Okay. I'll roll it then.

1966
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,629
- One. - Okay.

1967
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:12,369
- That's not bad. - This is good.

1968
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:13,499
- We got one, at least. - Right.

1969
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,540
Let's see what we will do today.

1970
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,550
- What will the present be? - Let's see what it is.

1971
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,639
"Whenever possible, I enjoy my hobby."

1972
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,010
- "I'd like to..." - "I'd like to have this equipment."

1973
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,579
- "Vineta harmonica." - "Vineta harmonica?"

1974
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,819
- Okay. - Goodness.

1975
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,119
- It's a harmonica. - Gosh.

1976
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,589
- A harmonica? - It's a harmonica.

1977
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,649
(He becomes happy right away.)

1978
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,860
It's a Vineta harmonica.

1979
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:36,860
I wanted to get this one.

1980
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,060
- Really? - For real.

1981
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:40,389
Because his harmonica is old.

1982
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,499
It's a famous harmonica.

1983
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,759
- It's so big. - Yes.

1984
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,769
- It's like two harmonicas. - What is this?

1985
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:47,029
- It has the bass too, right? - That's right.

1986
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,239
- This is interesting. - Yes.

1987
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,400
- What's this? - It must be hard to play this.

1988
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,269
We'll get this only if you succeed, right?

1989
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,569
- Right. If we succeed. - Yes.

1990
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,709
- We need to play the game well. - All right.

1991
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,879
- We must do well. - The game we'll play is...

1992
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,040
the important thing here.

1993
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,149
(Lucky Human Zero)

1994
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:00,150
(Round 1)

1995
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:04,790
(You win if you avoid the number called out between 0 and 4.)

1996
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,689
- You need to stand up. - We need to avoid that number.

1997
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,389
- It's a 0 game. - If you win 4 times in a row,

1998
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,459
- you succeed. - Four times in a row?

1999
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,519
Goodness.

2000
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,459
The success rate is about 40 percent.

2001
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,259
So it's a zero if all of us are sitting down.

2002
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,559
Right. You need to avoid the number I call out.

2003
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,599
- We need to avoid it. - Avoid the number.

2004
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,099
- We need to avoid that number... - Right.

2005
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,429
- for four times in a row. - We need to avoid it.

2006
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,640
If he calls out 3, we need to get 2 or something.

2007
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,139
It's 0 to 4, right?

2008
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,939
- We can't plan in this game. - No.

2009
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,170
- We can't. - Right.

2010
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,139
- It's pure luck. - Let's begin the first round.

2011
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,179
To win the harmonica, let's do a cheer first.

2012
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,849
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2013
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,620
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

2014
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,219
(They need to avoid the number the director calls out and stand up.)

2015
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,350
I should close my eyes.

2016
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,190
In 1, 2, 3.

2017
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:44,360
One!

2018
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,589
- We got two. - Thank you.

2019
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,689
(First try)

2020
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,530
Thank you, Jung Eun.

2021
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,669
- We got one. - One win.

2022
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,999
We need to do this four times in a row.

2023
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,540
We need three more to go.

2024
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:56,940
Ready.

2025
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,839
In one, two, three. Three!

2026
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,479
(First try)

2027
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,779
- You need to be determined. - Great job holding back.

2028
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,409
- You need to be determined. - I held back well.

2029
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:07,519
- I didn't want to get up. - You need to be determined.

2030
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,320
You need to make up your mind before he goes.

2031
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,689
In one, two, three. One!

2032
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:16,459
(First try)

2033
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,730
- Jung Eun. - Hold on.

2034
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,589
One more win, and we pass Round One?

2035
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,590
- All right. - Just one more win.

2036
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:22,459
- One more win. - If we avoid it one more time,

2037
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,759
- he'll get the harmonica. - We'll win the harmonica.

2038
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,069
- Gosh, this is... - We might be able to...

2039
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,129
advance to Round Three.

2040
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,130
Right.

2041
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,440
Round One is...

2042
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,810
(They got this golden opportunity on their first try.)

2043
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,840
(Will they succeed in their first try?)

2044
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,780
In one, two, three. Two!

2045
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,080
Gosh, I wanted to get up!

2046
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,380
Two!

2047
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:45,190
(Gosh, I wanted to get up!)

2048
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,889
- Gosh. - I should've stood up.

2049
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,059
I thought he'd call out zero.

2050
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,489
- I thought, "This time..." - I had this feeling that...

2051
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,859
Gosh, what a shame.

2052
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,659
I didn't stand up that much.

2053
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,699
- This is... Goodness. - You clearly stood up.

2054
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,199
I had this feeling that he'd call out zero.

2055
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,539
That's why I got up.

2056
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,310
They stood up so passionately.

2057
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,109
- I wanted to get up. - You failed your first try.

2058
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:07,839
- We failed our first try. - This is difficult.

2059
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,479
- By the way... - The production crew won't do that.

2060
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,679
You don't look nervous, ma'am.

2061
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,880
- No. - I see.

2062
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:15,179
- Why not? - Because the prize is a harmonica?

2063
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,556
- The prize is a harmonica, so... - It's because...

2064
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,950
- the prize is a harmonica. - That's right.

2065
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,319
- She doesn't feel drawn to it. - This is so funny.

2066
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,190
It's not something that she wants.

2067
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,160
- It's not what she wants. - Exactly.

2068
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,659
I know, right?

2069
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,099
- It's your second try now. - Okay.

2070
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,759
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2071
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,000
- This is tough. - Here we go.

2072
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,699
In one, two, three. One!

2073
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,899
My goodness.

2074
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,669
(Second try)

2075
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,939
- I'll buy you a meal, Jung Eun. - Good job.

2076
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,140
I can feel it when you're about to stand up.

2077
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,140
- Here we go. - Okay.

2078
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,579
In one, two, three. One!

2079
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,009
(One!)

2080
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:48,979
(Second try)

2081
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,500
- Gosh, this is... - Look at his face.

2082
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,419
- This is exhilarating. - There's no plan or anything.

2083
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,089
- We go with our gut. - Right, with our gut.

2084
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,289
This is a mind game...

2085
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:56,719
between Bo Pil and us.

2086
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,790
That's right.

2087
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,390
In one, two, three. Two!

2088
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:02,030
We got this.

2089
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,329
- It's our last try now. - One last try.

2090
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,610
- This is the last one. - Right.

2091
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,400
(They succeeded 3 times in a row again.)

2092
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:09,769
- We can do it. - Right.

2093
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,870
(They only need to go through this one.)

2094
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,010
In one, two, three. Three!

2095
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,010
Three!

2096
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,180
- I shouldn't have stood up. - Why did I stand up?

2097
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:27,110
I had been sitting all along, and then I...

2098
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,689
- Gosh, this is tough. - I had been sitting all along.

2099
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:32,259
This is not easy.

2100
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,530
- Well, I... - Gosh.

2101
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,036
- I wanted to stand up every time. - I should have stood up too.

2102
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,099
- How about... - Gosh.

2103
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,129
How about we exchange signals?

2104
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,969
- You can do that. - When we stand up, right?

2105
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,639
- I think they can read our minds. - That way, we can be prepared.

2106
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,869
This is not as easy as I thought.

2107
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,190
- This is not easy. - It's tough.

2108
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,740
Here we go.

2109
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,249
In one, two, three. Two!

2110
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,250
(Third try)

2111
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:53,609
- This was okay. - I was flinching.

2112
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:54,950
I didn't get nervous this time.

2113
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,849
In one, two, three. One!

2114
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,150
(One!)

2115
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,450
Gosh, I...

2116
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,059
- Gosh, I... - What's wrong with you?

2117
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,380
- What? - Why are you doing this?

2118
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,460
Well, I slipped a little.

2119
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,930
- What's the problem? I stood up. - Good.

2120
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,500
- I stood up. - Sure.

2121
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,600
I wasn't going to stand up this time.

2122
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,110
- This is your third attempt. - We need to succeed this time.

2123
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:20,940
In one, two, three. Zero!

2124
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,539
(Zero!)

2125
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:25,149
(Third try)

2126
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:27,050
- You can do it. - Let's make a plan.

2127
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,449
- This is our last try, right? - This is our last one.

2128
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,690
- Okay. We can do this. - Let's make a plan.

2129
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,689
- What are we planning? - What plan are you talking about?

2130
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:36,989
- How are we going to do that? - How do we plan it?

2131
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:39,889
- We guess what they will call out. - I see.

2132
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:41,200
And we avoid that number.

2133
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:42,729
How about that?

2134
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,630
(Determined)

2135
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,629
(He takes out the strategy board.)

2136
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,799
What are we going to plan with it?

2137
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,939
I mean... We guess...

2138
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,110
It shouldn't be like this.

2139
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,180
(He's done giving orders.)

2140
01:12:56,181 --> 01:12:57,710
- All right. - Okay?

2141
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:59,749
We can't let them read our plan.

2142
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,250
- Okay. - Ready.

2143
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:04,990
(We need to do this just once.)

2144
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,990
(Will they be able to succeed this time?)

2145
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,430
- In one, two, three. Two! - Please.

2146
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,129
- Two! - Please.

2147
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,829
(Finally, they succeed until the end.)

2148
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:18,169
- We did it. - Did we succeed? All right!

2149
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:21,269
- Success! - We won!

2150
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,370
(I love the harmonica.)

2151
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,340
But we were supposed to do zero this time.

2152
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,149
- My gosh. - We were supposed to do zero.

2153
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:33,080
- Why would you... - I don't know.

2154
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,319
- He could call out zero. - Of course.

2155
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,649
That's why I did it.

2156
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,619
- Because they told us. - Right.

2157
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,620
They said it would be zero.

2158
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:42,459
All right. We won Round One, and here's your harmonica.

2159
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,730
- The harmonica. - Thank you!

2160
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,470
- In your boring everyday life... - I won the harmonica.

2161
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,429
- In your boring everyday life... - Congratulations.

2162
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,500
All right.

2163
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,999
- There's a Round Two. - Okay.

2164
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,369
- We have many chances left. - Right.

2165
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:56,539
- Go or stop? - Since you're here,

2166
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,310
I have to say go as a man.

2167
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,569
In 1, 2, 3.

2168
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,909
- Go! - Go!

2169
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,779
So this is what happens.

2170
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,110
Pick a cookie for Round Two.

2171
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,279
Gosh, what's this? Goodness.

2172
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,019
"A literary girl who writes poems."

2173
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,849
"Let's go on a literature tour with romance around you."

2174
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:13,589
"A Louis Vuitton scarf."

2175
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,510
(The Present for Round 2: A Louis Vuitton scarf)

2176
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,190
What?

2177
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,990
I really love scarves.

2178
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:23,900
- Goodness. - A Louis Vuitton scarf.

2179
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,999
(A literature tour with romance, A Louis Vuitton scarf)

2180
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,440
Gosh, I didn't expect the prize to be a Louis Vuitton scarf.

2181
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,410
- Goodness. - Open up and see if you like it.

2182
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,309
- My goodness. - Because it was about poems,

2183
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,639
- I thought it would be a book. - Me too.

2184
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,780
- I thought it was a travel voucher. - Gosh, I didn't expect this.

2185
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,049
- Goodness. - It's so pretty.

2186
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,379
- Open it. - Gosh.

2187
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,049
- It's about 700 dollars. - My goodness. It is?

2188
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:45,819
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2189
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,419
I've never had something like this.

2190
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,819
(Even Jung Eun wants to have this scarf.)

2191
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,120
- I love it. - My goodness.

2192
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,729
- Goodness. - But...

2193
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:53,859
(Taking it away)

2194
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,699
- We need to win to give you this. - We need to win this round.

2195
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,329
Gosh. What do we do?

2196
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,569
- Actually... - You feel nervous, right?

2197
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,339
(Round 2)

2198
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,609
(You win if you avoid the number called out by the director.)

2199
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,616
(The options are 0, odd numbers, and even numbers.)

2200
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,669
Zero, an odd number...

2201
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,109
- Or an even number. - It's harder to win now.

2202
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,639
Right. So if I say, "Odd number,"

2203
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,879
- it shouldn't be 1 or 3. - We need to avoid them.

2204
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,249
So if he says, "Even number," we should pick an odd number.

2205
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,619
- Right. - Zero or an odd number.

2206
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,519
- There rule is the same. - We must win four times in a row?

2207
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,989
If he says, "Odd number," pick zero or an even number.

2208
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,089
- Goodness. - The probability decreased.

2209
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,159
- Right. - Yes.

2210
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,959
- This is hard. - It's a 19 percent chance to win.

2211
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,089
- Goodness. - What?

2212
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,589
It's 19 percent.

2213
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,730
Doesn't that mean you won't let us get the prize?

2214
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,430
You showed us the scarf, and you are...

2215
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,060
- Zero, odd, and even numbers. - Right.

2216
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:35,899
- But we have many opportunities. - Right.

2217
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,299
- We should give it a try. - Let's start with a cheer.

2218
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,069
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2219
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,869
- All right. Since she is... - It's all about the spirit.

2220
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,279
She is...

2221
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,539
- Right. It's all about the spirit. - Yes.

2222
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,109
- It's all about the spirit. - We need to be confident.

2223
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,149
We must win this scarf.

2224
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,680
- The Louis Vuitton scarf. - Ready.

2225
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,949
In 1, 2, 3. Odd number.

2226
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,649
(Odd number!)

2227
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,719
(They won with 0, avoiding an odd number.)

2228
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,289
- We did it. - We did it.

2229
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,619
I didn't want to move.

2230
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,160
- We did it. - I didn't want to move.

2231
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,359
- We need three more to go. - Three more.

2232
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,699
- It's all about the spirit. - We'll just go with the spirit.

2233
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,130
In 1, 2, 3. Odd number.

2234
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,129
(It's 4, an even number.)

2235
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,199
(They won, avoiding odd numbers.)

2236
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,340
- We did it. - That was amazing.

2237
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,209
- We did it. - We got it.

2238
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,369
(Fourth try)

2239
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,009
- We're halfway there. - Good.

2240
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,740
- Goodness. - Okay. Let's do this.

2241
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,880
In one, two, three. Zero!

2242
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,049
(Fourth try)

2243
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,919
Good job. You did great.

2244
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,019
All right. We got this.

2245
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,760
- Let's go. - Let's make a plan.

2246
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,759
- Let's have a meeting to plan. - A meeting to plan?

2247
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,960
- Give us an order. - Okay.

2248
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,130
All right.

2249
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,230
(Thinking carefully)

2250
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,199
(He gave the order.)

2251
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,969
- Okay. - One more win, and...

2252
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,170
- Then... - But isn't it...

2253
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,730
Can you see the bottom part of my hand?

2254
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,979
I can see your fingers that are not folded so clearly.

2255
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,110
- What's that? - I see.

2256
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,010
It's clear that it's two.

2257
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,719
- It was obvious. - It was showing too much.

2258
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,519
- Try writing it. - Goodness.

2259
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,949
- Write it on your palm. - I shouldn't do this then.

2260
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,420
- Okay. - This is crazy.

2261
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:00,750
Do you want a pen?

2262
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,990
- I see. - Okay.

2263
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,730
- What's that? - Then...

2264
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:06,990
- Right. - I see.

2265
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,499
- Okay, then. I got it. - Yes.

2266
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,729
- Okay. - Okay.

2267
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:11,730
(Fourth try)

2268
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:13,030
- Let's do this right. - Okay.

2269
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,840
Let's go. If we win this,

2270
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,439
we win Round Two.

2271
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,370
(Fourth try)

2272
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,010
(Will Jae Suk's plan work?)

2273
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:21,739
- Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3.

2274
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,109
Even number!

2275
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:26,449
(An even number?)

2276
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:27,510
Three. Even number!

2277
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,080
(The plan was to make 3, an odd number.)

2278
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:30,219
Let's do this right.

2279
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,819
(The plan was to make 3, an odd number.)

2280
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,750
If we win this, we win Round Two.

2281
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,860
An even number!

2282
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,899
- Goodness! - He was right.

2283
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,999
- I was right. - It should've been an odd number.

2284
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,830
- We were so close. - He ordered us to pick three.

2285
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,470
I thought...

2286
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:50,370
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

2287
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:51,810
But, I...

2288
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,939
Then, we should...

2289
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,979
(They chose a number but forgot to choose who will stand.)

2290
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,410
- This isn't easy. - Let's give a signal...

2291
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:59,679
- to choose who will get up. - Goodness.

2292
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,419
We would've won if I hadn't stood up.

2293
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,679
- What a shame. - That was close.

2294
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,949
- Gosh, it was close. - Goodness.

2295
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:05,266
We need to choose who will get up.

2296
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:07,290
- You should give directions. - Then, this time...

2297
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,890
Let's use a coupon.

2298
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,319
(Coupon)

2299
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,230
- The guest will do it? - I have the coupon.

2300
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,989
Then you should...

2301
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,400
- Come over here. - Okay.

2302
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,129
With the spirit of Majang-dong.

2303
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,546
(Bang Seop will play instead of Jung Eun.)

2304
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,330
In your boring everyday life...

2305
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,299
Let's have a moment full of dopamine.

2306
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,439
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2307
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,710
- Let's go. - Let's go!

2308
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:27,669
- Let's go. - I have this feeling that...

2309
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:28,879
- they will succeed. - So...

2310
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,439
we need to choose a different number, right?

2311
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,479
- Just do whatever you want. - Do whatever you want.

2312
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,609
- Okay. - All right.

2313
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,179
- Let's go. - Zero, odd, or even.

2314
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,020
- I think they'll win. I feel it. - All right.

2315
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,989
- I have this good feeling. - In 1, 2, 3.

2316
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,050
Even number.

2317
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,120
That was so...

2318
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:46,129
- They stood up. - Please get me a screen here.

2319
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,890
- This is... - It's so embarrassing.

2320
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:50,010
- When you fail... - I should've stood up.

2321
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,429
Well, sir.

2322
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:53,110
You were just sitting down, and it's over.

2323
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,370
Indeed.

2324
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,999
He was just sitting there, and...

2325
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,239
What's this?

2326
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,839
He was just sitting there, and it ended.

2327
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,140
(He's back to his seat.)

2328
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,109
He was sitting there doing nothing.

2329
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,516
(The coupon round ended meaninglessly.)

2330
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,179
- This is hard. - It is hard.

2331
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,809
I guess we were lucky...

2332
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:09,650
- to win three times in a row. - Right.

2333
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:10,850
- Like a miracle. - But I hope...

2334
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:12,089
- we win like a miracle. - Let's go for it once more.

2335
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,419
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2336
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,490
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2337
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,860
- We need to get her the present. - Of course.

2338
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:20,560
In one, two, three. Zero!

2339
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,469
- He jumped. - I jumped.

2340
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,299
- Your head almost hit the ceiling. - Did you see me jump?

2341
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,270
- My goodness. - Be confident when you stand up.

2342
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,739
- I made it clear. - Nice. I was surprised.

2343
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:33,940
You need to be clear.

2344
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,860
- He was so good. - Ready. Second try.

2345
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,009
In 1, 2, 3. Odd number!

2346
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,509
(Fifth try)

2347
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:41,949
It was zero.

2348
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,620
It was zero. Great job.

2349
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,289
My bottom feels heavy since a while ago.

2350
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,719
- I can't get up. - Let's...

2351
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,720
Ready.

2352
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,690
In one, two, three. Zero!

2353
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,119
(Fifth try)

2354
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,459
- All right. - We got this.

2355
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,789
Shall we hold a meeting to plan?

2356
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,100
A meeting to plan.

2357
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,400
(The meeting begins again.)

2358
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,169
(They will make 1, an odd number.)

2359
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,669
(Jung Eun will stand up to make it.)

2360
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,740
Okay.

2361
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:07,339
All right.

2362
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,900
(This time, they know who will get up.)

2363
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,949
If you succeed, you win Round Two.

2364
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,449
Right. We'll advance to the next round.

2365
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,180
- Ready. - Let's stick to the plan.

2366
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,720
(Will their plan work?)

2367
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,790
In 1, 2, 3. Even number!

2368
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:29,930
(An even number?)

2369
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,729
In 1, 2, 3. Even number!

2370
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:34,629
(Their plan was to make 1 with Jung Eun.)

2371
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,240
In 1, 2, 3. Even number!

2372
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:40,539
- Why would you... - Deok Hwan, why are you up?

2373
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,610
Even number!

2374
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,309
- Why would you... - Deok Hwan, why are you up?

2375
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:47,179
- Why did you get up? - Why did I get up?

2376
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,719
We chose an odd number.

2377
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,889
- Why would you... - Deok Hwan, why are you up?

2378
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:52,950
Why did you get up?

2379
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,890
(Laughing)

2380
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,989
- You... Deok Hwan! - My goodness.

2381
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,259
- Why are you up? - But we...

2382
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,290
- Why did I get up? - We chose an odd number.

2383
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,860
We chose an odd number, and Jung Eun was supposed to get up.

2384
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,999
Deok Hwan.

2385
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
(Frozen)

2386
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,630
Why did I get up? I mean...

2387
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,376
- I told you we'd stick to the plan. - Deok Hwan.

2388
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,570
My joints were...

2389
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,770
What happened? Why did I do that?

2390
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,870
Deok Hwan. If we had an odd number...

2391
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,310
(They failed on their fifth try.)

2392
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:19,079
I think I was startled. I was too nervous.

2393
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,649
- Jung Eun... - He was startled.

2394
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:22,349
He was startled. He got up because he was startled.

2395
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,779
He didn't stand up. He was just startled.

2396
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,520
- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.

2397
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,849
He said he was sorry.

2398
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:28,026
- What a mess. - What do I do?

2399
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,190
Gosh. What do I do?

2400
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,460
- The sixth try. - I want to cry now.

2401
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,790
From now on, no more plans, okay?

2402
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,859
Let's not plan anything from now on.

2403
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,099
It's okay.

2404
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,020
- We still have five more tries. - We have time.

2405
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,740
- All right. - Gosh, I'm sweaty.

2406
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,840
I'm sweating on my back.

2407
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,510
My goodness.

2408
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,209
We need to succeed this time.

2409
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:53,480
- Let's cheer up! - Let's go!

2410
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,449
- To Round Three. - Goodness.

2411
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,090
- We should go for it. - This isn't easy.

2412
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,720
In 1, 2, 3. Odd number.

2413
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,390
Goodness.

2414
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,719
(Failure)

2415
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,360
- This is... - Gosh. What do we do?

2416
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,829
It's not easy to win three times in a row.

2417
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,459
- Actually, how... - You're right.

2418
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,630
Sitting down doesn't mean I did good,

2419
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,699
but it feels so guilty when we fail when I'm standing.

2420
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,099
- Yes. - If you're the only one standing.

2421
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,439
It's like you're the main culprit.

2422
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,740
- Goodness. - Right.

2423
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,180
Let's focus on his lips when he calls out.

2424
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,540
Okay.

2425
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,850
But Jung Eun, I did that last time, and I got up because of it.

2426
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,150
- Without knowing. - Right.

2427
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,949
I saw his lips say, "Even number."

2428
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,389
So I got up thinking,

2429
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,719
- "I should make an even number." - Right.

2430
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,789
I know.

2431
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:38,160
- Okay. This is your 7th try. - It's our 7th try.

2432
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,690
We don't have many chances left for Round Two.

2433
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,560
What do we do?

2434
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,199
I really love scarves.

2435
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,880
(Will they be able to give her the scarf?)

2436
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,670
In one, two, three. Zero!

2437
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,939
- We did well this time. - Good job.

2438
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,040
- Okay. - Gosh.

2439
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,480
Okay. It's your second try.

2440
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,840
In 1, 2, 3. Even number!

2441
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,249
- I have a good feeling. - I know. Good job.

2442
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,330
- Great job. - We got this.

2443
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,949
- It's our third try now. - Right.

2444
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,020
Should we have a meeting?

2445
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,049
- A plan? - Let's just give it a try.

2446
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,149
- Right. Let's give it a try. - Okay.

2447
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:09,150
Let's just see how it goes. Let's take the chance.

2448
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,290
In one, two, three. Zero!

2449
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,959
(Seventh try)

2450
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,999
- We're almost there. - I thought...

2451
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,536
- We got this. - it wouldn't be zero again.

2452
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,899
Let's make a plan now.

2453
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:19,970
Right. A plan.

2454
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,900
Please write a number here.

2455
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,070
- A number? - Yes, a number.

2456
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,370
All right. He gave us the number.

2457
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,410
But everyone could see that it was one.

2458
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,979
(Their strategy is so clear and open.)

2459
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,050
Right?

2460
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:35,009
- I'll do it again. - One more time.

2461
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,479
- Hide it well. - Please give us a number.

2462
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,149
(Tight security)

2463
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,319
- All right. - Okay.

2464
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,350
- All right. - But I couldn't see it.

2465
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,590
So...

2466
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,029
- Hold on. There's a mirror here. - My goodness.

2467
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,759
- There's a mirror. - Goodness. Wait a second.

2468
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,560
There was a mirror here.

2469
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,899
- Gosh. I was surprised. - This won't do.

2470
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,069
- One more time. - No, it won't do.

2471
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,299
- One more time. - You didn't see that, right?

2472
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,300
I didn't see that.

2473
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,980
I really I didn't see that.

2474
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:00,839
Okay.

2475
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,179
We've got our plan.

2476
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,239
- What is it? - Gather around.

2477
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,440
(This is their final timeout.)

2478
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,979
Gosh.

2479
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,679
(They hide it so well that even cameras can't see it.)

2480
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,419
- Right. - Okay.

2481
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,520
- You got it, right? - Got it.

2482
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:14,319
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2483
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,559
- We must win this time. - Right.

2484
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,119
If we lose this time, we have no chance.

2485
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,289
Ready.

2486
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,360
(There's only one chance left for them to win.)

2487
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,129
We must win this time.

2488
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,730
If we lose this time, we have no chance.

2489
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:27,030
In 1, 2, 3. Odd number.

2490
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:30,599
Odd number.

2491
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,310
(They succeeded in Round 2.)

2492
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,510
(We won!)

2493
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:41,750
(My goodness!)

2494
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,950
We did it!

2495
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,719
Congratulations, ma'am!

2496
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,159
The Louis Vuitton scarf!

2497
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,090
- Thank you. - Gosh.

2498
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,960
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2499
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,359
- He kept going with one. - That was amazing.

2500
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,299
And He gave us a zero at the end.

2501
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,870
(He gave everything he had.)

2502
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:04,169
- My goodness. - Congratulations.

2503
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:05,869
I feel so happy for you as a neighbor.

2504
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:07,770
Your strategy worked.

2505
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:10,639
Well, we passed Round Two...

2506
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,879
and won the presents.

2507
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,849
- There are only three tries left. - Right.

2508
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:17,819
You can choose to stop or go.

2509
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:20,289
If you go, the present will be much better,

2510
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,259
but it will become much harder.

2511
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:23,919
- Right. - I think he's persuading us.

2512
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,460
- No. - No?

2513
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,129
She said no.

2514
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,359
- You can stop here. - Right.

2515
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,629
We have to give it back if we fail, don't we?

2516
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,130
- Right. - That is if we fail.

2517
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,899
- She's hugging it tightly. - Right.

2518
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,969
- She's already hugging it. - Right.

2519
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,099
All right. Go or stop. Please make your decision.

2520
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,210
In 1, 2, 3.

2521
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,410
Stop!

2522
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,639
We did it.

2523
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,479
We did it!

2524
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,949
- That was hilarious. - Well,

2525
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:48,309
he could've stayed up all night tonight.

2526
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,420
Exactly.

2527
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,849
"Why did I do that?"

2528
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:51,989
It's big.

2529
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:53,989
Spread it out, and it can go around like this.

2530
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,790
(He puts the Louis Vuitton scarf around her.)

2531
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,319
- It looks nice. - Thank you.

2532
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,729
- It's pretty. - She's like an ambassador...

2533
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:00,960
for Louis Vuitton.

2534
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:02,660
She's an ambassador for Louis Vuitton.

2535
01:26:02,661 --> 01:26:03,799
She should head to Paris.

2536
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,059
Right. She should.

2537
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,470
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2538
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,630
She can wear this.

2539
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,439
Whenever possible...

2540
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,969
(Whenever possible, )

2541
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,669
(double the happiness.)

2542
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,710
Thank you.

2543
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,639
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2544
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,850
Thank you so much.

2545
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:22,249
(Hasn't it been 10 years since they have made their debut?)

2546
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,219
(Idol stars with 10 years of experience as Whenever Friends?)

2547
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,450
(Jihyo and Sana of TWICE)

2548
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:29,396
(How does it feel to be an idol star with 10 years of experience?)

2549
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,460
(Sighing)

2550
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,089
(They definitely feel relaxed.)

2551
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,159
(Let's go!)

2552
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,240
(We are professionals now.)

2553
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,040
(How are the skills of the professionals?)

2554
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,160
Hey!

2555
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,970
(I'm a foreigner.)

2556
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,799
(The professional idol stars...)

2557
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,470
(do not hesitate to complain.)

2558
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,716
(I was being too cheap, wasn't I?)

2559
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,540
(I'll be harsh with you two today.)

2560
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,579
(As the years go by, )

2561
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,349
(we get treated a bit more...)

2562
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:54,949
(A wild day...)

2563
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,019
(with the feisty professional idols...)

2564
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,520
(charged with 200-percent openness)

2565
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:02,190
(Whenever Possible)

2566
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,260
(Whenever Possible)
