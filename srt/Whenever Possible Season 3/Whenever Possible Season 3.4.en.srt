1
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:06,817
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:13,387
- The weather is...
- It's amazing.

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,487
The weather is good, but summer is here now.

4
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:18,666
It's quite hot in the afternoon.

5
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,667
It's hot now.

6
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:22,036
My gosh. I didn't know there was a park like this here.

7
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:23,736
- It's my first time here too.
- Gosh, this is a great park.

8
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:24,866
The basketball hoops look great too.

9
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:26,507
So we're in Dogok-dong.

10
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:29,737
- Gosh, Dogok-dong...
- Dogok-dong isn't your spot, right?

11
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:30,946
- Well...
- I don't think he has...

12
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,976
any memories about this area.

13
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,947
I rarely came to this neighbourhood.

14
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:35,776
I was mostly in Suyu-ri when I was in high school.

15
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:36,916
(I love Suyu-ri.)

16
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:37,946
- I was in Gangbuk.
- You didn't come down here.

17
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:38,947
I didn't.

18
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:41,717
I came to this neighbourhood often to go to a dental clinic.

19
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,117
Why did you come all the way here?

20
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,656
- To get a discount?
- Gosh, no.

21
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:46,786
I was in high school back then.

22
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:48,456
- It was for dental braces.
- I see. For dental braces.

23
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:51,466
There was a dentist, renowned for dental braces.

24
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,566
The dental clinic is still here.

25
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,396
- Do you still go to that dentist?
- What about you? Which dentist...

26
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:56,597
- I...
- Why didn't you get braces?

27
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:59,566
Here's the thing. My parents weren't interested.

28
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,806
They said...

29
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:02,807
- everyone had crooked teeth.
- Really?

30
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,206
They weren't interested in tooth alignment.

31
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,416
And a few of my colleagues had misaligned teeth like me...

32
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,147
- and got braces.
- I see.

33
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,087
Yoon Jong Shin was one of them.

34
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:14,256
- But... Yes, he did.
- Did he get braces?

35
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:15,486
- Really? I see.
- Yes.

36
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,487
But I don't know if there's a big difference.

37
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:20,026
I never said this to his face.

38
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:22,456
But when I saw him, I thought, "Yes."

39
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,966
- "I don't need to get braces."
- Right.

40
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,426
- That crossed my mind.
- Yes.

41
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:26,427
As long as your teeth touch...

42
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:27,996
- when you bite, it's fine.
- Yes.

43
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:30,466
By the way, today's Whenever Friends are quite impressive.

44
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,667
Have you met them?

45
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:34,707
- I filmed two shows with him.
- I see.

46
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:36,976
But I've never met the other one at all.

47
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,046
It's her first time...

48
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:39,506
- on a variety show. Yes.
- Right.

49
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:41,446
I know that she's an introvert.

50
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:42,516
(This is the 1st variety show for the 2nd Whenever Friend.)

51
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:45,246
- I've never seen them on a show.
- Okay.

52
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,116
But I met both of them at a shoot.

53
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,656
Really? The shoot for what?

54
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:50,686
I met them at the shoot for "Nine Puzzles."

55
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,086
Are you in "Nine Puzzles?"

56
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:53,756
- No.
- Then why were you at the shoot?

57
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,456
- To see the director.
- I see.

58
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:57,096
- The director...
- We worked on "Narco-Saints."

59
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,266
- I see.
- Yes.

60
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,396
- My gosh.
- Yes.

61
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:01,797
You went there to butter him up.

62
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,336
- Butter him up? Seriously?
- My gosh.

63
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:05,706
You can't do that.

64
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:07,406
- The director...
- We're close.

65
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,306
Then meet him in private.

66
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,576
- Why did you go there?
- Gosh.

67
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:11,976
I went there to show my support.

68
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:13,946
No, you weren't there to show your support.

69
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,416
Then why do you go to so many concerts?

70
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,646
- I was invited.
- Did you go to butter them up?

71
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:19,847
I was invited to the concerts.

72
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:23,057
- They're already filming.
- I think they're filming us.

73
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:27,797
Do they not know that we're coming?

74
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,197
(They're still bickering.)

75
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,426
Gosh. I think our cases are different.

76
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:34,796
What do you mean?

77
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:36,736
Gosh, it's got an original theme.

78
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:37,907
- Right.
- Yes.

79
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,637
Here they come. My gosh.

80
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:41,836
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

81
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:44,147
- Suk Ku. Da Mi.
- Hello.

82
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,576
- Hello.
- Hello.

83
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:47,776
(Whenever Friends: Kim Da Mi and Son Suk Ku)

84
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,316
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to meet you.

85
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,516
- Nice to meet you.
- Have you been well?

86
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,286
- We were just talking about you.
- Hello.

87
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,386
- Hello.
- Hello.

88
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,857
(The most polite handshake)

89
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,127
She grabbed my hand with both hands.

90
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:58,857
You know what?

91
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:00,527
- We were just saying that...
- Yes?

92
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,296
- you were a complete introvert.
- Right.

93
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,396
(Da Mi's very first opening segment for a variety show)

94
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:04,766
- Is she not?
- Da Mi?

95
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,296
- Yes, she is.
- Gosh, look at the cameras.

96
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,496
- Da Mi is an introvert.
- There are so many.

97
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:09,297
It feels like we're doing a press conference.

98
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,236
Right? Yes.

99
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,013
There are more cameras than you thought, right?

100
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,736
But this isn't considered a lot.

101
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:17,776
- This is a small crew.
- Really?

102
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,107
- Two, four, six, eight...
- Yes.

103
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:23,016
They bring many cameras to show off partially.

104
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:25,446
- Is that so?
- So the people who join us...

105
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,186
- To intimidate them?
- Yes, that's it.

106
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,257
(Taking it seriously)

107
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,016
Is this your first variety show, Da Mi?

108
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:31,557
Yes. It's my first time on a TV show.

109
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:34,167
- It's your 1st time?
- Yes, it is my 1st time.

110
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,996
- I see.
- Yes.

111
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:37,697
Is there a reason behind that?

112
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:39,866
Well, I feel awkward in this kind of environment.

113
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,696
- I see. You feel awkward?
- Yes.

114
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:43,736
- I bet you get nervous.
- Right.

115
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:44,766
Did you get a good night's sleep?

116
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,567
- I did get some sleep.
- I see.

117
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:47,607
(Chuckling)

118
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:49,076
What is it?

119
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,606
- What is it?
- What?

120
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,646
When people are nervous, they can't sleep. But I slept well.

121
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:53,747
- Right.
- My gosh.

122
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,146
Anyway, Suk Ku and Da Mi are starring in a drama.

123
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:58,246
We briefly talked about it. It's directed by Yoon Jong Bin.

124
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,246
- "Nine Puzzles."
- "Nine Puzzles." Yes.

125
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,607
Could you tell us about the drama?

126
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,387
- I have to tell you?
- Yes.

127
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,156
- Then who will?
- Well...

128
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,186
- No.
- Da Mi will do it?

129
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:07,196
- Yes.
- Is that your responsibility?

130
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:08,396
- Da Mi, can you do it?
- What?

131
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,697
Well, so...

132
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,796
there was a serial murder case ten years ago.

133
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:15,767
My character is the only eyewitness.

134
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:17,566
(E Na is the only eyewitness of a cold case.)

135
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:18,906
(And Detective Han Saem suspects E Na.)

136
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:19,907
(It's a detective thriller...)

137
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,183
(uncovering the secrets of the serial murder.)

138
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:22,636
("'Nine Puzzles' Takes 1st Place Upon Release")

139
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,746
("'Nine Puzzles' Enters Global Top 10")

140
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,907
("The World Goes Wild for the Drama with Plot Twists")

141
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,716
Back then, they received a puzzle.

142
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:33,247
And ten years later, another puzzle showed up.

143
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:35,786
So they try to figure out...

144
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:37,456
- who the murderer is again.
- Who the murderer is?

145
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,126
The drama is about uncovering the murderer.

146
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,096
I see. So you play the character who tries to catch the murderer.

147
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,826
- He's the detective.
- But he suspects my character.

148
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:44,666
My character suspects her character.

149
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,326
She plays a profiler.

150
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,596
- Did you mention that?
- Right. No, I didn't yet.

151
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:48,636
- You didn't?
- No.

152
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:49,996
- That's the most important part.
- I play the profiler.

153
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:52,036
- She plays the profiler.
- I play the profiler.

154
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,077
(She forgets to explain her role as she's nervous.)

155
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:56,106
- You play the profiler, - I was nervous too.

156
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,706
- So I couldn't hear you at all.
- but you're suspected.

157
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:58,876
Why are you so nervous?

158
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,516
- I wasn't nervous before.
- Right.

159
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,876
But she's so nervous.

160
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,616
- I see.
- I kept thinking, "Do well."

161
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:07,086
- So I got nervous with her.
- You wanted...

162
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,656
- to encourage her.
- Yes.

163
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:10,116
- You were so focused on her.
- Yes.

164
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,426
I was at the shoot.

165
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:12,956
- Right.
- Yes, you did come.

166
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:15,156
That's why I asked him this when he told me he was there...

167
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,496
to show support for the director.

168
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,226
- What?
- "Did you go to butter him up?"

169
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,467
- Butter him up?
- I did.

170
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:20,867
This is common for actors.

171
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,536
When you're close to directors, you visit their shoot and so on.

172
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,106
- To be supportive.
- To support them.

173
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,936
- Right.
- But I don't do that personally.

174
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:27,136
- I usually send coffee trucks.
- Right. Sending coffee trucks.

175
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,276
- Right.
- But he came personally.

176
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,636
- Yes. So he had an ulterior motive.
- Right.

177
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,306
- Yes, he had an ulterior motive.
- What motive?

178
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,987
- I think so too.
- I wanted to meet them.

179
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,447
- I see.
- Today will be a tough one.

180
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:37,786
- Right.
- Yes.

181
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,487
You know what? You look so cool.

182
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,616
He has such a robust chest.

183
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:44,857
- That's my shoulder.
- I...

184
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,126
You didn't have to correct me.

185
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:50,026
I couldn't put my hands right on your chest.

186
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:51,197
So I stopped here.

187
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,966
It's his overall figure.

188
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,466
- Right. The width...
- It's quite robust.

189
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,496
Yeon Seok, don't you have broad shoulders?

190
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,936
- But my figure... Yes.
- You have a lean figure.

191
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:00,066
I don't have a stocky build.

192
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,376
But when you have a slim figure, clothes fit you better.

193
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:04,847
You two look great.

194
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:07,006
- A figure like mine?
- Yes.

195
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,217
- A slim figure.
- But as for people like us,

196
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,386
some clothes do look good on us. But...

197
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,557
- how do you say it?
- Don't clump me up with you.

198
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:18,026
- Why did you clump me up with you?
- He mentioned our figure.

199
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,856
Suk Ku was talking about our figure.

200
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:21,096
So guys as skinny as anchovies...

201
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,356
- What? Anchovies?
- Anchovies?

202
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:24,026
- I'm not that skinny.
- He's skinny like an anchovy.

203
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:26,507
- I got over the skinny figure.
- He's skinny like an anchovy.

204
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,466
- You have a stocky build.
- I see.

205
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:31,166
- But I have to lose weight.
- Why?

206
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,977
The director of my next project wants that.

207
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:36,636
- I think I prefer that too.
- Okay.

208
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:38,907
I was asked to lose a lot of weight.

209
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:42,216
- So my goal is to drop 10kg.
- You have to lose 10kg?

210
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:45,047
I must start now. But I've never gone on such a huge diet before.

211
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,886
Yeon Seok probably has good tips on losing weight.

212
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:51,626
As for me, I mostly lost weight through food.

213
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,026
- I had seafood-centered meals.
- I see.

214
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,197
Seafood isn't fattening?

215
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,126
- It's protein.
- Well...

216
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:57,397
Then, I didn't eat rice.

217
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,396
- I didn't eat carbs.
- Not even brown rice?

218
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,136
- I just didn't eat rice.
- I see.

219
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,836
But don't you love eating?

220
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,737
- I do.
- Then...

221
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,106
- you must cut down on food.
- Right.

222
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,476
- Appetite control is a challenge.
- Right.

223
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:11,946
- What about you, Da Mi?
- Do you have a lot of cravings?

224
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:14,716
(She's startled by the barrage of questions.)

225
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,916
- Why... We asked at the same time.
- We asked at the same time.

226
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,116
- You go first.
- Okay.

227
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:19,686
Who has ties to Dogok-dong?

228
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,316
- Who has connections here?
- Right. Which one of you is it?

229
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,456
I used to live around Suseo-dong, which is close to here.

230
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,587
- I see. Suseo-dong.
- Yes. I lived there...

231
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:28,527
for about ten years.

232
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:30,596
It was when I moved to Seoul on my own.

233
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:32,066
- You lived in Suseo-dong?
- Yes.

234
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,826
There's Yangjae Stream in Dogok-dong.

235
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,166
- That's a great stream.
- Yes.

236
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,467
I used to walk alongside the stream and arrive at my house.

237
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:41,276
- Well... Yes.
- Right. We talked about it earlier.

238
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:42,876
He's Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

239
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:43,877
- Yes.
- He is?

240
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,747
- Yes.
- That's my nickname.

241
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:48,576
- You like to walk.
- I do love walking.

242
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:49,847
I often went for a run...

243
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,916
along the stream early in the morning.

244
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,487
I like jogging early in the morning.

245
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:56,686
So some of my friends...

246
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,726
would still be up and text me late at night.

247
00:07:58,727 --> 00:07:59,967
They ask, "What are you up to?"

248
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,956
I would say, "I'm jogging along Yangjae Stream."

249
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,966
They would say, "Again? Are you a raccoon at Yangjae Stream?"

250
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,196
That's how I got my nickname, Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

251
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,166
You know what? You do look like a raccoon.

252
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,866
- Really? There are real raccoons.
- I see the resemblance.

253
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,966
- There are real raccoons.
- Yes.

254
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,006
- Yes, there are. They're famous.
- Yes.

255
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,936
- Oh, they're famous?
- Yes, they are.

256
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,853
- So I'm one of them.
- Yes. There are real raccoons.

257
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:21,846
A while ago, I filmed a drama at Yangjae Stream.

258
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:22,916
I had to fall into the stream.

259
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,286
- I had to go into the water.
- Oh, into the stream?

260
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:26,146
- I went into the water.
- I see.

261
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:27,586
The water wasn't that deep.

262
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,316
I dove in pretty hard.

263
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,557
I skinned my palm a bit because I hit a rock right away.

264
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,257
Are you whining about your scratch?

265
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:37,526
- My gosh. I thought...
- You could show some concern.

266
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,396
- it was something serious.
- Look at this.

267
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,896
- It's a pretty big scratch.
- The scratch looks severe.

268
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,066
- Let me see.
- It's pretty bad.

269
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,396
- Gosh, people get...
- It healed a bit.

270
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,736
- that kind of scratch all the time.
- Gosh.

271
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,036
This is quite common. Why are you whining about that?

272
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,277
- No, it's not common at all.
- My gosh.

273
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,476
You could blow on it.

274
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,506
(His feelings are hurt.)

275
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,416
Anyway, we're in Dogok-dong.

276
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,316
Let's check where we have to go today.

277
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,787
Let's go and find our first Whenever Guest.

278
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,417
(Spreading)

279
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,757
- What's that?
- Oh, my.

280
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,687
She's quite responsive.

281
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:08,457
- Right. She's quite responsive.
- Yes. She's good.

282
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:11,427
- She's responsive.
- She seems more comfortable...

283
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,567
- than Suk Ku.
- You're doing well.

284
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,637
(You're doing well.)

285
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,407
"Cho Sung Hee."

286
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,236
"When I was a teenager,"

287
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:23,406
"starring in Jae Suk's show was my dream."

288
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:24,846
"But now, I've become an office worker..."

289
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,446
"who must be mindful of everything..."

290
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,377
"like bank balances and wardrobe inventory."

291
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,486
"I'm constantly travelling for work."

292
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,286
"I have to carry mannequins and clothes hangers..."

293
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,256
"as I travel all over Korea. And I wonder..."

294
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,957
"if I'll ever get to meet Jae Suk in person during my spare time."

295
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:40,487
Is she a stylist?

296
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,257
- Or...
- Does she work in fashion?

297
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:43,827
- I think she does.
- Does she?

298
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,396
- It's 8 minutes by foot.
- It's 8 minutes away?

299
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:47,536
- Let's walk there then.
- Okay.

300
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,136
It's 12pm now. We can get going now.

301
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,337
- It's perfect then.
- Yes.

302
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,837
- It's quite hot.
- Yes.

303
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:55,136
It'll go up to 27°C...

304
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,137
- in the afternoon.
- I see. There?

305
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,778
(It feels like a summer afternoon today.)

306
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,347
Do you prefer summer?

307
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:01,846
- I prefer winter.
- Same here. I prefer winter.

308
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,116
- Me too.
- Really?

309
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:05,587
Yes. I can't think straight with the heat.

310
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:08,256
- I sweat a lot.
- Right.

311
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,457
So I think winter is better for me when I have to work.

312
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:12,786
- My mouth gets numb in winter.
- Right.

313
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:14,497
- So... Yes.
- So I just want to go home.

314
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,497
I feel that way in summer and winter.

315
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,797
- We always want to go home.
- Always.

316
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,666
At one point, I thought...

317
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,867
that I wasn't passionate about acting anymore.

318
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:25,536
- I want to go home after one scene.
- That's...

319
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,606
- That's very natural.
- Right.

320
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:28,313
- Everyone feels the same way.
- Seriously.

321
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,376
What about you, Da Mi?

322
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,246
If I'm being completely honest, I felt that way...

323
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,276
- when I was getting my makeup done.
- You wanted to go home?

324
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:34,516
- Right.
- Yes.

325
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,517
(As this is her first variety show, she was under pressure.)

326
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,247
That's too much. I was excited then.

327
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,586
I get excited when I get my makeup done.

328
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:40,086
I think about what I'm going to do.

329
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,686
Here's the thing. When I began starring in variety shows,

330
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,287
I had a similar kind of fear.

331
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,856
- Gosh.
- Da Mi, that was quite honest.

332
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,757
- Yes. I can relate to that.
- That was honest.

333
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,896
The atmosphere of the show is quite comfortable.

334
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:54,267
- Right.
- So...

335
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,406
we're going to play some games later.

336
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,706
We play games to give out presents.

337
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:03,007
So you'll naturally... Let's cross here.

338
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,547
You'll naturally end up getting invested in the games.

339
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,616
But it's rare...

340
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:10,417
to succeed in all three rounds, right?

341
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,116
- But it happens.
- It happens.

342
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:13,516
- I see.
- The one with Jun Hyuk.

343
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:14,856
- When he was on our show, - Yes.

344
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,186
We succeeded all of the rounds.

345
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:18,686
- He's good at games.
- Jun Hyuk...

346
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:20,526
It wasn't just Jun Hyuk.

347
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:21,957
Ji Min was on fire that day.

348
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,296
She carried the whole thing that day.

349
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:27,166
She brags about completing all three rounds so much.

350
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,236
Right!

351
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,913
- She told me to watch it.
- Did Jun Hyuk help?

352
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,606
Didn't Ji Min practically do everything?

353
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,806
- She tells everyone...
- Right.

354
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,376
To star in our show.

355
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:38,176
When actors and actresses have to promote their dramas,

356
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:40,646
- She's our PR fairy.
- she tells them to pick our show.

357
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,376
She forces me to watch her highlight.

358
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:44,817
She told me to watch it.

359
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,916
- So I did. And she was good.
- Seriously.

360
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,056
- It looked like...
- Hello.

361
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:49,186
- they used CGI on the eraser.
- Hello.

362
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:51,756
You'll probably get a taste of that today.

363
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:52,757
- It's such a thrill.
- It's a thrill.

364
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:53,757
(Excited)

365
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,657
I can't believe I'm walking past this place.

366
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,796
I've never walked past this place.

367
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,266
- Right.
- Wait.

368
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,336
- The path...
- It's here.

369
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,618
- This is the place?
- I think it's on the seventh floor.

370
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,166
Is this the building?

371
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,836
- This one?
- Should we check?

372
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,407
- The 7th floor.
- The 7th floor?

373
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,687
- On the seventh floor...
- Where is that?

374
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,677
- There's nothing on that floor.
- Right.

375
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,247
Samsung C and T Corporation.

376
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:17,746
- I see. They sell clothes.
- They sell clothes. Right.

377
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:19,117
- That's right.
- I see.

378
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:22,117
- They do sell clothes.
- Gosh, you're indeed a profiler.

379
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:24,287
- That was sharp.
- Yes.

380
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:27,186
It's cool in here.

381
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:28,196
She knew...

382
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,396
- because her role was a profiler?
- That's what I think.

383
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:31,237
(He promotes his new drama whenever possible.)

384
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,743
- That must be it.
- We can go in this way.

385
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,126
I see. That elevator is for high floors.

386
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,527
I see. The elevators are separated.

387
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,567
- Hello.
- My gosh.

388
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,206
(The office workers have just begun their lunch break.)

389
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,876
- Hello.
- It's Whenever Possible!

390
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,206
My gosh. Yes.

391
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:46,207
(The king of communication)

392
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,346
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm a huge fan.

393
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:48,917
I guess you're going out for lunch.

394
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:52,517
- Hold on.
- He communicates with the people.

395
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,356
- Right.
- Wait.

396
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,417
- He likes to...
- Why...

397
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,457
(Shy)

398
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:01,527
(He's too shy and breaks down.)

399
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,057
- Come this way.
- That's for odd-numbered floors.

400
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,026
- All right.
- Hello.

401
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,266
- Hello.
- Hello.

402
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,936
- Wait. This is...
- Gosh, it's hot.

403
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,666
- Gosh, this place is...
- Is it hot? You must be sweaty.

404
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,367
Located inside...

405
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,007
- Do we go this way?
- My gosh.

406
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:16,806
(Ironclad security)

407
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,676
- Well, the security here...
- The security is tight.

408
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:20,006
- I don't know how.
- Well...

409
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,376
We need a key card.

410
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,446
(Hovering around in front of a closed door)

411
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,176
Hold on. Will they come out?

412
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,216
No. I don't think we should press the security button.

413
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:27,347
- Gosh.
- They're here.

414
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,316
- Hello.
- Hello.

415
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:30,686
- Are you Cho Sung Hee?
- Yes, that's me.

416
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,127
- Are you Sung Hee? My gosh, hello.
- Hello.

417
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,456
- Do you work in fashion?
- Yes, I do.

418
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,756
- My gosh.
- They're working right now.

419
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:38,526
Let's go in.

420
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,826
They're working right now. Can we enter?

421
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,496
- We can go that way.
- That way?

422
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,996
- Hello. Excuse us.
- It's lunchtime now. Hello.

423
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,706
- Here.
- It's lunchtime now. Why...

424
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:46,966
Don't they go out for lunch?

425
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,736
- I think they stayed on purpose.
- That's...

426
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:49,876
It seems no one left for lunch.

427
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:50,907
That's right.

428
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,446
- They wanted to watch us.
- Yes.

429
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,906
- Are they your colleagues?
- Yes.

430
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,276
- Yes.
- Come inside.

431
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,476
- We should...
- How do we do this?

432
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,717
(Her colleagues join them too.)

433
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,686
I'll sit here.

434
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:01,757
The four of you...

435
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:03,656
- Can I use the restroom?
- Yes, you can.

436
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:05,227
- You guys can sit here.
- Okay.

437
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:07,326
I'll be back.

438
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:08,927
- I'm sweaty.
- Go ahead.

439
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:11,596
Here's the thing with Suk Ku.

440
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:12,726
I mean, it is hot today.

441
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,487
But he started to break out in a cold sweat.

442
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,696
- I think he was flustered.
- Right.

443
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:17,906
Da Mi, are you feeling all right?

444
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,506
- Me? I'm okay.
- You know what?

445
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,736
- Da Mi is calmer than I expected.
- She's surprisingly calm. Yes.

446
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,307
But Suk Ku is quite nervous.

447
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,746
What's gotten into him?

448
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:27,006
He's only used to walking by Yangjae Stream.

449
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:28,176
Exactly.

450
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,817
More importantly, he's wearing a sleeveless top underneath.

451
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:33,046
- He can't take it off.
- He can't take it off.

452
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:34,956
He said he couldn't take it off because he wasn't brave enough.

453
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,493
If he takes it off, he might become his character in "The Roundup."

454
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,156
- His top...
- That's so funny.

455
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,056
Sung Hee. Anyway, you are the one...

456
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:42,526
Yes. I'm the one who wrote to the show.

457
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:43,796
- You wrote to our show.
- Yes.

458
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,037
It seems you've been working...

459
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,596
for some time now.

460
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,936
Yes. If you count my internship,

461
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,336
- I've been working for 11 years.
- That's a long time.

462
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:51,337
- Just in this company?
- Right.

463
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:52,666
No, I worked at other companies too.

464
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:53,866
We're in charge of women's apparel brands...

465
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:55,136
from the domestic market.

466
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,137
They're in charge of brands...

467
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,706
- from abroad.
- We manage international brands.

468
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:58,976
- We work on the same team.
- Yes, we do.

469
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,206
We only manage different brands.

470
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:01,676
- I see.
- Yes.

471
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,353
- They manage international brands?
- Yes.

472
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,616
Da Mi, with them next to you,

473
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:05,763
- you look like you work in fashion.
- Yes.

474
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:07,507
- She...
- You look like their team leader.

475
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,057
- She fits in perfectly.
- She really does.

476
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,457
- Da Mi, you fit in perfectly.
- Yes.

477
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,096
When you work in an office... Suk Ku is back.

478
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,926
- I'm back.
- So you've freshened up.

479
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:18,067
Yes.

480
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,296
It was very hot.

481
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:21,897
- I went and freshened up a bit.
- Okay.

482
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:24,466
It would be nice if you could take off the jacket.

483
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,807
- I want to.
- Okay.

484
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,277
But I might sweat even more if I do...

485
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:29,936
because I would be embarrassed.

486
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:31,806
(He needs a lot of courage to pull off a tank top.)

487
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,846
You know what? The tables have turned.

488
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,077
Da Mi is in her element now.

489
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,316
- She's a part of the team now.
- It looks like she works here.

490
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,517
Yes. This place suits you.

491
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,157
What made you decide to write to our show?

492
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:47,256
First of all, I wanted to experience something like this...

493
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:48,956
- with my team.
- Okay.

494
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:52,366
And starring in one of your variety shows...

495
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,566
with regular people in it was my lifelong dream.

496
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,807
- You wanted to be on our show?
- Yes. So...

497
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,336
I was so nervous today.

498
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:01,777
I couldn't do anything today.

499
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:06,006
Well, since you work for a fashion company,

500
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,516
it's impossible not to care about your outfit.

501
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:11,546
Right. That's why when we get paid,

502
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,416
we return it to the company.

503
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:16,117
- There's this return system.
- Yes.

504
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:20,126
Did you study fashion at university?

505
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:22,797
- I majored in Western painting.
- I see.

506
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:27,396
I was looking for a VMD job...

507
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,896
and ended up in fashion.

508
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:30,136
What is "VMB?"

509
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,567
- It's "VMD."
- It's MD.

510
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,266
- "MD" stands for "merchandising."
- Right.

511
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,676
Visual merchandising is...

512
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:39,476
making products look visually more appealing...

513
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:40,876
to the customers...

514
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:43,477
- in shops or pop-up stores.
- I see.

515
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:46,716
In other words, we are in charge of the displays and mannequins...

516
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:49,156
in shop windows and inside the stores.

517
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,687
We're the ones who do that.

518
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:54,796
Being in fashion,

519
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,096
do you have any job-related habits?

520
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,173
That could be possible. Do you have job-related habits?

521
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:03,166
Since we're the team that makes shops look clean...

522
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,437
and visually nice,

523
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:08,136
when we go to department stores...

524
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:09,976
and see clothes hanging awkwardly...

525
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:13,047
or that the mannequin's hand is crooked,

526
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:15,176
we find ourselves straightening it out...

527
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,617
although we are there as customers.

528
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,816
- You straighten it out?
- Yes.

529
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,916
I look at the space between the hangers.

530
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,756
- Do you fold clothes nicely?
- Yes.

531
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,856
If it's folded in a wrong way,

532
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:27,126
I organize it.

533
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:30,257
When we go shopping,

534
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,397
we hold up clothes that were nicely folded.

535
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:33,996
But even if we try to fold it back,

536
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,466
- It doesn't work.
- it doesn't look the same.

537
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,587
- It's difficult.
- That's why I don't look at those.

538
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,606
- You don't at all?
- I can't make it look the same,

539
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,776
- so I can't look at those clothes.
- I know the feeling.

540
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:45,123
- I feel bad making a mess.
- I can't just leave it in a mess.

541
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,983
But I can't make it look the same as it used to.

542
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,476
It's okay to leave it in a mess.

543
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:53,586
Folding the clothes helps us relax.

544
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,586
- It does?
- Yes, for most of us.

545
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:56,886
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,656
So don't worry about taking a look at the clothes...

547
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,126
- and leave it as it is.
- We can?

548
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,356
- Do you all agree?
- Yes.

549
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,903
There is one thing I was curious about people who work at offices.

550
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,226
You must get drowsy after lunch.

551
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:08,467
How do you overcome that?

552
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,637
We have to fight it off with caffeine.

553
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,506
(Drinking)

554
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:13,606
We transfuse caffeine into our bodies.

555
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,676
Even while I'm filming...

556
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,877
You know me, right?

557
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:20,047
We recently filmed a drama together.

558
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:21,576
I was surprised at myself.

559
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:23,217
I fell asleep while acting.

560
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,416
- When?
- I was so sleepy.

561
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:28,057
- When was that?
- I fell asleep while acting.

562
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,487
That's very human.

563
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,286
- The food was so good.
- I see.

564
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,696
- I'm curious about the food trucks.
- Right?

565
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:38,597
- We're curious about the cafeteria.
- I bet.

566
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,096
It's a battle to get good food trucks at shoots.

567
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,537
The moment a shoot is set,

568
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,836
the first thing a production company does is find...

569
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:47,307
- good food catering trucks.
- They find good food trucks?

570
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:48,736
It shows how capable you are.

571
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:50,706
We hear about the good food trucks.

572
00:18:50,707 --> 00:18:52,547
- That's right.
- We know which ones are good.

573
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,816
Do you take walks...

574
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,676
along Yangjae Stream after lunch?

575
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,846
- Yes, we often do.
- You take walks?

576
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,756
Suk Ku's nickname is Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

577
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:04,386
- Really?
- I come here often.

578
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:05,727
- You do?
- Really?

579
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:07,087
Why are you a raccoon?

580
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:09,397
- There are many raccoons...
- Yes?

581
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:10,897
At Yangjae Stream.

582
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:14,266
That's why? That's why you're a raccoon?

583
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,297
They often come out early in the morning.

584
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,466
- It's also when I often come.
- You do? I see.

585
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,406
You might be able to see him...

586
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,136
- if you take a walk before work.
- Yes, that's right.

587
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:25,083
You might be able to see the Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

588
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:26,846
Do you have any nicknames, Da Mi?

589
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,616
Me? People used to call me "Dam-Da-Di-Dam."

590
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,717
From the song.

591
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,816
Or they often called me "Dam-Da."

592
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,157
You stay nice and calm.

593
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,816
She stayed nice and calm.

594
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:40,026
- I just realized...
- Yes?

595
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,426
- it's time to start the challenge.
- Yes.

596
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:43,527
We have to roll the die for coupons.

597
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:45,667
- Why don't you, Suk Ku?
- What?

598
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,526
- What?
- Do you want me to go first?

599
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:48,696
- You can go first.
- Okay.

600
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:50,096
Relax.

601
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:51,137
Okay.

602
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:52,867
In 1, 2, 3.

603
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,037
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

604
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:58,407
This is bad.

605
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,107
What did you do, Raccoon?

606
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,123
- I shouldn't have touched it.
- Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

607
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:04,547
Why did you touch it?

608
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,446
- It's zero.
- Okay.

609
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:08,316
- I feel so bad.
- Gosh.

610
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,556
I don't know what it is, but let's take a look...

611
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:14,026
- at the presents 1st.
- Yes, the present for Round 1.

612
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:15,056
If you open...

613
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,456
- the fortune cookie here.
- Yes.

614
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:17,697
It's huge.

615
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,997
The present gets bigger.

616
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:23,496
"We have business trips all over the country."

617
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:25,306
"We can't give up on our style."

618
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,466
"Like Jennie."

619
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,236
- "Gentle Monster sunglasses."
- Gosh.

620
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:29,997
(Round 1 present: Gentle Monster sunglasses)

621
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:32,207
They are Gentle Monster sunglasses.

622
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,607
- Gosh.
- This is for Sung Hee.

623
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:37,387
- You can try them on.
- Should I try them on?

624
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:39,186
- She looks good in them.
- Gosh.

625
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:40,586
- She looks good in them.
- She looks good in them.

626
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:41,916
- She looks good in them.
- Like Jennie?

627
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,516
- Yes, like Jennie.
- Like Jennie.

628
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:46,626
(Flying Hangers)

629
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,026
(Toss hangers...)

630
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:51,526
(and hang them on a clothes rack.)

631
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,996
(Round 1: Get 1 out of 10 hangers)

632
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:57,066
(However, everyone has to toss at least 1 hanger.)

633
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,606
We have to hang it on the rack?

634
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,636
(This is where they stand.)

635
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:02,877
- We have to hang it on the rack.
- We need to practice.

636
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:04,136
- How should we do this?
- Suk Ku.

637
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,277
How do I toss it?

638
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:06,907
This is difficult.

639
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,586
(Staring at Jae Suk)

640
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:13,316
Is it better to hold that side?

641
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:14,347
Like this.

642
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:15,956
(It's close.)

643
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,987
- How do we hang it?
- This is difficult.

644
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,426
- Maybe we should do this?
- It's too small.

645
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:20,633
Maybe we should throw it like this.

646
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:21,756
How about this?

647
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:23,757
- Should we do this?
- Make it turn a full circle.

648
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:26,297
- Wait a second.
- Let me try like this.

649
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,006
(All the hangers miss.)

650
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:35,207
- The hook is...
- Wait a second.

651
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:36,606
It's too small.

652
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,577
We need to find a way to do this.

653
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,706
I'll try like this. I just have to...

654
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:42,476
- keep my foot behind the line.
- Right.

655
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,693
(He just has to stay behind the line while tossing the hanger.)

656
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:46,477
- That's good.
- That's how we should do it.

657
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:48,517
- I see a possibility.
- That might work.

658
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:50,486
(Jae Suk tries practising like Suk Ku.)

659
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,587
Like Suk Ku.

660
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:54,257
Like Suk Ku.

661
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:55,727
Toss it high up.

662
00:21:57,697 --> 00:21:59,326
(He almost got it.)

663
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:01,227
- Like that?
- Yes, do it like that.

664
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,636
Do it like that.

665
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,067
I'll try this.

666
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:06,667
We have ten hangers in total.

667
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:09,136
Give him four, and...

668
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:10,907
- Did you get it?
- Almost.

669
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,477
Take four hangers.

670
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:18,886
It spins at the end and falls off.

671
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:20,017
- Let's see.
- All right.

672
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:22,687
Let's take 2, 2, 2, and 4.

673
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,426
- Suk Ku and Yeon Seok each take 3.
- We'll take 3 each.

674
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,227
- Da Mi and I will each take two.
- Okay.

675
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:29,026
Bring your hands in.

676
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,697
- Bring your hands in.
- Okay.

677
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:31,896
Should we say, "Jennie?"

678
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,266
- Come on.
- In 1, 2, 3.

679
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,497
- Jennie.
- Jennie.

680
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:37,237
We'll begin Round One.

681
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,206
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

682
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,906
- Here we go.
- In what order should we go?

683
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,277
- Should I go first?
- Go ahead.

684
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:43,983
- We'll start with Da Mi.
- Good luck.

685
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:45,247
Toss both.

686
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,246
Be confident.

687
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:48,247
Be confident.

688
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:52,316
(Thinking)

689
00:22:52,317 --> 00:22:53,616
(Remaining hangers: 9)

690
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:54,747
I missed.

691
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,756
- I just thought of something.
- What?

692
00:22:56,757 --> 00:22:58,756
- Should we toss it like this?
- All at once?

693
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,727
- All three at once?
- No.

694
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:03,397
That's reckless.

695
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:05,496
You're reckless.

696
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:07,257
(Recklessly dreaming of taking one big shot)

697
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,297
I'll go next.

698
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,536
(Remaining hangers: 8)

699
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:15,637
(Sad)

700
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:18,667
I should toss it more confidently.

701
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:24,276
(Remaining hangers: 7)

702
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,587
(It was close.)

703
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,386
- Try one more.
- This is yours.

704
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:29,987
- No, it's okay.
- No?

705
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,226
- It almost stayed on.
- Seriously.

706
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,756
Suk Ku, this is what you have to do.

707
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:35,826
- I'll go first.
- Go ahead.

708
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:37,347
- This is what you have to do.
- Okay.

709
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:41,496
(Remaining hangers: 6)

710
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,966
- Just a bit farther.
- I think it'll work.

711
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:43,996
Just a bit farther.

712
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:45,136
(Remaining hangers: 5)

713
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:46,306
- Gosh.
- Toss it a bit higher.

714
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:48,067
- Toss it a bit higher.
- Just a bit higher.

715
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:50,037
(Remaining hangers: 4)

716
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:51,806
I failed.

717
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,607
(Even Suk Ku fails.)

718
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,647
I'll just make it draw an arc.

719
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,447
There.

720
00:24:01,387 --> 00:24:02,686
- No, wait.
- What?

721
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:03,756
What if we toss it like this?

722
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:04,926
- What?
- What if we toss it like this?

723
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:06,426
How? Wait a second.

724
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,556
We only have one left. What do you want us to do?

725
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:08,696
- What do you want us to do?
- Take this.

726
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,697
Okay.

727
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,698
- What if we toss it like this?
- Push it forward?

728
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,767
- Push it forward?
- I don't think it'll work.

729
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:16,436
Do you want to reach out and hang it on the rack?

730
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:17,736
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second.

731
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,137
Wait, do this.

732
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,667
Hang it and pull back.

733
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,176
- Can we do this?
- No, stay behind the line.

734
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:24,307
- So we can't?
- Come on.

735
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:25,477
- Wait.
- We can't.

736
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,077
This is difficult.

737
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:28,617
Like this.

738
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:30,816
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

739
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,047
(Even Yeon Seok fails.)

740
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,386
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

741
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:34,586
(They fail on their first try.)

742
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:36,556
- This is difficult.
- This is Round One.

743
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:38,477
- We still have nine tries left.
- We can do it.

744
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,826
Wait a second.

745
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:40,927
(They practice again.)

746
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:43,456
- If we toss it too high, - That didn't work.

747
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,896
- it spins and falls off.
- This part gets in the way.

748
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:46,226
- Can I try that, Yeon Seok?
- We...

749
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:47,326
Can I toss them all at once?

750
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:49,096
- Give it a try.
- Try practising it.

751
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:50,937
- I have five hangers.
- Try it.

752
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:58,406
(Grunting)

753
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:00,107
Did you see that?

754
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:02,116
- You should at least touch the rim.
- Did you see that?

755
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:03,117
Suk Ku.

756
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:04,716
We know this doesn't work.

757
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:05,816
(He withdraws his strategy.)

758
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,986
Let's try a second time.

759
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,387
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

760
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,116
- This isn't a practice game.
- No.

761
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:12,226
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

762
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:13,356
(Remaining hangers: 10)

763
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:14,426
That's right.

764
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:17,096
(Remaining hangers: 9)

765
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,197
(Remaining hangers: 8)

766
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:23,496
- Be confident.
- Toss it just like this.

767
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:24,736
(Remaining hangers: 8)

768
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:26,767
(Suk Ku fails.)

769
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:28,376
- I'll go next.
- This is so difficult.

770
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:29,707
(The second player is Yeon Seok.)

771
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,407
Draw an arc like this.

772
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:36,417
Stable like this.

773
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,017
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

774
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:41,687
Good job.

775
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:42,987
What should we do?

776
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:45,327
I think we will randomly do it.

777
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,187
Da Mi might end up doing it.

778
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:55,967
This is my last one.

779
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:57,437
Please.

780
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,536
That's right.

781
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:00,607
- It worked!
- No.

782
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,176
- You almost did it.
- You did a good job.

783
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,306
You almost did it.

784
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:05,546
We've all gotten the hang of it.

785
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,807
(There are two hangers left.)

786
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:13,346
(Remaining hangers: 2)

787
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:14,347
(Remaining hangers: 1)

788
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:17,887
Let's say it worked.

789
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:20,287
Seriously.

790
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:22,756
- That was so close.
- She almost got it.

791
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:26,497
I still think tossing them all at once is the best strategy.

792
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,496
- All 10 of them?
- Yes, all 10.

793
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:30,896
They fall off even if we get them on the rack.

794
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,406
- So all 10 of them?
- Yes, all 10.

795
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,937
- For example...
- I have one left.

796
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,606
I still have 1 left for our 2nd try.

797
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:38,176
- I have 1 left, Suk Ku.
- We have 1 left.

798
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:42,117
(Remaining hanger: 1)

799
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,216
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

800
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,333
So you want to toss all of them at once?

801
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:52,956
We'll do this.

802
00:26:52,957 --> 00:26:55,527
- Tangle them together.
- If you don't toss it far enough...

803
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:57,256
- If you don't toss it far enough, - Yes?

804
00:26:57,257 --> 00:26:59,667
- then we'll fail in one try.
- If it isn't far enough?

805
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,466
- If you don't toss it far enough.
- Yeon Seok.

806
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,197
Suk Ku wants to try it.

807
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,606
Practice it first.

808
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:08,066
Today's game is very difficult.

809
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,307
Practice it, Suk Ku.

810
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:10,407
I'll try it.

811
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:12,807
All right.

812
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,147
We aren't playing yet. He's practising.

813
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:21,716
(Reading their faces)

814
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:24,156
Suk Ku has many interesting ideas.

815
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:25,387
What does your hunch say?

816
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:26,787
That we're doomed.

817
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:28,826
I'll try with three.

818
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,697
It'd be nice...

819
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:33,527
if it landed on the rack perfectly,

820
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,937
It worked. See? I told you this is the way to go.

821
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,877
(They finally get a hanger on the rack!)

822
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:48,377
It worked. See? I told you this is the way to go.

823
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,517
- I told you so.
- Hey.

824
00:27:51,077 --> 00:27:53,197
- Let's toss several at once.
- Toss several at once.

825
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:55,486
- I told you, Jae Suk.
- Let's toss several at once.

826
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:57,416
- It works as a buffer.
- That's right.

827
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,563
- The other hangers work as buffers.
- They work as buffers.

828
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:00,887
- Wait.
- Let's try it.

829
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,697
They work as buffers and stop them from spinning off.

830
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:05,096
- Let's not play this time.
- Watch me.

831
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,297
- That won't work.
- Watch me.

832
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:10,397
(He gets 2 hangers on the rack!)

833
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:12,736
This works.

834
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:15,376
- See? I told you.
- It works.

835
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,836
- You were right.
- I was right.

836
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:18,277
- It works.
- He was right.

837
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:19,877
- This is the way to go.
- Yes.

838
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,406
It works.

839
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:24,317
I got two hangers on the rack.

840
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:26,287
Let's toss five at a time.

841
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:28,447
- Wait, Jae Suk.
- This is good.

842
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:29,856
- We got this.
- It'll work.

843
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:31,987
- We got this.
- This is amazing.

844
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,726
- We found a way to do it.
- Awesome.

845
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:36,756
- Then...
- All right.

846
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,697
- Let's toss 1, 1, 3, and 5.
- Okay.

847
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:40,466
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

848
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,467
- One.
- Yes.

849
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:42,766
- This is our fourth try.
- I'll just...

850
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,367
- I'll toss mine away.
- No.

851
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:46,737
You didn't have to do that.

852
00:28:47,137 --> 00:28:49,106
- I...
- Why did you throw it away?

853
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:51,306
- I'm betting everything on this.
- Why did you throw it away?

854
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:52,706
(He just dreams of taking one big shot!)

855
00:28:52,707 --> 00:28:54,007
That surprised me.

856
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:56,477
- Go ahead. Try your best.
- Okay.

857
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,886
(Remaining hangers: 9)

858
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:00,946
Good job.

859
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,456
Sometimes what worked while practising...

860
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,386
- doesn't work in the real game.
- You might end it here.

861
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:05,457
He has three hangers.

862
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:07,047
- Do what you did earlier.
- Wait.

863
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:08,756
- Good luck.
- I can't toss it too lightly.

864
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:10,426
- Go ahead.
- I can't toss it too lightly.

865
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:12,196
I have to make it to the rack.

866
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,957
(He just has to get one hanger on the rack.)

867
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:18,706
(Remaining hangers: 8)

868
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,206
(It was close, but he failed.)

869
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,706
It's okay, we still have one more chance.

870
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:23,836
(His shoulders feel extremely heavy.)

871
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:26,006
- We were just...
- He's tossing five at once.

872
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,577
- We were the build up.
- He'll do it at once.

873
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:30,253
- Two or three, Jae Suk?
- This is it.

874
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,376
- Wait.
- Two or three?

875
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:33,247
Tossing all five at once? Wait.

876
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,586
- Go, Jae Suk.
- Go, Jae Suk.

877
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:36,517
You have to make it to the rack, Jae Suk.

878
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:38,726
I tossed it earlier...

879
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,726
- without feeling pressured at all.
- Just go for it.

880
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:41,826
Pretend you're practising.

881
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,256
- Okay.
- Go, Jae Suk.

882
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:44,297
Let's go.

883
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:45,967
(Five hangers)

884
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:51,237
(Please!)

885
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,216
(They fail on their fourth try.)

886
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,247
It's okay.

887
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:06,917
Let's try right away.

888
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:08,547
You can toss seven.

889
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:11,887
That gives him a higher chance of succeeding.

890
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:14,687
Why don't you try it?

891
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:17,097
- Jae Suk.
- You try seven at once, Suk Ku.

892
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:18,966
- I'll try it.
- Here. This is seven.

893
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,226
- The rest of us each take one.
- Two...

894
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:22,966
- Here you go.
- This is 2, 4, 6, 7.

895
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:24,566
- Okay.
- All right. Bring your hands in.

896
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,236
- Come on.
- No.

897
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:28,107
- Can we not do this?
- Let's do it.

898
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:30,406
- Let's do it.
- He's overwhelmed.

899
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:32,206
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go.

900
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,376
This makes me more nervous.

901
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:34,846
This is our fifth try. Here we go!

902
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,417
- He's suddenly sweating.
- It's okay.

903
00:30:37,517 --> 00:30:38,577
Do what you did earlier.

904
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,217
Please make it work.

905
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:41,646
- Are you playing?
- Yes.

906
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:42,887
Let's feel a burst of dopamine.

907
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:48,767
Let's feel a burst of dopamine.

908
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,797
(It worked!)

909
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:01,707
(Suk Ku did it!)

910
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,847
(Screaming)

911
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:14,017
(His one-shot strategy worked.)

912
00:31:14,387 --> 00:31:17,117
- It worked.
- It worked.

913
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,157
- We did it.
- We succeeded.

914
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:21,686
- Awesome.
- You did it.

915
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,256
Hey, Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

916
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,827
(Yangjae Stream Raccoon wins it in one try!)

917
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:29,236
- That was awesome.
- It worked.

918
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,967
- That was very difficult.
- Gosh.

919
00:31:31,437 --> 00:31:33,266
- That was Round One.
- Gosh.

920
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:36,077
You get the sunglasses.

921
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,346
Like Sonnie.

922
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:40,606
However,

923
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,906
you have to decide...

924
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:44,246
whether to go onto Round Two or not.

925
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,216
- Right.
- You saw how hard it was.

926
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:48,686
- But we did find a way to do it.
- Yes.

927
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:50,086
Okay.

928
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,316
In 1, 2, 3.

929
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,727
Go.

930
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,186
- What? Go?
- Wait.

931
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,956
- We should keep going.
- We should keep going.

932
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,167
- Please clear one more round.
- Okay.

933
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,096
This is really tough.

934
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,136
- What is it?
- Awesome.

935
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,166
- There are four.
- I know.

936
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,606
"I have to care for my skin while keeping up with the trend."

937
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:09,237
"Four beauty devices from Medicube."

938
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,076
- You should care for your skin.
- Yes.

939
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:13,577
How many are there? There are four.

940
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:15,646
- There are 4.
- Yes, there are 4.

941
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:16,776
Gosh, look at that.

942
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:19,446
(Beauty device for skincare)

943
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,386
(4 beauty devices)

944
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:24,556
(Round 2: Get 2 hangers on the rack)

945
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,586
- What?
- We need to get two hangers.

946
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:27,756
Should we toss all ten at once?

947
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:30,077
- That's the only thing we can do.
- Toss all ten at once?

948
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,526
But we all have to toss one.

949
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:33,096
- That's right.
- Right.

950
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,496
- How about 4, 4, 1, and 1?
- Yes.

951
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:35,866
What do you think about tossing 4, 4, 1, and 1?

952
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,667
- Let's practice.
- Let me try tossing seven.

953
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,666
- He's so funny.
- He's all about one shot.

954
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,037
He became way too confident.

955
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:45,077
Succeeding in Round One...

956
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:46,476
has pushed him...

957
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:48,347
- to the edge of a cliff.
- I have seven.

958
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:51,957
- It works at times like these.
- You're right.

959
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:57,287
It fell apart.

960
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,286
If you don't toss it far enough,

961
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,196
- you lose all the hangers at once.
- Right.

962
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,457
Should we have 2 people toss 4?

963
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,596
- Da Mi, try tossing 4.
- Should I toss 4?

964
00:33:06,597 --> 00:33:09,636
If we split it between two people...

965
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,136
- You can try four each.
- Okay.

966
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:12,707
- Four each?
- Yes, four each.

967
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:14,907
- Four sounds good.
- Did you do it?

968
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:16,507
- Four each?
- Yes, four each.

969
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:18,577
(She got 2 out of 4!)

970
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,376
- What did you do?
- How did you do it?

971
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,347
- Da Mi.
- Da Mi.

972
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,176
(Surprised)

973
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:26,586
- What?
- Da Mi.

974
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,186
What did you do? How did you do it?

975
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:30,087
- Da Mi, what did you do?
- Da Mi.

976
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:31,986
- How did you do it?
- Don't wait.

977
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,803
- She just tossed all four.
- Start right away.

978
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,027
Start right away, Da Mi.

979
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:36,796
We have no time to wait.

980
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:38,596
- Toss four.
- I don't think I can do it.

981
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:40,567
- Hurry up, Da Mi.
- Let's keep this going.

982
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:41,767
Right now.

983
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,296
You have to toss it when you've got the hang of it.

984
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,166
It's Round Two.

985
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,366
This is our 6th try. In 1, 2, 3.

986
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,367
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

987
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:49,736
Do what you just did.

988
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,697
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

989
00:33:58,747 --> 00:33:59,847
I'm so nervous.

990
00:34:01,187 --> 00:34:02,586
Just go for it.

991
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:04,716
- Think of it as practice.
- You got this.

992
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,457
- Think of it as practice.
- You got this.

993
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,227
(The variety show rookie faces a harsh situation.)

994
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,966
(Remaining hangers: 10)

995
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,107
We still have six left.

996
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,736
Let's have Suk Ku toss four.

997
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:26,546
- Okay.
- You and I each toss one.

998
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:29,246
(Remaining hangers: 6)

999
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,746
(Remaining hangers: 5)

1000
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:33,916
- I'll get one on the rack.
- Okay.

1001
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:36,286
I'll get one on the rack. I can get it on the rack.

1002
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:37,357
I just toss it like this.

1003
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:39,787
Draw an arc and land stably.

1004
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:42,087
Like this.

1005
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:45,256
Good job.

1006
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:46,826
(Remaining hangers: 4)

1007
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:48,347
- Okay.
- It's Yangjae Stream Raccoon.

1008
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:55,007
You never know.

1009
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,407
You got this!

1010
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:02,877
(You got this!)

1011
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,047
You got this!

1012
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:09,187
You got this!

1013
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:13,526
(Try number six is a failure.)

1014
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:14,856
That was good.

1015
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,796
We have four tries left.

1016
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:18,296
From what I saw,

1017
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:20,417
I think we should continue going with four at a time.

1018
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:21,997
I'll go like this...

1019
00:35:22,597 --> 00:35:25,537
I'll take one. Someone...

1020
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:28,707
- Hey.
- She got three.

1021
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,007
Someone...

1022
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,806
- Hey.
- She got three.

1023
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:34,807
- She got three.
- Da Mi.

1024
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:37,447
Go ahead right now.

1025
00:35:38,517 --> 00:35:39,987
- Da Mi.
- Da Mi.

1026
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,517
- Do that again.
- Go ahead right now.

1027
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,686
- Start right away.
- Hurry up.

1028
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:46,486
- Come here, Da Mi.
- Da Mi.

1029
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:48,486
- Toss it right away.
- We'll start.

1030
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:50,856
- Toss it right away.
- She the ace.

1031
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,096
Should we each toss 1 and give her 7?

1032
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:56,596
- No.
- I think four is good.

1033
00:35:56,597 --> 00:35:58,466
- Did you get 3 out of 4?
- Yes, 3 out of 4.

1034
00:35:58,467 --> 00:35:59,936
- Try tossing four again.
- Wait.

1035
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:01,836
- Let's practice again.
- No, just try.

1036
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:03,606
- No.
- Let's try, Yeon Seok.

1037
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:05,807
- Let's practice.
- No.

1038
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:07,977
"Here we go." This is what we'll do.

1039
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:09,946
- Go ahead.
- Here.

1040
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:12,016
- Look.
- Go ahead and practice.

1041
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:13,817
- This is try number seven.
- Okay.

1042
00:36:13,947 --> 00:36:16,186
- What should I do?
- We're practising.

1043
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:17,617
Imagine that this is practice.

1044
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:21,027
Please.

1045
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,266
- Yes!
- Yes!

1046
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,467
I did it.

1047
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:34,966
(She hung 1.)

1048
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,536
- How many did you throw?
- Four.

1049
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:37,907
Four? We have six left, then.

1050
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:40,076
- We have 6 left, so you do 4.
- We have 6 left, right?

1051
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:41,377
- No.
- You should throw four.

1052
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,876
- Me?
- Yes. Four.

1053
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:46,117
No, I don't think I'll make it this time.

1054
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:48,346
- You should do it.
- Four for me?

1055
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:49,586
I'll go last, then.

1056
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:51,416
- Throw one each.
- I'll give it a shot.

1057
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,626
(Remaining hangers: 6)

1058
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:54,887
(Suk Ku failed.)

1059
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:57,126
(He's only waiting for that one shot.)

1060
00:36:57,127 --> 00:37:01,197
(Remaining hangers: 5)

1061
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:03,737
All right.

1062
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:07,307
(Yeon Seok is the last player.)

1063
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:14,107
(They succeed if he hangs 1 more.)

1064
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:18,977
No!

1065
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:20,547
That was so close.

1066
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:23,517
No!

1067
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:26,086
- That was so close.
- So close.

1068
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:27,367
(Try number seven is a failure.)

1069
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:30,327
(That was so close.)

1070
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,866
- It hit the bar, though.
- Now,

1071
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:34,867
we...

1072
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,636
Which attempt was that?

1073
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:37,877
It's time for try number eight.

1074
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:39,907
We'll have Da Mi throw four again.

1075
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,206
- Let's practice.
- Da Mi should throw four.

1076
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,276
- Four. Da Mi.
- Practice...

1077
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:46,953
- Yes, I'll practice again.
- Try four again.

1078
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:48,476
Then, we'll have Da Mi go last.

1079
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,876
- Yes, you should go last.
- She practised,

1080
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:51,516
- so she'll throw four in the end.
- Okay.

1081
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:52,617
Either of you...

1082
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:55,346
- Do you want to throw 4?
- I'll try 4.

1083
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:57,063
And you'll throw four hangers in our last attempt.

1084
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:58,616
- Okay.
- This is try number eight, right?

1085
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:00,386
- Yes.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1086
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:01,426
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1087
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:03,387
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

1088
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:06,927
I should at least hang one.

1089
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:27,217
(He hung 2 hangers in 1 go!)

1090
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,787
(They succeeded right away.)

1091
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:35,727
(Cheering)

1092
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,856
- No way!
- No way!

1093
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:40,166
This is awesome!

1094
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,267
(They passed Round 2.)

1095
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,936
- Awesome.
- We did it.

1096
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:45,166
(Jae Suk has done it.)

1097
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,766
I did it.

1098
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,336
(The gambler is impressed.)

1099
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:49,377
Amazing.

1100
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:51,937
- Success.
- That was a success.

1101
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:55,176
- You even won the beauty device!
- Yes!

1102
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:56,653
(They won the sunglasses and the beauty device.)

1103
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:58,516
- That was insane.
- Gosh.

1104
00:38:58,517 --> 00:38:59,517
So...

1105
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:01,387
I think you need to stop now.

1106
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:03,256
- You know, - Goodness.

1107
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,316
- the prizes get better, but...
- Right.

1108
00:39:05,317 --> 00:39:06,657
You might lose all of them.

1109
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:08,986
You should have a discussion.

1110
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:11,126
- Yes.
- You have four beauty devices,

1111
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:12,297
so have a discussion...

1112
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,097
and choose whether to go or stop.

1113
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,136
- Stop?
- What do we do?

1114
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:21,337
- We'll...
- In 1, 2, 3.

1115
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:22,807
- Stop.
- Stop!

1116
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:25,607
- Good choice.
- Good choice.

1117
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:26,977
Good job.

1118
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:32,346
So, the four of them won...

1119
00:39:32,347 --> 00:39:35,717
- Sunglasses and beauty devices.
- Beauty devices!

1120
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:38,556
- Rest your fatigued skin.
- Yes.

1121
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:40,586
- Also, - Thank you.

1122
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,796
- can I give them coupons?
- What kinds of coupons?

1123
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,556
- What is it?
- We brought gifts.

1124
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:45,796
- What are they?
- For them.

1125
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:46,797
(A special present from Da Mi and Suk Ku)

1126
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:48,343
Oh, coupons for the streaming platform!

1127
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:49,437
I have four.

1128
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:51,296
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1129
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:54,236
- It's a three-month subscription.
- Thank you so much.

1130
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,667
- Really?
- Yes.

1131
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:57,336
- That's a relief.
- That's a relief.

1132
00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:59,977
- That was...
- I never expected to win.

1133
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:01,546
I can't believe we made it.

1134
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,876
And Suk Ku's quick thinking was...

1135
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,146
- Yes. Suk Ku!
- Totally.

1136
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:07,516
- It wasn't so bad, right?
- You did great.

1137
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:09,217
- I'm glad we succeeded.
- Great.

1138
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,086
- I never thought we'd make it.
- Me neither.

1139
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:12,256
- Suk Ku.
- Yes.

1140
00:40:12,257 --> 00:40:14,287
Da Mi. Amazing.

1141
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:16,026
He's really quick-witted.

1142
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,326
I never even thought of that.

1143
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,696
- I thought it was reckless.
- I know.

1144
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:19,697
Throwing a bunch of them...

1145
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:22,066
It looked like it was never going to work otherwise.

1146
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:23,467
Were you an engineering major?

1147
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,236
No.

1148
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:27,767
- He's from the casino in "Big Bet."
- I am.

1149
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:29,276
That was incredible.

1150
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:30,306
(The gambler's bold performance)

1151
00:40:30,307 --> 00:40:31,536
Now,

1152
00:40:31,537 --> 00:40:33,476
let's check out our second Whenever Guest...

1153
00:40:33,477 --> 00:40:34,976
and check the time.

1154
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,877
- All right. The second guest.
- Thank you.

1155
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:38,946
(Ahn Hee Jin and Ahn Hee Geun, from 3 to 4:30pm)

1156
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:40,316
- They have the same last name.
- What?

1157
00:40:40,317 --> 00:40:42,447
"Ahn Hee Jin and Ahn Hee Geun."

1158
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,686
"I have an older brother..."

1159
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:46,786
"who can get really angry at times but is always on my side."

1160
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:48,986
"And I'm the loyal supply officer little brother..."

1161
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:50,456
"who follows him, no matter what."

1162
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:51,527
He's a supply officer?

1163
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:52,927
Is he a soldier?

1164
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:57,066
"Both brothers are fathers of two,"

1165
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,806
"but we still spend 12 hours together every day."

1166
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,306
"Come to our little playground,"

1167
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:04,376
"Little California in Dogok-dong."

1168
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:05,507
"Little California?"

1169
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:07,597
- "Little California?"
- Is it a restaurant?

1170
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:08,947
When do we have to get there?

1171
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:11,046
The appointed time is 3pm.

1172
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:13,446
- We should have lunch, then.
- We should eat first.

1173
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:15,463
Suk Ku and Da Mi, is there anything you want to eat?

1174
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:16,986
You said you knew a good restaurant.

1175
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:20,257
But this is...

1176
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,656
We have to walk a little far from here.

1177
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:25,357
I know a place that sells great tacos and burgers.

1178
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:26,866
- That sounds great.
- Which way is it?

1179
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:28,907
- Do you like the sound of that?
- Which way is it?

1180
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,667
Do you prefer tacos or burgers?

1181
00:41:31,237 --> 00:41:33,106
- Tacos.
- Tacos?

1182
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:34,467
- I like tacos.
- Tacos?

1183
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:37,336
Shall we get going, then? But I'm not sure if I can navigate.

1184
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:39,276
We can take the bus too. We have bus cards.

1185
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:40,846
- Should we?
- Yes. We can take the bus.

1186
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:42,047
I'll look up the route.

1187
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:45,117
This place has great tacos.

1188
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:47,117
- Which is it?
- Here.

1189
00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:50,716
It's called Queens Blvd.

1190
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,726
- Great.
- I think it's pretty close.

1191
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,127
- It's not that far.
- Where is it?

1192
00:41:54,257 --> 00:41:55,456
How do you see the address?

1193
00:41:55,457 --> 00:41:57,556
You need to look it up on the map.

1194
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:58,727
The name of the restaurant.

1195
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,066
We need to check the next destination too.

1196
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:04,267
- Sure.
- If it's the other way,

1197
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:06,407
- we may not make it on time.
- Right.

1198
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:08,106
Good. Good idea.

1199
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,307
- We'll check the route first.
- You're certainly good.

1200
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:11,677
You're a smart man.

1201
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:13,906
- Let's check it first.
- I'm sure there are other places.

1202
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,146
- Yes, we need to get there on time.
- He's right.

1203
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,816
(Checking the route accurately)

1204
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:18,877
Where is it?

1205
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:20,946
It's in the neighbourhood.

1206
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:22,087
Really?

1207
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:25,417
It's pretty tough to get there with public transportation.

1208
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:29,057
I chose the wrong outfit. It wasn't right for this occasion.

1209
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:31,356
But it's pretty cold in the morning.

1210
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:32,426
- That's true.
- Right.

1211
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,597
In the morning and evening.

1212
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,736
I was in the US until the day before yesterday.

1213
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:38,173
So I didn't know the weather in Korea.

1214
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:40,167
I never expected it to be so hot.

1215
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,336
It started getting hotter yesterday afternoon.

1216
00:42:42,337 --> 00:42:43,337
(Navi Yoo is still searching.)

1217
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:44,607
When did you arrive yesterday?

1218
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:47,176
- I arrived early in the morning.
- Suk Ku!

1219
00:42:47,177 --> 00:42:48,407
I got up... Yes?

1220
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:50,717
It's the same building.

1221
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:52,886
- Maybe that's our destination.
- What?

1222
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:54,546
Wait. The restaurant and the next spare time spot...

1223
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:55,586
are in the same building.

1224
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:56,856
- Maybe it's that place.
- Seriously?

1225
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:59,387
Maybe they learned how to make tacos in California.

1226
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:02,287
What?

1227
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:03,597
Suk Ku.

1228
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:05,597
It can't be.

1229
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:07,527
Are you serious?

1230
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:10,036
(Checking it again)

1231
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:11,067
Wait.

1232
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,807
Is this for real?

1233
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,336
I think they're in the same building.

1234
00:43:15,337 --> 00:43:16,377
Let's just go.

1235
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:17,937
We might be wrong.

1236
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:19,376
Hang on. Queens Blvd.

1237
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:21,246
(Spare time spot and restaurant)

1238
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:22,407
Check the address.

1239
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:24,216
- It's the same building?
- It is!

1240
00:43:24,217 --> 00:43:25,276
It is?

1241
00:43:25,277 --> 00:43:26,946
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

1242
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:29,117
- The next guests asked us...
- That's fascinating.

1243
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:31,156
- What...
- I think the next guests...

1244
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:33,486
- Did they ask us to come there?
- asked us to be there.

1245
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:35,126
- They wrote something...
- Why didn't you tell us to change?

1246
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:36,456
About California.

1247
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:38,627
- I had no idea.
- We were surprised when he said it.

1248
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:39,727
Really?

1249
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:40,727
(Genuinely surprised)

1250
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:41,966
Then, we should eat something else.

1251
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,036
We should go there, then.

1252
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,266
We can eat there and meet them there.

1253
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:45,267
Sure.

1254
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:46,436
I think we can do that.

1255
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:47,506
(This happened for the first time on our show.)

1256
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:49,576
The owners of the place asked us to be there?

1257
00:43:49,577 --> 00:43:51,036
(The restaurant they picked was the next spare time spot.)

1258
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,997
- That's so interesting.
- That's so interesting.

1259
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,047
- It must be your lucky day.
- Suk Ku.

1260
00:43:55,577 --> 00:43:57,337
Everything is on point except for my outfit.

1261
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,616
I think your show is going to be a huge hit.

1262
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:01,016
I thought it was weird...

1263
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:03,216
- I hope it's a huge hit.
- because they were so close,

1264
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:04,617
and they were in the same building.

1265
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:05,986
- It's that place.
- Let's go.

1266
00:44:05,987 --> 00:44:07,626
- Let's go.
- Let's go, then.

1267
00:44:07,627 --> 00:44:08,786
(They move to eat and to meet the next guests.)

1268
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:11,096
This is amazing. How did I pick that restaurant?

1269
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:12,656
You have such accurate instincts today.

1270
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:14,967
- I know.
- They'll be surprised to see you.

1271
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,437
- But...
- I was so surprised.

1272
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,196
- But...
- Yes?

1273
00:44:19,197 --> 00:44:21,837
What are the chances of that happening?

1274
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:26,007
Suk Ku asked us, "Do you want tacos or burgers?"

1275
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:27,946
And you said you liked tacos.

1276
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:29,616
How did it turn out to be the exact restaurant?

1277
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:33,817
It was the same building our next guests asked us to come to.

1278
00:44:34,717 --> 00:44:36,437
- So...
- Because Yeon Seok looked it up...

1279
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,986
- our next appointed time is 3pm.
- Yes.

1280
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,826
- We'll eat, and...
- We'll eat...

1281
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:43,426
- Let's just eat first.
- without interviewing them.

1282
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:45,227
- We'll eat first.
- Yes.

1283
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:47,596
And we can start the interview at 3pm.

1284
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,696
- Yes.
- We'll eat with a straight face.

1285
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:51,736
- Of course.
- We're there as customers.

1286
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:52,796
They're still in business.

1287
00:44:52,797 --> 00:44:54,666
- Don't ask them any questions.
- No.

1288
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:56,977
- Promise me.
- I don't even have any questions.

1289
00:44:57,977 --> 00:44:59,976
I start working only when the cameras are rolling.

1290
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:01,246
(He clearly separates business from personal matters.)

1291
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:05,117
- This is our break.
- Indeed.

1292
00:45:05,977 --> 00:45:08,987
I hope we succeed in the mission...

1293
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:10,816
for these guests.

1294
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:11,986
- I know, right?
- Yes.

1295
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:13,856
How... Oh, did you mean the prizes?

1296
00:45:13,857 --> 00:45:15,126
Yes, the prizes.

1297
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:17,256
- You're a regular there, so...
- Yes.

1298
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,796
He's a regular. That's fascinating.

1299
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:21,996
- It's such a trendy place.
- Really?

1300
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:23,397
- Really?
- Yes.

1301
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:24,996
It must have a Californian vibe.

1302
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:26,736
It does. I thought that...

1303
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,406
every time I went there.

1304
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:30,607
I believed the person who designed the place...

1305
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:33,446
spent some time abroad.

1306
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:34,747
I used to think that.

1307
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:37,916
- Da Mi is...
- Yes?

1308
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:39,517
A good listener.

1309
00:45:39,787 --> 00:45:41,286
- She has good reactions.
- She does.

1310
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:42,316
- Do I?
- Yes.

1311
00:45:42,317 --> 00:45:44,186
(Laughing)

1312
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:46,327
You should be on variety shows from time to time.

1313
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:48,026
- Da Mi, you should be...
- Yes?

1314
00:45:48,027 --> 00:45:49,226
- on more variety shows.
- She's such a good listener.

1315
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:50,626
I'm not such a good talker, though.

1316
00:45:50,627 --> 00:45:52,396
What are you talking about?

1317
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:53,566
(Laughing)

1318
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,096
- Empathizing, listening, - Exactly.

1319
00:45:56,097 --> 00:45:57,837
And reacting. Those are all you need.

1320
00:45:58,537 --> 00:46:00,806
She listens so well during shoots.

1321
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:04,107
- Right.
- Also, she gives great solutions.

1322
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:07,007
Da Mi, you get a lot of calls from your friends...

1323
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:09,347
when they're going through stuff, don't you?

1324
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:10,647
- Me?
- Yes.

1325
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:14,187
- I don't have that many friends.
- No?

1326
00:46:14,747 --> 00:46:16,517
(Oh, well.)

1327
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:18,186
That happens.

1328
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,787
I don't have that many friends either.

1329
00:46:21,257 --> 00:46:22,356
- Yeon Seok.
- Yes?

1330
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:24,496
- How close are we?
- It's just around the corner now.

1331
00:46:24,497 --> 00:46:26,056
No need to look at the map now. I know the way.

1332
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:27,296
- To the left?
- Yes.

1333
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:28,366
Do we take a left?

1334
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:29,766
- It'll be in that alley.
- Yes.

1335
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,537
You'll find it right in that alley.

1336
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:34,806
I'm hungry.

1337
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:36,206
The tacos...

1338
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:37,576
They also have great burritos.

1339
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:39,457
- They have a variety.
- That sounds delicious.

1340
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,546
- Oh, they also have burritos?
- Yes.

1341
00:46:41,547 --> 00:46:42,577
(Gulping)

1342
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:46,217
Ever since I was little, I've always loved Mexican food...

1343
00:46:47,017 --> 00:46:49,516
- and Southeast Asian food.
- Have you?

1344
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:50,586
I also like them.

1345
00:46:50,587 --> 00:46:52,787
- Do you like cilantro?
- I love cilantro.

1346
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:54,956
Do you eat cilantro?

1347
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:57,356
- I don't avoid it, - Okay.

1348
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,727
But I don't look for it either.

1349
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:04,137
Do you leave out cilantro in tacos?

1350
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,197
No, I ask them not to put it in.

1351
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:08,007
That's the same thing.

1352
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:11,376
- Don't you get what I mean?
- That's leaving out cilantro.

1353
00:47:11,377 --> 00:47:13,407
I'm saying that I don't add it on purpose.

1354
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:16,276
- Do you get it, Da Mi?
- That means you can't eat it.

1355
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:17,976
That's not it. It's different.

1356
00:47:17,977 --> 00:47:19,246
- I'll explain again.
- That means you can't eat it.

1357
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,687
- So, you do eat it.
- If it's there when I didn't know,

1358
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:23,247
I eat it as I don't have a choice.

1359
00:47:23,687 --> 00:47:25,916
But if they're making it in front of me,

1360
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:27,087
I ask them not to add it.

1361
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:30,027
- You don't love it, but...
- But I don't avoid it.

1362
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,856
Do you get what I mean now?

1363
00:47:31,857 --> 00:47:33,166
It just means I'm picky.

1364
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,797
- You get it now, don't you?
- Yes.

1365
00:47:36,397 --> 00:47:38,337
- So, yes.
- To the left.

1366
00:47:38,437 --> 00:47:40,536
Filming in a neighbourhood that I go to every day...

1367
00:47:40,537 --> 00:47:41,837
This place is good.

1368
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:43,407
Feels funny.

1369
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:45,006
Should we go this way?

1370
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:46,707
- I think it's this way.
- It is.

1371
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,606
- Where is it?
- There it is!

1372
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:49,817
- Where?
- The sign.

1373
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,216
It does look like a restaurant in California.

1374
00:47:51,217 --> 00:47:53,146
Oh, there it is.

1375
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:55,246
(Amazed)

1376
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,886
- There are so many coffee shops.
- It's nice.

1377
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,287
- This is it.
- There it is.

1378
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:00,787
I get what you mean now.

1379
00:48:02,027 --> 00:48:03,226
Right? It's got the vibe.

1380
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:04,903
(Arriving at Suk Ku's favourite taco place)

1381
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:06,526
Is it break time?

1382
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:08,367
We were supposed to get here...

1383
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:09,997
At 3pm.

1384
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:11,666
But it's 2pm now.

1385
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,897
(It's before the spare time.)

1386
00:48:14,507 --> 00:48:15,736
- Is anyone here?
- Hi.

1387
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:17,537
- What?
- Hi.

1388
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:19,237
Ahn Hee Jin and Ahn Hee Geun.

1389
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,007
They're here.

1390
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:23,416
- Hello.
- What?

1391
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,776
(Laughing)

1392
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,077
It feels...

1393
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,787
a bit like LA.

1394
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:31,287
Hello.

1395
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:33,487
- Hello.
- Hee Jin?

1396
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:35,427
Hee Geun?

1397
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:36,796
- Hello.
- Oh, the brothers.

1398
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,296
You two look alike.

1399
00:48:38,297 --> 00:48:41,896
You asked us to be here...

1400
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:44,067
- at 3pm, - Yes.

1401
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:47,467
But we were going to have lunch before that.

1402
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:50,306
And Suk Ku said there was...

1403
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:52,336
a good taco place nearby...

1404
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:54,106
and suggested that we eat there. So, we came,

1405
00:48:54,107 --> 00:48:55,676
- It was this place.
- and it was this place.

1406
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:56,677
That's insane!

1407
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:01,287
- It's not the spare time yet, - Right.

1408
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:04,856
- but if we can eat...
- Of course.

1409
00:49:04,857 --> 00:49:06,356
- Will that be all right?
- Of course.

1410
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:08,226
- We'll just eat first.
- Then...

1411
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:09,456
We'll find another restaurant...

1412
00:49:09,457 --> 00:49:11,156
- if we're interrupting.
- Yes, we can go elsewhere.

1413
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,396
- No, it's totally fine.
- Are you sure?

1414
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:13,866
- Yes.
- We'll take a table, then.

1415
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,997
Yes, sit wherever you like.

1416
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,637
Where should we sit?

1417
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:19,597
We'll just have lunch for now.

1418
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:22,437
I can't wait.

1419
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:25,237
Sometimes, you crave this type of food.

1420
00:49:25,777 --> 00:49:27,376
- This looks good too.
- It's so delicious.

1421
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,946
- What is it?
- It's on top of French fries.

1422
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:31,377
Suk Ku, choose the food for us.

1423
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,046
- Me?
- Yes.

1424
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,447
I normally order a lot of food.

1425
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,056
A regular pork burrito...

1426
00:49:39,057 --> 00:49:40,556
- And...
- I want shrimp tacos.

1427
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,186
- Two tacos?
- Yes, two tacos.

1428
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,456
And you'll order this too, right?

1429
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:44,757
- Yes, fries.
- Yes.

1430
00:49:45,057 --> 00:49:46,866
I want a chicken burrito.

1431
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:48,666
- I'll order three chicken tacos...
- Yes.

1432
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,037
- and eat two.
- Three? Good.

1433
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,396
- Chili con carne.
- That sounds good.

1434
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:53,836
I think it's a type of meat that you scoop.

1435
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:54,837
That sounds tasty.

1436
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:56,636
- So, this one.
- I'll go and order the food.

1437
00:49:56,637 --> 00:49:57,637
Okay.

1438
00:49:58,477 --> 00:49:59,847
Can I order?

1439
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,476
- And one of these.
- Okay.

1440
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:03,547
Okay.

1441
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:07,747
(Snapping)

1442
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:10,986
(Jae Suk is working on something.)

1443
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:12,157
It's a lot.

1444
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:13,957
This is LA.

1445
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:16,327
- Totally.
- It's LA.

1446
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:18,797
Post a picture saying that you're in LA.

1447
00:50:20,097 --> 00:50:21,267
It definitely looks like LA.

1448
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:23,797
It's been so long since I last went to LA.

1449
00:50:24,537 --> 00:50:26,037
New York was so lovely, though.

1450
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:28,406
- Did you go?
- I went for the first time.

1451
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:29,506
- It was your first time?
- New York?

1452
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:34,107
I did live in upstate New York when I was little,

1453
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:37,217
but I had never been downtown or in Manhattan.

1454
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:40,416
I went there and watched a show by Denzel Washington.

1455
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,517
Really?

1456
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:43,286
A play?

1457
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:44,757
It's a play. "Othello."

1458
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:46,386
- You watched "Othello?"
- Yes.

1459
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:48,357
- Denzel Washington was in that?
- Yes.

1460
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:51,156
How should I put it?

1461
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:53,267
It was like watching a concert by Denzel Washington.

1462
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,196
I couldn't even concentrate on the plot.

1463
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:57,337
- You know Jake Gyllenhaal, right?
- Yes.

1464
00:50:57,437 --> 00:50:59,367
He and Jake Gyllenhaal perform together.

1465
00:50:59,537 --> 00:51:01,306
Of course, there are other actors too.

1466
00:51:01,307 --> 00:51:03,937
But I was dazed by Denzel Washington the whole time.

1467
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:07,077
- His charisma is unbelievable.
- I didn't know he was in a play.

1468
00:51:07,877 --> 00:51:09,276
(The drinks and nachos come first.)

1469
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:11,677
We heard that Suk Ku was a regular here.

1470
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:13,487
I saw him play a video game here.

1471
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:15,546
- You played that, didn't you?
- Yes.

1472
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:18,357
- Did he?
- He played as he waited.

1473
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,426
- It's so delicious.
- Thank you.

1474
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:22,257
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1475
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:24,897
(He takes a bite of nachos right away.)

1476
00:51:25,557 --> 00:51:27,266
It's nice to eat this once in a while.

1477
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:28,627
They have great nachos.

1478
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:30,836
It's so good.

1479
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,537
I know a great taco place in LA.

1480
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:37,876
They stop selling alcohol past 2am.

1481
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:39,176
Do they?

1482
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:42,647
So, we go to cure our hangovers with tacos.

1483
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:44,476
- I see.
- Because they open until late.

1484
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:47,047
There's a long line past 2am there.

1485
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:49,316
I heard they had kimchi tacos in the US.

1486
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:51,156
I've never tried kimchi tacos, though.

1487
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:53,427
- But the sauce is amazing.
- Da Mi...

1488
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:55,427
responds so well when she listens.

1489
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:59,726
Every time you speak, she responds.

1490
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:01,527
My story about the taco place in LA...

1491
00:52:02,027 --> 00:52:03,797
She listens so attentively.

1492
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:05,897
- She doesn't miss a single detail.
- Right.

1493
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:07,637
She makes me want to talk.

1494
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:09,836
- I get why Suk Ku said that.
- Yes.

1495
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:13,407
- She makes me want to keep talking.
- Exactly.

1496
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:14,976
She's a great listener.

1497
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:16,106
I know. I want to be friends.

1498
00:52:16,107 --> 00:52:18,147
Did you become friends fast while you were filming?

1499
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:20,416
I think we got pretty close before the shoot.

1500
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:21,446
Really?

1501
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:23,086
I don't expect...

1502
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:25,216
to be friends with all the actors...

1503
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:26,957
when I'm filming a show.

1504
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,187
But this time...

1505
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:30,826
- Right?
- Right.

1506
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:33,227
- We're the only lead actors.
- That's true.

1507
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,466
- So...
- The story revolves around you.

1508
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:36,467
Yes.

1509
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:37,566
Da Mi, do you drink?

1510
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:40,237
I do. A little bit.

1511
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:41,866
You said you liked whiskey.

1512
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,576
But I can't drink it anymore.

1513
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,907
- Why not?
- It's too strong.

1514
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:47,776
- One day, I just felt this burn...
- All of a sudden?

1515
00:52:47,777 --> 00:52:49,306
Down my throat.

1516
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:51,616
You need to mix it with something. I can't drink whiskey only either.

1517
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:54,147
What do you normally drink?

1518
00:52:54,347 --> 00:52:56,246
I don't even know what I like, though.

1519
00:52:56,247 --> 00:52:59,116
- Whiskey seems to suit you.
- Does it?

1520
00:52:59,117 --> 00:53:02,527
I rarely drink, and I don't know that many types.

1521
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:05,356
When we have a get-together,

1522
00:53:05,357 --> 00:53:07,866
he says he has to let all the alcohol out before bed.

1523
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:09,866
- So, he always walks home.
- I do.

1524
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:12,213
I feel like sleeping only when all the alcohol is out of my body.

1525
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,136
Oh, you don't like sleeping under the influence.

1526
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:17,436
- No, that's tough for me.
- I see.

1527
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:20,446
When people have irregular sleeping patterns,

1528
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,106
some of them have a glass of wine before bed.

1529
00:53:23,107 --> 00:53:24,346
I sleep so well, though.

1530
00:53:24,347 --> 00:53:26,047
I've been sleeping better recently.

1531
00:53:26,347 --> 00:53:29,316
I always sleep eight hours a day.

1532
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:30,986
- That's the perfect amount.
- It feels so nice.

1533
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:32,227
When do you normally go to bed?

1534
00:53:32,387 --> 00:53:34,886
I usually go to bed before midnight.

1535
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:37,856
I think it's the best feeling in the world.

1536
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:38,956
It feels so nice.

1537
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:41,326
But it's not so easy to fall asleep before midnight...

1538
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:42,426
like he does.

1539
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,296
- That's true.
- It hasn't grown into a habit yet.

1540
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:46,707
I'll tell you how I do it.

1541
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,837
When I start feeling sleepy,

1542
00:53:49,137 --> 00:53:50,537
I don't even wash up.

1543
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:52,277
I just go to bed.

1544
00:53:52,677 --> 00:53:53,846
Even if it means showering the next day.

1545
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:56,076
- When I shower...
- It wakes you up.

1546
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:58,516
Yes. So, I don't even brush my teeth and go straight to bed.

1547
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:00,046
I just sleep without even removing my makeup.

1548
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:01,286
- What?
- Shouldn't you remove your makeup?

1549
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:02,586
Aren't you supposed to remove that?

1550
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:04,686
But I personally believe...

1551
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:06,927
that between damaging my skin...

1552
00:54:07,187 --> 00:54:09,087
by not removing makeup...

1553
00:54:09,787 --> 00:54:12,056
and damaging my skin by not getting enough sleep...

1554
00:54:12,057 --> 00:54:13,526
- I see.
- I weighed them up,

1555
00:54:13,527 --> 00:54:14,767
and I decided...

1556
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:17,397
- to get some more sleep.
- You'd rather get more sleep.

1557
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:20,306
So, I go straight to bed when I start feeling sleepy.

1558
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:21,606
Our food is already here.

1559
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:22,647
(Their order has arrived.)

1560
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:25,106
- Look at that.
- That looks incredible.

1561
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:26,237
Are these the fries?

1562
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,146
That looks scrumptious.

1563
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:29,706
These are chicken tacos.

1564
00:54:29,707 --> 00:54:31,076
- These are shrimp tacos.
- Shrimp.

1565
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:32,616
(The tacos and burritos are packed.)

1566
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,086
- It looks beautiful.
- They look so tasty.

1567
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:35,816
And chili con carne.

1568
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,986
- Thank you for the food.
- Thanks for the food, sir.

1569
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:39,387
- This is...
- We have to mix them.

1570
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:40,857
We'll talk to you soon, sir.

1571
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:43,796
Yes. As soon as we're done eating...

1572
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:45,497
- We will talk to him soon.
- Soon.

1573
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,197
We won't interview him yet.

1574
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:48,866
That looks delicious.

1575
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:50,197
It looks so good.

1576
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,097
It can't taste bad. Not a chance.

1577
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:54,666
It looks so tasty.

1578
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,437
Oh, we got small plates.

1579
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:58,637
What do you need?

1580
00:54:59,477 --> 00:55:00,547
Here it is.

1581
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:01,947
It's so good.

1582
00:55:03,817 --> 00:55:05,516
(Da Mi has a bite of the taco.)

1583
00:55:05,517 --> 00:55:06,917
Suk Ku, it's so delicious.

1584
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:08,217
I'm glad.

1585
00:55:09,317 --> 00:55:10,587
This is so good.

1586
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:12,417
This is good too.

1587
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:14,387
It's delicious.

1588
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:17,627
(A genuine facial expression)

1589
00:55:18,957 --> 00:55:19,957
It's good, isn't it?

1590
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:21,527
It's so good.

1591
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:23,107
Suk Ku, you made a good choice.

1592
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:24,937
We've never had tacos.

1593
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:27,437
You probably got many offers...

1594
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:30,906
from other variety shows to promote your new series.

1595
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:32,137
Right.

1596
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:35,147
She and I debated it.

1597
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:37,567
You wanted to be on Whenever Possible.

1598
00:55:37,677 --> 00:55:38,916
(Da Mi first suggested to be on Whenever Possible.)

1599
00:55:38,917 --> 00:55:40,016
- You wanted it.
- Yes.

1600
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,846
- Really?
- I heard many actors...

1601
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,716
felt more comfortable on our show...

1602
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:47,456
- than on any other variety show.
- Yes.

1603
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:49,656
You feel less pressured on this show.

1604
00:55:49,657 --> 00:55:51,356
Since we need to give gifts,

1605
00:55:51,357 --> 00:55:52,996
we'll feel pressured...

1606
00:55:52,997 --> 00:55:54,866
to do so once we start the game.

1607
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:56,297
I was out of my mind.

1608
00:55:57,367 --> 00:55:59,136
(He was out of his mind under pressure.)

1609
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:01,136
I really wanted to succeed.

1610
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:02,207
Exactly.

1611
00:56:03,637 --> 00:56:06,307
I met Da Mi for the first time today.

1612
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:08,397
And I think I'm more difficult than she is.

1613
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,976
(Laughing)

1614
00:56:09,977 --> 00:56:11,246
Da Mi is easygoing.

1615
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:12,346
She's easygoing.

1616
00:56:12,347 --> 00:56:14,446
- Yes.
- You keep taking out the cilantro.

1617
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:16,687
So, when I see Da Mi...

1618
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:18,757
People often ask me...

1619
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:21,086
what I have done and with whom.

1620
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:22,186
When I say I did it with Da Mi,

1621
00:56:22,187 --> 00:56:24,026
they ask me what she is like.

1622
00:56:24,027 --> 00:56:25,197
Then, I always tell them...

1623
00:56:25,497 --> 00:56:27,866
that Da Mi has a country vibe.

1624
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:29,627
- Why?
- She is...

1625
00:56:30,127 --> 00:56:32,396
- down-to-earth with no pretensions.
- That's true.

1626
00:56:32,397 --> 00:56:33,436
She's different from what I expected.

1627
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,237
I should spread good words about Da Mi.

1628
00:56:36,307 --> 00:56:37,577
You work out a lot, don't you?

1629
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:41,946
I do when I'm not that busy.

1630
00:56:41,947 --> 00:56:43,246
But I haven't lately.

1631
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:44,616
What kind of exercise do you do?

1632
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:45,746
- I just go to the gym.
- I see.

1633
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:47,516
- Lifting weights?
- I do that too.

1634
00:56:47,517 --> 00:56:49,447
- I also run on the treadmill.
- I see.

1635
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:52,817
- I recently started CrossFit.
- CrossFit?

1636
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,556
Since I started it, I fell for it.

1637
00:56:56,557 --> 00:56:59,396
Since then, I have gained confidence...

1638
00:56:59,397 --> 00:57:01,866
- that I can lose weight.
- You think you can lose weight.

1639
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:04,536
- You do workouts together there.
- That's right.

1640
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:05,766
You do workouts in intervals together,

1641
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,067
- taking turns.
- Yes.

1642
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:09,106
Let's say I have to do it 30 times.

1643
00:57:09,107 --> 00:57:10,376
- If I do it only ten times, - Someone does it next to you.

1644
00:57:10,377 --> 00:57:11,906
My partner has to do it 20 times.

1645
00:57:11,907 --> 00:57:13,476
- Really?
- There is a rule about it.

1646
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:14,776
So,

1647
00:57:14,777 --> 00:57:16,976
I work out way more...

1648
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:18,646
when I do it with others...

1649
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:20,446
- than when I do it alone.
- It's different.

1650
00:57:20,447 --> 00:57:22,046
- I bet.
- It's so much fun.

1651
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:24,057
When you work out with someone,

1652
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:25,856
it's like that.

1653
00:57:25,857 --> 00:57:28,386
- The person encourages you.
- That's right.

1654
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:30,187
- That's so true.
- That's why I do it alone.

1655
00:57:31,327 --> 00:57:34,267
- You don't want the encouragement.
- No, I don't like it.

1656
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:37,466
It's like what you think of cilantro.

1657
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:38,637
"Get it away!"

1658
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:41,036
When I plan to do it 10 times, I want to do it only 10 times.

1659
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:43,136
If I have to do it twice more...

1660
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:44,736
or three times more because of someone,

1661
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:46,306
I feel like being forced.

1662
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:48,546
- So, I do it only ten times.
- When I work out,

1663
00:57:48,547 --> 00:57:52,016
if someone screams at me, "You're doing great!"

1664
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:55,216
I used to feel so embarrassed.

1665
00:57:55,217 --> 00:57:56,446
So, I couldn't keep it up.

1666
00:57:56,447 --> 00:57:58,756
I wanted to work out in peace.

1667
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:00,256
But once I got used to it,

1668
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:02,256
- That's right.
- I liked it a lot.

1669
00:58:02,257 --> 00:58:04,196
You might feel lonely if you work out alone.

1670
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:05,757
It'd be good if someone encouraged you.

1671
00:58:06,557 --> 00:58:08,167
Anyway, it's so good.

1672
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:09,967
- It's good.
- I enjoyed it.

1673
00:58:10,597 --> 00:58:11,867
Who will pay...

1674
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,106
We need to pay for it.

1675
00:58:14,107 --> 00:58:15,566
(We need to pay.)

1676
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,336
Da Mi...

1677
00:58:17,337 --> 00:58:19,237
- and I brought our wallets.
- Yes.

1678
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:21,747
Why don't we play a game with a cell phone?

1679
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:23,076
A cell phone?

1680
00:58:23,077 --> 00:58:24,753
- What do we do with a cell phone?
- What is that?

1681
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:27,187
Calling the production team fast.

1682
00:58:27,517 --> 00:58:29,317
We call the production team at the same time.

1683
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:32,556
The person the team first answers to...

1684
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:34,756
will be excluded.

1685
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:35,887
- I see.
- Okay.

1686
00:58:36,187 --> 00:58:37,896
I just need to press the call button fast, don't I?

1687
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:39,327
Yes. We call at the same time.

1688
00:58:39,427 --> 00:58:41,827
(Game to pay for the meal)

1689
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:43,666
Ready.

1690
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:46,897
(Call the number of the production team fast.)

1691
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,407
Ready.

1692
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:51,107
Start.

1693
00:58:51,307 --> 00:58:54,507
Zero, one, zero... Four, six, seven.

1694
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,877
- Okay.
- I think I won.

1695
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:00,747
It's eight...

1696
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,887
That's me.

1697
00:59:03,017 --> 00:59:04,187
Da Mi was fast.

1698
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:05,916
When did you press all the numbers?

1699
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,387
She was so fast.

1700
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:09,086
- I can't believe it.
- So, is one person out?

1701
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,827
Yes, Da Mi is out.

1702
00:59:10,997 --> 00:59:13,096
- I'll tell you the 2nd number.
- Don't press 0, 1, 0 1st.

1703
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:14,097
Can't I?

1704
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:16,827
Here is the second number.

1705
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:22,236
Zero, one, zero... Fourteen hundred.

1706
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:24,706
- Fourteen and what?
- I got confused.

1707
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:25,737
Wait.

1708
00:59:26,407 --> 00:59:27,447
It's six...

1709
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:29,747
- That's me.
- Darn it.

1710
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:31,376
What is this?

1711
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:33,546
Why did you say fourteen hundred?

1712
00:59:33,547 --> 00:59:35,287
Please say 1, 4, 0, 0.

1713
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:37,956
(Last round)

1714
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:40,057
(Yeon Seok won.)

1715
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:42,756
(Jae Suk will pay for the meal.)

1716
00:59:42,757 --> 00:59:44,026
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the meal.

1717
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:45,156
Thanks for the food.

1718
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:46,196
Darn it.

1719
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:48,127
How could I not win 1 in 3?

1720
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:51,297
(Stressed)

1721
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:53,737
Nice!

1722
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:56,807
Okay.

1723
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:59,377
This game was pretty intense.

1724
00:59:59,777 --> 01:00:01,306
The one...

1725
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:04,077
who suggests the game always loses.

1726
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:05,176
It was thrilling.

1727
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:06,723
(The person who suggests the game usually loses.)

1728
01:00:06,747 --> 01:00:07,846
Did you enjoy the food?

1729
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:09,787
- It was so good.
- Thanks a lot.

1730
01:00:10,457 --> 01:00:13,156
I was really surprised. I really was.

1731
01:00:13,157 --> 01:00:15,387
- We'll meet in a minute.
- Exactly.

1732
01:00:15,557 --> 01:00:16,956
Jae Suk, thanks for the food.

1733
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:17,997
Of course.

1734
01:00:18,027 --> 01:00:20,057
By the way,

1735
01:00:20,527 --> 01:00:23,936
since we had lunch at the Whenever Guests' restaurant,

1736
01:00:23,937 --> 01:00:26,096
I'm not sure how to begin.

1737
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:27,807
Let's get out first and come in again.

1738
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,136
- Let's get out.
- Are we going out?

1739
01:00:30,137 --> 01:00:31,176
We're going out for now...

1740
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:33,236
- to give him time to get ready.
- Okay.

1741
01:00:33,237 --> 01:00:35,076
- And let's come in again.
- Okay.

1742
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:36,806
Thanks for the good food.

1743
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,216
- Thanks for the good food.
- Thank you.

1744
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,816
- See you soon.
- It was really good.

1745
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:41,986
- We'll come often.
- The food was really good.

1746
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:43,686
The food was really good.

1747
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:45,356
It was so good.

1748
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:46,477
(Pretending to really leave)

1749
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:49,056
It's almost the spare time,

1750
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:50,126
so we need to go in.

1751
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:51,557
I think it's here.

1752
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,527
- Is it?
- I think so.

1753
01:00:54,897 --> 01:00:57,597
We walked the least today.

1754
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:00,436
- We walked the least.
- It was just one step.

1755
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:01,967
Just one step. Let's go in.

1756
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:04,237
- Hello.
- Hello.

1757
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

1758
01:01:06,437 --> 01:01:07,976
- You look familiar, - Yes.

1759
01:01:07,977 --> 01:01:08,977
But we'll say hi again.

1760
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:11,176
Are you Ahn Hee Jin and Ahn Hee Geun?

1761
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:12,877
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

1762
01:01:13,377 --> 01:01:14,686
(The second Whenever Guests, Ahn Hee Jin and Ahn Hee Geun)

1763
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:16,486
- The food was really good.
- Thanks.

1764
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:18,117
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming.

1765
01:01:18,517 --> 01:01:20,316
You're brothers, aren't you?

1766
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:21,687
- Yes, we are.
- Yes.

1767
01:01:21,957 --> 01:01:24,327
How long have you worked together?

1768
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:26,557
It's been about eight years.

1769
01:01:28,297 --> 01:01:30,897
(The brothers spend 12 hours a day together.)

1770
01:01:31,737 --> 01:01:33,936
(Both are fathers of two children.)

1771
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:36,037
(They stay apart, yet together.)

1772
01:01:36,937 --> 01:01:38,136
(They've been running the restaurant together for 8 years.)

1773
01:01:38,137 --> 01:01:41,806
What made you open a taco place?

1774
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:44,147
When I studied abroad in the US,

1775
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:47,076
- I often had...
- I see.

1776
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:49,716
Those big and inexpensive burritos.

1777
01:01:49,717 --> 01:01:51,286
- They're pretty heavy.
- I see.

1778
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,756
- I got full when I had one.
- I see.

1779
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:55,326
I didn't have enough money back then.

1780
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,856
So, I wanted to eat it.

1781
01:01:56,857 --> 01:01:59,726
But in Korea, there weren't many places that served...

1782
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:02,227
- Californian-style food.
- I see.

1783
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,166
- It wasn't easy to have one.
- Okay.

1784
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:07,737
So, I started this place to share the food with people.

1785
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,906
When brothers or sisters...

1786
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:12,777
run a business together,

1787
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:14,506
their relationship often ends up turning sour.

1788
01:02:14,507 --> 01:02:15,846
It turns out that way in most cases.

1789
01:02:15,847 --> 01:02:17,106
- Does it in most cases?
- Yes.

1790
01:02:17,107 --> 01:02:18,816
How could you maintain it for eight years?

1791
01:02:18,817 --> 01:02:21,017
I guess you two get along with each other pretty well.

1792
01:02:22,217 --> 01:02:23,246
(Sighing)

1793
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:25,717
So that's not exactly the case.

1794
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:28,057
That's not exactly the case.

1795
01:02:28,087 --> 01:02:30,087
Who is putting up with the other?

1796
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:33,626
- I guess both are.
- Yes.

1797
01:02:33,627 --> 01:02:35,067
Both are putting up with each other.

1798
01:02:35,197 --> 01:02:37,026
We can understand. Please don't worry.

1799
01:02:37,027 --> 01:02:38,796
We can totally understand what you mean.

1800
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,066
I bet it's not easy to run...

1801
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:44,007
a business together.

1802
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:46,776
We didn't want to do it together at first.

1803
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:48,646
- Why not?
- I was a little...

1804
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:49,976
scared of my older brother.

1805
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:52,176
- You were scared of him.
- If I made a mistake,

1806
01:02:52,177 --> 01:02:54,886
he might curse and scold me.

1807
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:57,146
I didn't want to do it because it'd be uncomfortable.

1808
01:02:57,147 --> 01:02:58,486
How many years apart are you?

1809
01:02:58,487 --> 01:02:59,656
We're six years apart.

1810
01:02:59,657 --> 01:03:01,226
That's quite an age gap.

1811
01:03:01,227 --> 01:03:03,747
If your brother is six years older, you could be scared of him.

1812
01:03:04,497 --> 01:03:06,397
So we've never had a fight.

1813
01:03:07,227 --> 01:03:10,127
- My brother has rarely defied me.
- I see.

1814
01:03:10,227 --> 01:03:11,966
We've never fought...

1815
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:13,166
as we were growing up.

1816
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,206
- I see. Really?
- Yes.

1817
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,067
That's entirely his perspective.

1818
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:18,776
What do you think about that?

1819
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:20,537
I tried to defy him in some way,

1820
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:23,077
but it wasn't really effective.

1821
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:25,847
He didn't rebel but tried to defy.

1822
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:27,746
(Laughing)

1823
01:03:27,747 --> 01:03:29,386
Da Mi, do you have siblings?

1824
01:03:29,387 --> 01:03:30,656
I have an older brother.

1825
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:32,416
How do you get along with him?

1826
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,986
We get along really well.

1827
01:03:33,987 --> 01:03:37,426
My brother is such a sweet guy.

1828
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:38,726
He even cooks for me.

1829
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:40,596
- Really?
- Are you far apart in age?

1830
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:42,496
- He's three years older.
- I see.

1831
01:03:42,497 --> 01:03:44,536
I think I can tell.

1832
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:46,237
No wonder her brother is sweet to her.

1833
01:03:46,837 --> 01:03:48,867
She listens to others well.

1834
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:50,636
Suk Ku, do you have siblings?

1835
01:03:50,637 --> 01:03:54,276
I have a younger brother. He's two years younger.

1836
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:55,946
How do you get along with him?

1837
01:03:55,947 --> 01:03:57,447
I don't think...

1838
01:03:58,017 --> 01:04:01,016
my brother is scared of me.

1839
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:02,446
I'm more scared of my brother.

1840
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,516
My brother is a big guy.

1841
01:04:04,517 --> 01:04:06,517
- Really?
- He's also good at sports.

1842
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,657
I don't think you could have scolded your brother that much.

1843
01:04:09,757 --> 01:04:10,956
I couldn't have.

1844
01:04:10,957 --> 01:04:13,326
Not all older brothers can scold...

1845
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:14,996
their younger brothers.

1846
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:17,436
When a younger brother is in high school,

1847
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,596
he's as big as, or even bigger than, his older brother.

1848
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:21,236
I once felt that.

1849
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:24,436
When we were about to get into a physical fight,

1850
01:04:24,437 --> 01:04:27,907
I felt my brother holding back.

1851
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,577
I felt it.

1852
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:31,587
- You felt you couldn't win.
- Right.

1853
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:33,717
He was definitely able to beat me,

1854
01:04:33,817 --> 01:04:35,946
but he was holding back. He was composed.

1855
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:38,216
Then, I knew I could never win.

1856
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:39,786
You felt his composure.

1857
01:04:39,787 --> 01:04:41,387
Yes, I did.

1858
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:46,026
Are you here together every day?

1859
01:04:46,027 --> 01:04:47,797
- Yes, almost every day.
- Almost every day.

1860
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:49,796
What is your older brother like?

1861
01:04:49,797 --> 01:04:51,113
(What is your older brother like?)

1862
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,197
He's such a boomer. No.

1863
01:04:53,437 --> 01:04:55,537
He's old-fashioned...

1864
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,266
- but honest.
- Right.

1865
01:04:57,267 --> 01:05:01,946
I don't think we need further descriptions.

1866
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:03,746
The word "boomer" was enough to describe him.

1867
01:05:03,747 --> 01:05:05,446
What kind of person is your younger brother?

1868
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:06,716
(What kind of person is your younger brother?)

1869
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:08,786
He does what I tell him to do.

1870
01:05:08,787 --> 01:05:12,517
He can do everything, including plumbing and electrical work.

1871
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:14,657
He's good at everything.

1872
01:05:14,857 --> 01:05:15,857
That's why you called him...

1873
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:17,656
- the supply officer.
- So that was why.

1874
01:05:17,657 --> 01:05:18,726
Yes.

1875
01:05:18,727 --> 01:05:20,626
I have a question.

1876
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:22,696
When brothers run a business together,

1877
01:05:22,697 --> 01:05:24,266
what are the pros and cons?

1878
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,873
- Tell us 1 each.
- Tells us 1 thing for each.

1879
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:27,097
- The pros?
- The pros.

1880
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:30,266
Compared to a regular company,

1881
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:32,376
since it's a business run by brothers,

1882
01:05:32,377 --> 01:05:34,706
we can take the day off more freely.

1883
01:05:34,707 --> 01:05:35,876
- It's easier to do that.
- So that's one good thing.

1884
01:05:35,877 --> 01:05:37,846
You can take the day off more comfortably.

1885
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:38,976
Then, what are the cons of it?

1886
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,116
(What are the cons?)

1887
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:42,747
- The cons?
- The cons.

1888
01:05:43,317 --> 01:05:44,886
Well, one thing is that...

1889
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:48,357
I've become a first-class slave to him.

1890
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:50,526
So that could be one thing.

1891
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:51,696
(A critical shortcoming)

1892
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:52,957
You two are amazing.

1893
01:05:53,227 --> 01:05:54,797
"So this is reality."

1894
01:05:54,897 --> 01:05:56,257
- So that's what you think.
- Yes.

1895
01:05:56,297 --> 01:05:58,096
I noticed that you were nodding.

1896
01:05:58,097 --> 01:05:59,737
What do you think about this shortcoming?

1897
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:01,736
Actually, there's nothing lacking for me.

1898
01:06:01,737 --> 01:06:02,967
He's the perfect slave.

1899
01:06:04,977 --> 01:06:06,207
So I have nothing.

1900
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:10,677
You two are amazing.

1901
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:13,116
You two really hit it off.

1902
01:06:13,117 --> 01:06:15,016
- Yes, they do.
- Anyway,

1903
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:17,046
Suk Ku and Da Mi are here.

1904
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:18,116
Before coming here,

1905
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:19,316
- we got to Round Two.
- They are on a roll.

1906
01:06:19,317 --> 01:06:20,756
They are on a roll.

1907
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:22,587
- Suk Ku will do it.
- Okay.

1908
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:24,656
You can relax. It doesn't matter even if it falls on the floor.

1909
01:06:24,657 --> 01:06:26,097
- It's okay for this to fall?
- Yes.

1910
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:33,896
(They got 1 coupon.)

1911
01:06:33,897 --> 01:06:35,297
- We got one, at least.
- One shot.

1912
01:06:36,407 --> 01:06:37,813
- We got one more chance.
- One shot.

1913
01:06:37,837 --> 01:06:40,277
The present you can get in Round One.

1914
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:43,076
"I lost my hobby as I was busy raising my child."

1915
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:45,197
"I want to go back to the innocence of my childhood."

1916
01:06:45,517 --> 01:06:47,046
"A Lego F1 car."

1917
01:06:47,047 --> 01:06:48,246
(The Present for Round 1: A Lego F1 Car)

1918
01:06:48,247 --> 01:06:49,546
- Oh, that is...
- That's an expensive one.

1919
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,916
- That's expensive.
- I have this.

1920
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,656
- You have this?
- It's so fun to make this.

1921
01:06:52,657 --> 01:06:55,287
Me too. I have some Lego cars.

1922
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:57,003
- This was released recently.
- It's so fun.

1923
01:06:57,027 --> 01:06:58,667
- That's so nice.
- You must be so happy.

1924
01:06:58,757 --> 01:07:01,496
(Clang! Clang! Can Baseball)

1925
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:04,336
(Hit a ping-pong ball with a bottle opener...)

1926
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:05,866
(and drop the can.)

1927
01:07:05,867 --> 01:07:07,566
(There are 10 balls, and there's a 30-second time limit.)

1928
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:09,807
This must be fun. Even though I don't know what this is.

1929
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:12,637
- So with this...
- You bounce it and hit it.

1930
01:07:12,807 --> 01:07:15,146
- So we need to hit that...
- We need to bounce the ball once?

1931
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:16,206
- and drop it?
- Yes.

1932
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:18,117
And we must hit the ball with this.

1933
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:19,946
So this is the bat.

1934
01:07:19,947 --> 01:07:21,246
(They'll use a bottle opener as a bat today.)

1935
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:24,416
So I bounce the ball once and then hit it?

1936
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:25,817
- That's right.
- Gosh, be careful.

1937
01:07:29,757 --> 01:07:30,757
Not only do we have to hit it,

1938
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:32,718
- but we also have to drop it.
- Gosh, this is...

1939
01:07:32,827 --> 01:07:34,797
- The opener is quite small, so...
- Gosh.

1940
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:36,666
This is not easy.

1941
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:38,696
- This is tough.
- But compared to the last one,

1942
01:07:38,697 --> 01:07:40,777
- Let me try it.
- I think it'd be easier this time.

1943
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:43,307
(Da Mi practices.)

1944
01:07:44,837 --> 01:07:46,107
This is tough.

1945
01:07:46,777 --> 01:07:48,576
- This is hard.
- In 30 seconds?

1946
01:07:48,577 --> 01:07:50,846
- Suk Ku, you practice now.
- It'd be better from here, right?

1947
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:52,247
- You can do it from there.
- Okay.

1948
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:56,657
- Let me try it one more time.
- I think he's going to do it.

1949
01:07:59,057 --> 01:08:00,256
- I think you can do it.
- Right. I think...

1950
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:01,956
- Do we need to strike it down?
- It needs to drop.

1951
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:03,437
- It needs to drop?
- It has to drop?

1952
01:08:04,227 --> 01:08:05,957
But this is so difficult.

1953
01:08:06,697 --> 01:08:08,526
- So we only have to succeed once?
- Yes.

1954
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:09,767
I'll come up with a plan again.

1955
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:11,166
Go ahead, Suk Ku. Give it a try.

1956
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:12,366
Can I hit it like I push it?

1957
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:14,937
(He's getting carried away.)

1958
01:08:22,607 --> 01:08:23,607
- You did it.
- I did it.

1959
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:28,317
(He hit the target!)

1960
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:32,156
(The regular customer hit the mark.)

1961
01:08:32,157 --> 01:08:33,186
We got this.

1962
01:08:33,187 --> 01:08:35,986
- Hold it like this and hit it hard.
- I see. Okay.

1963
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,596
- You get to hit it really hard.
- Great.

1964
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:39,126
But it's a little... How do I put it?

1965
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:40,356
- It could be less accurate.
- Is it less accurate?

1966
01:08:40,357 --> 01:08:41,396
Okay.

1967
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:43,197
- He's a strategist.
- Try it again.

1968
01:08:43,497 --> 01:08:44,596
He's Strategy Son.

1969
01:08:44,597 --> 01:08:46,096
Should we give it a try?

1970
01:08:46,097 --> 01:08:47,567
This is our first try.

1971
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:49,606
We'll go for it.

1972
01:08:49,607 --> 01:08:50,636
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1973
01:08:50,637 --> 01:08:51,737
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1974
01:08:52,237 --> 01:08:53,877
- Distribute the ten balls first.
- Okay.

1975
01:08:53,907 --> 01:08:55,207
Okay, first...

1976
01:08:55,547 --> 01:08:56,976
- How many should we have each?
- Three for you, Suk Ku.

1977
01:08:56,977 --> 01:08:58,516
- Three.
- I...

1978
01:08:58,517 --> 01:09:00,316
Three for you. Three for Da Mi.

1979
01:09:00,317 --> 01:09:01,546
Can I have 2? I got 3?

1980
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:02,686
- Let's have 2 each.
- We'll have 2 each.

1981
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:04,217
- Let's have two each.
- Okay.

1982
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,556
- Should I go 1st?
- You go 1st. You just made it.

1983
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:07,656
- You can pull it off, Suk Ku.
- Right.

1984
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:08,726
- Right.
- Ready.

1985
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:09,757
Hold on.

1986
01:09:10,057 --> 01:09:11,656
- Ready.
- Here you go.

1987
01:09:11,657 --> 01:09:12,697
Set.

1988
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:15,867
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1989
01:09:17,837 --> 01:09:18,837
(Start!)

1990
01:09:20,137 --> 01:09:21,207
It grazed.

1991
01:09:23,767 --> 01:09:25,236
- Hurry up.
- Do we need to hurry up?

1992
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:27,397
- We need to do it in 30 seconds.
- We got 30 seconds.

1993
01:09:31,277 --> 01:09:32,317
I'm sorry.

1994
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:35,546
(It's a wrong delivery.)

1995
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,086
- I'm so sorry.
- We've got five balls left.

1996
01:09:37,087 --> 01:09:38,207
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

1997
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:40,057
- We're sorry.
- No worries.

1998
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:43,327
You did a good job.

1999
01:09:45,927 --> 01:09:46,957
Goodness.

2000
01:09:47,397 --> 01:09:48,926
- How many seconds do we have left?
- Three,

2001
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,767
two, one.

2002
01:09:51,697 --> 01:09:52,996
You're good at this.

2003
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:54,437
(Failed)

2004
01:09:56,037 --> 01:09:57,876
I think we have a shot.

2005
01:09:57,877 --> 01:09:59,707
- It was close.
- I think I got this.

2006
01:10:05,017 --> 01:10:06,377
You should have done that earlier.

2007
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:10,046
Well, I just got the hang of it as I tried.

2008
01:10:10,047 --> 01:10:11,286
- He hit it really hard.
- Right.

2009
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:13,156
- That was amazing.
- Out of the ten tries,

2010
01:10:13,157 --> 01:10:14,687
- one of us will make it.
- Right.

2011
01:10:15,427 --> 01:10:16,926
- We have a shot.
- Right. We got this.

2012
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:18,456
- We can do it.
- We got this.

2013
01:10:18,457 --> 01:10:19,457
(All they need is one good shot.)

2014
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,696
Why don't you hit seven balls?

2015
01:10:21,697 --> 01:10:23,326
- Goodness.
- Hold on.

2016
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:25,396
- Well...
- Don't do this, Suk Ku.

2017
01:10:25,397 --> 01:10:26,637
(Here comes the gambler again.)

2018
01:10:26,867 --> 01:10:29,507
- All right then.
- Why would you...

2019
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:31,936
This is our second try.

2020
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,497
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

2021
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:34,807
I'll go first.

2022
01:10:35,077 --> 01:10:36,747
- Do you want to go first?
- No.

2023
01:10:37,177 --> 01:10:38,247
How many will you take?

2024
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:39,946
- All right.
- I'll have two.

2025
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:41,316
- You'll take 2?
- I'll have 2 as well.

2026
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:42,487
Two? Okay.

2027
01:10:43,117 --> 01:10:44,117
Ready.

2028
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:48,056
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 10)

2029
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:49,557
- One more, Jae Suk.
- Gosh.

2030
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:52,827
(Switching places swiftly)

2031
01:10:54,197 --> 01:10:55,226
Way to go.

2032
01:10:55,227 --> 01:10:56,427
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 6)

2033
01:10:56,827 --> 01:10:57,866
Like that?

2034
01:10:57,867 --> 01:10:59,166
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 5)

2035
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:00,797
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 4)

2036
01:11:01,907 --> 01:11:03,367
We've got plenty of time.

2037
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:08,046
- Here it is.
- Yeon Seok.

2038
01:11:08,047 --> 01:11:09,476
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 2)

2039
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:11,716
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 1)

2040
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:13,217
(They failed on their second try.)

2041
01:11:13,777 --> 01:11:14,786
(He picks up the balls right away.)

2042
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:16,046
Should I do it like this?

2043
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:17,527
- This is not easy.
- Ping-pong is...

2044
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,487
- Is this how we play ping-pong?
- It's hard to hit it.

2045
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:23,586
I think what Jae Suk is doing now is the best way.

2046
01:11:23,587 --> 01:11:26,356
- Like this?
- You hold it like this.

2047
01:11:26,357 --> 01:11:27,726
- That's right.
- It's hard to hit the ball with it,

2048
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:29,096
so think of it as hitting with this finger.

2049
01:11:29,097 --> 01:11:30,726
- There you go.
- And push it like this.

2050
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:32,767
- Right. Try pushing it a little.
- I see.

2051
01:11:33,437 --> 01:11:34,906
- Push it in a straight line.
- Right.

2052
01:11:34,907 --> 01:11:36,307
- Push it.
- Like that.

2053
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:37,536
Yeon Seok got the hang of it now.

2054
01:11:37,537 --> 01:11:38,706
(Exclaiming)

2055
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:40,027
Yeon Seok got the hang of it now.

2056
01:11:40,437 --> 01:11:42,276
- We did it.
- Gosh.

2057
01:11:42,277 --> 01:11:43,723
- This is our third try, right?
- Let's go.

2058
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:45,316
- All right. In 1, 2, 3.
- We got this.

2059
01:11:45,317 --> 01:11:46,546
- Here we go. Let's go.
- Here we go.

2060
01:11:46,547 --> 01:11:47,846
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

2061
01:11:47,847 --> 01:11:48,916
- Three?
- Three.

2062
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,817
Don't think too much. You can do it.

2063
01:11:52,457 --> 01:11:54,156
Just do as you always do.

2064
01:11:54,157 --> 01:11:55,726
(I'm going to succeed by pushing the ball.)

2065
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:56,926
Don't feel pressured.

2066
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,997
- My hands are sweating.
- We will...

2067
01:11:59,997 --> 01:12:00,997
Don't think too much.

2068
01:12:00,998 --> 01:12:02,796
You can do it. You already got this.

2069
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:04,026
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 10)

2070
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:05,736
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 9)

2071
01:12:05,737 --> 01:12:06,737
Gosh.

2072
01:12:06,738 --> 01:12:08,567
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 8)

2073
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:11,206
Here's one more.

2074
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:12,437
- One more?
- Try once more.

2075
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:19,217
(Yeon Seok hit it!)

2076
01:12:20,147 --> 01:12:21,816
(Exclaiming)

2077
01:12:21,817 --> 01:12:23,647
- Did they succeed?
- Yes.

2078
01:12:24,147 --> 01:12:25,816
(Yeon Seok succeeded it.)

2079
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:27,386
Da Mi gave me one, and...

2080
01:12:27,387 --> 01:12:28,457
(Excited)

2081
01:12:29,687 --> 01:12:32,757
- We did it!
- Da Mi...

2082
01:12:33,127 --> 01:12:34,526
Da Mi gave me one, and...

2083
01:12:34,527 --> 01:12:36,597
(It was a thrilling shot.)

2084
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:39,466
- Goodness. You...
- Da Mi.

2085
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:41,036
- Da Mi.
- My gosh.

2086
01:12:41,037 --> 01:12:42,636
- You...
- You did...

2087
01:12:42,637 --> 01:12:44,577
We did it because you gave me your ball.

2088
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:46,177
Here's one more.

2089
01:12:46,277 --> 01:12:47,376
(Da Mi gave him a ball.)

2090
01:12:47,377 --> 01:12:48,497
- One more?
- Try once more.

2091
01:12:53,777 --> 01:12:57,347
(He made a clean shot.)

2092
01:12:57,987 --> 01:13:01,157
(It was fantastic teamwork.)

2093
01:13:01,827 --> 01:13:03,726
We did it because you gave me your ball.

2094
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:04,857
You read the game.

2095
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:06,427
She read the game.

2096
01:13:06,957 --> 01:13:07,966
Gosh, Da Mi.

2097
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,097
(Touched)

2098
01:13:11,127 --> 01:13:13,367
By the way, I'm the one who succeeded, but no one is...

2099
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,606
- Yeon Seok.
- Jae Suk. Seriously.

2100
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:18,176
- Good job.
- You did it.

2101
01:13:18,177 --> 01:13:19,706
- I knew you would do it.
- I succeeded it.

2102
01:13:19,707 --> 01:13:21,307
You're good with games using your hands.

2103
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:22,547
My goodness.

2104
01:13:23,047 --> 01:13:24,346
Da Mi. You're amazing.

2105
01:13:24,347 --> 01:13:26,616
- Gosh.
- That was a perfect judgment.

2106
01:13:26,617 --> 01:13:28,817
- You let him do it once more.
- It really was perfect.

2107
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:31,686
- She smoothly gave one to me.
- She gave it to you smoothly.

2108
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:33,487
I have to say, Yeon Seok was awful.

2109
01:13:35,087 --> 01:13:36,126
(Jae Suk plays with him.)

2110
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:38,127
- Good job.
- But I did great.

2111
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,726
It was amazing.

2112
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:43,067
- Okay. We succeeded in Round One!
- We succeeded!

2113
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:46,966
We have many tries left.

2114
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:48,006
We have a coupon too.

2115
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,936
It's 7 plus 1, so we have 8 tries left.

2116
01:13:49,937 --> 01:13:53,636
Tell us if you're going to go for Round Two or stop...

2117
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:54,677
and pick one.

2118
01:13:55,007 --> 01:13:56,477
In 1, 2, 3

2119
01:13:56,677 --> 01:13:58,317
- We must go even if we fail.
- Go.

2120
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:01,217
Let's see.

2121
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:03,986
"They go to and get off work together."

2122
01:14:03,987 --> 01:14:06,356
"Matching hoodies for the brothers who are always together."

2123
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:08,657
"Two Supreme hoodies."

2124
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:10,656
(Matching Supreme hoodies for the brothers who are always together)

2125
01:14:10,657 --> 01:14:11,857
They're expensive.

2126
01:14:12,627 --> 01:14:13,627
(Round 2:)

2127
01:14:13,628 --> 01:14:16,697
(There are 3 cans to hit.)

2128
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:18,167
You need to hit three cans now.

2129
01:14:18,197 --> 01:14:19,437
Why is it three?

2130
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:22,767
Aren't there too many?

2131
01:14:24,307 --> 01:14:25,637
You need to find the right angle.

2132
01:14:26,637 --> 01:14:28,347
- We need to hit all three of them?
- Yes.

2133
01:14:29,677 --> 01:14:31,106
(Even 1 was difficult.)

2134
01:14:31,107 --> 01:14:33,023
So we have 10 like before, and we've got 30 seconds.

2135
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:34,317
What's next?

2136
01:14:35,147 --> 01:14:36,247
I mean, Round Three.

2137
01:14:36,517 --> 01:14:37,846
(Puzzled)

2138
01:14:37,847 --> 01:14:39,586
They'll let us know once we get there.

2139
01:14:39,587 --> 01:14:41,056
- They'll tell us when we get there.
- They'll tell us later.

2140
01:14:41,057 --> 01:14:42,387
You can't tell us right now?

2141
01:14:43,057 --> 01:14:44,357
- Shall I go first?
- Okay.

2142
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:45,657
Suk Ku, here you go.

2143
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:49,066
It's so hard now.

2144
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,726
I think if we can send the ball to the table...

2145
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:52,037
- Suk Ku, focus.
- It's hard.

2146
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:53,636
(He's passionate, but he can't focus.)

2147
01:14:53,637 --> 01:14:54,767
Suk Ku, focus.

2148
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:56,813
Do I hit it with this part? The middle of the opener?

2149
01:14:56,837 --> 01:14:58,707
- This is...
- Right, but hold it like this.

2150
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:00,676
- This isn't easy.
- You need to hit it like this.

2151
01:15:00,677 --> 01:15:01,707
As if I'm pushing it?

2152
01:15:02,677 --> 01:15:03,807
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2153
01:15:04,677 --> 01:15:06,347
(He got 2 with 1 shot.)

2154
01:15:06,547 --> 01:15:08,193
- What do we do with that?
- You need to hit it and drop it.

2155
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:10,146
- But it fell down.
- That's worse.

2156
01:15:10,147 --> 01:15:11,817
We need to hit this off the table?

2157
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,216
Gosh, you guys are unbelievable.

2158
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:16,126
- It's even worse.
- Do it like this.

2159
01:15:16,127 --> 01:15:17,457
- Okay.
- And hit it like this.

2160
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,896
(Winning Strategy 3: Use your wrist)

2161
01:15:18,897 --> 01:15:20,337
- Goodness.
- The shot got stronger.

2162
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:23,897
(Powerful)

2163
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:26,236
Hey.

2164
01:15:26,237 --> 01:15:27,697
(He made a strong shot.)

2165
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:31,636
- Suk Ku. You did great.
- Let's go.

2166
01:15:31,637 --> 01:15:32,637
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

2167
01:15:32,638 --> 01:15:33,836
- Let's try it.
- Let's go.

2168
01:15:33,837 --> 01:15:35,237
- All right. Let's do this.
- Okay.

2169
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:36,976
(They have a shot in Round 2 as well.)

2170
01:15:36,977 --> 01:15:38,177
Okay. Round Two.

2171
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,916
- Try 4.
- Take 4.

2172
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:41,016
- I'll pass 1 to you later.
- Take 4?

2173
01:15:41,017 --> 01:15:42,617
- Okay. He'll try four.
- Let me do it.

2174
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,286
- Try 2 balls 1st.
- Here we go.

2175
01:15:44,287 --> 01:15:45,356
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2176
01:15:45,357 --> 01:15:46,763
(What will Strategy Son's new winning strategy be like?)

2177
01:15:46,787 --> 01:15:48,457
Take enough time to get ready.

2178
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:52,057
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 10)

2179
01:15:53,997 --> 01:15:54,997
(Hitting)

2180
01:15:55,497 --> 01:15:57,597
(He got 1 in the center with the 1st shot.)

2181
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:00,766
- I got this.
- Go for it.

2182
01:16:00,767 --> 01:16:03,366
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 8)

2183
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:04,567
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 7)

2184
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,137
- I did 3, right? I'll try 1 more.
- Okay.

2185
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:08,406
- This makes me nervous.
- All right.

2186
01:16:08,407 --> 01:16:09,747
- This is...
- The fourth.

2187
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:14,247
(What's going on?)

2188
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:19,447
(Suk Ku got 2 with 1 shot and finished the game.)

2189
01:16:27,597 --> 01:16:29,897
(Exclaiming)

2190
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:35,537
(Everyone goes crazy.)

2191
01:16:35,907 --> 01:16:38,477
Gosh. With one shot. Hold on.

2192
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:41,277
- Hold on.
- What's with you?

2193
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,277
Goodness. Who are you?

2194
01:16:43,547 --> 01:16:45,977
- My gosh.
- I don't know. I just did it.

2195
01:16:46,177 --> 01:16:47,823
- Suk Ku.
- I just hit it, and it happened.

2196
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:49,787
Goodness. What did you do?

2197
01:16:49,987 --> 01:16:51,247
What are you?

2198
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,486
- What's with you?
- I don't know.

2199
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:54,317
- You are so...
- I have no idea.

2200
01:16:55,187 --> 01:16:56,957
I just hit it, that's all.

2201
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:58,996
(Teary-eyed)

2202
01:16:58,997 --> 01:17:01,327
Since Seung Won was here...

2203
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:03,466
- So it's a success!
- We succeeded.

2204
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:04,996
(They succeeded Round 2.)

2205
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:06,266
- Hold on.
- My goodness.

2206
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:07,336
(Dumbfounded)

2207
01:17:07,337 --> 01:17:08,577
- My goodness.
- What was that?

2208
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,167
I have no idea.

2209
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,437
Now you know what it's like to succeed.

2210
01:17:13,637 --> 01:17:14,907
Suk Ku, you are...

2211
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:16,647
He's sweating all of a sudden.

2212
01:17:17,477 --> 01:17:18,747
You were so focused.

2213
01:17:19,077 --> 01:17:20,877
Suk Ku and Da Mi are amazing today.

2214
01:17:21,017 --> 01:17:22,987
- He did it by himself.
- I know.

2215
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:26,556
- All right.
- You won the hoodies in Round Two.

2216
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:28,356
You need to think about it carefully.

2217
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:31,226
The prize in Round Three will be more amazing.

2218
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:33,327
But it's going to be more difficult.

2219
01:17:33,457 --> 01:17:35,066
- So...
- We don't know what it will be.

2220
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,196
We don't know.

2221
01:17:36,197 --> 01:17:38,796
Decide if you want to continue or stop here.

2222
01:17:38,797 --> 01:17:41,266
Okay. Will you go or stop?

2223
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:42,787
(What will the brothers choose to do?)

2224
01:17:44,007 --> 01:17:45,577
- Go.
- Go.

2225
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,306
I think it's worth trying.

2226
01:17:48,307 --> 01:17:49,827
(The present for Round 3 is revealed.)

2227
01:17:50,307 --> 01:17:51,447
This is crazy.

2228
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:52,876
"My brother works like a supply officer."

2229
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,386
"I wish he could go on a therapeutic trip."

2230
01:17:55,387 --> 01:17:56,517
"A RIMOWA suitcase."

2231
01:17:57,417 --> 01:17:59,716
- Really?
- It's a nice suitcase.

2232
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,056
- It's really expensive.
- It's an expensive one.

2233
01:18:01,057 --> 01:18:02,087
It's really expensive.

2234
01:18:02,627 --> 01:18:03,726
Thank you.

2235
01:18:03,727 --> 01:18:04,927
(They bring it in right away.)

2236
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:07,057
My gosh. This is crazy.

2237
01:18:07,357 --> 01:18:08,397
Open it.

2238
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,366
My goodness.

2239
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,036
You should go to California with this suitcase.

2240
01:18:12,037 --> 01:18:13,096
- I think I should.
- Goodness.

2241
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:14,906
(3 prizes are at stake in Round 3.)

2242
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:16,066
(Round 3:)

2243
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:19,207
(The cans are smaller and narrower.)

2244
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:21,607
So they're not the fat ones like before?

2245
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,247
(Grunting)

2246
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:26,146
(The cans are...)

2247
01:18:26,147 --> 01:18:27,316
(smaller than before.)

2248
01:18:27,317 --> 01:18:28,646
- How many cans are there?
- Three cans.

2249
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:29,746
Three cans? Okay.

2250
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:30,907
(There's a clear difference.)

2251
01:18:34,017 --> 01:18:36,126
- But I think you can do this.
- It looks difficult.

2252
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:37,527
- Actually, I'm confident.
- Right.

2253
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:38,756
- You can do it.
- You can just think...

2254
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:39,826
- that they are the same.
- I mean...

2255
01:18:39,827 --> 01:18:41,927
Look. Like this...

2256
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:43,697
Hold it with two fingers.

2257
01:18:44,027 --> 01:18:46,336
Try it as if you're slapping it.

2258
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:47,396
Like this.

2259
01:18:47,397 --> 01:18:49,667
If you do it as if you're slapping...

2260
01:18:50,007 --> 01:18:51,106
(Strategy Son's Winning Strategy 4: Hit it as if you're slapping it)

2261
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:52,347
Then the ball will be stronger.

2262
01:18:52,977 --> 01:18:54,337
All right. I feel good about this.

2263
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:57,177
(As if I'm slapping...)

2264
01:18:57,677 --> 01:18:58,777
Hold on.

2265
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:01,377
- Hold on.
- What's wrong with you?

2266
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:03,916
Take it easy.

2267
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:05,057
It's making me feel nervous.

2268
01:19:09,127 --> 01:19:10,356
(His shot got better thanks to Strategy Son's winning strategy.)

2269
01:19:10,357 --> 01:19:11,897
Good. Try it, Da Mi.

2270
01:19:13,297 --> 01:19:14,357
That was good.

2271
01:19:14,597 --> 01:19:15,797
Should I pass the ball to you?

2272
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:22,167
Da Mi.

2273
01:19:22,307 --> 01:19:23,666
- Goodness.
- Da Mi.

2274
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:24,937
Da Mi. Hit the ball first.

2275
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:27,336
You need to hit the ball first.

2276
01:19:27,337 --> 01:19:29,097
Why would you check before hitting the ball?

2277
01:19:29,507 --> 01:19:30,746
You need to look at the ball.

2278
01:19:30,747 --> 01:19:32,276
(She hit the ball without looking at it.)

2279
01:19:32,277 --> 01:19:33,597
Da Mi, you need to practice more.

2280
01:19:34,577 --> 01:19:35,886
(Practising hard)

2281
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:38,063
- How many tries do we have left?
- You have four more to go.

2282
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:40,533
People might think that you're shooting a movie about ping-pong.

2283
01:19:40,557 --> 01:19:41,686
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2284
01:19:41,687 --> 01:19:42,956
- You got the hang of it.
- Da Mi.

2285
01:19:42,957 --> 01:19:44,487
- You got this.
- The can is bent.

2286
01:19:44,587 --> 01:19:45,656
Let's go.

2287
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,727
- Jae Suk. Let's go now.
- Let's go.

2288
01:19:47,827 --> 01:19:49,426
- You should go last.
- Okay.

2289
01:19:49,427 --> 01:19:51,466
- All right. Yeon Seok.
- So, I...

2290
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:53,107
- You go 1st.
- I'll go 1st. I'll take 3.

2291
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,667
- Here we go.
- We should think about the time.

2292
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:56,867
Ready.

2293
01:19:57,407 --> 01:19:58,477
Set.

2294
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,776
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 10)

2295
01:20:00,777 --> 01:20:02,507
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 9)

2296
01:20:02,707 --> 01:20:03,807
Gosh.

2297
01:20:04,777 --> 01:20:06,417
- Goodness.
- It didn't work.

2298
01:20:06,947 --> 01:20:08,047
All right.

2299
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:10,446
- Goodness.
- What do we do?

2300
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:11,886
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 6)

2301
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:13,057
Gosh, that was close.

2302
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:14,856
- Goodness.
- How many balls do we have left?

2303
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,256
How many balls do we have left?

2304
01:20:16,257 --> 01:20:17,503
- We have 4 left.
- We have 4 left?

2305
01:20:17,527 --> 01:20:19,096
You need to finish it.

2306
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:20,557
(Suk Ku the Ace is up.)

2307
01:20:20,897 --> 01:20:22,327
You need to finish it.

2308
01:20:22,427 --> 01:20:26,136
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 3)

2309
01:20:26,137 --> 01:20:27,936
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 2)

2310
01:20:27,937 --> 01:20:29,406
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 1)

2311
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:30,537
Hold on.

2312
01:20:30,637 --> 01:20:32,836
- This is so not right.
- No.

2313
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:34,936
- The balls were...
- Seriously.

2314
01:20:34,937 --> 01:20:36,376
- The balls were...
- Someone should've...

2315
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:37,446
passed you the balls.

2316
01:20:37,447 --> 01:20:38,846
- We should've done that.
- We need to...

2317
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:40,246
- Seriously.
- We need to calm down.

2318
01:20:40,247 --> 01:20:41,316
Okay.

2319
01:20:41,317 --> 01:20:42,616
- We got worked up.
- I know.

2320
01:20:42,617 --> 01:20:44,586
- We were in a hurry to finish it.
- Right.

2321
01:20:44,587 --> 01:20:45,827
- We let our guard down.
- Yes.

2322
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:47,816
- You should go 1st.
- You go 1st.

2323
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:49,026
- I'll pass the balls to you.
- Okay.

2324
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:50,226
- Pass me the ball.
- Okay.

2325
01:20:50,227 --> 01:20:52,596
- Let's have Da Mi go next.
- Then you should stand behind me.

2326
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:53,996
- Okay.
- And you go last.

2327
01:20:53,997 --> 01:20:56,266
- Stand like this.
- We shouldn't waste time.

2328
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:58,567
- You take four balls.
- You stand in front of me.

2329
01:20:58,837 --> 01:21:00,396
- Pass me the ball like this.
- Okay.

2330
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,837
- I'll have two in my hand.
- Okay.

2331
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:03,167
Ready.

2332
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,007
- You're going, right?
- Yes.

2333
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,307
Set.

2334
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,447
(Exclaiming)

2335
01:21:12,377 --> 01:21:13,476
(He got 2 with 1 shot again.)

2336
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:15,586
(But...)

2337
01:21:15,587 --> 01:21:16,717
Fall down. Hey.

2338
01:21:17,047 --> 01:21:18,146
Fall down. Hey.

2339
01:21:18,147 --> 01:21:19,486
Gosh, that's so...

2340
01:21:19,487 --> 01:21:20,956
That will be hard to hit.

2341
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:22,656
- Pass me the ball.
- Unbelievable.

2342
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:23,857
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 8)

2343
01:21:23,957 --> 01:21:25,697
- Get 1 more.
- Good. Just get 1 more.

2344
01:21:26,097 --> 01:21:27,756
- Goodness.
- What do we do?

2345
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:28,827
Da Mi. Let's go.

2346
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:31,066
You got this, Da Mi.

2347
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:32,366
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 5)

2348
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:33,566
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 4)

2349
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:34,696
What do we do?

2350
01:21:34,697 --> 01:21:36,006
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 4)

2351
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:37,207
(It brushed against the can.)

2352
01:21:38,577 --> 01:21:40,737
This won't be easy.

2353
01:21:41,307 --> 01:21:42,447
You've got five seconds.

2354
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:43,647
Goodness.

2355
01:21:44,447 --> 01:21:45,577
You've got five seconds.

2356
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:46,877
Goodness.

2357
01:21:47,817 --> 01:21:48,947
Hold on.

2358
01:21:50,217 --> 01:21:51,446
- Gosh, we were close.
- Goodness.

2359
01:21:51,447 --> 01:21:52,617
My goodness.

2360
01:21:53,317 --> 01:21:54,716
If only he had gotten 2 with 1 shot...

2361
01:21:54,717 --> 01:21:56,927
and Yeon Seok had succeeded with the last one...

2362
01:21:57,087 --> 01:21:58,456
Gosh, this was so hard to hit.

2363
01:21:58,457 --> 01:22:00,997
It gets so hard if this happens.

2364
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:03,966
(They have three more tries to go.)

2365
01:22:03,967 --> 01:22:05,026
- All right.
- Okay.

2366
01:22:05,027 --> 01:22:06,566
- Is this our eighth try?
- Yes.

2367
01:22:06,567 --> 01:22:07,867
- Goodness.
- This is...

2368
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:10,207
You know, it goes like this.

2369
01:22:11,007 --> 01:22:12,777
It only counts when we hit the ball, right?

2370
01:22:12,937 --> 01:22:14,576
- If we miss, it doesn't count.
- Yes.

2371
01:22:14,577 --> 01:22:16,377
We don't need to pick up the ball.

2372
01:22:16,477 --> 01:22:19,076
- We let it go?
- We should do that to save time.

2373
01:22:19,077 --> 01:22:20,116
(Strategy Son's Winning Strategy 7: Let go of the balls that fell)

2374
01:22:20,117 --> 01:22:21,793
- He's a strategist.
- You've become so serious.

2375
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:22,887
A strategist.

2376
01:22:23,017 --> 01:22:24,646
- Suk Ku is so serious.
- He's a strategist.

2377
01:22:24,647 --> 01:22:26,816
- He's Strategy Son.
- Should I go?

2378
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,017
- Okay.
- Will you go first?

2379
01:22:28,317 --> 01:22:29,627
- You go 1st.
- Should I go 1st?

2380
01:22:29,787 --> 01:22:30,787
You can do it!

2381
01:22:31,227 --> 01:22:32,947
It's our eighth try. Let's do it this time.

2382
01:22:33,057 --> 01:22:34,956
- In 1, 2, 3, let's go!
- Let's go.

2383
01:22:34,957 --> 01:22:36,996
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2384
01:22:36,997 --> 01:22:40,797
(It seems that they have a chance.)

2385
01:22:47,977 --> 01:22:49,076
(Yeon Seok got 3 with 1 shot.)

2386
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:50,577
Goodness. Calm down.

2387
01:22:51,377 --> 01:22:53,647
(They have one left.)

2388
01:22:54,577 --> 01:22:56,257
Take your time. You just need to get that.

2389
01:22:56,387 --> 01:22:58,116
Okay. Hit it and make it roll.

2390
01:22:58,117 --> 01:23:00,186
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 7)

2391
01:23:00,187 --> 01:23:01,356
- Goodness.
- How many do we have left?

2392
01:23:01,357 --> 01:23:03,127
Suk Ku. You have four left.

2393
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:05,656
- You need to get it. I'll pass it.
- But that one looks so hard.

2394
01:23:05,657 --> 01:23:07,956
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 6)

2395
01:23:07,957 --> 01:23:09,896
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 5)

2396
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:10,997
All right.

2397
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:12,536
There's one more.

2398
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:13,736
- Take this.
- Goodness.

2399
01:23:13,737 --> 01:23:15,137
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 3)

2400
01:23:16,937 --> 01:23:19,507
(They are about to succeed.)

2401
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:20,907
Five.

2402
01:23:21,777 --> 01:23:22,907
Four.

2403
01:23:23,277 --> 01:23:25,177
(They have only one ball left.)

2404
01:23:25,577 --> 01:23:26,817
We just need to touch it.

2405
01:23:27,217 --> 01:23:28,857
- Three, two.
- We just need to touch it.

2406
01:23:29,247 --> 01:23:30,387
Two.

2407
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:32,156
We just need to touch it.

2408
01:23:32,157 --> 01:23:33,517
(Failure)

2409
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:35,957
(Grunting)

2410
01:23:36,527 --> 01:23:37,756
(It was so close this time.)

2411
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:39,397
Gosh, if that happens...

2412
01:23:41,197 --> 01:23:42,197
Unbelievable.

2413
01:23:43,697 --> 01:23:45,367
What? We have only two tries left.

2414
01:23:46,697 --> 01:23:48,536
(It's their ninth try now.)

2415
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:49,806
Oh, come on.

2416
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:52,436
Push them back a bit.

2417
01:23:52,437 --> 01:23:54,337
Why are you making them roll forward?

2418
01:23:54,407 --> 01:23:56,006
They won't fall off from here.

2419
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:57,206
Oh, come on!

2420
01:23:57,207 --> 01:24:00,077
They're pushing them forward again.

2421
01:24:00,147 --> 01:24:01,446
(No mercy)

2422
01:24:01,447 --> 01:24:02,717
The ball should be...

2423
01:24:03,517 --> 01:24:05,046
If we don't succeed this time,

2424
01:24:05,047 --> 01:24:06,527
it would put too much pressure on us.

2425
01:24:07,017 --> 01:24:08,987
- This is so hard.
- Right.

2426
01:24:09,787 --> 01:24:12,156
- Since I hit it hard, - Right.

2427
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:13,196
I think it's right for me to go first.

2428
01:24:13,197 --> 01:24:14,226
Right. You should go first.

2429
01:24:14,227 --> 01:24:15,266
- You should go 1st.
- Send them away 1st.

2430
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:16,527
That would be better.

2431
01:24:17,397 --> 01:24:19,566
It'll be 3, 3, 2, 2.

2432
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:20,896
- Okay.
- Let's do our cheer.

2433
01:24:20,897 --> 01:24:23,106
If we fail this time, we should use the bonus coupon.

2434
01:24:23,107 --> 01:24:24,906
We have to succeed this time. It'll be too hard on the next try.

2435
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:26,106
In 1, 2, 3.

2436
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:27,176
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2437
01:24:27,177 --> 01:24:28,646
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2438
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,247
We really have to succeed this time.

2439
01:24:31,207 --> 01:24:32,546
- Okay.
- It's 3 and 3.

2440
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:34,417
(Their eyes look determined.)

2441
01:24:34,777 --> 01:24:36,746
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 10)

2442
01:24:36,747 --> 01:24:39,486
(Ping-pong balls remaining: 9)

2443
01:24:39,487 --> 01:24:40,557
He missed it.

2444
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:45,947
(He got 3 with 1 shot again!)

2445
01:24:47,997 --> 01:24:50,897
(It's a chance to end things!)

2446
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:52,997
- Finish it.
- Hold on.

2447
01:24:53,837 --> 01:24:56,137
Hold on. There's one left.

2448
01:24:56,237 --> 01:24:57,266
Why is that still there?

2449
01:24:57,267 --> 01:24:58,467
It could roll off!

2450
01:25:00,237 --> 01:25:02,106
Hold on. There's one left.

2451
01:25:02,107 --> 01:25:03,907
It could roll off!

2452
01:25:04,747 --> 01:25:06,377
- Hey!
- Hey!

2453
01:25:07,017 --> 01:25:08,047
Hold on.

2454
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,287
It could roll off!

2455
01:25:10,517 --> 01:25:12,556
Go! Come this way!

2456
01:25:12,557 --> 01:25:13,617
Wait!

2457
01:25:13,987 --> 01:25:15,403
- It could roll off!
- Go! Come this way!

2458
01:25:15,427 --> 01:25:16,927
- Come this way!
- Wait!

2459
01:25:31,107 --> 01:25:34,007
(This really happened!)

2460
01:25:40,577 --> 01:25:41,917
There's one left.

2461
01:25:42,787 --> 01:25:43,787
Why is that still there?

2462
01:25:43,788 --> 01:25:45,356
- It could roll off!
- Come this way!

2463
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:46,517
Wait!

2464
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:51,287
(A legendary scene that might never happen again)

2465
01:25:52,327 --> 01:25:55,696
(Son Suk Ku has done it!)

2466
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:56,766
- Gosh!
- Son Suk Ku!

2467
01:25:56,767 --> 01:25:57,796
What was that?

2468
01:25:57,797 --> 01:25:59,537
- Gosh!
- Nice one!

2469
01:26:00,497 --> 01:26:02,206
- Nice!
- Gosh!

2470
01:26:02,207 --> 01:26:03,807
- Gosh!
- Yes!

2471
01:26:04,737 --> 01:26:06,506
This reminds me of...

2472
01:26:06,507 --> 01:26:09,147
- Tiger Woods!
- Right. Tiger Woods!

2473
01:26:09,577 --> 01:26:11,546
That was like his hole-in-one moment.

2474
01:26:11,547 --> 01:26:12,817
That was just like Tiger Woods.

2475
01:26:13,617 --> 01:26:16,747
- His hole-in-one.
- It went in like this.

2476
01:26:17,347 --> 01:26:18,617
- Suk Ku!
- Yes?

2477
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:20,427
- You're going to become a model.
- Gosh.

2478
01:26:20,687 --> 01:26:22,787
(He's ready to become the Coke model.)

2479
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:24,887
(He still can't believe what just happened.)

2480
01:26:25,127 --> 01:26:26,856
Gosh, that was amazing.

2481
01:26:26,857 --> 01:26:27,956
(The pleasant aftertaste of that moment still lingers.)

2482
01:26:27,957 --> 01:26:29,126
And just like that,

2483
01:26:29,127 --> 01:26:31,396
- we clear Round 3!
- We clear Round 3!

2484
01:26:31,397 --> 01:26:33,537
(They clear Round 3!)

2485
01:26:34,797 --> 01:26:36,267
- That was miraculous.
- Gosh.

2486
01:26:37,007 --> 01:26:39,406
How did it feel when it started rolling toward you?

2487
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:40,407
After hitting it,

2488
01:26:40,707 --> 01:26:42,267
I wondered if it would really roll off.

2489
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:44,647
It moved as if it was alive.

2490
01:26:46,177 --> 01:26:48,146
- That was dramatic.
- That was dramatic.

2491
01:26:48,147 --> 01:26:49,147
I'm sweating again.

2492
01:26:49,148 --> 01:26:50,386
Their drama is going to be a big success.

2493
01:26:50,387 --> 01:26:52,817
We did it on the ninth try for "Nine Puzzles."

2494
01:26:53,687 --> 01:26:55,956
- What?
- I'm getting goosebumps. "Nine?"

2495
01:26:55,957 --> 01:26:57,256
(The "puzzle" was matched on the "9th" attempt.)

2496
01:26:57,257 --> 01:26:58,403
I guess that was how it happened.

2497
01:26:58,427 --> 01:26:59,626
- We have to get a picture.
- Right.

2498
01:26:59,627 --> 01:27:02,097
- I'll get a picture for you.
- Okay.

2499
01:27:02,727 --> 01:27:04,167
Let's get a picture.

2500
01:27:04,797 --> 01:27:06,897
- Right.
- You should really take one.

2501
01:27:07,467 --> 01:27:08,807
Take a ball.

2502
01:27:09,467 --> 01:27:10,866
That was just amazing.

2503
01:27:10,867 --> 01:27:12,577
One, two, three.

2504
01:27:12,877 --> 01:27:14,736
Please send "Nine Puzzles" a lot of love!

2505
01:27:14,737 --> 01:27:16,446
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2506
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:17,502
(A day where the puzzles were solved for Suk Ku and Da Mi!)

2507
01:27:19,377 --> 01:27:25,717
(Whenever Possible)
