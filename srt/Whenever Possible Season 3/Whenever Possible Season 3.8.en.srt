1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,870
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,970
It's raining uncertainly.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,440
What kind of rain is this called? A misty rain?

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,830
- A drizzle? I think it's that.
- A drizzle.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,440
Gosh, this place.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,039
- This is your area.
- It's my hometown.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,709
This is the mountain...

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,209
I used to go up often when I was young.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,849
- It has been redesigned as a park.
- Right. It's really nice.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,150
It's completely different from when I used to live here.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,089
Suyu-dong is your area.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,319
I'm known to be from Suyu-ri.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,619
It's so nice here.

14
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,129
This is Ppalaegol.

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,789
- Ppalaegol?
- Right.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,099
- There was a wash place here.
- There was a wash place here?

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,869
That was how it got its name,

18
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,330
and I came here often.

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,899
And...

20
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,570
when I...

21
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,440
got away from town,

22
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,609
I never mentioned Ppalaegol in the taxi.

23
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,709
- Why not?
- Sorry?

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,339
- It was a little bit...
- Why not?

25
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,010
It sounded a bit off.

26
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,256
- It sounded like a wash place.
- It was my area,

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,050
but the name Ppalaegol...

28
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,119
didn't sound too appealing.

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,650
That was why I just called it Suyu-ri.

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
(Peeking)

31
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,560
Are you performing today?

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,536
- Do you have something coming up?
- Well,

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,559
weren't we going to a club at night?

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,069
The place you used to go to when you were young.

35
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,300
- It wasn't this area.
- I heard you went to...

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,669
nightclubs often in Suyu-dong.

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,069
The club I went to in Suyu-dong...

38
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,710
- Is it gone?
- no longer exists.

39
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,409
All right.

40
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,839
Your outfit looks fancy today.

41
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,609
There was a bit of controversy with my stylist.

42
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,379
I knew that you would say something...

43
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,149
if I wear this outfit.

44
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,379
- That was why...
- It can't be helped.

45
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,849
That was why I kept saying, "I think this is too fancy."

46
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,560
"Let's go with a normal cardigan."

47
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,060
But as soon as I wore this...

48
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,690
(Sighing)

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,459
I said something as soon as he wore it.

50
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,220
I said it felt like something from Harajuku.

51
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,769
An outfit from Harajuku.

52
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,940
- Right. It has that feel.
- It has that feel.

53
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,299
- Stop bringing it up.
- Fine.

54
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,410
- Let's talk about Suyu-dong.
- Right. Suyu-dong.

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,309
- Let's see. Will they be there?
- They're filming over there.

56
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,449
- They're filming over there?
- Yes. Let's go.

57
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,780
We just go toward them?

58
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,079
They probably won't know we're here.

59
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Right. I heard they don't know who the guests are.

60
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,750
- Right.
- I know this place well.

61
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,519
I went to the mineral spring with my father here.

62
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
In the morning?

63
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:12,559
I hated it when he woke me up early in the morning...

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
during my vacation.

65
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:15,159
But even now...

66
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,000
- There are people coming.
- Who are they?

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,370
- Gosh!
- It's Hyun Sung!

68
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,170
Hello.

69
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,270
(Today's Whenever Friends, Jang Hyun Sung and Kim Dae Myung)

70
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,540
- I knew it was Dae Myung.
- Gosh!

71
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,310
He's from Suyu-ri.

72
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,849
- Gosh.
- What?

73
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,379
- I did think about him.
- Right.

74
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,519
I wondered if he would really come.

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,689
- Hyun Sung.
- It's been a while.

76
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,089
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

77
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,149
- Gosh, Dae Myung.
- Gosh.

78
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,559
My junior from Suyu-ri.

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,590
Of course.

80
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,990
(Last winter)

81
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,430
(Dae Myung came to sub in for Yeon Seok.)

82
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,829
(He's a junior from Suyu-ri!)

83
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,039
(Dae Myung is from Suyu-ri too!)

84
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,169
It's the Suyu-ri Special today.

85
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,309
(That was how the first group of Suyu-ri members was formed.)

86
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,439
The ones from Suyu-ri made a great achievement.

87
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,680
- Right.
- In Gangbuk, at that.

88
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,710
(Suyu-ri junior Dae Myung made a great achievement.)

89
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,049
I wondered if it was you.

90
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,920
- I didn't tell you on purpose.
- Gosh.

91
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,379
You're not from this area, right?

92
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,389
I'm not from this area.

93
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,789
I was born in Geoje.

94
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,489
- I see.
- I then moved to Ilsan.

95
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,290
What's with your outfits today?

96
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,089
- Check out his outfit.
- Well,

97
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,029
- it's a bit controversial.
- It's like he's at...

98
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,429
- a nightclub.
- He's performing on stage today.

99
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,569
(Fascinated)

100
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,099
Dae Myung looks like he's out for a walk around town.

101
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,639
These are my actual clothes.

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,169
- Really?
- Really?

103
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,369
- Right.
- But...

104
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,840
You look so natural though.

105
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,709
- It's because I'm in my area.
- I see.

106
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,310
- You look so unnatural.
- Right.

107
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,209
If I stand next to Dae Myung...

108
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,780
- He's dressed to kill.
- Right.

109
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,949
Everyone will tell he's a celebrity.

110
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,049
- When displayed on a graph, - Should we...

111
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,449
- switch just our tops?
- it's the man of nature here,

112
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,989
- and it moves up to the celebrity.
- Right.

113
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,689
You look like a director...

114
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,529
- of an entertainment company.
- Right.

115
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,629
It's like you've dressed up after a while.

116
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,159
- Right.
- That's how it feels.

117
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,699
It feels like you should stand there...

118
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,440
and head back after watching us do the opening.

119
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,769
- "Good luck today."
- And you'd give out money.

120
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,309
- Take a seat, Hyun Sung.
- Right.

121
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,769
Which area in Suyu-ri are you from, Dae Myung?

122
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,239
To be honest, my house is really close from here.

123
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,009
It really surprised me. It's a ten-minute walk from here.

124
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,779
From here? Your house is around this area?

125
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,879
Hanshin University is right there.

126
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,479
- Right.
- My house is right there.

127
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,749
He lived really near me.

128
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,789
Is your house in this area?

129
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,619
I lived in the Ppalaegol area.

130
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,919
- Really?
- I went to Suyu Middle School.

131
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,089
This place is called Ppalaegol.

132
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,529
I came here really often when I performed in plays.

133
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,029
I see. Since Daehak-ro...

134
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,159
- is nearby.
- Right.

135
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Since Daehak-ro is nearby,

136
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,399
I was really jealous of those...

137
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,999
who lived in Suyu-ri...

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,239
- or Chang-dong.
- Around here.

139
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,999
I was really jealous of those who lived on their own there.

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,910
Suyu-ri is a great place.

141
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,279
- It's a great place to live.
- Yes.

142
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
- It's a great place to live.
- Right.

143
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,150
- You must've gotten a haircut.
- Right.

144
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,019
I got a haircut for today.

145
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,049
Hold on. I think I should help with the hair on your face.

146
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,020
- You must've...
- This is being natural too.

147
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,719
- Right. It does look natural.
- Gosh.

148
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,989
It's been a while for him to be on a variety show. Hold on.

149
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,089
Now that I think about it, when Dae Myung came last time,

150
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,499
- Yeon Seok wasn't there.
- Right.

151
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,859
- I was an MC.
- Right.

152
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,470
- I see.
- Right.

153
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,869
- You're a guest for the first time.
- Right.

154
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,499
You guys went to Everland last time.

155
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,109
- He went there on his own.
- That's right.

156
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,709
He went on his own a few days before the shoot.

157
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,539
He went to Everland on his own before the shoot.

158
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,010
I didn't want to cause trouble for Yeon Seok.

159
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,449
I tried to understand...

160
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,849
- Yeon Seok's position fully.
- Why would you cause trouble?

161
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,349
Dae Myung is ambitious.

162
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,489
- Right.
- He's an ambitious one.

163
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,849
He worked so hard.

164
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,219
He's waiting for his spot to be open.

165
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,989
- He's prepared for it.
- Right.

166
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,229
He's here as Mr. Storyteller today.

167
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,160
Right. Today...

168
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,629
- You're right.
- Right.

169
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,629
He's here as Mr. Storyteller.

170
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,899
When he spoke earlier,

171
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,540
- he got all of our attention.
- Right.

172
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,369
To be honest, he's someone I really look up to.

173
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,469
- Really?
- Yes.

174
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,539
Dae Myung is a junior of mine from the theater company.

175
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,839
- Really?
- Yes.

176
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,239
- My junior from Hakchon.
- Hakchon.

177
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,249
- He's my senior.
- So you were in Hakchon too.

178
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,009
- Right.
- Gosh.

179
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,119
- "Subway Line 1."
- Right.

180
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,049
I didn't know Dae Myung was in Hakchon.

181
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,119
- Right.
- He has a lot of experience.

182
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,649
You had a solid background.

183
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,559
- Right.
- Right.

184
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,919
Were you in Hakchon too?

185
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,160
No.

186
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,889
(It's obvious that he's trying to make fun of him.)

187
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,959
No? Then how did you become an actor?

188
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,399
- What are you saying?
- Well...

189
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,829
I just had my own ways.

190
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,170
- Is that so?
- Yes.

191
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,740
- I had my own ways.
- My goodness.

192
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,769
I remember when I first met Yeon Seok.

193
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,109
- It was...
- The daily drama.

194
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,579
Right. It was when we were in a daily drama.

195
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,579
- He was a rookie back then.
- Right.

196
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,980
It was my first daily drama too.

197
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,849
- I see.
- It was new for me,

198
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,889
but Yeon Seok...

199
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,489
- He was a baby?
- seemed like a weakling.

200
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,290
(The weakling)

201
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,989
I think that was my first ever...

202
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,229
- daily drama.
- Right.

203
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,329
- It was with Chung Ah.
- Right.

204
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,159
- But Yeon Seok...
- Lee Chung Ah.

205
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,860
Worked really hard.

206
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,799
I heard that Yeon Seok used to work really hard.

207
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
- He really did.
- Why say that in the past tense?

208
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,539
- I'm not sure about that now.
- Are you serious?

209
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,470
Look at this jacket! He's so diligent!

210
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,839
- Really?
- I film for dramas...

211
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,979
and I'm now here for a variety show.

212
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,540
- I work really hard.
- Right.

213
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,449
- Why say that in the past tense?
- I said that in the past tense.

214
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,719
- Gosh.
- Come on.

215
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,020
- Why say that in the past tense?
- Fine.

216
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,249
- It's present progressive.
- Okay.

217
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,130
(Yeon Seok's hard work is present progressive.)

218
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,360
As for Jae Suk,

219
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,159
I got to know you personally...

220
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,090
- while filming for a show.
- Right.

221
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,860
But I remember...

222
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,769
when you were a student.

223
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,529
- How do you remember that?
- Were you in the Class of '91?

224
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,339
- Yes.
- I was in the Class of '89.

225
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,399
So we went to school around the same time.

226
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,509
I did my military service in the 1990s.

227
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,909
- When you returned to school?
- Yes, I returned to school.

228
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,680
- Near the school's front gate...
- Yes?

229
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,879
- What is it?
- When Jae Suk was a freshman?

230
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,919
There are college students like him.

231
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,080
What does that mean?

232
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,489
You're being cruel, Hyun Sung.

233
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,659
- Wait.
- Can I ask you for a favor?

234
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,120
Can you tell us in your "A Story about the Day" voice?

235
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,890
All right. Here it is.

236
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,000
- This was in 1993.
- Okay.

237
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,469
- December of 1993.
- It was in December.

238
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,199
It was in the middle of winter.

239
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,299
There was a dim streak of light before sunrise.

240
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,369
This makes me focus.

241
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,909
- I could barely see.
- You could barely see.

242
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,979
Most returning students had been up all night...

243
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,879
- and were lying down in exhaustion.
- Right.

244
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,220
There was a bench by some crocks near the school.

245
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,150
I was going to get some rest on it.

246
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,360
Then I suddenly saw,

247
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,929
by the front gate of the school,

248
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,699
three to four students.

249
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,730
- They were walking in.
- Gosh.

250
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,170
But they weren't dressed like students you normally see.

251
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,739
- Were they dressed like him?
- Stop it.

252
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,539
Were you wearing a leather jacket?

253
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,780
They were dressed in suits.

254
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,750
- They wanted to look like adults.
- That's right.

255
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,819
- Jae Suk's hair looks natural now.
- Yes.

256
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,150
But it was slicked back at the time.

257
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,689
He would've been in danger if there were a fire.

258
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,960
It looked as if BGM was playing in their heads.

259
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,399
You basically mean you found us annoying.

260
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,729
- That's right.
- So they looked like delinquents?

261
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,799
- Right.
- From Hyun Sung's perspective.

262
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,669
(Jae Suk's story about the day when he was a delinquent)

263
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,270
- Let's go meet our Whenever Guest.
- Yes, we should go.

264
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,340
- We should go.
- I'm curious...

265
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,709
who we will be meeting in Suyu-ri.

266
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,149
- Me too.
- Right?

267
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,910
(Flipping it open)

268
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,396
I can't believe I saw that in person.

269
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,920
I haven't seen that for a while.

270
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,949
- You saw it last year.
- It's become a performance.

271
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,619
- This is our first Whenever Guest.
- Okay.

272
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,519
- Park Gi Mun.
- Gi Mun.

273
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,629
And Han Hyun Sook.

274
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,029
- It's two people?
- They must be a married couple.

275
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,599
"We're a married couple that spend all day together..."

276
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,070
"from work and gatherings to even pilates."

277
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,490
- "With out teamwork of 35 years..."
- That must be tough.

278
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
It must be tough?

279
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,639
It must be tough. Can't you already tell?

280
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,979
- Yes, of course.
- Right?

281
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,709
- Although they love each other.
- Because...

282
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,380
- if they even work together...
- You're right.

283
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,919
- For 35 years.
- I know.

284
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,019
For 35 years?

285
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,619
"With our perfect teamwork of 35 years,"

286
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,460
"we wash away our customers' built-up grime."

287
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,559
Car wash?

288
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,619
- "Visit us..."
- Cleaner's?

289
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,589
- Cleaner's?
- "Visit us..."

290
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,759
"at our Ppalaegol where love bubbles over."

291
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,999
- Cleaner's?
- Love bubbles over?

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,469
"Visit us at our Ppalaegol."

293
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,539
Ppalaegol is actually a village where people did their laundry.

294
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,039
- That's right.
- Because the water is clean.

295
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,439
Did you come and explore Ppalaegol yesterday?

296
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,810
I'm prepared for anything.

297
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,409
Stay on the edge of your seat.

298
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,050
You think you'll always be the host for the jacket you're wearing?

299
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,749
Dae Myung speaks to Yeon Seok carelessly.

300
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,350
We speak carelessly to each other.

301
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,059
- You're wrong to think that.
- Yes. See?

302
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,219
- He's like Cha Tae Hyun.
- You're right.

303
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,060
You're only worried about your appearance.

304
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,800
There are people like that in your life.

305
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,070
- I'll look up the location.
- Okay.

306
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,730
Insubong-ro?

307
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,170
- It must be nearby.
- I think...

308
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,710
we have to go that way.

309
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,739
- How long does it take?
- It's a 12-minute walk.

310
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,409
- That's close.
- It's close.

311
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,780
- Shall we?
- Yes, let's go.

312
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,809
It's so pretty here.

313
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,109
Yes, it's very nice here.

314
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,519
This wasn't here a long time ago.

315
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,820
It was just a dirt path.

316
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,519
(Going down memory lane)

317
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,989
I noticed this when I lived here a long time ago,

318
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,390
but the air is clean.

319
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,189
- Mount Bukhan is close by.
- I love the scent of mountains.

320
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,529
The air is different.

321
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,530
- Right?
- Even though we're still in Seoul.

322
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:13,559
It's nice.

323
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,269
You must've walked around this area when you were younger.

324
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,000
I used to sled here in the winter when there was ice.

325
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,409
It's changed a lot.

326
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,569
(Ppalaegol has changed a lot over time.)

327
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,556
- Is slightly raining?
- I get confused when I visit.

328
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,480
You get confused when you visit the neighborhood you grew up in.

329
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,149
This was all part of Ppalaegol.

330
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,549
I'll share your umbrella.

331
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,620
Okay.

332
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,049
- This is a nice neighborhood.
- It looks welcoming.

333
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,219
- Right?
- Yes.

334
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,120
Suyu-ri used to be part of Gyeonggi Province.

335
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
- Really?
- It was?

336
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:44,329
- A long time ago.
- I believe it was part of Goyang.

337
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,360
I think I read it somewhere.

338
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,369
Did you study that too?

339
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,030
I should study everything.

340
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,000
You have to do your best.

341
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,910
I'll look forward to today's lunch.

342
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,139
You must know all the good restaurants nearby.

343
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,179
Of course.

344
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,780
Dae Myung knows many good restaurants.

345
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,879
- You're right.
- Dae Myung knows his food.

346
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,109
Yes, he really does.

347
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,650
I still often come to this neighborhood.

348
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,549
(Follow Dae Myung to a good restaurant.)

349
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,349
If you go straight down,

350
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,990
we'll reach Hanshin University...

351
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,170
- and Suyu Middle School. Yes.
- Suyu Middle School.

352
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,160
This road wasn't here before.

353
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,960
- There wasn't a road here?
- No, they paved it.

354
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,799
- If there was no road...
- We used to walk.

355
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,270
Were there ox carts here?

356
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,000
Come on, Hyun Sung.

357
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,109
- I'm serious.
- Hyun Sung.

358
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,239
It was in the late 1980s.

359
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,879
- Who rode ox carts then?
- Wait.

360
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,139
I live in Ilsan.

361
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,779
When I was in elementary school...

362
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,879
You rode in ox carts?

363
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,250
- Yes.
- Really?

364
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,650
Back then...

365
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,720
- Really?
- There were ox carts...

366
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,689
and horse carriages at the markets.

367
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,789
There were carriages?

368
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,989
Yes, there were.

369
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,800
We're talking about ox carts when there are autonomous vehicles.

370
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,830
(The story about the day of Hyun Sung)

371
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,340
It's so nice being here with you, Dae Myung.

372
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,370
I feel comfortable.

373
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,330
- That's a relief.
- Back then...

374
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,539
Yeon Seok seems to love having Dae Myung on the show.

375
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,540
I feel so comfortable.

376
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,280
It must be like when I'm with Seok Sam.

377
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,679
- I think that's it.
- Right?

378
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,320
- You're even sharing an umbrella.
- Yes.

379
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,089
Dae Myung makes the people around him feel comfortable.

380
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,319
- Yes, he does.
- You're right.

381
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,880
- Dae Myung is nice.
- You flatter me.

382
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,929
I always walked around this neighborhood by myself.

383
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,729
It's nice to be here with you and Yeon Seok.

384
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,869
- You like it?
- Yes, albeit strange.

385
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,039
Youhyeon Elementary School and Suyu Middle School are up there.

386
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
That's right.

387
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,509
(They are near Jae Suk's alma mater, Youhyeon Elementary School.)

388
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,670
There used to be...

389
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,409
lines of zelcova trees here, but they're gone.

390
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,149
(While Jae Suk is going down memory lane...)

391
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,779
(Is that it?)

392
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,250
- I think it's over there.
- Right?

393
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,749
- I see a drawing...
- You're right.

394
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,519
- of a couple.
- Really?

395
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,690
- It's on the sign.
- You're right.

396
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,019
- There is?
- The cleaner's?

397
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,029
Yes.

398
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,329
- You're right.
- That's it.

399
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,490
I can tell they've been working together for 35 years.

400
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,000
- They have a customer.
- Wait a minute.

401
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,270
They even have a Silver Play Button...

402
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:04,970
- from YouTube.
- Exactly.

403
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,839
They must have a YouTube channel telling people how to wash clothes.

404
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,870
You think so?

405
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,810
Are they YouTubers?

406
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,080
- It's here.
- Those two.

407
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,456
- You're right.
- Is this the wrong place?

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,440
- Is this the wrong place?
- This must not be it.

409
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,149
- Are Gi Mun and Hyun Sook here?
- Yes, that's right.

410
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,150
- Is that you?
- Okay.

411
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,249
(Their first spare time is at a cleaner's.)

412
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,619
Boss, you have a customer.

413
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,360
- They even have a mic.
- They have a mic.

414
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,319
Why is everything so fancy here?

415
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
(Staring at something)

416
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:28,761
- I've seen this before.
- You have?

417
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,159
He used to be a YouTuber. Oh, hello.

418
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,399
- He's still a YouTuber.
- Should we go in?

419
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,099
- Should we go in?
- Come inside.

420
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,699
- Go downstairs.
- Thank you.

421
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
- This way?
- Okay.

422
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,639
Go out this way and go downstairs.

423
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,199
- This way?
- There is a basement?

424
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,209
What's this?

425
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,890
(The Whenever Guests are in the basement.)

426
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,540
(Screaming)

427
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,679
- Hello.
- Hello.

428
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,809
(They suddenly hear a unique laugh.)

429
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,479
- You were here.
- My goodness.

430
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,350
- Hello.
- They were downstairs.

431
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,919
(Han Hyun Sook and Park Gi Mun, the first Whenever Guests)

432
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,050
Hello.

433
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,060
- I'll show you the cleaner's.
- Okay.

434
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,789
- Cleaner's are...
- It's huge.

435
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,429
I'm sure you've only seen small ones.

436
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,159
I'll show you a modern-style cleaner's.

437
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,769
- Please have a seat.
- Here?

438
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,770
Yes.

439
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,069
- It's huge.
- Come this way.

440
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,370
- It's quite big.
- You use the entire basement.

441
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,279
(A huge cleaner's that use the entire basement level)

442
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,709
- Gosh.
- This is like a factory.

443
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,719
Isn't this a factory?

444
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,649
There are so many different types of machinery.

445
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,650
(They launder clothes, remove stains and restore them.)

446
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,489
I do all kinds of work.

447
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,759
(It is filled with products related to washing clothes.)

448
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,619
- Let's go that way.
- Okay.

449
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,589
- This is our office.
- I see.

450
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,130
This must be your office space.

451
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,940
There's even an inversion table.

452
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,369
(The first Whenever Guest of Suyu-ri has everything.)

453
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,399
This is a lot of space.

454
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,129
- You know what?
- The basement is huge.

455
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,440
I feel like...

456
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,740
we're visiting a successful laundromat in the US.

457
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,309
- You're right.
- Have a seat.

458
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,556
- Okay.
- A chaebol in this business.

459
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,679
A chaebol in this business.

460
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,140
No, we aren't.

461
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,349
The entrance was small with one office.

462
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,589
- So I thought it was a small place.
- Many people think that.

463
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,149
- But you're right.
- How is it so big?

464
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,219
I never imagined so much space in the basement.

465
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,420
There is an underground world.

466
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,059
When the lady at the counter spoke into the microphone...

467
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,389
and told us where to go,

468
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,360
I thought you had an interesting system.

469
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,629
- But the microphone is essential.
- You're right.

470
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,299
- I understand the system now.
- What's it like?

471
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,020
The first floor is like the ticket booth...

472
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,539
of an amusement park.

473
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,909
(It's like a laundry theme park.)

474
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,039
I used to run the cleaner's on the first floor.

475
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,879
- On the first floor?
- Yes.

476
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,779
We didn't have much money.

477
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,119
So we lived in a loft at the cleaner's.

478
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,489
- A loft.
- I see.

479
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,019
We just did the laundry for our customers back then.

480
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
That was it.

481
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,759
- You weren't enthusiastic about it.
- We were motivated by our son...

482
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
because we were doing nothing while he was studying.

483
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,699
We started studying about cleaning clothes.

484
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,999
- That's impressive.
- It's impressive.

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,899
I saw that they were part...

486
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,439
of a cleaning research group.

487
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,240
That's right. After making some money,

488
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,580
we moved to the fourth floor.

489
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,609
So you started in a small place and slowly expanded it?

490
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,909
- Yes.
- That's right.

491
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,149
Did you buy this building?

492
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,649
- Of course not.
- That would've been great.

493
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,919
- My goodness.
- But...

494
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,419
You've taken over the lower part of the building, but not the top.

495
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,789
We craved to learn new techniques,

496
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,160
but didn't get lucky with money.

497
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,899
- You've achieved a lot.
- You're successful.

498
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,469
I think he invested a lot in the machinery.

499
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,740
- So he takes pride in it.
- You're right.

500
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,369
Don't you also make some kind of chemical product?

501
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,969
- How did he know that?
- Yes, we do.

502
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,439
- I saw it on YouTube.
- You did?

503
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,510
I had an oil stain on my T-shirt that wouldn't come out...

504
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,750
even after I washed it several times.

505
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,249
So I was looking it up on the internet...

506
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,779
- and found your YouTube channel.
- Right.

507
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
- Really?
- Really?

508
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:43,649
- I thought about buying it.
- Would you like one?

509
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,719
- No, it's okay.
- That would be a bribe.

510
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,359
You can just bring your T-shirt.

511
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,459
A bribe.

512
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,590
(A bribe...)

513
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,630
What was your most-watched video about?

514
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,600
How to turn yellowed clothes white again.

515
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,046
- I see.
- It got over three million views.

516
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,799
- I'm curious about that too.
- Right?

517
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,899
What do you have to do?

518
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,970
That is...

519
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,839
about acidic and alkaline substances.

520
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,416
- You're telling us so much today.
- I know.

521
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,960
- I'm telling you too much.
- It's all on your YouTube channel.

522
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,949
It's your video with the most views.

523
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,880
It's on your YouTube channel.

524
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,419
We get sweat...

525
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,159
- on our inner clothes.
- That's right.

526
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,829
- That's why it's yellow?
- That's right.

527
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,090
Sweat is acidic.

528
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,859
But over time, it turns into alkaline.

529
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,669
When it meets air,

530
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,869
- it oxidizes and turns yellow.
- I see.

531
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,039
(When sweat meets air, it turns yellow.)

532
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,869
How do you get rid of it?

533
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,710
- Do you use an acidic substance?
- No.

534
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
"No."

535
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,379
- Then an alkaline substance?
- Yes.

536
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,310
You two are a good match.

537
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,050
When customers come to us,

538
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,079
I tell them...

539
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,679
to do the easy things themselves.

540
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,766
- To do it themselves?
- When it's something they can do.

541
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,919
That's the right thing to do.

542
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,859
- Really? It doesn't sound easy.
- I send them away.

543
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,920
I have them bring things they can't do.

544
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,159
- That's why we post it online.
- So... I...

545
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,389
I...

546
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,229
prepared some drinks. Can I bring it out?

547
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,899
Drinks? What kind of drinks?

548
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,499
- Can I bring it out?
- Yes, you can.

549
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,729
- Bring it out.
- Is that okay?

550
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,130
- I don't want to get in trouble.
- I didn't buy it for you.

551
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,769
I'm not sure what you like.

552
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,909
This is just something I bought for myself.

553
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,709
- Up there.
- Did you make it yourself?

554
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,310
No.

555
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,850
What's this?

556
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,620
- This is something we drink.
- Yes, it is.

557
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
(Jae Suk appears.)

558
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:22,520
- This is something we drink.
- Yes, it is.

559
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,489
- Suyu-ri is without doubt...
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

560
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,620
My hometown.

561
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,560
The people here...

562
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,199
- drink the products I advertise.
- Was this necessary?

563
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,359
Look at this.

564
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,469
- We always drink this.
- It's for Vitamin C.

565
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,929
- You didn't buy this on purpose.
- No, we didn't.

566
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,450
- It just happened to...
- I can tell.

567
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,069
He hesitated before bringing it out.

568
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,969
He thought it might look intentional.

569
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,980
- Can you open this for me?
- Goodness.

570
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,110
I'll open it for you.

571
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,139
- It's okay.
- No, it's okay.

572
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,509
- My hand is slippery.
- Let me.

573
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,609
Please help me open mine.

574
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,110
I'm on the bottle.

575
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,119
This wasn't intentional.

576
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,389
It was natural.

577
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,259
- I really always drink this.
- Of course.

578
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,420
- However...
- Let's drink.

579
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,159
I won't mention it...

580
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,000
since I don't want them to get the wrong idea.

581
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,259
Thank you.

582
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,460
- Thank you.
- This is nice.

583
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,500
You seem to enjoy it more than usual, Jae Suk.

584
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,300
(Gasping)

585
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,070
- That's not true.
- Vitamin C wakes me up.

586
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,909
He's advertising it.

587
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,710
Don't get the wrong idea.

588
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,550
That's why they were hesitant to bring it out.

589
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,779
What were you saying?

590
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,849
I was saying...

591
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,320
- Why are you laughing?
- He's so funny.

592
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
- He's funny, isn't he?
- He was always funny.

593
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,759
- He should be on YouTube.
- You're right.

594
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,590
- It fits him.
- You're right.

595
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,559
You live and work together,

596
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,659
- spending 24 hours a day together.
- Right.

597
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,729
Isn't that challenging?

598
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,029
- Stop it.
- That's a good question.

599
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,670
Why are you asking that right now?

600
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,370
- She's right here.
- I feel uneasy without her.

601
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,209
We each have our strengths.

602
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,740
We often fought when we were younger.

603
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,209
But it's gotten better over time.

604
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,150
Here, we are colleagues.

605
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,350
We're colleagues, but I'm his superior.

606
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,820
- You're in a higher position?
- Yes, and I'm older.

607
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,219
You are? You're older than him?

608
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,819
- How much older are you?
- She's a year older.

609
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,489
That's not much of a difference.

610
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,960
- It's quite big.
- But I...

611
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,800
I lead him.

612
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,630
Right.

613
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,399
(Intimidated)

614
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,469
She glared at him...

615
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,000
when he tried to cut in.

616
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,639
- I can tell she's above him.
- Yes.

617
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,840
It shows.

618
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,079
- Right?
- Now,

619
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,350
we've become very good friends.

620
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,909
How did you send in your story...

621
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,450
- Exactly.
- to the show?

622
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,619
I watch many shows with Jae Suk in them,

623
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,389
including "Running" or whatever it's called.

624
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,089
- "Or whatever it's called."
- Then I happened...

625
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,619
to watch Whenever Possible.

626
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,960
I realized you visit different neighborhoods.

627
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,059
- And Jae Suk has ties to his area.
- That's right.

628
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,036
- So you thought we'd come someday.
- That's right.

629
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,130
I wanted to grab that opportunity.

630
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,669
Suyu-ri is very nice, isn't it?

631
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,039
- It's very nice.
- Of course.

632
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,969
I truly love it here.

633
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,810
There is another reason this area is nice.

634
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,179
It's because of the mountains nearby.

635
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,209
- They give off good energy.
- The air is cleaner.

636
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,809
- This area has good energy.
- That's right.

637
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,280
- It does.
- So people like him are born here.

638
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,719
- And him.
- Gosh.

639
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,879
Although I wasn't born here.

640
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,119
My wife is from this neighborhood too.

641
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,650
- She is?
- Yes, she is.

642
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,659
She spent her childhood teenage years here.

643
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,389
This is my neighborhood.

644
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,629
My parents still live here.

645
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,089
- Really?
- They still live here?

646
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,259
Really? Where?

647
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,159
Near Cheongsu Bathhouse.

648
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,400
- Near Cheongsu Bathhouse?
- That's right.

649
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,369
- I used to frequent that bathhouse.
- That's the one.

650
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,699
- They live right by it.
- Gosh.

651
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,239
I used to drive there with my father.

652
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,410
It's near that bathhouse.

653
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,709
Please tell your mother to bring her dry cleaning to us.

654
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,209
- Tell her to mention you.
- I'll tell her.

655
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,309
- Tell her to mention you.
- It won't be free, right?

656
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,919
- She'll have to pay.
- Of course.

657
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,280
Of course you should have her pay.

658
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,389
It sounded like it would be on the house.

659
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,696
- I'll give her a huge discount.
- We'll give her a discount.

660
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,259
- Make sure she comes here.
- Seriously.

661
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,436
- I'll make sure to tell her.
- I'll give her a huge discount.

662
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,489
- Thank you.
- Goodness.

663
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,459
Since we're here...

664
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,646
- Let's have Hyun Sung roll it.
- You roll the die, Hyun Sung.

665
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,169
- There's 0, 1, 2.
- Yes.

666
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,640
There is only 1 for 2 coupons.

667
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,539
Two.

668
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,010
(He cautiously rolls the die.)

669
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,310
Two.

670
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,120
(They win 2 coupons!)

671
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,520
- You are a lucky charm.
- Amazing.

672
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,390
- That was awesome.
- Good job.

673
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,490
- He's a lucky charm.
- Seriously.

674
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,989
Let's see the present.

675
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,530
- The present is written inside.
- What is it?

676
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,470
"We use this to tempt our married daughter to visit us..."

677
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,939
"when we miss her."

678
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,410
- "Premium Korean beef set."
- All right.

679
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,486
- It's a premium Korean beef set.
- This is our daughter's favorite.

680
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,680
- Korean beef set.
- Gosh.

681
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,779
(The premium Korean beef arrives.)

682
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,779
- Is your daughter getting married?
- She's already married.

683
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,980
- It's only been a few months.
- Just a few months ago.

684
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,519
You call her to come over for this when you miss her?

685
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Korean beef.

686
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:53,560
(Round 1 present, Premium Korean beef set)

687
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,360
Standing up, I can see that your wife...

688
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,959
- is in a higher position.
- Why?

689
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,529
- Your apron...
- It's clean.

690
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,699
He has many stains on his.

691
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,830
We have different jobs.

692
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,940
She cleans, and I restore the clothes.

693
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,200
- That's why?
- So I have dyes on mine.

694
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,640
You're wearing matching T-shirts, right?

695
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,039
We always buy them together.

696
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,556
- Buy 1, get 1 free?
- Yes. Buy 1, get 1 free.

697
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,900
That must be why we got the "two plus" premium grade beef.

698
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,749
That's why you got the "two plus" premium grade beef?

699
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,320
- Yes, that's amazing.
- I see.

700
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,520
(Thread flicking)

701
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,319
(Flick skeins of thread...)

702
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,490
(and get 1 in the sewing kit.)

703
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,489
Flick the skein of thread...

704
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,570
- and get it in the sewing kit?
- In the sewing kit?

705
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,900
What does that mean?

706
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,599
Oh, we're supposed to flick this.

707
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,099
- This?
- We put this here...

708
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,740
- and flick it into the sewing kit.
- This is what we do.

709
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,570
How are we supposed to do that?

710
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,710
- We can practice, right?
- Of course.

711
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,540
- We need a sense of distance.
- That's right.

712
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,810
You have no sense of distance.

713
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,719
- But we need it.
- We're doomed.

714
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,440
- I have to flick it stronger.
- It's okay.

715
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,790
This is harder than the game I played last time.

716
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,359
You have worse aim than I expected.

717
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,460
Flick it harder.

718
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,289
Aren't you prepared for this?

719
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,399
I had to know which game we'd be playing to practice.

720
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,899
I'll have to go with you next time.

721
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,200
(Laughing)

722
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,900
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

723
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,440
You have a very bad sense of distance.

724
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,510
- It isn't about the distance.
- No.

725
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,740
I'm good with my hands.

726
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,380
It didn't seem like that last week.

727
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,979
- Why would you say that?
- You're doing great.

728
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,500
He's bad at things involving his feet.

729
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,220
- Really?
- He's bad with his feet.

730
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,890
But he's a good kid.

731
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,860
- That's true.
- Right.

732
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,130
- He's a good kid.
- He's a good kid.

733
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,800
I feel smaller sitting here.

734
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,230
I have to be bold.

735
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,399
You were too bold.

736
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,570
That was too bold.

737
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,770
Next is Mr. Storyteller.

738
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,110
I realized...

739
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,480
it's important how much you pull this back.

740
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,210
It has to go like this, right?

741
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,450
Drawing an arc.

742
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,819
(It was close!)

743
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,720
You're good at this.

744
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,290
I think it'll be possible if you aim well.

745
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,929
- This is good.
- Let's give it a try.

746
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,159
- Should we try?
- Yes.

747
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,689
- Bring your hands in.
- Come on.

748
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,130
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.

749
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,599
We'll give Round One a try.

750
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,770
This is try number one.

751
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,400
- Let's go.
- Okay.

752
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,399
- I think you can do this.
- You think so?

753
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,116
- I think you'll get it in.
- I have a good feeling.

754
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,510
Which color should I use?

755
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,179
- Use a new one.
- Choose it for me.

756
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,779
- Here.
- All right.

757
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,510
(He carefully accepts the skein of thread.)

758
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,380
(Cautiously)

759
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,820
(Gasping)

760
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,519
You get nervous when the real game begins.

761
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,829
- It's nerve-racking.
- It is.

762
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,030
Mr. Storyteller.

763
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,099
I have to flick it lightly.

764
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,470
It was too close.

765
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,039
- I'll give it a try.
- Flick it lightly.

766
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,480
- Lightly?
- Lighter than you think.

767
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,610
- You shouldn't have said that.
- That was too light.

768
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,720
I'm sorry.

769
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,420
(It's Jae Suk's turn.)

770
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,590
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

771
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,860
It could go in.

772
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,060
- Let's go.
- Here it goes.

773
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,260
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

774
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,970
It went in the right direction.

775
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,599
- Let's go.
- Here it goes.

776
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,130
(Too bad.)

777
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,800
This is possible.

778
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,199
(That was so close.)

779
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,869
I almost did it.

780
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,310
(Jae Suk's near success)

781
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,409
- Let's go.
- He sometimes...

782
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,549
- does it when I least expect it.
- All right.

783
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,410
It sometimes happens to me.

784
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,119
All right.

785
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,619
- You can do this.
- Let's go.

786
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,589
It went to the right earlier.

787
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,450
If I flick it in this direction...

788
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,260
- Come on.
- No.

789
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,589
- Come on.
- No.

790
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,559
When he flicked it,

791
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,430
it went in the direction I thought it would.

792
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,580
It flew over there because you flicked it like this.

793
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,540
- You have to flick it straight up.
- Like this?

794
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,009
It's hard to flick it like this.

795
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,540
It does seem difficult.

796
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,980
- Gosh.
- See?

797
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,109
(It now goes in the right direction.)

798
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,110
That's what you have to do to make it go straight.

799
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,020
- First...
- Okay, that's it.

800
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,620
- We're getting the hang of it.
- Yes.

801
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,090
(It went in!)

802
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,600
(Screaming)

803
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,360
Success.

804
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,740
- No, wait.
- Success.

805
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,769
We did it.

806
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,890
- We were just practicing.
- We were just practicing.

807
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,740
This was a practice game.

808
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,910
- I'm sorry.
- I thought I succeeded too.

809
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,009
Because they got so excited.

810
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,120
- I know.
- I thought I succeeded.

811
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,120
Jae Suk is good during practice.

812
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,496
- I'm good when practicing.
- He is good during practice.

813
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,859
Then you'll be good at the real thing.

814
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,890
- Right.
- Okay.

815
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,259
Why don't we try right away so you can do what you just did?

816
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,580
- I don't think I can.
- Come on.

817
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,199
- It's okay.
- No, I can't.

818
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,169
- I feel too much pressure.
- It's okay, Jae Suk.

819
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,529
- I can't do it right now.
- You got the hang of it.

820
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,970
I don't think I can do it right now.

821
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,369
Someone else go first.

822
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,300
It's too much pressure to go first.

823
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,009
What color did you succeed with?

824
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,269
- This one.
- The yellow one.

825
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,739
This is our second try.

826
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,209
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

827
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,570
(Mr. Storyteller, who obsesses over the color, goes first.)

828
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,909
You flicked it like this.

829
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,520
That's right. Flick it straight up.

830
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,420
(He misses.)

831
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,930
(Groaning)

832
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,859
(Dae Myung)

833
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,890
All right.

834
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,360
- It sometimes works.
- You're right.

835
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,630
Let's do this, Dae Myung.

836
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,100
Flick it confidently.

837
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,169
It was too light.

838
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,839
You never succeeded last time, did you?

839
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,909
Come on.

840
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,970
Would you like to go last?

841
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,709
(Yeon Seok)

842
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,209
- You can do this, Yeon Seok.
- Be confident.

843
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,949
I'm confident. I got the hang of it.

844
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,349
- All right. That's good.
- Okay.

845
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,779
- Flick it in a straight line.
- He might get it in.

846
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,320
Flick it lightly.

847
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,559
(He fails.)

848
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,420
Good job. That was better than before.

849
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,090
- Too bad.
- Right?

850
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,530
- I'll go now.
- Go ahead.

851
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,099
Since you succeeded once.

852
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,199
(Jae Suk)

853
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,170
I can't do it under the pressure.

854
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,699
Show us, Jae Suk.

855
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,981
(Jae Suk is the only one that succeeded during practice.)

856
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,350
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

857
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,320
(It slightly misses.)

858
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,289
He has the highest possibility to succeed.

859
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,320
(Their second attempt ends in failure.)

860
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,689
Each skein of thread feels different.

861
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,289
- Gosh.
- Let's try right away.

862
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,860
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

863
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,200
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

864
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,170
(Jae Suk)

865
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,170
(Jae Suk goes first.)

866
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:46,670
I hope it goes in.

867
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,410
It's going in.

868
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,210
It's going in.

869
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,980
- How did you miss?
- Gosh.

870
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,620
(It was a bit short.)

871
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,790
(The direction was perfect.)

872
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,630
- He almost did it.
- Gosh, that was so close.

873
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
I think we almost got it.

874
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,030
I should've blown on it.

875
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,530
That was so close.

876
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,899
It went in the right direction.

877
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,209
Seriously, this is so hard.

878
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,930
- This skein of thread feels good.
- Today's game is very difficult.

879
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,439
- It's very difficult.
- It keeps going to the right.

880
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,849
This is very hard.

881
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,949
I can do it.

882
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,409
(Yeon Seok aims carefully.)

883
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,650
You can do this.

884
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,549
Be confident.

885
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,950
- Be bold.
- Be confident.

886
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,860
- Flick it.
- Just do it.

887
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,460
- I've done this many times.
- You got this.

888
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,460
- I'll show you.
- That's right.

889
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,929
- Let's go.
- Flick it.

890
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,130
You did it.

891
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,070
- Let's go.
- Flick it.

892
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,470
(It went in!)

893
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
- Flick it.
- You did it.

894
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,840
(Screaming)

895
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

896
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,680
(Jumping up and down)

897
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
(Yeon Seok suddenly did it.)

898
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,249
- You did it.
- You did it.

899
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,750
(Chaos at the cleaner's)

900
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,120
- Good job.
- Yeon Seok.

901
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,919
You're good at this.

902
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,159
- I sometimes get lucky.
- Gosh.

903
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,859
- He's good at it.
- He gets lucky.

904
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,660
- Gosh.
- He's good.

905
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,429
- You're good.
- It was about time.

906
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,529
(Feeling proud)

907
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,259
- We cleared Round One.
- We did it.

908
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,340
- All right.
- This thread.

909
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,230
This orange one.

910
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,839
- With this...
- I like this color.

911
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,239
With this,

912
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,070
you won the premium Korean beef.

913
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,639
You have to choose whether to go or stop.

914
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,009
You can stop now.

915
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,879
The game becomes harder,

916
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,279
but the prize gets bigger.

917
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,379
You've already seen the game.

918
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,819
- It's quite difficult today.
- Right.

919
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,119
All right. Will you continue...

920
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,289
- or stop?
- What should we do?

921
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,649
- Should we continue?
- In 1, 2, 3.

922
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,020
- Let's continue.
- Go.

923
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,260
(Laughing)

924
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,989
- The second one?
- Yes.

925
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,160
Open the second one.

926
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,430
- Open it?
- Yes.

927
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,469
"After spending 35 years with hundreds of different clothing,"

928
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,329
"we need clean air."

929
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,569
We really need this.

930
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,899
- An air purifier.
- "An air purifier."

931
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,070
- We really need this.
- An air purifier.

932
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,209
- It's something they need here.
- Yes.

933
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,880
- You're right.
- Look at that.

934
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,879
- It's been delivered right away.
- It's something we really need.

935
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,949
This is a nice model.

936
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,450
(An air purifier for clean air)

937
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,779
(Round 2)

938
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,880
(A wall of sewing thread is added.)

939
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,390
- A wall?
- A wall of sewing thread?

940
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,959
What thread?

941
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,990
What?

942
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,319
- It's high.
- What's this?

943
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,860
Wait. This is too high.

944
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,860
We have to go over it?

945
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,630
This is too hard.

946
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,060
It's too hard.

947
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,330
Gosh.

948
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:31,700
- This is too hard.
- The arc has to be higher.

949
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,539
This is too hard.

950
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,710
- We have to flick it higher.
- Yes, we do.

951
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,369
You have to get it in the sewing kit?

952
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,669
- Yes.
- What?

953
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,039
It's a sudden drop here.

954
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,156
(The mission for Round 2 makes her laugh in disbelief.)

955
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,880
What if it flies high in the air,

956
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,479
bounces off the table, and goes in?

957
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,779
- Is that okay?
- We'll allow that.

958
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,520
- That's allowed? Okay.
- Yes.

959
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,849
I think it'll go in.

960
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,690
(It hits the goalpost and bounces out.)

961
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,359
- You almost did it.
- I think it'll go in.

962
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,760
I think it could bounce off the table and go in.

963
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,629
Try not to worry about the wall.

964
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,329
We just have to flick it higher.

965
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,459
It could go in.

966
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,570
(Flick it higher.)

967
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,630
- Higher.
- Gosh.

968
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,940
You have to flick it higher.

969
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,740
Wait. Round Two isn't easy.

970
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,340
I'll try one more time.

971
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,879
- Gosh.
- Dae Myung,

972
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,600
you're bad at doing things with your hands.

973
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,979
- That's weird.
- This is your second time here.

974
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,220
- What is going on?
- I was good last time.

975
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,689
Could it be because I'm at my hometown?

976
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,020
Because it's your hometown?

977
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,920
Then you should do better.

978
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,159
(Meanwhile, )

979
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,789
(Mr. Storyteller is hard at practice.)

980
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,630
It flies too far away if I hit it this hard.

981
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,690
Mr. Storyteller isn't doing very well today.

982
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,300
It'll go to the right.

983
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,800
You almost got it. Good luck.

984
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,510
It's getting worse, Hyun Sung.

985
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,039
It's going in.

986
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,879
- It has to be lower than that.
- I think it'll work.

987
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,680
- It'll work if you practice.
- It'll work...

988
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,109
because of his confidence.

989
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,249
Should we try?

990
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,579
Bring your hands in.

991
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,519
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

992
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,250
This is try number five.

993
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,960
- It's about time I got it in.
- It's about time.

994
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,830
It happens all of a sudden.

995
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,089
I can't be humiliated in my hometown.

996
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,230
Do it at once.

997
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,200
It's going in.

998
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,300
(It's going in?)

999
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,170
- It's going in.
- Gosh.

1000
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,610
- It's going in.
- Gosh.

1001
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,480
That was a good angle.

1002
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,079
I think the wind blew it away.

1003
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,450
- You're right.
- Right?

1004
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,820
- Turn the AC off.
- Wait.

1005
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,449
(He acts immediately.)

1006
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,460
- Or turn the flaps up.
- I lowered it.

1007
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,759
- Okay.
- Go, Jae Suk.

1008
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,330
(Now the wind won't be a problem.)

1009
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,930
I'm nervous.

1010
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,350
(The thread gets stopped by the wall.)

1011
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,680
It would've gone in if it weren't for the wall.

1012
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,769
If only the wall were a story shorter.

1013
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,839
Only if this weren't there.

1014
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,209
- You're right.
- That was a really good try.

1015
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,439
Hyun Sung, you're next.

1016
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,479
(Mr. Storyteller, who practiced intensively)

1017
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,549
I think you can do it.

1018
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,280
- It's about time we did it.
- All right.

1019
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,290
(It hits the wall again.)

1020
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
(Hitting the table)

1021
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,890
Petty revenge.

1022
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,890
- I still haven't gone yet.
- All right.

1023
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,659
I have A720.

1024
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,760
- A720?
- Yes.

1025
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,069
This is A720.

1026
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,129
(The thread that led him to success in Round 1)

1027
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,200
It's the thread that went in earlier.

1028
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,039
- No wall can stop me.
- You can do it.

1029
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,110
No wall.

1030
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,779
Just think it'll work.

1031
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,110
- Flick it.
- I am perfection.

1032
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,549
(Laughing)

1033
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,680
Here I go.

1034
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,119
- It was too light.
- The direction was perfect.

1035
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,220
- Gosh.
- Wait.

1036
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,259
Today's game is very difficult.

1037
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,519
How did you come up with a game like this?

1038
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
- I know.
- It's difficult.

1039
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,389
Let's use a free chance.

1040
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,660
- Good idea.
- Yes.

1041
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,930
We'll use the bonus coupon.

1042
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,000
Like this.

1043
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,500
(It was a near success.)

1044
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,009
(They all fail...)

1045
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,410
- That was close.
- That was close.

1046
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,139
Should we use a free chance?

1047
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,979
- Should we?
- Should we use the coupon?

1048
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,250
- Let's practice.
- Okay.

1049
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,820
- I'll give you the A720.
- Okay.

1050
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,090
Be confident.

1051
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,450
It's going in.

1052
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,220
- I'm sorry.
- Don't feel sorry.

1053
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,160
One went to the right, and the other went to the left.

1054
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,490
You're right.

1055
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,700
I was too nervous.

1056
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,600
(No one can get over the wall.)

1057
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,130
We failed.

1058
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,940
What a bummer.

1059
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,940
This is really hard, by the way.

1060
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,710
- It's so tough.
- Was that practice?

1061
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,880
- Let me stretch.
- A little to the left.

1062
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,440
Just a little.

1063
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,649
- We only have five minutes left.
- I'm so nervous.

1064
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,880
- Just five minutes?
- Yes.

1065
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,019
(They're running out of time.)

1066
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,049
We don't have much time.

1067
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,819
- Let's go for it. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1068
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,889
- Here we go!
- Good luck.

1069
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,890
A720.

1070
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,289
- We can do this.
- Let's go.

1071
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,330
A720.

1072
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,660
It's so difficult.

1073
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
- Indeed.
- No mistakes.

1074
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:54,199
- Be a bit bold.
- Good luck.

1075
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,520
(He's going for A720 once again.)

1076
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,000
(A720 soars into the air.)

1077
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,579
(Everyone sighs.)

1078
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,860
I thought you made it this time.

1079
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,880
Good job.

1080
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,290
That was so close.

1081
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,349
My A720.

1082
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,910
- I'll go next.
- Take good care of it.

1083
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I've got this.

1084
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,290
You've lived in Suyu-ri long enough.

1085
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,160
You can do this.

1086
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,330
Go on.

1087
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,930
Go on.

1088
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,800
Gosh.

1089
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,869
- Gosh.
- Jae Suk.

1090
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,599
- But...
- That wasn't even close.

1091
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,770
- How long have you lived here?
- Dae Myung.

1092
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,139
- Dae Myung.
- You're seriously...

1093
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,980
You should move. You're hopeless.

1094
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,550
I'll go with green, today's color.

1095
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,619
It's time you showed us one, Hyun Sung.

1096
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,890
I know. Let's show them.

1097
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,060
It's about time, Hyun Sung.

1098
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,960
That's true. It's about time.

1099
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,800
It's about time.

1100
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,430
(He missed by a hair.)

1101
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,210
- I should have gone from here.
- That was so close.

1102
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,040
- Is it our last shot?
- It is.

1103
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,010
I think he'll make it.

1104
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,380
Wait.

1105
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,610
Why? You don't like the number?

1106
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,750
It's A444.

1107
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,579
Switch it.

1108
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,690
No!

1109
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,749
How did I pick the number 444, of all the numbers?

1110
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,860
(He decided to defy fate.)

1111
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,020
Let's do this.

1112
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,230
You can save it.

1113
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,760
(Failure)

1114
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,860
It went up pretty nicely.

1115
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,929
Let's go for it again. We only have two attempts left.

1116
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,299
- We're running out of time too.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1117
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,900
- Here we go! Let's do it.
- Here we go!

1118
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,510
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

1119
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,439
- We don't even have time.
- We don't.

1120
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,709
We have three minutes left.

1121
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,879
(Dae Myung)

1122
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Here I go.

1123
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,260
Dae Myung, you don't get to eat today.

1124
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,430
- Jae Suk.
- You're going to starve.

1125
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,359
But I didn't come to Suyu-ri...

1126
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,899
- to be so bad at it.
- What are you doing?

1127
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,159
You're supposed to be the son of Suyu-ri.

1128
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,399
You're the son of Suyu-ri. What was that?

1129
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,270
(Quietly getting ready)

1130
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,840
(His performance worsened out of nowhere.)

1131
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,379
(The Hulk loses his mind.)

1132
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,250
The former Hakchon members aren't exactly dexterous.

1133
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,020
- Hakchon...
- The two of you, step aside.

1134
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
(Jae Suk)

1135
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,290
(Blowing)

1136
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,330
Did you think that would work?

1137
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,560
It could if it was going to miss by a hair.

1138
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,400
Was that a big miss?

1139
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,269
- It was very close.
- Block the wind for me.

1140
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,399
- Okay.
- Yes, block it.

1141
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,869
Right there.

1142
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,870
(Using all kinds of measures)

1143
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:51,239
- Just a bit closer.
- This way?

1144
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,209
- Yes. Perfect.
- Here?

1145
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,286
- Make it just once.
- I'll blow it if it comes this way.

1146
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,010
I need you to finish this.

1147
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,109
You have to make it this time.

1148
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,349
- Good luck.
- A720, let's go.

1149
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,889
(A720, let's go.)

1150
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,689
I believe in you.

1151
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,820
(Casting a spell on the threads)

1152
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,430
(To be continued shortly)

1153
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,629
I believe in you.

1154
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,260
(Yeon Seok)

1155
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,879
It's our last try.

1156
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
(Try number nine was a failure.)

1157
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:29,310
It's our one last try. Sir.

1158
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,579
- Do we have two tries?
- No.

1159
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,649
One last chance.

1160
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,219
- All right.
- We don't even have time.

1161
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,919
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1162
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,419
One last chance, guys.

1163
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,849
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

1164
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,926
- We can do it now.
- Should I go first?

1165
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,890
Just go for it nonchalantly.

1166
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,790
It's pink.

1167
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,159
(A pink skein comes to rescue.)

1168
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,260
I think he'll make it.

1169
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,100
I changed it to a pink one.

1170
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,169
Lucky color, pink.

1171
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,740
(The miracle of pink?)

1172
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,110
(Ready to blow on it)

1173
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,690
(Blowing)

1174
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,790
Yes!

1175
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,329
(Stopping)

1176
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,589
I should have blown on it sooner.

1177
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,329
(Jae Suk fails.)

1178
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,430
Was it far?

1179
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,569
It was like a millimeter away.

1180
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,599
(There are three players left.)

1181
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,139
- Should I go next?
- Go ahead.

1182
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,039
- Good luck.
- Be confident, Dae Myung.

1183
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,569
- I...
- Good luck. Please make it.

1184
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,809
It's about time we made it.

1185
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,210
- It is.
- That's true.

1186
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,839
- The son of Suyu-ri.
- Please.

1187
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,279
- Let's do it.
- The son of Suyu-ri.

1188
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Suyu-son.

1189
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:40,349
We have enough content for the show, right?

1190
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,550
- I'll make it now.
- Yes.

1191
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,089
All right.

1192
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,149
(Suyu-son)

1193
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,150
Flick it hard.

1194
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,089
(It was incredibly close.)

1195
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,799
- The direction was...
- All right.

1196
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,999
Hyun Sung.

1197
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,199
(Hyun Sung)

1198
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,229
Please.

1199
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,330
(I can't watch this.)

1200
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
All right, Hyun Sung.

1201
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,970
(It wasn't even close.)

1202
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,309
(The host of "A Story about the Day" gets on the ground.)

1203
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,950
- Seriously.
- Yeon Seok.

1204
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,879
- Yeon Seok.
- Yeon Seok.

1205
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,720
You're our last hope.

1206
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,719
- I had already made it.
- One last chance.

1207
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,849
- I actually made it before.
- I won't even look.

1208
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,859
- Yeon Seok, - I'm not going to look.

1209
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,319
It's been exciting enough.

1210
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,519
- It has.
- Let's do it.

1211
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,159
- You just need to make it now.
- Please.

1212
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,359
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1213
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,529
(The last player of the last try)

1214
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,260
I have A720 with me, so...

1215
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,330
Let's do it.

1216
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,170
It's been entertaining enough.

1217
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,469
I have a good feeling about this one.

1218
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,709
(He met A720 by chance...)

1219
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,679
(and completed Round 1 with it.)

1220
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,949
- Please.
- Let's do it.

1221
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,950
Go!

1222
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:46,779
(A720, you have my trust.)

1223
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,950
(Yeon Seok)

1224
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,700
(Bumping)

1225
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,030
What?

1226
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,010
(A720 is in?)

1227
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,680
(No way!)

1228
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,619
It's in? Hey!

1229
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,330
How did you do that?

1230
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,200
(Yoo One Shot carries the team.)

1231
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,210
(One last shot was all I needed.)

1232
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,780
(Thank you, A720!)

1233
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,779
(The last player finally made it.)

1234
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,919
- Awesome!
- That was amazing.

1235
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,289
Goodness.

1236
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,219
A720!

1237
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,489
(The miracle made by Yeon Seok and A720)

1238
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,320
- All right.
- I can't believe he did it.

1239
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,660
That was fantastic. You've done it today.

1240
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,360
On our last try...

1241
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,900
- So, we've succeeded in Round 2!
- Round 2!

1242
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,700
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm proud of you.

1243
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,539
- I'm very proud of you.
- That was wild!

1244
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,239
- You've done it.
- How did he make that?

1245
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,080
- It's as if it were staged.
- How on earth did he do that?

1246
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,849
What do I do with this guy?

1247
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,330
- You should take it home.
- Amazing.

1248
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,049
- You should take it home.
- I really should.

1249
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,319
- It's your lucky charm.
- It really is.

1250
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,590
Now, we'll give you...

1251
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,419
two-plus Korean beef and an air purifier!

1252
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,529
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1253
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,890
Thank you!

1254
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,999
In all the years I've known Yeon Seok,

1255
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,120
he looked the coolest today.

1256
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,770
- Seriously.
- Yeon Seok...

1257
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,539
makes it once in a while.

1258
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,900
It was great.

1259
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,540
- I feel great.
- I'm so proud of him.

1260
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,140
You know,

1261
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,879
in our hometown...

1262
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,079
- Indeed.
- All right, guys.

1263
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,109
(Today's ace player appears.)

1264
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,110
(He's hospitably received.)

1265
00:45:58,111 --> 00:45:59,311
That was Yoo One Shot for you.

1266
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,819
- And the rain stopped, sir!
- Great work, everyone.

1267
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,220
(Flattering)

1268
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,750
We didn't achieve anything, though.

1269
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,359
We'll play well in the next game.

1270
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,519
- Yes, we will.
- Sure.

1271
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,789
- We're in our hometown, after all.
- We can't leave like this.

1272
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,229
Right. Our next destination.

1273
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,230
(Reaching his hand out)

1274
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,600
(Can I get your business card?)

1275
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,880
I thought you were trying to shake my hand.

1276
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,699
(Yoo One Shot was expecting a congratulatory handshake.)

1277
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,939
- Our next Whenever Guest...
- What's the appointed time?

1278
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,340
It's from 1pm.

1279
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,209
- Then we should eat and...
- We have about an hour and a half.

1280
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,709
We can get something delicious to eat.

1281
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,990
Yeon Seok, you should pay, then.

1282
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,109
- Right.
- Right.

1283
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,409
- You should.
- What?

1284
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,449
- Right?
- Why...

1285
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,220
- It's a happy day, isn't it?
- Of course.

1286
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,949
- It should be on Yeon Seok.
- Great idea.

1287
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,019
- I have...
- Yes.

1288
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,519
- a special game prepared.
- What is it?

1289
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,619
- What?
- I...

1290
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,429
- A game to decide who pays?
- Exactly.

1291
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,190
- Do you have a good one?
- I do.

1292
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,059
Where should we eat?

1293
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,859
Dae Myung.

1294
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,299
You know all the good restaurants.

1295
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,199
Is there a specific type you're looking for? I know several places.

1296
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,069
- What?
- Near 4.19 Tower,

1297
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,209
- He's got everything in his head.
- there's...

1298
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,539
a nice yukgaejang place...

1299
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,539
- where you can eat outside.
- Yukgaejang.

1300
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,410
And near that place,

1301
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,049
there's a great makguksu place.

1302
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,920
- Makguksu!
- I like the sound of that.

1303
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,479
- Should we eat makguksu, then?
- You don't know that place?

1304
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,649
- Let's eat makguksu.
- Sure.

1305
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,019
Let's all follow Dae Myung.

1306
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,689
- Is it far?
- We won't be able to walk there.

1307
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,359
- We should probably take the bus.
- Then,

1308
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,890
let me check the next destination first.

1309
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,100
- Where is it?
- We have to move.

1310
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,630
It's 12 minutes by bus.

1311
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,700
- Let's take the bus.
- And on foot?

1312
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,000
- It's 36 minutes on foot.
- Gosh.

1313
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,269
- Let's take the bus.
- Take the bus.

1314
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,070
- We can wait there.
- It's only ten minutes.

1315
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,839
(Walking to the bus stop)

1316
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,110
My friend used to live at a place like that.

1317
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,820
Only the bus garage stayed the same.

1318
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,819
I think we should take it here.

1319
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,289
- At the last stop.
- The last stop?

1320
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,690
- Yes.
- Here it is.

1321
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,220
- It's 1165.
- Right on time.

1322
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:51,189
It goes toward Hwagyesa Temple.

1323
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,560
- Oh, this is the one.
- Right?

1324
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,500
- Hello, sir.
- Good afternoon.

1325
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,529
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1326
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,700
Sir, we're going to the makguksu place.

1327
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,569
Four adults.

1328
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,339
Okay. You can tag it once.

1329
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,809
- Multiple passengers.
- Thank you.

1330
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,510
I had a feeling that Yeon Seok would make it...

1331
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,510
- on our last attempt.
- Me too.

1332
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,279
Gosh, you punk.

1333
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,850
That was...

1334
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,650
That thrill is...

1335
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,019
It's indescribable, isn't it?

1336
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,390
- That dopamine rush...
- Indeed.

1337
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,060
In my entire life,

1338
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,730
I had only felt...

1339
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,230
- this level of dopamine rush...
- The dopamine rush.

1340
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,330
When I hit the very first grand slam in an amateur baseball game.

1341
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,899
Really?

1342
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,969
That was like 20 years ago,

1343
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,639
- Right.
- and I still vividly remember it.

1344
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,280
You once hit a grand slam?

1345
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,339
- It felt just like that today.
- I know, right?

1346
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,549
- That's what it feels like.
- Right.

1347
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,549
All our bases were filled.

1348
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,649
Two outs at the bottom of the ninth inning.

1349
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,050
- It was our final chance.
- I know.

1350
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,919
Now that we're sitting in the back row,

1351
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,360
I feel like we're on a school trip.

1352
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,759
Did you usually sit in the back?

1353
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,930
I did.

1354
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,359
- You were quite the fighter, yes?
- That's not it.

1355
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,959
I was just busy chatting with my friends.

1356
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,259
- That's Cheongsu Bathhouse.
- Cheongsu Bathhouse.

1357
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,569
- What?
- Cheongsu Bathhouse.

1358
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,846
It's the bathhouse I used to go to.

1359
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,229
- It's still here?
- It is.

1360
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,370
Cheongsu Bathhouse?

1361
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,300
There's a new bakery on the first floor.

1362
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,670
What is this smell?

1363
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,280
It smells delicious.

1364
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,879
It smells like boiled pork.

1365
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,079
- Right?
- Yes.

1366
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,409
- I'm hungry.
- Wait. Was it here?

1367
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,179
There's a kalguksu place nearby.

1368
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,249
- Where?
- Here.

1369
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,749
They sell perilla seed kalguksu and boiled pork.

1370
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,390
The smell must be coming from that place.

1371
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,019
How...

1372
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,060
How did you recognize a restaurant by the smell?

1373
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,289
How do you know so many restaurants?

1374
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,690
I may not be a good flicker, but...

1375
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,099
- Which stop is it?
- We're here.

1376
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,729
- Insu-dong...
- Do we get off?

1377
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,030
- Here?
- Yes.

1378
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,039
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1379
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,370
- Have a good one.
- Goodbye.

1380
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,800
Have a good day.

1381
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,339
It was so quiet because it was an electric bus.

1382
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,580
- Yes.
- I see.

1383
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:49,510
- Buses nowadays...
- Wait. What?

1384
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,209
- What?
- Do you know her?

1385
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,650
- Yes.
- You ran into a friend?

1386
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,420
- How...
- Who is it?

1387
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,419
Who is it?

1388
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,320
- Who was she?
- What?

1389
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,089
- You can't ask us that.
- What was that?

1390
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,430
I definitely know her.

1391
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,160
Maybe it's your first love.

1392
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,399
Yes, I know her.

1393
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
- I know that face.
- It sounds to me...

1394
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,869
like there was something going on between you two in the past.

1395
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,930
Not at all.

1396
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,469
- No?
- Are you staying quiet...

1397
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,739
- because you're on TV?
- No.

1398
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,509
- That's not it?
- He's not telling us.

1399
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,710
You're right.

1400
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,909
How long have you known this makguksu place?

1401
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,649
- When I was a little kid...
- Since you were a kid?

1402
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,649
You know, we didn't have a delivery system at the time.

1403
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,879
- I was in elementary school.
- Right.

1404
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,049
- And my dad gave me a pot...
- Behind you.

1405
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,666
- and told me to get the food.
- Oh, right.

1406
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,589
- It's that good?
- I remember that.

1407
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,290
He was like, "Go and get jumbo makguksu."

1408
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,559
- Back in the day...
- It's been around for years, then.

1409
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,229
- Restaurants didn't deliver food.
- That's true.

1410
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,099
- Things like short rib soup.
- Right.

1411
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,769
- We'd bring a pot, - Yes.

1412
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,999
- And they pack the food.
- and they'd put the food in.

1413
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,920
- In your own pot?
- You have to bring your pot.

1414
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,269
We didn't have any packing containers back then.

1415
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,339
Pots.

1416
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,979
It's comforting to talk to people...

1417
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,610
- who lived in the same era.
- Right.

1418
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,509
We're almost there.

1419
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,249
I think it's where the pine tree is.

1420
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,349
- There?
- Yes.

1421
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,690
- Here.
- This must be it.

1422
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,560
- We have to eat mung bean pancakes.
- We're finally here.

1423
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,019
They opened in the year I was born.

1424
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,219
- Hello.
- Hello.

1425
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,759
- Hello.
- May we...

1426
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,829
- May we eat inside with cameras?
- Sure.

1427
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,190
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Take a seat.

1428
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,399
They have mung bean pancakes.

1429
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,229
- We have to eat that.
- When I was little,

1430
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,390
I loved their mung bean pancakes, spicy chicken salad,

1431
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,610
jumbo makguksu, and cold makguksu.

1432
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,010
(Basically, they're all good.)

1433
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:27,079
- They sound delicious.
- They are.

1434
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,439
- Cold makguksu.
- Same.

1435
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,409
- Is cold makguksu better?
- I like it better.

1436
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,209
- I'll get the same one.
- I'll get spicy makguksu.

1437
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,379
Sure.

1438
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,079
One mung bean pancake and one spicy chicken salad, please.

1439
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,220
One spicy chicken salad.

1440
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,820
Thanks to Yeon Seok,

1441
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,720
we get to eat at ease today.

1442
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,560
I should take another look.

1443
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:45,960
My A720.

1444
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,460
- You kept it?
- You should always carry that.

1445
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,030
- On important days.
- Yes.

1446
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,799
It's my lucky skein.

1447
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,270
(Yeon Seok's pet)

1448
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,069
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1449
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,939
- Is this spicy chicken salad?
- I see.

1450
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,879
- It has always been this way?
- Yes.

1451
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,009
This is what Hyun Sung wanted.

1452
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,780
- Mung bean pancake.
- Mung bean pancake.

1453
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,480
The skin is really good.

1454
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,650
- Really?
- Try the skin.

1455
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,590
- It's a little mustardy.
- I like that.

1456
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,620
(A big bite)

1457
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,560
- It's good.
- It's tasty.

1458
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:19,390
It's a bit gamey and unusual, isn't it?

1459
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,680
That's what I like about it.

1460
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,829
(The taste of Suyu they never knew about)

1461
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,030
This is definitely for adults.

1462
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,100
You must have eaten here so often when you were little.

1463
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,510
It's good, right?

1464
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,639
Mung bean pancakes taste better...

1465
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,680
on a day like this, you know.

1466
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,809
- I'll give it a taste.
- Go ahead.

1467
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,020
The scent of dongchimi is insanely good.

1468
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,620
Their dongchimi is pretty thick.

1469
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,290
- It tastes rich, right?
- Yes.

1470
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,220
(Slurping)

1471
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,520
I got spicy makguksu.

1472
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:51,229
It's so good.

1473
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,289
I'll try it without the sauce.

1474
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:54,360
It's delicious.

1475
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,529
It's a type of taste for old people,

1476
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,490
- which you rarely find these days.
- It's great.

1477
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,840
- It's neat.
- Refreshing, right?

1478
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,740
I got spicy makguksu.

1479
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,039
(Spicy and sour makguksu)

1480
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,240
It's so delicious.

1481
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,180
Also, when you're little,

1482
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,449
you prefer food...

1483
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,790
that's provocatively seasoned.

1484
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,760
As time passes, you come to like bland food.

1485
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,720
This spicy makguksu is incredible.

1486
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,729
Dae Myung, this is delicious.

1487
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,999
- Great.
- You know your restaurants.

1488
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,360
This is the proudest moment.

1489
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,660
That makes sense.

1490
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,470
I had lived in Suyu-ri long enough,

1491
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,369
but I don't know this stuff.

1492
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,770
Thanks to Dae Myung...

1493
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,139
He knows a lot of good restaurants.

1494
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,210
Right?

1495
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,670
This is amazing.

1496
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,750
(Devouring)

1497
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,010
You're quite the loud slurper.

1498
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,919
(Moaning)

1499
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,156
- It's good.
- Is it just like you remember?

1500
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,490
Yes. It's exactly the same.

1501
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,319
It's so tasty.

1502
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,960
(He hasn't tasted this in so long.)

1503
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,330
You prefer food that's provocatively seasoned.

1504
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,230
- It's scrumptious.
- Really?

1505
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,260
Back in the day...

1506
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,870
Gombo Naengmyeong is also good.

1507
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,269
Yes, Gombo Naengmyeong in Ui Market.

1508
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,270
I used to go there on Saturday evenings with my mom.

1509
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,739
Your whole family often went to nice restaurants.

1510
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,779
- No one in my family drinks.
- I knew it.

1511
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,749
So, we can only find joy...

1512
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,249
in eating delicious food.

1513
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,780
Our family wasn't like that.

1514
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,020
We never tried to look for good restaurants.

1515
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,990
When there was a happy occasion, we only ate jjajangmyeon.

1516
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:27,790
That was about it.

1517
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,359
- My family...
- It was so good, though.

1518
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,429
That was fantastic, Dae Myung.

1519
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,559
- I loved it.
- I loved it.

1520
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,589
I'm glad.

1521
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:33,700
Should we play a game?

1522
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:35,999
- To decide who pays?
- Yes.

1523
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,869
I was trying to come up with games for lunch,

1524
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,339
- Okay.
- and I asked ChatGPT.

1525
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,569
- To get suggestions.
- Yes.

1526
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,709
They even tell you what games to play?

1527
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,010
I was asking, and I thought...

1528
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,010
we could just ask ChatGPT to pick.

1529
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,179
- Pick the person who will pay?
- Yes.

1530
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,309
Like, "Who do you want to pay for lunch?"

1531
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,320
Yes, but we're ruled out one by one.

1532
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,089
- Sure.
- We just ask her...

1533
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,189
since we can communicate.

1534
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,249
Good idea.

1535
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,889
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1536
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,020
How can I help you?

1537
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,159
We're four people. Jae Suk, Hyun Sung,

1538
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,799
Dae Myung, and Yeon Seok.

1539
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,470
We just had lunch, and we want to pick who should pay.

1540
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,840
Sure. Let's play a game to decide who pays.

1541
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,069
Then, pick one person...

1542
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,440
to be exempted first.

1543
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,779
Okay. I'll be a fair judge and randomly pick one.

1544
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,349
You know what? Yeon Seok had a mission today,

1545
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,750
and he had a huge success.

1546
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,620
It was an incredible shot.

1547
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,189
No. Why are you...

1548
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,589
And Hyun Sung is the oldest one.

1549
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,090
Hyun Sung has two kids,

1550
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,190
and one of them attends so many academies.

1551
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,230
And Dae Myung...

1552
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,760
brought us to this restaurant.

1553
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,069
I need you to be fair.

1554
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,570
(What's this AI model's decision?)

1555
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,870
Good. I'll randomly pick one.

1556
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,309
Yeon Seok.

1557
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,010
You had a huge success today, so you're exempted.

1558
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,409
(Yeon Seok is exempted?)

1559
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,110
- How...
- You're very smart, aren't you?

1560
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:59,949
- He's exempted?
- But...

1561
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,219
That's funny.

1562
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,949
I was exempted for my huge success.

1563
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,219
No, that's wrong.

1564
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,519
Reconsider this.

1565
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,859
- Yes, think again.
- I mean,

1566
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,659
- the person who succeeded...
- But that was her choice.

1567
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,760
Right.

1568
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,929
Okay, then. I'll try again.

1569
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,989
- Yes.
- Yes.

1570
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,759
- That's not fair!
- She has to go again.

1571
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,270
- She misunderstood us.
- Indeed.

1572
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,569
I randomly pick...

1573
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,040
Dae Myung to be exempted.

1574
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,739
So, Yeon Seok and Dae Myung are exempted.

1575
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,339
- Jae Suk and Hyun Sung...
- What?

1576
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,340
Hang on.

1577
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,709
- We're safe.
- Wait.

1578
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,480
- Not Yeon Seok.
- We're off the hook.

1579
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,009
She's pretty solid.

1580
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,649
- You can't rule out Yeon Seok.
- Why not?

1581
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,120
That's not what I mean.

1582
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,719
That's utter nonsense.

1583
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,550
She's being ridiculous.

1584
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,690
She's totally lost it.

1585
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,259
Okay. I'll start over.

1586
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,000
- There you go.
- There you go.

1587
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,299
(The older guys won't listen.)

1588
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,270
- Of course, you should.
- Naturally.

1589
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,769
- Why?
- It reflects the spirit of the age.

1590
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,670
- That's true.
- Fine.

1591
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,739
Pick one of us to be exempted.

1592
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,679
Okay. This time, Hyun Sung is exempted.

1593
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,679
Now, I can pick among Jae Suk, Yeon Seok,

1594
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,380
- and Dae Myung.
- Great.

1595
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,850
This time, Jae Suk is exempted.

1596
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,949
Now, either Dae Myung or Yeon Seok...

1597
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,279
will have to pay for the food.

1598
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,520
You can't just keep trying until it works in your favor.

1599
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,589
(The next human to defeat AI followed by Lee Se Dol)

1600
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,459
Between the last two,

1601
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,189
- I'll randomly pick one, - Yes.

1602
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,430
And he'll pay for lunch.

1603
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,760
All right. I've made my choice.

1604
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,960
Today, lunch is on Dae Myung.

1605
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,799
So, it's been decided.

1606
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,900
What?

1607
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,270
What's the reason?

1608
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,010
(Laughing)

1609
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,510
That's so enraging.

1610
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,209
Hey!

1611
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,210
(The exempted one finds it funny.)

1612
00:57:35,211 --> 00:57:36,279
- That makes me so angry.
- Accept it.

1613
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,410
It's totally random.

1614
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,849
What's the reason?

1615
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,479
- I rarely yell, though.
- Let's hear her out.

1616
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,820
I just randomly picked one person.

1617
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,420
That makes me even angrier.

1618
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,020
(Pleased)

1619
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,789
It's only fair that he pays.

1620
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,090
Indeed.

1621
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,330
She only gave us precise information.

1622
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,300
If I took a photo of you two, you'd look like brothers.

1623
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,269
They're even wearing the same color.

1624
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,570
- The naughty brothers.
- Yes.

1625
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,499
I'm so glad that you enjoyed the food.

1626
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,769
- Yes.
- It was scrumptious.

1627
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,980
- I'd think about it later.
- This makguksu.

1628
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,580
- Thank you so much for the food.
- Thank you for coming.

1629
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,050
Thanks for the food, Dae Myung.

1630
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,549
- That was a good meal.
- I think...

1631
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:15,919
I thoroughly enjoyed that.

1632
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,590
- It was excellent.
- I'm glad.

1633
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,949
- We have to take the bus, right?
- Yes.

1634
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,090
- It's over there, right?
- Yes, that's the bus stop.

1635
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,289
We've got enough time, right?

1636
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,530
(Checking the time for the bus)

1637
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,200
It's arriving now.

1638
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,730
- It's in the back.
- We can go and get on.

1639
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,029
That's our bus.

1640
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,599
- Run!
- We can get there on time?

1641
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,640
- If we run.
- Bus number 151.

1642
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,646
He doesn't have a problem with it as he's on "Running Man."

1643
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,639
This isn't a running show!

1644
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,310
- Is that the bus stop?
- That's the one.

1645
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,950
At least it's stopped at a red light.

1646
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,810
Hello.

1647
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,280
I told you we could get on.

1648
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,080
Why don't you do your best?

1649
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,790
- Hello.
- It stopped at a red light.

1650
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,719
- Thank you, sir.
- How should we pay?

1651
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,920
That's great.

1652
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,160
Awesome.

1653
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,889
Why don't you ever do your best?

1654
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,160
I did do my best.

1655
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,699
- Excellent.
- I told you we could get on.

1656
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,929
Right. There are two types of people...

1657
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,899
- in this world.
- What are they?

1658
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,639
People who are on "Running Man..."

1659
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,480
- and people who are not.
- People who aren't.

1660
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,040
- He started running instantly.
- As you should.

1661
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,280
We might have been late if we had missed this bus.

1662
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,809
I was the only one running when you all gave up.

1663
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:20,079
You taught me another lesson.

1664
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,380
I'm glad that you learned something.

1665
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,450
Right.

1666
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,790
(He spotted some students.)

1667
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,560
(Waving)

1668
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,429
(Squealing)

1669
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,830
There they are.

1670
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,099
I sometimes feel...

1671
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,170
that the energy of the youth is certainly different.

1672
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,999
Like we saw just now, the students...

1673
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,240
express it with their bodies,

1674
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,840
such as sound or...

1675
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,739
Indeed.

1676
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,509
- The way they express joy.
- Yes, joy.

1677
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:51,449
What my parents told me the most in my childhood was,

1678
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,910
"Will you please stay calm?"

1679
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,019
What my dad did to me the most was...

1680
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,650
(Inhaling sharply)

1681
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,289
- That's saying, "Stay calm."
- Exactly.

1682
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,589
- That's true.
- Right?

1683
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,759
It's the same.

1684
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,790
What did you hear the most in your childhood?

1685
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,090
Me?

1686
01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:08,460
(Pondering)

1687
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,700
I don't remember.

1688
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:10,876
What did my parents say to me?

1689
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,930
Perhaps they found you uncomfortable.

1690
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,370
Maybe.

1691
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,370
(Bursting into laughter)

1692
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,539
Maybe they found it difficult to deal with you.

1693
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,040
I don't remember them telling me not to do things.

1694
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,849
Is the name of the bus stop...

1695
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,179
- "Cheongsu Bathhouse?"
- It is.

1696
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,449
- Cheongsu Bathhouse Entrance.
- Really?

1697
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,179
- Let's get off.
- Let's get off.

1698
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,180
(What's the second spare time near the bathhouse?)

1699
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,620
Yoon Dong Hyeon and Kim Su Jin.

1700
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,960
"We're the son and daughter of the elders in Suyu-dong,"

1701
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,059
"fixing leaky faucets,"

1702
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,529
"changing light bulbs, and caring for both body and heart."

1703
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,930
- Okay.
- I see.

1704
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,529
"With our all-purpose bags and trusty bicycles,"

1705
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:48,539
"we roam the neighborhood whenever we get the chance."

1706
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:51,110
"Why don't you visit us in our spare time?"

1707
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,769
- They sound like good deed doers.
- Yes.

1708
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,280
- They're like MacGyver.
- Yes.

1709
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,910
I think that's the one.

1710
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,079
Where?

1711
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,649
- The oriental medicine clinic.
- Here?

1712
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,519
- An oriental clinic?
- I see.

1713
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,250
(Oriental Medicine Clinic)

1714
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,549
- This is the one.
- Oh, the elders...

1715
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:08,090
But they said they fixed faucets and light bulbs.

1716
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,959
- Wait.
- There they are.

1717
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,990
- Yoon Dong Hyeon and Kim Su Jin?
- Yes.

1718
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,859
- Hello.
- Hello.

1719
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,499
- Good afternoon.
- Goodness.

1720
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,469
- May we come in?
- Yes, come on in.

1721
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,969
Yoon Dong Hyeon and Kim Su Jin?

1722
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,699
- Yes.
- Hi.

1723
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,600
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure.

1724
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,609
Is this an oriental medicine clinic?

1725
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,539
- Yes, it is.
- Goodness.

1726
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,240
It's nice to meet you.

1727
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,440
Hello.

1728
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,809
(In a corner of the neighborhood, )

1729
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,479
I can't believe there's an oriental clinic here.

1730
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,519
(there is a little oriental medicine clinic.)

1731
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,850
Just from its name,

1732
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:41,519
it feels like a local gathering space.

1733
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,659
- It does.
- Wouldn't you agree?

1734
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,229
- Yes, a local hangout spot.
- Shall we take our seats?

1735
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:46,260
Yes.

1736
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,960
So, are the two of you...

1737
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:52,529
- married?
- No, we're not.

1738
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,000
We're senior and junior from school.

1739
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,869
- Oh, you're not married?
- No.

1740
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,039
Oh, I see.

1741
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,169
You must have gotten that question numerous times.

1742
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,040
We even live close by.

1743
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,809
We live upstairs and downstairs.

1744
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,419
- What?
- In the same building.

1745
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,650
But...

1746
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,749
he gestured like this.

1747
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,750
Yes.

1748
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:14,819
I get the feeling you're married or in a relationship, at least.

1749
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,919
But we're not.

1750
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,689
And neither of you is married yet?

1751
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,629
We're married to different people.

1752
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,829
- I see.
- I see.

1753
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,429
- Our children...
- And you live right above?

1754
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,630
- Yes.
- You two must be really close.

1755
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,990
How did you come to live right above and below each other?

1756
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,669
There were many senior citizens who lived alone in Suyu-dong...

1757
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,509
when we were in college,

1758
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,539
so we regularly volunteered here.

1759
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,540
Oh, I see.

1760
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:39,279
We've been volunteering in this area,

1761
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,919
so the neighborhood has become sort of a base for us.

1762
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,390
So, we found a place to live...

1763
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,959
and opened our oriental clinic here.

1764
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,630
I first opened the clinic in 2017,

1765
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,000
- and I was running it by myself.
- Okay.

1766
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,399
- I also make house calls, - I see.

1767
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,969
So I work here in the morning...

1768
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,639
and close it in the afternoon...

1769
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,400
to make house calls in the neighborhood.

1770
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,109
I had to keep my clinic closed in the meantime,

1771
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:07,939
and she offered to be here to keep it open...

1772
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,839
while I made house calls.

1773
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,380
That's how this was arranged.

1774
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,449
He performs medical treatment...

1775
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,819
- in the morning, - Right.

1776
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,319
And I make house calls in the morning.

1777
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,189
In the afternoon, I perform treatment here,

1778
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,659
- Oh, you take turns.
- while he...

1779
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,789
makes house calls.

1780
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:27,499
So, we've been taking shifts.

1781
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,899
That's interesting.

1782
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,499
- House calls...
- Yes.

1783
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,069
Are for people...

1784
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,599
- who have difficulty...
- Yes.

1785
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,609
In walking all the way here, such as the elderly...

1786
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:38,909
- So, we go and visit them.
- Exactly.

1787
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,309
- For those who can't come.
- That's admirable.

1788
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,879
There are a few oriental doctors who make house calls nowadays.

1789
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,409
- There aren't many.
- That's true.

1790
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:46,679
- Regarding your income, - Yes.

1791
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,679
Isn't it better to treat patients in the clinic...

1792
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,179
rather than making house calls?

1793
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,549
- That's true, actually.
- Right.

1794
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,589
But I first opened my clinic...

1795
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,989
because I wanted to make house calls here.

1796
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,029
Why?

1797
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:00,229
I was working at a different clinic,

1798
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,299
and I wanted to work in the clinic...

1799
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,529
and make house calls at the same time.

1800
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,099
So, I asked the director...

1801
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,369
to let me work in the morning...

1802
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,100
and make house calls in the afternoon.

1803
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,740
- When I told him that, - What did he say,

1804
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,630
he said, "I'm afraid you don't belong here."

1805
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,310
- He's pretty stern.
- Yes.

1806
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:19,450
I see.

1807
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:21,249
- I said, "I'll follow my own path."
- You did.

1808
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,379
- Then, you opened this clinic.
- Yes.

1809
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,689
(He even opened a clinic to make house calls.)

1810
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,889
Treating the patients isn't all you do, apparently.

1811
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,419
You even fix their faucets...

1812
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,859
- and change their light bulbs.
- Yes.

1813
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,189
That's what I read.

1814
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,089
Yes, I'm easily distracted,

1815
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,399
so I take a look around the house...

1816
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,260
when I make house calls.

1817
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,629
If their light bulbs are out,

1818
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,629
- I get new ones and change them.
- You do things...

1819
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,999
- for the elderly.
- Yes.

1820
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,246
- You give them a hand.
- Not many can do it on their own.

1821
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,039
You know,

1822
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,709
people around you...

1823
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:50,579
- must be so grateful for you.
- Indeed.

1824
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,549
In about ten years, I might see...

1825
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:55,180
their statues in front of Cheongsu Bathhouse.

1826
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,849
They're like the great names of history at this point.

1827
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,690
(The Great Yoon Dong Hyeon and Kim Su Jin)

1828
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:02,220
- Indeed.
- That's impressive.

1829
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,089
(He spotted something.)

1830
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,529
Su Jin, what's that bag next to you?

1831
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,359
Right. This is...

1832
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,659
the backpack...

1833
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,470
- For house calls?
- that we carry for house calls.

1834
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:13,969
What's in it?

1835
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,840
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes.

1836
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,869
- Like, "What's in my bag?"
- Exactly.

1837
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,110
Many people do that these days.

1838
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,779
I'm curious. A backpack for house calls.

1839
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,879
- I wonder what's in it.
- It doesn't...

1840
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,979
look like a visiting bag, right?

1841
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,980
- It doesn't.
- No.

1842
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,680
You carry a backpack.

1843
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,089
These are for treating patients. Equipment, cotton,

1844
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,449
bandages, blood pressure monitor, thermometer...

1845
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,890
This is the most important one.

1846
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,659
- Is this...
- A card reader.

1847
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,030
I thought it was...

1848
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,900
What?

1849
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,099
I thought that was a heart defibrillator.

1850
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,369
That was...

1851
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,269
So, this is a card reader.

1852
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,870
My treatment always ends by using this.

1853
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,339
Anyway, you were the one who opened the clinic,

1854
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,379
so you named it...

1855
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,486
The Youngest Son's Oriental Medical Clinic.

1856
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,679
Are you actually the youngest?

1857
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,580
- Yes, I am.
- I see.

1858
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,280
You have the typically cute face of the youngest child.

1859
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:04,719
But he's growing on me...

1860
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,549
- Right.
- now that I know he's the youngest.

1861
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:10,489
He's actually the youngest son in his family,

1862
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:12,459
but there are many senior citizens living in this neighborhood,

1863
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,999
so he means to be the youngest son for them.

1864
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,399
That was what he meant when he named it.

1865
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,369
- But you joined him later, so...
- That's true.

1866
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,339
- the name would be...
- When the senior citizens...

1867
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,569
visit in the afternoon...

1868
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,640
If it's their first visit,

1869
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,039
they ask why there's a woman when it's called The Youngest Son's.

1870
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,239
- How come there's a daughter here?
- Right.

1871
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,509
People ask about this a lot. So I suggested changing the name...

1872
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,450
- of the hospital once, but...
- What was it?

1873
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,250
The Youngest Son and the First Daughter's.

1874
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,419
- "The First Daughter's."
- But it...

1875
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,019
It became so long, so we didn't change it.

1876
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,219
But that sounds nice too.

1877
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,419
- People like the first daughter.
- Right.

1878
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,990
And people like the youngest son.

1879
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:46,959
- But we didn't change the name yet.
- The first daughter sounds...

1880
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,636
- It sounds reliable.
- It makes you trust them.

1881
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:51,100
- It sounds trustworthy.
- Right. It makes you feel that way.

1882
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,770
And this place has this vibe.

1883
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,499
It's cozy, and it doesn't feel like a clinic.

1884
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,169
- Right.
- That's how it feels.

1885
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,469
Well, did I offend you?

1886
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:59,839
- No. Not at all.
- Goodness.

1887
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,609
- That's what we were going for.
- Is that so?

1888
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,539
Our patients get acupuncture here while sitting.

1889
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,610
When they get acupuncture, we chat about this and that.

1890
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,149
We're sitting there, but we talk to them.

1891
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,349
You talk to your patients. When we filmed "Hospital Playlist,"

1892
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:12,710
we learned about building rapport.

1893
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:15,090
- You know that. As expected.
- You need to do that.

1894
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,019
- It helps when you treat patients.
- Right.

1895
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,429
- Since they shot a medical drama.
- Yes.

1896
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,459
- They're medical personnel.
- We were in a medical drama.

1897
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,729
- Because of that.
- Right.

1898
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,860
Former medical personnel.

1899
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,569
Hyun Sung. You played various roles,

1900
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,240
but most of the time, you were corrupted.

1901
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,669
Right. I did.

1902
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,269
- A public official.
- A director of a company.

1903
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,609
- When you were in "New Heart..."
- A corrupt public official.

1904
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:34,610
He played many roles like that.

1905
01:07:34,611 --> 01:07:36,039
- Did you watch "New Heart?"
- Yes, I watched it.

1906
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,120
That's when I studied for the college entrance exam.

1907
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,279
I really enjoyed it back then.

1908
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,979
- That was so long ago.
- Right.

1909
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,349
Later, you regretted.

1910
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,380
- I see.
- Right.

1911
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,789
- You remember that?
- Yes.

1912
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,289
(An unexpected fan meet of "New Heart")

1913
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:49,059
What made you decide to call us?

1914
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,619
Like I said earlier,

1915
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,589
Mr. Yoon stays here in the morning,

1916
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,999
and I stay here in the afternoon.

1917
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,760
So we never get to run into each other.

1918
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,999
- We never spend time together.
- Is that so?

1919
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,199
So our lunchtime is our spare time. I thought it'd be fun...

1920
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,139
if we used that time to make good memories.

1921
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,239
That's why I applied to appear on this show.

1922
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,109
By the way, we visited a laundry earlier.

1923
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:14,349
- Yeon Seok seems lucky today.
- Right.

1924
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,779
People who were from this neighborhood failed,

1925
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,090
but I succeeded and gave them the gifts.

1926
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,419
So this time, the guys from...

1927
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,859
- We're the sons of Suyu-ri.
- Let's do this.

1928
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,259
- They should do it now.
- It's our turn now.

1929
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,389
- I have a good feeling here.
- Yes.

1930
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,489
- "The Youngest Son's."
- Right.

1931
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:27,529
We're the sons of Suyu-ri.

1932
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,029
- Right. Show us what you got.
- The sons will do it.

1933
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,499
- Yes.
- For the coupon.

1934
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,000
- It's okay if it's more than 1.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1935
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,969
- One.
- Goodness.

1936
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,079
- What a relief.
- One.

1937
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,609
- That's enough.
- My goodness.

1938
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,279
- It's a good start.
- Yes. We got one.

1939
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,280
One is enough.

1940
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:46,679
All right. Let's find out what Round One is.

1941
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,950
Let's see what it is.

1942
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,079
"I hope this place becomes Suyu-ri's guest room..."

1943
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,050
"where anyone can visit comfortably."

1944
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,489
"A coffee machine."

1945
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:55,089
(Round 1 present, a coffee machine)

1946
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,319
You don't have a coffee machine here.

1947
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,390
- No, we don't.
- Right.

1948
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,089
- People would love this.
- My goodness.

1949
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,159
(The mission for the coffee machine)

1950
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,599
(Bingo in the visiting bag)

1951
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,499
(Bounce the ping pong ball on the floor...)

1952
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,899
(and make a bingo.)

1953
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,969
(Round 1: Use 5 ping pong balls...)

1954
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:11,410
(and make 1 bingo.)

1955
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,209
- It can be a vertical line.
- Or a diagonal line.

1956
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,339
- A diagonal line.
- I see.

1957
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,679
We need to make a line.

1958
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,049
We need to aim it well.

1959
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,509
We need to put it in there.

1960
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:20,609
(Where they will throw the ball and where the ball goes in)

1961
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:21,719
Let's see.

1962
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,390
- We need to lift our feet?
- It's okay if we're off the ground?

1963
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:26,790
- Hold on.
- We need to change seats too?

1964
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,620
- You need to make it bounce.
- Right.

1965
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,459
- You need to make it bounce.
- Right.

1966
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,530
(Jae Suk succeeded right away.)

1967
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,429
But we need to make one line.

1968
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:37,430
You need to make it bounce.

1969
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:39,169
It's best to put one in the center.

1970
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,170
Right.

1971
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,999
(In the center)

1972
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,140
Right.

1973
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,650
Right. It's important that we put one in the center.

1974
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,079
(It didn't go far enough.)

1975
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,109
Not like I expected...

1976
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:51,180
(Dae Myung can't get the hang of it.)

1977
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,450
(Moving close)

1978
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,580
(Man from "A Story about the Day" is almost hanging on his seat.)

1979
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,389
(He put it in the center.)

1980
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,589
- Hold on.
- In the center...

1981
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,360
You need to put one in the end.

1982
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,660
It's hard to aim for the end.

1983
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,660
- Putting one in the end. Hold on.
- Goodness.

1984
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,030
(Another wrong delivery)

1985
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,829
(They're close, but they keep missing it.)

1986
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,170
Gosh, this is difficult.

1987
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,830
The last one is the most difficult one.

1988
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,890
It's hard to put it in the one you want to.

1989
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,510
- Goodness.
- This is...

1990
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,670
Even this way doesn't work.

1991
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,949
(They unexpectedly made a bingo.)

1992
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,319
- We got one now.
- After throwing the balls...

1993
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,719
for almost 30 times,

1994
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,880
you finally got one.

1995
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,990
- Of course.
- Yes.

1996
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,519
I can tell you studied natural sciences.

1997
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,880
(Since she studied natural sciences, she gives statistics.)

1998
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,889
It's easy to put one in the center.

1999
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:40,410
(They continue practicing the aiming.)

2000
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:41,899
- It goes into the side.
- Gosh.

2001
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,400
It's easy to put one in the center.

2002
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,306
I think this would be better than the last one.

2003
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:46,330
It looks like...

2004
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,330
- you got the hang of it now.
- Right.

2005
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:49,669
- Shall we try it then?
- Let's go.

2006
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,670
(They are ready to go now.)

2007
01:10:50,671 --> 01:10:51,709
This isn't easy.

2008
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,609
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2009
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:54,779
(The first daugher and the youngest son cheer for them.)

2010
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,409
The son of Suyu-ri should take two balls.

2011
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,439
All right.

2012
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,509
- Really?
- The son of Suyu-ri takes two.

2013
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:59,549
And the rest will take one each.

2014
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:00,609
- Right. Let's go.
- All right.

2015
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,620
This is our first try. We'll begin.

2016
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:04,819
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2017
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,920
- Aim for the center first.
- The center?

2018
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,120
We have only five balls, so it's harder than you think.

2019
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,530
- You got it.
- Good.

2020
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,939
(Though it's not in the center, but he made it.)

2021
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,539
- You got it.
- Good.

2022
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,270
(Balls remaining: 4)

2023
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,440
Hold on. Then...

2024
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,479
It can go this way or that way.

2025
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,350
- Right. Yes.
- We still have a chance.

2026
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,920
- Should I go?
- Yes.

2027
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,450
- Then...
- The side ones are difficult.

2028
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:41,159
For now, I'll go for the center.

2029
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,420
(I'll go for the center.)

2030
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,930
Oh, my.

2031
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,330
The bound...

2032
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,629
- We have balls left.
- You still have many left.

2033
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,550
- We can do this.
- If you fail, we're done for.

2034
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,529
Goodness.

2035
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,030
(Balls remaining: 2)

2036
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,169
(There are 2 balls left. They must succeed no matter what.)

2037
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,270
Gosh, this won't be easy.

2038
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,549
It went into the same cup.

2039
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,096
(Unfortunately, it went into the same cup.)

2040
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,350
It went into the same cup.

2041
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,349
(They failed their first try.)

2042
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:15,510
- Let's do it again.
- Again.

2043
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,219
This is hard.

2044
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,630
- It's harder than you think.
- Making a bingo isn't easy.

2045
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,260
This time...

2046
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,959
- This time, another son will...
- I'll take 2, and you take 1 each.

2047
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,529
- Good.
- The son of Suyu-ri takes two.

2048
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,669
- The son of Suyu-ri.
- Okay.

2049
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:29,400
(The older son of Suyu-ri takes 2.)

2050
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,969
Here we go.

2051
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,970
(Out of 10 tries, they're on try number 2.)

2052
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,350
(Jae Suk succeeded.)

2053
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,849
Shall we change turns? Leave one for later.

2054
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:41,950
I'll save one for later.

2055
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,050
It'd be great if you put one in the center.

2056
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,989
- If he puts one in the center.
- In the center.

2057
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:49,189
(Balls remaining: 4)

2058
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,689
(It went out after hitting the wall.)

2059
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,560
- It was close.
- That should've gone in.

2060
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,230
In the center.

2061
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,829
- It's not over yet.
- In the center.

2062
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:01,029
(Balls remaining: 3)

2063
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,070
Goodness.

2064
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,300
(It went in!)

2065
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,609
- Good job.
- Now, just put it in the center.

2066
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,379
- Put it in the center.
- In the center.

2067
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,380
(Balls remaining: 2)

2068
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:11,139
- In the center.
- In the center?

2069
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,150
(If he puts it in the center, it's a bingo.)

2070
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,019
- Let's do this.
- I'm a bit far from the bag.

2071
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,180
In the center? I should throw it harder.

2072
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,919
Hold on.

2073
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,790
(Balls remaining: 2)

2074
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,160
(A bingo completed)

2075
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,270
(He succeeded in one go.)

2076
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,130
(Exclaiming)

2077
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,000
We got this.

2078
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,139
- What's up with you today?
- My goodness.

2079
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,570
(Lucky Yoo One Shot)

2080
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,470
- What's up with you?
- He's on a roll today.

2081
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:44,309
- Today, he is...
- All right.

2082
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:46,486
- What's up with you today?
- This must be my lucky charm.

2083
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,720
- A720.
- The color is similar too.

2084
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,779
- It's similar.
- It's his day today.

2085
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:52,519
- Round One. Success!
- Success!

2086
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,019
(They succeeded Round 1 in only 2 tries.)

2087
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,820
- What happened? Goodness.
- It's his day today.

2088
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,260
So you've won the coffee machine.

2089
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:02,600
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2090
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,159
- This is so nice.
- They won the present.

2091
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,599
- We have so many tries left.
- Good job.

2092
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,240
- I recommend going once more.
- Yes. Of course.

2093
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,469
Will you go again? Decide whether you will go or stop.

2094
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,609
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Okay.

2095
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,669
- Go.
- Okay.

2096
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,309
- You have to go.
- Right. You must go.

2097
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,230
- Let's see what the present is.
- This is so...

2098
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,549
"Faster and more."

2099
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:22,249
"We want to meet our patients with better mobility."

2100
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,520
"An electric bicycle."

2101
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,689
- "An electric bicycle?"
- Goodness.

2102
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:26,919
- They'd need it.
- I love it.

2103
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,720
- We need it.
- This is so nice.

2104
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,389
(The bicycle proudly enters.)

2105
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,089
- Did they bring it?
- I really love it.

2106
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,799
- Seriously.
- There are so many allies.

2107
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,159
- This would be so nice.
- It's not easy...

2108
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,529
- to move around by car.
- Right.

2109
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:39,299
- When it's not that far.
- Parking is a problem too.

2110
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,569
- Right. It's hard to park the car.
- Yes.

2111
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,599
- An electric bicycle is perfect.
- Yes. I love it.

2112
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,809
- Gosh, this is so nice.
- It's such a nice present.

2113
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:45,810
(Round 2)

2114
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:47,139
(Make 2 bingos.)

2115
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,710
(There are 7 ping pong balls this time.)

2116
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:52,079
(With 7 ping pong balls...)

2117
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,360
- Make two bingos.
- Two bingos?

2118
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,856
I think you'll be able to do it.

2119
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,620
We can do it. I'm sure we can.

2120
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:00,220
- It's important we put many in it.
- Right.

2121
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,859
But seriously. I feel lucky today.

2122
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,659
- Yeon Seok, you're the ace today.
- Right.

2123
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,859
I guess you go well with Suyu-ri.

2124
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,699
This neighborhood seems to go well with me.

2125
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,700
- Good.
- Marry someone from Suyu-ri.

2126
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,776
- That sounds good.
- That's a good idea.

2127
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,770
- Think about it.
- You're doing great today.

2128
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,439
- All right. Let's do this.
- This is interesting.

2129
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,739
- This is our 3rd try. In 1, 2, 3.
- I think so too.

2130
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,910
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2131
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,709
Should I go first?

2132
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,909
- Yes. You should go first.
- Okay.

2133
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,280
Put one in the center.

2134
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,550
All right.

2135
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,520
That's good.

2136
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,789
(He put one in the first row which is difficult.)

2137
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:35,790
- Good.
- He's amazing.

2138
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,059
- Save this for later.
- Okay.

2139
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,089
- Yes.
- Really?

2140
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:40,259
- Let's take turns then.
- This is perfect.

2141
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:42,600
(Balls remaining: 6)

2142
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:45,929
- Goodness.
- All right.

2143
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,470
(Dae Myung succeeded too.)

2144
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,169
- Wait. We can do this and that.
- Hold on. Then...

2145
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,299
- Like an L.
- This would be nice too.

2146
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,409
- I know.
- Yes.

2147
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,370
- We still have our chance.
- We have our chance.

2148
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,109
It would be best if it goes in the center.

2149
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:57,440
- That would be perfect.
- Right.

2150
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,650
(Balls remaining: 5)

2151
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,620
All of them are good. We have our chance.

2152
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,750
(Hyun Sung put it in the center.)

2153
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:08,589
(They succeed as they say.)

2154
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,059
We got this.

2155
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,829
- Hyun Sung.
- Hold on. All of us did it.

2156
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,289
- How did you do that?
- Then,

2157
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,729
this and this works.

2158
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,029
- Right.
- All the cups are okay.

2159
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,076
- Because we got the center.
- We can put it in the front row.

2160
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,406
- Let's do this.
- This is interesting.

2161
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,710
The middle one in the front row.

2162
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,339
- The middle one in the front row?
- Yes. You can do it, Almighty Yoo.

2163
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,780
- But it's hard to put it in there.
- That's the hardest one.

2164
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,310
(When they practiced earlier, )

2165
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,839
(not like other cups, )

2166
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,749
(this cup had only one ball in it.)

2167
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,850
(Balls remaining: 4)

2168
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,030
(Startled)

2169
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,290
My gosh.

2170
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,500
- Gosh, the son of Suyu-ri.
- We got this.

2171
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,530
- Hold on.
- We got this. Now, we...

2172
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,129
- We got 1 left, right?
- We just need 1 more to go.

2173
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,369
If we put it in here, we succeed.

2174
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,899
- Right. Just one more.
- Let's focus.

2175
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,769
- We can put it up there too.
- Or we can go for this.

2176
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,009
- Right.
- It's either here or here.

2177
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:01,779
- Let's focus on these too.
- That's right.

2178
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,580
- All right. Yeon Seok's turn.
- We got this.

2179
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,149
This is Round Two. Gosh, it's amazing today.

2180
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:07,810
- I...
- Suyu-ri is so...

2181
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,350
The one at the end?

2182
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,649
- That would be better, right?
- The one at the end.

2183
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,650
Go for it.

2184
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:13,090
(Balls remaining: 3)

2185
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,419
- That's...
- Goodness.

2186
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,489
- It went in.
- That's not bad.

2187
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,329
- Now, it can be this way.
- All of them work.

2188
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,970
- You're right.
- We can go for this too.

2189
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:24,869
- Here too.
- We win if we get one here.

2190
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,029
We got this.

2191
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:27,129
- All of them work.
- We got this no matter what.

2192
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:28,770
Are we really going to succeed like this?

2193
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,140
We got this.

2194
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,210
I think we got this.

2195
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:35,810
We got it.

2196
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,420
We got it.

2197
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,390
(They even made 3 bingos.)

2198
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:48,819
(Man from "A Story about the Day" did it.)

2199
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,189
- I told you we got this.
- Let's go.

2200
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,290
- All right.
- My goodness.

2201
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,730
My gosh.

2202
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,060
- So...
- Round Two.

2203
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,999
- It's a success!
- Success!

2204
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,120
(They succeeded in Round 2.)

2205
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,370
- It was so...
- We're on a roll today.

2206
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,839
- We have so many tries left.
- We're on a roll today.

2207
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,600
- You even made three bingos.
- My goodness.

2208
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,509
- All right.
- What do I do?

2209
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:07,740
It's Round Three now.

2210
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:11,010
- But it's going to be difficult.
- I know. But I didn't think...

2211
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,809
- we'd get to the third round.
- I think you don't have to worry.

2212
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:15,549
- Okay. So we have 7 tries.
- We have 1 coupon too.

2213
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:16,856
Do we have eight tries left then?

2214
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,049
- Yes. Seven plus one.
- We have eight tries left.

2215
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,249
The staff members look flustered too.

2216
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,389
- They look... They can't hide it.
- My goodness.

2217
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,060
You thought we'd fail, right?

2218
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,330
Anyway, you need to decide whether you will go or stop.

2219
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:29,400
Think carefully.

2220
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,570
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2221
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,030
- Go.
- Go.

2222
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,800
Yes. It's worth trying.

2223
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,340
This is the last round. It's Round Three.

2224
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,709
"Come and get your blood pressure checked. You're always welcome."

2225
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,339
"We want to give you the accurate result."

2226
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,479
"The blood pressure monitor."

2227
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,960
- Gosh.
- The blood pressure monitor.

2228
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:46,756
- That's so great.
- The blood pressure monitor.

2229
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:49,049
(Round 3 present, the best automatic blood pressure monitor)

2230
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,249
- That's so great.
- The blood pressure monitor.

2231
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,419
It costs about 1,200 dollars.

2232
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,660
(It costs about 1,200 dollars.)

2233
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:53,949
You put your arm inside it?

2234
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,320
It checks your blood pressure too.

2235
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,289
I think it can be connected to your phone too.

2236
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:00,590
- Really? How do you know that?
- I see.

2237
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:02,460
It's InBody. You can always connect it.

2238
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,299
Are you from the company?

2239
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,329
All right. We can do this!

2240
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:06,546
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

2241
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:07,669
(Round 3)

2242
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,870
(The square in the center will be blocked.)

2243
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,580
They're blocking it.

2244
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,739
(It suddenly became more difficult.)

2245
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:20,056
- It'd be more difficult that way.
- They turned it upside down.

2246
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,479
Now we need to make two lines for sure.

2247
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,949
That really...

2248
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,496
- decreases our chances of winning.
- We can't make a diagonal line.

2249
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,619
Two lines?

2250
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:29,059
(Make 2 lines with 7 balls without the square in the center.)

2251
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:30,636
- This must be tough.
- How are we going to do that?

2252
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,689
Getting the balls in the corners...

2253
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:34,859
- is the key.
- I know.

2254
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:36,030
Should we give it a try?

2255
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,760
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

2256
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:39,230
This won't be easy.

2257
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:42,369
This is Round Three.

2258
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,039
It's our 4th try. In 1, 2, 3.

2259
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,109
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2260
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:46,209
(Out of 10 tries, they're on try number 4.)

2261
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:47,340
I really want to do this.

2262
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,149
- Gosh.
- Okay.

2263
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:53,479
(He successfully aimed at the corner.)

2264
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,349
- Good job. It was a hard one.
- That was a hard one.

2265
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,520
(Balls remaining: 6)

2266
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:00,790
(They succeeded in a row.)

2267
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,189
- We got this.
- All right.

2268
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:03,359
- We can do this.
- At the beginning,

2269
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,589
- I have a good feeling.
- we need to get the balls in.

2270
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,689
We must do this.

2271
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:07,570
(Keeping up the momentum, it's Jae Suk's turn.)

2272
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,999
(It went into the same cup.)

2273
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,320
- Gosh.
- Gosh, it went in there.

2274
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,320
- Gosh.
- Gosh, it went in there.

2275
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,990
Since we don't have the cup in the center...

2276
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,170
We need to make it happen without it.

2277
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,710
This is really hard.

2278
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,909
- We don't have the center cup.
- How many balls do we have left?

2279
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,010
- I have one left.
- Right.

2280
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,209
- It can be easier than we think.
- Gosh.

2281
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:26,280
- Way to go.
- Dae Myung.

2282
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,649
Dae Myung is on a roll today.

2283
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,719
- Way to go.
- Dae Myung.

2284
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,790
- I have 1 left.
- I have 1 left too.

2285
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:33,850
- Then...
- We can make it then.

2286
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:35,996
- One, two, three. Right.
- We can have the three balls here.

2287
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:37,919
- That's right. Okay.
- Or this way.

2288
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,989
We still have a chance.

2289
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:40,329
- We can get the three balls in.
- We need to get them all in.

2290
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:41,489
(They're going to win if they get all the remaining 3 balls in.)

2291
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,629
Yeon Seok, you need to get one in.

2292
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,430
We'll decide after you do it.

2293
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:46,310
Right. It's all over if you don't make it.

2294
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,900
It's all over if you don't make it.

2295
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,640
We're not giving you pressure.

2296
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:52,410
He needs to feel some pressure.

2297
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,009
Here I go. I have a good feeling with the color orange today.

2298
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:59,110
(I have a good feeling with the color orange today.)

2299
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,150
My gosh.

2300
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,619
(Yoo One Shot scored again.)

2301
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,659
My gosh.

2302
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,559
- This is really...
- That was amazing.

2303
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,560
(The ace is on a roll.)

2304
01:21:11,561 --> 01:21:12,589
This is your day.

2305
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,729
- Over there. On the left end.
- Right?

2306
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,199
- Right there.
- In the middle of the left line.

2307
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,660
- You can do this.
- I got this.

2308
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,500
You can do this.

2309
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,750
We're done if we can't make it, right?

2310
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:23,840
I got this.

2311
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,470
We did it.

2312
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:26,970
We did it.

2313
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,280
(It went into the same cup.)

2314
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,419
(They already failed regardless of Jae Suk's 1 remaining ball.)

2315
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,949
- It hit the cup.
- It was the right direction.

2316
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:37,950
It was so close.

2317
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:40,690
- It's Round Three indeed.
- It's hard to make it happen.

2318
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,490
- Since the center is blocked...
- That's huge.

2319
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,860
- It's significant.
- Right.

2320
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,759
The front row is...

2321
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,836
(It's always hard to aim at the front row.)

2322
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,229
The front row is the hardest.

2323
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,430
Because of the divider...

2324
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,500
It's always blocked.

2325
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,200
(Leaning forward)

2326
01:21:58,810 --> 01:21:59,940
(Glancing)

2327
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:02,280
Hyun Sung, you're leaning forward too much.

2328
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:06,810
(Hyun Sung is too passionate.)

2329
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,880
It's for the electric bicycle.

2330
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:11,819
This is your sixth try.

2331
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,819
Okay. Let's succeed in Round three this time.

2332
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,019
We really want to give them...

2333
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:17,419
- We have such a great present.
- the electric bicycle.

2334
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,359
- Let's say, "Here we go!"
- Shall we?

2335
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,899
Let's say, "Here we go," and keep it up.

2336
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,759
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

2337
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,760
- You can do it!
- We can do it.

2338
01:22:24,761 --> 01:22:26,200
Let's keep up the steam.

2339
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,329
- Let's do it right away.
- Let's do this.

2340
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:30,269
- I got a good feeling. We got this.
- You still have many chances.

2341
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,299
Right.

2342
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,086
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

2343
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,469
- Okay.
- Should I go first?

2344
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:35,509
We have to score in the beginning.

2345
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,590
- You should do it for a good start.
- I'll go then.

2346
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:38,950
You must get it in.

2347
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,279
I'll get one in.

2348
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,480
This is the right point.

2349
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:47,790
- Good job.
- You did great.

2350
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,490
There you go.

2351
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,660
(Sighing)

2352
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,030
(I'm sorry.)

2353
01:22:58,330 --> 01:22:59,470
We still have a chance.

2354
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:03,669
There you go.

2355
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:04,800
The one in the front.

2356
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,269
(It's Dae Myung's turn again.)

2357
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,370
This is tough.

2358
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,239
The one in the front.

2359
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,240
(They're aiming at the three cups.)

2360
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:11,340
This is tough.

2361
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,926
- We got this.
- We can do it.

2362
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,870
- We're back again. We got this.
- We can do it.

2363
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,749
- One...
- The one over there.

2364
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,060
- You've been practicing it.
- Right. Over there.

2365
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:24,859
I can do this, no matter what.

2366
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:25,860
(The next players feel nervous.)

2367
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:28,830
(Balls remaining: 3)

2368
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,170
(This is crazy.)

2369
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:40,370
- You're so...
- What was that?

2370
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,009
This is your day.

2371
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,079
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

2372
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,110
Is this really possible?

2373
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,950
- Great work.
- Seriously.

2374
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,779
- It has never happened before.
- Number three.

2375
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,379
- Aim for the cup number three.
- Yeon Seok.

2376
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,919
Now we only have the sons of Suyu-ri.

2377
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,889
- We have the sons of Suyu-ri.
- I'll go first.

2378
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,619
- The sons of Suyu-ri.
- You'll be the last son of Suyu-ri.

2379
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,890
Okay. Two sons of Suyu-ri.

2380
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,359
- Cross.
- Cross.

2381
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,630
(Suyu-ri cross)

2382
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,780
- Let's go.
- You should do it when I fail.

2383
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,099
- We should do it. We got this.
- I think we can do it.

2384
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,629
I should do this. I must not lose this chance.

2385
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:08,500
(There's only one more to go to succeed.)

2386
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,770
Please.

2387
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,239
- I think we can do it.
- I should do this.

2388
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,570
(Balls remaining: 2)

2389
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:16,539
(There's only one target.)

2390
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,679
- I think we can do it.
- I should do this.

2391
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,779
(There's only one target.)

2392
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,879
(Balls remaining: 2)

2393
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,179
- Please.
- Just this once.

2394
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,280
Please. Just once.

2395
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:28,689
(Balls remaining: 2)

2396
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:29,819
We got this.

2397
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,620
(Balls remaining: 2)

2398
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,390
We got this.

2399
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:35,399
(Sighing)

2400
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,059
(It went into the same cup.)

2401
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,160
We got this.

2402
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,400
We can do it.

2403
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,060
The son of Suyu-ri. You can do it.

2404
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,569
You're the son of Suyu-ri.

2405
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:46,050
- You got this.
- The son of Suyu-ri.

2406
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:48,169
(The last ball)

2407
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,909
(There's only one target.)

2408
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:54,610
(Balls remaining: 1)

2409
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:00,749
(It's a success when the ball goes in here.)

2410
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,790
We did it.

2411
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:04,560
We did it.

2412
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,730
We did it.

2413
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,300
We did it.

2414
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,630
(It got in!)

2415
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:15,500
(The younger son made it!)

2416
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,670
(Everyone gets up.)

2417
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,170
(Touched)

2418
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:22,779
The son of Suyu-ri!

2419
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,910
I did it!

2420
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:25,310
- Gosh!
- Yes!

2421
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,249
- Gosh, you did it!
- The son of Suyu-ri!

2422
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,919
- The son of Suyu-ri!
- Great job, brother!

2423
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,780
(The two sons finally smile brightly.)

2424
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:34,520
We did it.

2425
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,120
We did it.

2426
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,429
I can't believe this!

2427
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:43,459
(Kim Dae Myung of Suyu-ri becomes successful.)

2428
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,500
The son of Suyu-ri finally made it happen.

2429
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:48,500
He really made a drama scene.

2430
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,899
We have cleared...

2431
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,469
- Round 3!
- Round 3!

2432
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,070
(They have cleared Round 3 as well!)

2433
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:57,109
Gosh, the son of Suyu-ri.

2434
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,179
He struggled so much...

2435
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,379
- Hey, Dae Myung.
- in the morning.

2436
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,350
- He really struggled.
- Gosh.

2437
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:03,950
- I cried in the restroom earlier.
- Seriously, though.

2438
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,019
The son of Suyu-ri struggled a lot today.

2439
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,420
What are all the presents then?

2440
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:10,150
- They get the coffee machine.
- Right.

2441
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,689
- The electric bike.
- The electric bike.

2442
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,689
- The blood pressure monitor.
- The blood pressure monitor.

2443
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:14,960
Is there no Round Four?

2444
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:16,760
(An endless greed for presents)

2445
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,670
We can clear Round Four at this rate.

2446
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,599
What were they called again?

2447
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,969
- I'm getting a burst of...
- Right?

2448
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:23,440
Dopamine and adrenaline.

2449
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,739
As Hyun Sung mentioned earlier,

2450
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,239
- the bases were loaded.
- Right.

2451
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,609
- It was even harder to pull off.
- This was what you mentioned.

2452
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:32,610
- Right.
- The walk-off homerun from behind.

2453
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,009
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations once again.

2454
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:36,720
- Thank you.
- Congratulations!

2455
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,390
(What do I do?)

2456
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,220
(I don't think I can look. What do I do?)

2457
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,820
(I love your reaction.)

2458
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:45,430
(Choi Ji Woo, Queen of Worries)

2459
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,960
(What do I do?)

2460
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:48,530
(Choking)

2461
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:50,036
(The Queen of Worries is feeling very nervous.)

2462
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,070
(If Ji Woo's child sees her like this...)

2463
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:53,670
(That can't happen.)

2464
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,069
I'll do it, Yeon Seok!

2465
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,440
(I'll do it!)

2466
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,200
(I'll show you that I can make it.)

2467
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,439
I got it. Won Bin.

2468
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,086
(She confidently says the correct answers.)

2469
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:02,340
(Yes!)

2470
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:03,540
Jung Woo Sung!

2471
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,409
(She says the wrong answer with confidence too!)

2472
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:06,680
(No!)

2473
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,049
- You were late.
- No!

2474
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:10,049
(Even with a lot of worries, )

2475
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:12,790
(what's wrong is wrong...)

2476
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:16,360
(and taking care of others comes first.)

2477
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,860
(I feel relieved to have Ji Woo with us today.)

2478
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:20,559
(The Queen of Worries...)

2479
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,530
(takes a step into the variety show world.)

2480
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,230
You got this, Ji Woo.

2481
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,469
You got this, Ji Woo.

2482
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:29,470
(Whenever Possible)
