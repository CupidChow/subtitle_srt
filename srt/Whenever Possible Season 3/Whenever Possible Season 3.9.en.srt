1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,750
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,520
You ordered the matcha drink.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,880
I did.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,650
- Gosh, this is...
- What is this?

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,510
This is a nice change of pace for a change.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,719
- What's this?
- This looks great too.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,159
This one has corn on top.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,860
What? I want to try the one without the sugar.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,090
- What?
- This is moist.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Oh, my.

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,230
This is tasty.

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,440
- This is tasty.
- What's this? Is it vanilla?

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,409
You shouldn't have ordered the matcha latte.

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,870
- Why?
- This goes well with coffee.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,140
Why are you judging my drink?

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,609
- Jae Suk.
- You should have this with coffee.

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,179
Jae Suk. This is nice because it's got a bitter taste.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,519
No, this pairs well with coffee.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,750
I bet you're regretting it.

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,149
I didn't regret anything. Why...

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,589
- Why are you judging me?
- I bet you're regretting it now.

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,750
This goes well with coffee.

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,689
- Try it with this.
- You got a mild latte, right?

24
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,260
Try it with my coffee.

25
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,390
(A bite of the donut)

26
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:57,400
After that...

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Try it.

28
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,600
(A sip of the coffee)

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,969
Coffee is better, right?

30
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,869
(Nodding)

31
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,240
Listen to me.

32
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,239
Listen to me.

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,410
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

34
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,140
The combination of the coffee and donut is a familiar taste.

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Gosh, this is good.

36
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:16,879
I don't know who's joining us for today's episode.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,449
- Same here. I don't know either.
- They said I'd be happy.

38
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,196
(The Whenever Friend is someone he'd be happy to see again?)

39
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,096
- You must like this person.
- If that's the case,

40
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,720
this person must work in our scene.

41
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,759
- I see. Then...
- So...

42
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,029
was this person born in the 1970s?

43
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,160
Not necessarily.

44
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,059
- Hey, I said in our "scene."
- Yes?

45
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,499
- I see. "Scene." Okay.
- Come on.

46
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,370
- I didn't say "year."
- Okay.

47
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,669
Not a lot of entertainers...

48
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,339
- were born in my birth year.
- We had entertainers before.

49
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,869
- They were on our show before?
- Right. There aren't many of them.

50
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,446
(While they wait for the Whenever Friend...)

51
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,970
Hello.

52
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,639
- Hello.
- Hello. Should I take this?

53
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,679
- Yes, you can take it.
- Okay.

54
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,850
(Chuckling)

55
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,409
Once you start eating this,

56
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,750
- you can't stop.
- Right.

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,450
(Turning)

58
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,250
What? I think they're greeting someone.

59
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,259
I can hear the footsteps.

60
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,290
(I'm on my way up.)

61
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,929
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

62
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,430
(Hyper-focused)

63
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,399
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

64
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,930
(Coming in by showing her back)

65
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,700
Wait!

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,339
- She's not from your scene.
- What?

67
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,039
- She works in my scene.
- That's right.

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,269
(She's an actress, not an entertainer?)

69
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,040
- That's right.
- She works in my scene.

70
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,679
My gosh, Ji Woo.

71
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
(Surprised)

72
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,149
Ji Woo!

73
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,720
(Today's Whenever Friend, Choi Ji Woo)

74
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,390
(Ji Woo)

75
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,959
(She shows up with a big smile.)

76
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,220
How long has it been?

77
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,790
- Hey, Yeon Seok!
- My gosh.

78
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,000
I thought we were going to meet...

79
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,859
- Hello, Jae Suk.
- Hey.

80
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,869
- She works in my scene.
- Right.

81
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,129
- She doesn't work in my scene.
- Right.

82
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,469
It's Ji Woo. Come and sit down.

83
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,939
What are you talking about? What is it?

84
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,040
- Well...
- So...

85
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,239
- He thought it'd be an entertainer.
- Hello.

86
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,739
- Someone...
- They said you'd be an entertainer.

87
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,709
- Someone he'd be happy to meet.
- Right.

88
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,149
- That was their hint.
- I see.

89
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,709
I had no idea you'd be on our show.

90
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,119
So you're not happy to see me?

91
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm happy.

92
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,550
- You're not happy... I see.
- I'm happy to see you.

93
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,019
- It's been a while.
- Gosh, Ji Woo.

94
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,859
It's so nice to see you after all these years.

95
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,429
Yeon Seok and I worked...

96
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,029
- on a show too.
- Right.

97
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,159
We filmed a variety show on Jeju Island.

98
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,769
- We filmed for a long time.
- Yes.

99
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,069
- It was "Coffee Friends."
- Yes.

100
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,500
When was the last time I filmed with Ji Woo?

101
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,699
When was it for you?

102
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,270
That's the thing with Jae Suk.

103
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,210
We cross paths just when it's been too long.

104
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,779
We film together just when it starts to feel like it's been ages.

105
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,979
- Seriously.
- That's nice.

106
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,309
I'll never forget this incident with Ji Woo.

107
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,079
I was playing minor roles on comedy shows back then.

108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,449
That's when Ji Woo...

109
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,220
- starred on the show as a guest.
- What?

110
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,449
- She was a guest?
- On which show?

111
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,359
You were on the comedy show with a live audience.

112
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,389
- Really?
- I was.

113
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,790
Yes. You don't remember it, right?

114
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,600
What? Did you see me there?

115
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
- Listen.
- If he didn't...

116
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,399
- My gosh.
- What's going on?

117
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,469
(Shaking)

118
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,470
This is understandable.

119
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,770
- Ji Woo. You were on the show.
- I was?

120
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,499
She was a rookie back then too.

121
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,569
When she was a rookie? Just when her career took off?

122
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,279
- No, it was before that.
- Before her career took off?

123
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,740
- I was hired as a group.
- Right.

124
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,750
- You were hired as a group?
- Yes, I was. With the MBC group.

125
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,580
- Really?
- That's amazing.

126
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,410
Not a lot of people from that era are still active in our field.

127
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,619
- Right.
- Back then,

128
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,190
there was a group of hired talents.

129
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,589
TV stations used to hire actors and actresses in groups.

130
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,759
- Right. The official groups.
- I was also in a comedian group.

131
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
- Right.
- Yes.

132
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,060
Won Bin was hired as a talent for the group.

133
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,260
No, he wasn't.

134
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,629
Wasn't he in the group, Super Talent, or something?

135
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,029
- No.
- No?

136
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,040
No.

137
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,440
Your information is quite shallow.

138
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,630
(Fact-checking with a smile)

139
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,709
- Just a bit.
- How should I put it?

140
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,780
She's not cold or anything.

141
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,649
- She's strict about these facts.
- Yes.

142
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,349
But she needs to correct these facts.

143
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,419
- Well, she's raising a child now.
- Yes.

144
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,519
- "No."
- You know?

145
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,189
- She's clear about that.
- "That's not right."

146
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,559
- You know what? I just... Yes.
- I see.

147
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,789
When she gets up, I say, "Sit down."

148
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,030
Gosh, the tone of your voice.

149
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,330
- You sound firm. Right?
- Yes.

150
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,330
Even when she cries...

151
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,799
- "No."
- "No is a no."

152
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,929
Right.

153
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,729
- I clearly felt that just now.
- Yes.

154
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,430
- If it's wrong, it's wrong.
- Yes.

155
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,700
You're scary.

156
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,510
I only use that tone to say "sit" to my dog.

157
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,379
- To Rita?
- Yes. To Rita.

158
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,450
I always say, "Sit."

159
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,079
I needed to get Rita washed and groomed today.

160
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,650
- So I brought Rita with me.
- Yes.

161
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,450
The moment Rita got out of the car, none of the staff...

162
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,260
called for me.

163
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,920
"Rita!"

164
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,290
At that moment, no one said hello to me.

165
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,929
That always happens. Everyone's like, "Rita."

166
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,260
Next time, just send Rita.

167
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,600
But Rita can't talk.

168
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,639
- Really?
- I want to do that.

169
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,239
- She can't?
- She can't talk.

170
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I think she can learn.

171
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:34,970
I know that Rita goes to school.

172
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,440
So listen. You'll join us for today's episode.

173
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,839
Let's check where we're going today.

174
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,156
- Let me check.
- We should check that.

175
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,720
Here's our first gap. Lee Chung Gyu. Sin I Na.

176
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,249
"We were Kim Go Eun yesterday."

177
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,719
- "Today, we're Song Kang Ho."
- What?

178
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,880
"We'll be Hyun Bin tomorrow."

179
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,620
"We're a pair of sound makers with different lives every day."

180
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
"Sound makers?"

181
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,629
Are they voice actresses?

182
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,990
- Do they work in dubbing?
- Wait.

183
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,729
"We go back and forth..."

184
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,399
"between our regular vintage shop and our favorite junkyard..."

185
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,769
"and tap on everything that comes our way."

186
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,070
"We invite you to our general store where all genres are born."

187
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,840
They must record sound effects.

188
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,539
- Could it be the recording studio?
- I see.

189
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,849
- Where they record sounds?
- That's it.

190
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,519
- I think that must be it.
- They named actors and actresses.

191
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,019
They must record these sounds while watching their clips.

192
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,349
- While they act.
- Yes.

193
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,920
- When they tap on something.
- Yes.

194
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Where is it located?

195
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,189
It will take 12 minutes on foot.

196
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,959
- Why don't we slowly walk over?
- Shall we?

197
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,300
(They head out to spend their first spare time.)

198
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,399
- Gosh.
- I had no idea you'd be here.

199
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,906
- You didn't know? Really?
- We didn't.

200
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,100
We didn't see it coming.

201
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,040
- It's been so long.
- Yes.

202
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,110
My gosh. Look at this place.

203
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,409
It's not that hot because we're walking under the trees.

204
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,809
- This place is great for walks.
- Right.

205
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,849
- Right.
- Yes.

206
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,079
(The verdant trail offers them a nice shade.)

207
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,760
It's gotten quite hot at night these days.

208
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,590
It's really hot now.

209
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,519
- But...
- I turn on the fan.

210
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,260
Yes. I turn on the ceiling fan.

211
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
- What?
- I turn on the ceiling fan.

212
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,159
- What's that?
- I see. The one on the ceiling.

213
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,630
- It's on the ceiling.
- I see.

214
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,560
I love ceiling fans.

215
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,760
That scares me a bit.

216
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,269
- Why? In case it fall off?
- It might fall off.

217
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,429
- I see. When you're under it?
- Yes.

218
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,099
- Stuff like that scares me.
- I feel the same way.

219
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,339
- Really?
- Really?

220
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,569
I don't know what you'll think of me when I say this.

221
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,940
When you watch horror movies,

222
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,209
a lot of ghosts come out from the ceiling fans.

223
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,140
Why would you say that? When I go to sleep...

224
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,579
- Why...
- Am I wrong?

225
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,719
Am I wrong?

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,419
But how would ghosts come out from the ceiling fan?

227
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,449
They do.

228
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,419
You first see their hair coming down from the fan.

229
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,559
- Why would you say that?
- And then...

230
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,319
- their hair would get tangled up.
- Right.

231
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,989
- I need that when I go to sleep.
- Right.

232
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,860
- It'd drip with blood too.
- Why would it drip with blood?

233
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,560
- You'll have trouble sleeping.
- No.

234
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,299
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
- I bet he can't sleep in his room.

235
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,440
- I didn't hear that.
- He'll sleep on the sofa.

236
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,509
Come on. I fall asleep on the sofa a lot these days.

237
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,170
You can sleep with your dog.

238
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,709
- Back in the day, to see parks...
- I think it's this way.

239
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,549
Within the city like this you'd have to go...

240
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,880
- to Japan, Europe, or the US.
- Hold on.

241
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,250
Is this the place?

242
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,659
(The address says this is the place.)

243
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Where is it?

244
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,929
It's the basement of this building.

245
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,459
Over there. There's a path leading down.

246
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
- There's a staircase...
- Is this the place?

247
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
To the basement.

248
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,859
(There's only a staircase without a sign.)

249
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,380
There's no sign. There's nothing here.

250
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,699
Or is it in the basement...

251
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,946
- of that building?
- I see something here.

252
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,770
- What do you see?
- Is this the right place?

253
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,750
- Is this it?
- I think this is the place.

254
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,410
There's a small garden here.

255
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,809
There really isn't a sign here.

256
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,316
(A basement space with a small garden?)

257
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,950
This isn't a garden. Is it just wild grass?

258
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,420
- It looks like...
- Hello.

259
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,419
I can feel the artistic vibe.

260
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,749
Are you Lee Chung Gyu?

261
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,049
- That's right.
- Are you Sin I Na?

262
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,590
This is such an artistic vibe.

263
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,459
- Hello.
- Hello.

264
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,980
- Hello.
- We came to the right place.

265
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,199
- Ji Woo is joining us today.
- Yes.

266
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
(The first Whenever Guests, Lee Chung Gyu and Sin I Na)

267
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,360
- Hello.
- Yes.

268
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,830
I knew it.

269
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,070
- That's "Exhuma."
- Yes.

270
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,970
Is this the most recent film you guys worked on?

271
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,940
We won an award with this movie.

272
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,439
- We display it to commemorate it.
- Yes.

273
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
- For winning the award.
- Yes.

274
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,080
The production team sent it to us to thank us.

275
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,519
We almost passed past this place when we walked here.

276
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,640
We almost missed this place.

277
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,519
Right. It's tucked away on this street.

278
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,919
- Right.
- It's like a secret spot.

279
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,019
- That's right.
- You guys didn't hang...

280
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,319
- any signs on purpose, right?
- Yes.

281
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,929
- We have to stay mysterious.
- Right.

282
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,359
(Staying mysterious is their concept.)

283
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,659
- What's your concept?
- Staying mysterious.

284
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,729
- While staying mysterious?
- Yes.

285
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,669
But considering your concept which is staying mysterious,

286
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,199
- your outfit isn't mysterious.
- Right.

287
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,039
- It's my first time being on TV.
- Will you reveal yourself today?

288
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,276
- Yes, I'll reveal myself today.
- You'll reveal yourself today.

289
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,670
Anyway, could you introduce yourselves first?

290
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,179
Okay. I'm Lee Chung Gyu. I'm a foley artist.

291
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,109
- Chung Gyu. Nice to meet you. And?
- Hello.

292
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,419
My name is Sin I Na. I'm a foley recordist.

293
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,879
- I Na. I see.
- Nice to meet you.

294
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,919
- Foley artist?
- Artist.

295
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,020
I get it. Foley.

296
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,389
It's like... Right?

297
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,429
Yes. We receive the edited clips of the movies and dramas.

298
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,589
Then we add sounds to the clips.

299
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,929
(Professionals who add sound effects for the scenes in movies and dramas)

300
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,129
Let me give you an example.

301
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,070
Let's say a pigeon is flying away.

302
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
The flapping sound. Something like that.

303
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,129
(Surprised)

304
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,570
- I apologize for my posture.
- Jae Suk.

305
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,940
- It just came out.
- Gosh.

306
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,409
The only thing I could do now was...

307
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,410
(Flapping)

308
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:04,440
This was it.

309
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,909
This wouldn't work well, right?

310
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,709
We create sounds you hear from day-to-day lives...

311
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,019
to interesting sounds. We create everything ourselves.

312
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,079
- Right.
- Yes.

313
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,619
Let's say we finish filming movies.

314
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,859
- There are some hidden sounds.
- Right.

315
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,329
When there are detailed recordings of such sounds,

316
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,989
the whole scene sounds much better.

317
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,859
These sounds give a lively vibe to the movies overall.

318
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,969
- Right.
- We need professionals like them.

319
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,740
What are some recent projects you participated in?

320
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,609
Recently, we worked on "Dark Nuns."

321
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,069
- "Dark Nuns."
- Yes.

322
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,239
- You worked on that movie.
- Yes.

323
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,279
We saw the poster earlier.

324
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
- You also worked on "Exhuma."
- "Exhuma."

325
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:40,949
- Yes.
- It also won an award.

326
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,249
So you set up a secretive space for your projects.

327
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,549
- Yes.
- I see.

328
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,319
How long have you been working in this field, I Na?

329
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,749
- It's been over a decade now.
- Gosh.

330
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,049
- That's a long time.
- You worked for a long time.

331
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,289
You had the vibe of a young zoomer.

332
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,810
- I tried to dress up today.
- Really?

333
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,930
I wanted to look young.

334
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,529
What about you, Chung Gyu?

335
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,099
I've been working in this field for about 17 years.

336
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,530
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

337
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,970
How long have you two been working together?

338
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,369
- It's been a bit over a decade.
- Is that so?

339
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,370
Yes. It's been over a decade.

340
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,569
Did you start your career with him?

341
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,980
Yes. He's my direct senior.

342
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,439
- You're her direct senior.
- Yes.

343
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,009
There's no establishment that helps you work in our field.

344
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,049
You need to get a job at a company...

345
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,450
to watch and learn from your senior. That's the only way to start.

346
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,789
- There are other foley artists.
- Yes.

347
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,150
But you're saying you're the best.

348
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,229
No, I didn't mean it like that.

349
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,559
- You didn't?
- No.

350
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
What I find interesting is that...

351
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:32,559
- you guys use other props...
- Right.

352
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,729
To record sound effects. Props that make similar wounds.

353
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,399
- That's right.
- Is that why...

354
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,570
you go to antique shops?

355
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,099
Yes. That's right.

356
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,269
- Since we're at their studio, - That's so fascinating.

357
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,309
- could you demonstrate for us?
- We'd love to see that.

358
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,310
- Sure. This way.
- Just a little.

359
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:46,080
- Really? Shall we?
- Yes.

360
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,849
- We can try it too.
- Yes.

361
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,890
I always wanted to try it.

362
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,920
I was always so curious.

363
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,150
- Okay. Shall we?
- This way. Yes.

364
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,819
You've got so much stuff. This is a general store indeed.

365
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,660
- This place is legit.
- Gosh.

366
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,560
I see all kinds of stuff here.

367
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,559
(A general store with all kinds of props in the world)

368
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,799
We created countless of our works in here.

369
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,029
- In here?
- Yes.

370
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,129
(Thousands of sounds were created with these objects.)

371
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,969
I see. So do you watch the videos from there and record?

372
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,970
Yes.

373
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,510
He's going to do it now.

374
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

375
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:19,239
You have to close the door over there.

376
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,439
- Close the door?
- Yes.

377
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,349
Seriously. He's so approachable.

378
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,350
His outfit...

379
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:26,391
- He's got that vibe.
- reminds me of my neighbors.

380
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,150
They usually wear jerseys of their favorite team.

381
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,189
They wear jerseys of the teams they support.

382
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,719
He must be Faker's fan.

383
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,290
- His clothes can't rustle.
- Right.

384
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,430
- You're right.
- That could be one of the reasons.

385
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,030
- Ji Woo, you're sharp.
- That's...

386
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
- Should we open the coffin?
- Yes.

387
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,169
(The tool for the first scene is a wooden plank.)

388
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,850
Is it the sound of laying down the coffin?

389
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,210
I see. He's covering it with sand.

390
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,439
(Intrigued)

391
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,579
- Isn't it fascinating?
- Yes.

392
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,050
- Shall we? Let's go.
- Yes.

393
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,880
It's "Exhuma."

394
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:07,930
(Without the sound effects)

395
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,830
(How will the scene look with the sound effects?)

396
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:20,840
(With the sound effects)

397
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,979
(It sounds more real than the actual scene.)

398
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,640
- It's really...
- This is nice.

399
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,279
- Should we add more sand?
- That was nice.

400
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Sure.

401
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,250
You guys are so detailed. You literally record everything.

402
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,149
- This must take a lot of time.
- Yes.

403
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,796
The two of them have to do everything in the studio.

404
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,389
I Na has to listen to the sounds and check everything.

405
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,930
- Exactly.
- Right?

406
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,329
(The next prop is a pair of heels?)

407
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,500
He's putting on heels.

408
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,669
I see. There are heels his size.

409
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,639
Did he wear the heels himself?

410
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,740
- Yes.
- Those high heels?

411
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,639
(Breaking in the shoes)

412
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,739
- Shall we?
- Let's do it.

413
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,910
- Yes.
- Let's start.

414
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,610
(Scene 2: The sound of heels clacking in "Exhuma")

415
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,690
Great.

416
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,860
The sound effect is perfectly in sync.

417
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,990
Gosh, the shooting scene?

418
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,536
- I see. Is it "12.12: The Day?"
- Yes, "12.12: The Day."

419
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,860
(Next up is a shooting scene.)

420
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,600
- You don't use a real gun for it.
- No, I don't.

421
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,270
Right.

422
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,310
(Scene 3: The sound of a gun loading in "12.12: The Day")

423
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,680
(Clicking)

424
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,720
Gosh, it sounds so real.

425
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,590
That's how you make the sound of loading a gun.

426
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,459
- He doesn't use guns.
- He doesn't.

427
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,159
- What's that?
- Isn't that a staple gun?

428
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,659
- That's a staple gun.
- Yes, it is a staple gun.

429
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,690
It's a staple gun.

430
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,329
For the sound of loading a gun?

431
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,170
- Yes. To load a magazine.
- For the magazine.

432
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,106
The sound of loading the magazine.

433
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,230
Let's begin.

434
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,839
Okay.

435
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
(Clicking)

436
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,110
We need to add the clattering sound from the plastic.

437
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,140
- You could hear it. Right?
- Gosh.

438
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,680
Yes. It was missing something.

439
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,750
- I see.
- Yes.

440
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,780
- Just a bit.
- It's missing something.

441
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,240
- Okay.
- Add some more. Let's go.

442
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,959
- Let's try again.
- He's nervous.

443
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,160
To add the sound effect?

444
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,429
Just do what you've been doing.

445
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,930
You're dissing him a lot.

446
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,559
It looks like she has the upper hand in this partnership.

447
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,600
That's the only benefit of the job. Let's go.

448
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,030
I'll do what I've been doing.

449
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,870
Let's go.

450
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,599
(Scene 4: The sound of loading the gun with a magazine)

451
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,370
(This is the scene.)

452
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,079
- Okay. Great.
- Yes.

453
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,160
- This sounded real.
- Yes.

454
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,950
Yes. That sounded real.

455
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,190
That sounded real. Gosh, thank you.

456
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,850
- Why don't you come out for now?
- Okay.

457
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
- That was so interesting.
- Gosh.

458
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,936
- It was interesting, right?
- Yes.

459
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,089
My gosh. I never imagined this would be used...

460
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,500
to load the gun with a magazine.

461
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,799
(A lingering feeling)

462
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,100
We have so many questions.

463
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,639
- Thank you for everything.
- Sure.

464
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,840
Gosh, thank you.

465
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,870
You must need a lot of tools.

466
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,980
Yes, that's right. We need a lot of tools.

467
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
- Right?
- Yes.

468
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:17,010
You know those items people throw out?

469
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,379
I always check them out.

470
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,619
- You check the sounds.
- Yes.

471
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,989
People throw out recyclables, you know?

472
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,689
- Yes. I see.
- I pick up a lot of them.

473
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,889
When we go out to have a meal,

474
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,830
he'd go off and pick up random stuff out of the blue.

475
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,860
At first, that was embarrassing.

476
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,699
I used to walk away from him and pretended I didn't know him.

477
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,569
- You pretended not to know him?
- All of a sudden, he asked me...

478
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,000
to help him carry a big table.

479
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm fine now because I'm used to it.

480
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,410
You have more power in this partnership.

481
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,410
I only speak up when we record.

482
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,439
That's the only time I can express my opinions.

483
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,909
This is for a TV show.

484
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,950
- So he's playing along now.
- Okay.

485
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
But usually, he says he likes his versions better.

486
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,290
- I get it.
- I usually...

487
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,220
Earlier, he was gentle like a sheep.

488
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,020
You guys have your own way of doing things.

489
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,430
What's the toughest sound effect you've created so far?

490
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,670
I wouldn't say it was the toughest.

491
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,629
- A few of them were a bit iffy.
- Okay.

492
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,200
- Like physiological phenomena...
- What are some of them?

493
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,209
I'd say bedroom scenes.

494
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,710
- They kiss and make out.
- How do you do that?

495
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,650
I can't make those sounds with someone.

496
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,749
- I'd do that on my body.
- I hear they do this for kisses.

497
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,049
- Yes. I do that too.
- Yes.

498
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,849
- Among ice pops, - Yes.

499
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,220
- there's one in red.
- Yes.

500
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,019
- I use that to record sounds.
- You use ice pops?

501
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,560
- Yes. When I want it to sound wet.
- To make it sound wet?

502
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,589
- Yes.
- You have your own tricks.

503
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,600
But watching him do that in the recording booth...

504
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,699
- What crosses your mind then?
- I'm sure you're focused and all.

505
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,739
- My gosh.
- It's not easy.

506
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,900
- It's not easy, right?
- No.

507
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,209
I have a question. This is a two-person operation.

508
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,809
But in the movies, there are scenes...

509
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,379
- with a lot of people.
- The mob scene.

510
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,509
There could be a crowd.

511
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,749
Or there could be a group of soldiers.

512
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,779
Do you make all of the sound effects...

513
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
- by yourself?
- Yes.

514
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,950
How do you do that?

515
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,950
- I record sounds several times...
- You do it several times?

516
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,950
For each character.

517
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:02,589
- And then we layer up the sounds.
- You layer them.

518
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,919
- Yes.
- Like when they are heading...

519
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,220
- somewhere together.
- Right.

520
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,960
What are some pros of working in this profession?

521
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,699
- I get to watch movies or dramas...
- Okay.

522
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,359
- before they are released.
- You get to watch them first.

523
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,070
- I see.
- That's the upside.

524
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,629
- That's what you like?
- Yes.

525
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,729
What are some downsides?

526
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,130
As for the downsides, I must always work with him as a pair.

527
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,960
We have to stay together all the time.

528
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,080
Even when we argue, we still have to work together.

529
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,579
He can sense my mood...

530
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,979
- through the speaker.
- Of course.

531
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,510
I have to talk to him when I don't want to.

532
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,040
A long time ago, I didn't talk to him.

533
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,750
One time, I only dragged the part we had to record.

534
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,220
- I wanted him to record that.
- I see.

535
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,230
- He just recorded the sounds.
- Yes.

536
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,559
- You're something else.
- I dragged it with my house.

537
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,959
But you still worked with him for over ten years.

538
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,600
- Exactly.
- You know?

539
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,599
- We had a lot of ups and downs.
- I see.

540
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,099
They've been working together for over ten years.

541
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,669
- Being able to work as a team...
- It's their teamwork.

542
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,969
Yes. It's not easy to have great teamwork like this.

543
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,309
- It's not easy.
- It's not.

544
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,010
It's rare to find someone whom you can work well as a team.

545
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,639
Since we're on the subject,

546
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,109
tell us what made you apply to our show.

547
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,350
- Was it you, I Na?
- Yes, I did it without telling him.

548
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,596
- You didn't tell him? Why?
- Yes. I did it secretly.

549
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,750
She said she wanted to be more famous.

550
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,190
That's not true.

551
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,419
- That's what I Na wanted?
- Yes.

552
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,860
Let me explain. Sometimes, reporters come to cover our story.

553
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,330
I want to be on TV. But only my neck shows.

554
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,400
Or it's just my wrist.

555
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,130
Only the back of my head is on TV.

556
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,099
But I thought your show would give me...

557
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,870
- more airtime.
- That's right.

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,069
That's why I wrote to your show.

559
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,939
- Great. Yes.
- That explains her fancy outfit.

560
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,639
So listen. She's showing that...

561
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
- she wrote to our show.
- Yes.

562
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,309
That's crystal clear. Okay.

563
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,850
- Okay. We have to draw coupons.
- Yes, we should.

564
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,219
Just throw it.

565
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,920
(Ji Woo will draw the bonus coupons.)

566
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,860
(She fails to get them any coupons.)

567
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,230
Your reaction is great.

568
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,060
You know what? I just saw...

569
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,870
- an excellent scene.
- Yes.

570
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,240
- That sounded so real.
- Yes.

571
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,309
- It says what your present will be.
- The fortune cookie.

572
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,679
Let's check the present for Round One.

573
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,909
"Discover sounds..."

574
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,116
- "from your regular antique shop."
- "Antique shop."

575
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,149
"A stipend of 300 dollars..."

576
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,390
- "to be spent at the antique shop."
- It's 300 dollars.

577
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,419
- It's cash. It's 300 dollars.
- Here's why.

578
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,149
They must pay when they want to take...

579
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,889
- some props from the shop.
- Right.

580
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,120
- Right.
- All right.

581
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,220
We're not giving you 300 dollars yet.

582
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,659
I see. I guess not.

583
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,290
- We must complete the mission.
- I see.

584
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,559
What is it?

585
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,280
(300 dollars are at stake on this mission.)

586
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,299
(Who Are You?)

587
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,669
(Listen to the famous lines from a movie or a drama.)

588
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,569
(True love always returns.)

589
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,869
(Then guess the actor.)

590
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,269
(The correct answer: Kwon Sang Woo)

591
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,409
(Round 1)

592
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,109
(Successfully make a round trip.)

593
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,780
You must listen to the famous lines.

594
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,809
Then guess the actor or actress who said the lines.

595
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,680
This is harder than it sounds, actually.

596
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,219
(His performance with the soundtrack quiz was awful.)

597
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,950
- Gosh, this is so hard.
- This is a difficult mission.

598
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,980
- Gosh, this is so hard.
- This one is hard.

599
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,959
- We just have to name the actors?
- Just the actors.

600
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
- Actors?
- All right.

601
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,190
- We must make a round trip?
- Let's try it.

602
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,000
- Let's do a team cheer first.
- Actually...

603
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,830
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go - In 2, 3. Here we go.

604
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,730
This is your first try.

605
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,199
Yeon Seok. This one is for you. Go.

606
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,269
(The 1st question)

607
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,410
Tell me. Do I have the face of a king?

608
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,009
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Lee Jung Jae!

609
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,010
- Okay.
- That's correct.

610
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,350
- I knew it too.
- Ji Woo. Here you go.

611
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,680
(His lips are dry.)

612
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,389
(Ji Woo is up next.)

613
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,450
Go.

614
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,150
Does it hurt?

615
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,120
It hurts me too.

616
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,189
- What?
- In 1, 2, 3.

617
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,790
- Lee Seo Jin.
- That's it.

618
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,190
We'll accept it.

619
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,330
- That startled me.
- My gosh.

620
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,629
- She was going to say it on three.
- Right.

621
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,669
- I was about to say it.
- She was going...

622
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,539
- to say it on three.
- Of course.

623
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,869
- I was going to say it after that.
- Right.

624
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,669
- This is the tough part.
- This is so hard.

625
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,109
- You'll only go once.
- Ji Woo... Yes.

626
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,509
- It could be a difficult one then.
- Right.

627
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,739
We have to complete the first round.

628
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,909
He'll only go once?

629
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,210
He's the halfway point.

630
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,670
I should sit there next time then.

631
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,120
Ji Woo.

632
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,290
- Here's your question.
- Okay.

633
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,550
Go.

634
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,020
Hey, 4885.

635
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,720
- What?
- It's you, isn't it?

636
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,089
Kim Yun Seok.

637
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,390
- Correct.
- Okay.

638
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,159
- That was a hard one.
- That was hard.

639
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,559
- Why...
- That one was hard.

640
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,059
- I didn't know that one.
- Isn't that a famous scene?

641
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,300
That was hard. It was Kim Yun Seok's scene.

642
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,069
- Ji Woo.
- It's my turn again?

643
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,070
Yes.

644
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:14,540
Here's your question. Go.

645
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,709
Don't you smell something burning?

646
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,079
(The 4th question)

647
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,310
- Eric.
- That's it!

648
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,540
- Correct.
- Yes!

649
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,049
- Great.
- Here it goes.

650
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,580
- Hold on. It sounds muffled.
- Great.

651
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,696
- Right. I couldn't hear it well.
- Change the direction.

652
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,820
Turn it to our side.

653
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,650
- All right.
- All right.

654
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,296
- You can complete Round 1 with it.
- We can end Round 1 with this.

655
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,389
Here's your question.

656
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,529
(If he gets it right, they'll complete Round 1.)

657
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,629
Go.

658
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,429
(The 5th question)

659
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,530
How many?

660
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,099
- What?
- What?

661
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm talking about the rice grains. How many are there?

662
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,700
- What?
- I'm talking about the rice grains.

663
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,069
How many are there?

664
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,979
In 1, 2, 3.

665
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,909
It's Lee Sung Min! Come on.

666
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,209
(He runs out of time.)

667
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,550
It's Sung Min's scene.

668
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,020
- From what?
- It's Lee Sung Min's scene.

669
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,219
- It's from his drama.
- I know this scene.

670
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,650
He's asking about the rice grains.

671
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,590
- Don't you know this scene?
- This is...

672
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,589
I know the scene. It's the drama with...

673
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,160
- "Reborn Rich."
- "Reborn Rich."

674
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,030
- Gosh, this scene...
- I just remembered it.

675
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,000
"Reborn Rich."

676
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,406
This was a great opportunity for us. It's Sung Min's scene.

677
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,799
(That was close.)

678
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,670
I was flustered when he asked for the number of the rice grains.

679
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,510
I mean...

680
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,139
- Don't try to guess the number.
- I mean...

681
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,979
I had to figure out who said the line.

682
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,650
But he asked about the number.

683
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,150
So I tried to figure that out.

684
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,850
- By the way, we got so close.
- We really got close.

685
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,320
- Gosh, Sung Min's character...
- I knew this scene.

686
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,319
- All right.
- Do you want to go first?

687
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,559
I'll be at the halfway point.

688
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,119
- I want to stay in the middle.
- Okay. Come here.

689
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,289
- I'll go first.
- I'll take the halfway point.

690
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,059
- My heart...
- This is a difficult spot.

691
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,429
There's a lot of pressure at the end.

692
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,629
- At the end... Gosh.
- You know?

693
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,530
I thought my heart was going to burst.

694
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,639
All right. This is our 2nd try. In 1, 2, 3.

695
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,699
- Here we go.
- Okay.

696
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,140
Jae Suk. Here's your question.

697
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,510
Go.

698
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,740
It is understandable with regular people.

699
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,450
- But...
- "But..."

700
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,779
I do not expect that from my people.

701
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,519
It's Ko Hyun Jung! My gosh.

702
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,649
(Ko Hyun Jung, from "The Great Queen Seondeok")

703
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,720
I didn't know that one.

704
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,426
- You didn't know? It's Mi Shil.
- You didn't know this scene?

705
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,166
How could you not know this famous character?

706
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,859
- Mi Shil?
- Yes, Mi Shil.

707
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,220
- It's Mi Shil.
- It's her, right?

708
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,550
- From "The Great Queen Seondeok."
- Right.

709
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,960
Ji Woo.

710
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,930
Here's your question.

711
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,469
I want to go back!

712
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,010
(The 2nd question: I want to go back!)

713
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,710
(Shaking)

714
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,019
In 1, 2, 3.

715
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,380
- Seol Kyung Gu!
- That's correct.

716
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
You were too late.

717
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:45,120
(Seol Kyung Gu, from "Peppermint Candy")

718
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,020
My throat hurts so much.

719
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,159
- I was right.
- Ji Woo.

720
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,860
- No! Jae Suk.
- Ji Woo.

721
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,199
- I was right.
- You were too late.

722
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,759
- I wasn't late.
- You were right. But you were late.

723
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,869
Come on, Jae Suk.

724
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,740
Ji Woo, you were too late.

725
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,370
Ji Woo. Do you really want to go back, perhaps?

726
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,240
About ten seconds ago.

727
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,480
I couldn't remember his name for a second.

728
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,909
I thought you were doing a 100m sprint just now.

729
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,949
You kept stamping your feet.

730
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,750
(She stamped her feet as she was anxious.)

731
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,990
I knew it.

732
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,749
Your mind goes blank for a second.

733
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,636
- You know the answer. But...
- Once you try it, it'll be hard.

734
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,789
- I don't think I can do it.
- Right? It seems hard.

735
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,110
- Yes.
- I couldn't say his name.

736
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,029
Get it, Ji Woo?

737
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,630
You're the reason our second try failed.

738
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,859
(Their second try ends in failure.)

739
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,129
Should we switch seats?

740
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,499
Do you want to switch with him?

741
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,969
- Sure. Let's switch seats.
- Try going first.

742
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,000
- Sure.
- Okay.

743
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,769
- All right.
- It's okay.

744
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,039
- This is our third try, right?
- Yes.

745
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,869
- It's your 3rd try. Ji Woo.
- In 1, 2, 3.

746
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,970
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

747
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Here's your question.

748
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,280
Go.

749
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,910
Falling in love isn't a crime!

750
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,780
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jung Woo Sung.

751
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,949
(Park Hae Joon from "The World of the Married")

752
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,990
It's Park Hae Joon's scene.

753
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,466
- "The World of the Married."
- "The World of the Married."

754
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,630
(Sinking her head)

755
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,560
(It's the famous scene of justifying his affair.)

756
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,230
Why don't you take the halfway point?

757
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,099
Ji Woo.

758
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,940
- Ji Woo, take this seat.
- Ji Woo, come here.

759
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,309
- Come here.
- Okay.

760
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,809
- You give us no choice.
- Gosh.

761
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,969
- My gosh. Seriously.
- You take this spot.

762
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,739
I knew it. Yes. "The World of the Married."

763
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,839
- It's hard to remember it.
- My gosh.

764
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,549
- It's hard to remember it there.
- It's really hard.

765
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,879
- It's hard to remember it.
- Actually,

766
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,209
it's just like you said.

767
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,519
- In that split second...
- Right.

768
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,696
(Even when they know the answer, they forget it at that moment.)

769
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,989
Don't worry, though.

770
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,160
It's harder to remember when it's your turn.

771
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,690
How many tries do we have left?

772
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,860
- Seven.
- Seven? I see.

773
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,389
- We've got a lot of tries.
- We must succeed.

774
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,930
- All right.
- Okay.

775
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,010
- Yeon Seok. Here's your question.
- Okay.

776
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,830
Go.

777
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,770
Do you want some ramyeon?

778
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,270
- In one...
- Lee Young Ae.

779
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,609
Gosh, that was confusing.

780
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,039
- It was confusing for me too.
- That was hard.

781
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,440
- That was really hard.
- Son Ye Jin said something similar.

782
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,849
- My gosh. This is...
- It's such a famous line.

783
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,749
- But the actresses...
- Gosh, this was so confusing.

784
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,920
- So many actresses said this line.
- Yes.

785
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,690
- I did it.
- Here's your second question. Go.

786
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,390
Do you want to eat? Or do you want...

787
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,490
- All right. Gosh.
- to die with me?

788
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,699
(You don't know this?)

789
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,629
(The 2nd question)

790
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,870
- In 1, 2...
- So Ji Sub.

791
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,800
- For a split second...
- Come on, Jae Suk.

792
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,370
- Do you want to die?
- Jae Suk.

793
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,969
(His heart skipped a beat.)

794
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,130
Gosh, I suddenly remembered his nickname, So Cool Guy.

795
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,680
- Jae Suk.
- I couldn't remember his name.

796
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,079
- But that could happen.
- You must say his real name.

797
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,450
I remembered So Cool Guy.

798
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,579
I can't do this.

799
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,119
My heart is beating so fast.

800
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,289
- Ji Woo. It's just one question.
- Ji Woo. Focus.

801
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,689
My gosh, Jae Suk. Of course, I'm focused.

802
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,229
- I stayed focused the whole time.
- Ji Woo.

803
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,259
Ji Woo, focus.

804
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,789
I can't seem to remember their names.

805
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,529
- What do I do?
- Ji Woo, here's your question.

806
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,159
- No, you were good before.
- Oh, no. What am I going to do?

807
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,230
Here's your question.

808
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,570
Go.

809
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,670
I thought I could have you with this.

810
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,640
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jung Woo Sung.

811
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,809
- Choi Min Soo.
- Choi Min Soo.

812
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,279
My gosh. No. I knew it.

813
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,750
(Choi Min Soo from "Sandglass")

814
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,019
- What?
- You're right. I must be losing it.

815
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,450
I must be going crazy.

816
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,089
You're right. I must be losing it.

817
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,119
(Oh, no)

818
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,419
- How will you fix this?
- What do I do?

819
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,519
Why can't I stop thinking about "A Moment to Remember?"

820
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,090
- Come on. Ji Woo.
- You need a moment to remember.

821
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,860
What do I do?

822
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,130
Can't we play a different game?

823
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,999
My gosh. I don't think I can play this anymore.

824
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,640
That was our fifth try now.

825
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,569
All right. This is our 6th try. In 1, 2, 3.

826
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,610
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

827
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,810
- Jae Suk, here's your question.
- Okay.

828
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,610
Go.

829
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,310
You should go...

830
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,550
to Hawaii.

831
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,250
- Jang Dong Gun.
- Yes. Correct.

832
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,789
- Okay. Here's the second question.
- Just play it cool.

833
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,419
(Next up is Yeon Seok.)

834
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,420
Go.

835
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,890
Let's go, baby.

836
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,559
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Park Shin Yang.

837
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,790
That's it.

838
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,830
(Yeon Seok passes his turn too.)

839
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,330
All right. Ji Woo, here's your question.

840
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,870
(It's the halfway point, the most difficult part.)

841
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Go.

842
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,710
It's an excuse of a coward!

843
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,009
All right.

844
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,850
- In 1, 2, 3.
- His name was mentioned before.

845
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,910
(His name was mentioned before.)

846
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,709
(His name was mentioned before?)

847
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,779
- Jung Woo Sung.
- No!

848
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,219
(Seol Kyung Gu from "Silmido")

849
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,449
Why do you keep saying his name?

850
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,019
You said his name was mentioned before.

851
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,089
- It's Seol Kyung Gu.
- It's Seol Kyung Gu.

852
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,589
You said his name was mentioned before.

853
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,190
I couldn't even think. I just...

854
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,759
- You said...
- Their voices are different.

855
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,469
I was going to say his name,

856
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,869
but you said his name was mentioned before.

857
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,940
Ji Woo. Why are you doing this to us today?

858
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,270
Oh, no.

859
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,110
I don't think this can air.

860
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,209
(Sensing a canceled episode)

861
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,510
What's the alternative then?

862
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,749
What are we going to air this week?

863
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,719
Let's start over.

864
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,949
- We can't start over.
- Hey.

865
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,560
This can't air.

866
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,620
My gosh.

867
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,490
We must complete Round One now.

868
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,159
Ji Woo, let's try it. All right. Let's go.

869
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,759
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go.

870
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,399
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

871
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,480
- Here's your question.
- I must complete Round One.

872
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,870
Go.

873
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,499
I mean, I just can't understand it.

874
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,169
- It's Cho Jung Seok.
- That's it. Great.

875
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,609
- I was in the movie too.
- All right.

876
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,810
Here's the second question. Go.

877
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,649
- I'll let you live.
- "I'll let you live."

878
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,719
- He's my friend. Park...
- In 1, 2, 3.

879
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,690
(Out of time)

880
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,520
(The sound effect for how-can-you-get-this-wrong faces?)

881
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,220
He's my friend.

882
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,730
Who's your friend?

883
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,600
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

884
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,960
Tell us. Who is it?

885
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,229
I can't suddenly remember his name.

886
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,630
Tell me his name. Who is it?

887
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,030
Park... My gosh.

888
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,369
Park Sung Woong.

889
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,939
- Sung Woong. My friend.
- Sung Woong.

890
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,270
- Right. It's Sung Woong.
- That's Sung Woong?

891
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,809
- It's Sung Woong.
- Sung Woong.

892
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,556
(He fails because he forgot his friend's name.)

893
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,309
Gosh, I really enjoyed watching this movie.

894
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,510
I couldn't remember his name.

895
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,880
Gosh, I'm done for because of Sung Woong.

896
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,480
I'll let you live.

897
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,419
- This is a difficult game.
- My gosh.

898
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,449
(Things aren't going well for this mission.)

899
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,520
Are you crying?

900
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,290
- Are you crying?
- Sung Woong might not spare us.

901
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,790
- All right.
- You named most of them, right?

902
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,159
- No.
- No, not really.

903
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,429
- It's confusing, right?
- It's confusing.

904
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,659
The last one was confusing too, right?

905
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,670
No.

906
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,439
I couldn't remember his name all of a sudden.

907
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,769
- It happens like that.
- It was Sung Woong.

908
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,610
- This is our eighth try.
- Okay.

909
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,609
- It's your eighth try.
- All right.

910
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,939
- We can do this.
- Good luck.

911
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,610
We got this. Yes.

912
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,009
Yeon Seok. Here's your question.

913
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,349
(They're on their 8th try for Round 1.)

914
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,380
Go.

915
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,920
"Let's do it. Fall in love..."

916
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,450
"with me."

917
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,490
- Do what?
- In 1, 2, 3.

918
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,989
It's Lee Byung Hun.

919
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,030
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

920
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,730
That's "Mr. Sunshine."

921
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,630
- You were in the drama.
- Wait.

922
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,170
That was "Mr. Sunshine?"

923
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,799
That was Lee Byung Hun.

924
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,769
- It's the sound. It was...
- Right.

925
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,309
- muffled, so I couldn't hear it.
- Same here. Right.

926
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,150
- The bass... I'm serious.
- Right. Seriously.

927
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,879
Let's do it again.

928
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,949
What just happened, Dong Mae?

929
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,680
Of all people, at least Dong Mae should've gotten it right.

930
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,819
- What just happened, Dong Mae?
- We're in trouble.

931
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,990
That was just awful.

932
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,559
This is our weakest game.

933
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,390
Quizzes like this are our worst enemy.

934
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,030
This is worse because I was in the drama.

935
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,736
- Dong Mae, this isn't cool.
- He's got nothing to say.

936
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,080
- He has nothing to say.
- Right.

937
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,370
Why don't we roll the dice again?

938
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,670
- We can't do that.
- It's over.

939
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,316
- We can't?
- Ji Woo, how about the middle seat?

940
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,210
All right. You know what?

941
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,009
- Let's get our energy up.
- This is our ninth try.

942
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,209
It's our 9th try. In 1, 2, 3.

943
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,370
- Here we go.
- What do I do?

944
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Here's your question.

945
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,579
(They're struggling hard with the mission.)

946
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,779
(They can't afford any more mistakes.)

947
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,250
Jae Suk. Here's your question. Go.

948
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,620
Who was that?

949
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,319
- "Who..."
- Who coughed just now?

950
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,429
- It's Kim Yeong Cheol.
- Correct.

951
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,390
- That was hard.
- That was hard.

952
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,700
Next. Yeon Seok, here's your question. Go.

953
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,269
Only one thing happens in my zone.

954
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,540
We save people.

955
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,799
Han Seok Kyu.

956
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
That's it.

957
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,040
It's Seok Kyu.

958
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,886
- Han Seok Kyu.
- It's Ji Woo's turn.

959
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,739
- Gosh. Oh, no. No way.
- Ji Woo, just get this one right.

960
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,179
- My goodness.
- Get a grip, Ji Woo.

961
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,449
Jae Suk. Not you too.

962
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,450
- Seriously.
- Pretend you're watching it...

963
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,450
at home. Just relax.

964
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,720
- All right. Just relax.
- Don't be so nervous.

965
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,850
- Just relax. Don't cover your ears.
- Right.

966
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,889
Ji Woo, here's your question.

967
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,259
(This is their ninth try.)

968
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,359
Go.

969
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,419
(The 3rd question)

970
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,730
After meeting this woman,

971
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,436
- I got it.
- I got to love her.

972
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,659
- Park Shin Yang.
- Correct.

973
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,899
(Park Shin Yang from "A Promise")

974
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,630
(Ji Woo finally got one right!)

975
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,699
We got it.

976
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,339
- All right, now.
- It's been so long.

977
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,639
- A chance that came after long.
- It's our turn now.

978
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,370
- All right.
- Here's the fourth question.

979
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,509
(Next is Yeon Seok.)

980
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,510
Go.

981
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,780
Your boss lives in Namcheon-dong, right?

982
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,149
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Choi Min Sik.

983
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,789
That's it. We got it.

984
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,689
- Last one.
- We just need to do this well.

985
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,820
- Jae Suk. You got this.
- Here comes your question.

986
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,960
(If Jae Suk gets it, they'll succeed in Round 1.)

987
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,340
Go.

988
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,600
I'll tear your trap apart.

989
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,910
- "Trap?"
- One...

990
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,470
(Your trap!)

991
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,740
I'll tear it.

992
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,350
(You got it, right?)

993
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,850
(You know it, right?)

994
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,719
- "Trap?"
- One, two, three.

995
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,449
- Kim Jung Eun?
- It's Yum Jung Ah.

996
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,090
- Yum Jung Ah...
- It's Yum Jung Ah.

997
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,690
Gosh, Jae Suk! I knew!

998
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,989
(The famous line he blindly thought he knew)

999
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:20,429
Seriously. I knew the answer.

1000
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,830
(Even Ji Woo knew.)

1001
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,730
I didn't expect to hear "trap" here.

1002
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,346
I knew the answer when she started saying, "trap."

1003
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,870
When she began, I knew it was Yum Jung Ah.

1004
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,479
(They failed in their ninth try as well.)

1005
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,349
All right. Here's our last chance. It's Round One.

1006
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,280
- As for Round One, - Then you...

1007
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,920
we must succeed in it.

1008
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,750
It was our chance to win Round One.

1009
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,390
Something felt off since I threw the dice.

1010
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,329
Right, Jae Suk? Goodness.

1011
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,400
- We got no extra chance.
- Come on, seriously.

1012
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,400
All right, now. You're looking a lot more gloom.

1013
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,970
- I know.
- Now...

1014
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,069
- All right. Let's do that.
- Let's do a cheer.

1015
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,909
It's our last chance. One, two, three.

1016
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,910
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1017
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:05,286
Come here. Let's do it among ourselves too.

1018
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,379
Let's do it while getting up.

1019
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,980
We must do this. We must make it today.

1020
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,649
(They must succeed in Round 1, at least.)

1021
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,680
Here's your last chance. Jae Suk, your question.

1022
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,790
Go.

1023
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:17,989
(The 1st question)

1024
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,490
If you fail, it's treason. If you succeed, it's a revolution!

1025
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,559
- My brother. Hwang Jung Min.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1026
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,959
(Hwang Jung Min from "12.12: The Day")

1027
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,030
- Yeon Seok, here's your question.
- Okay.

1028
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,870
Go.

1029
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,870
(The 2nd question)

1030
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:33,069
In 1911, in Gyeongseong,

1031
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,269
when we were assassinating General Terauchi...

1032
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,040
- Lee Jung Jae.
- That's right.

1033
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,710
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1034
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,439
- Here's the third question.
- Take it easy.

1035
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,550
- Here comes the question.
- All right.

1036
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,450
Go.

1037
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:47,479
(The 3rd question)

1038
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,420
Love? Don't be ridiculous.

1039
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,719
I'll buy it with love.

1040
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,689
- In 1, 2, 3.
- I got it. Won Bin.

1041
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,790
That was great.

1042
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,759
Were you nervous?

1043
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,899
(Ji Woo passes.)

1044
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,999
- Here it is.
- Your question.

1045
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,730
(It's Yeon Seok and Jae Suk's turn again.)

1046
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,469
- Here it is.
- Your question.

1047
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,170
(Be at ease.)

1048
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,210
Go.

1049
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,480
You must've had a plan all along.

1050
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,479
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Song Kang Ho.

1051
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,556
That's it. You're exactly right.

1052
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,819
- Here's the last question.
- All right. It's me.

1053
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,419
(The last to answer, Jae Suk)

1054
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
Here it is.

1055
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,890
(The last question of their last chance)

1056
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,800
All right. Your question.

1057
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
Go.

1058
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:37,099
(The 5th question)

1059
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,139
The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people.

1060
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,569
(The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people.)

1061
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,979
(The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people.)

1062
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,779
And all authority comes from the people.

1063
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,879
Song Kang Ho!

1064
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,979
(Song Kang Ho from "The Attorney")

1065
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,249
Why did you have to make us feel anxious?

1066
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,689
(They finally succeeded in the 1st round.)

1067
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,190
- We barely passed Round One.
- My gosh.

1068
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,989
(Sighing)

1069
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,229
- I can't do this.
- I was really nervous.

1070
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,230
I mean...

1071
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,529
I didn't know we'd get Song Kang Ho twice in a row.

1072
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,999
- Goodness, this is...
- My gosh.

1073
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,939
- That's why I thought, - It's confusing.

1074
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,399
- "Wait a minute."
- "We just had him as an answer."

1075
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,509
"They're going to ask me about the same guy again?"

1076
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,669
(They were more flustered at the unexpected question.)

1077
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,309
(Teary-eyed)

1078
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,110
I thought it was a movie I didn't know about.

1079
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,210
All right. You earned 200 dollars.

1080
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,120
(A sound effect for winning the money)

1081
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,889
- That was hard.
- Thank you.

1082
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,819
- It was hard.
- I'm glad, though.

1083
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,890
- But we still got it.
- I'm so glad.

1084
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,089
- Whenever...
- Finding props.

1085
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:43,730
(Finding props whenever)

1086
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,239
I can't believe I missed "Mr. Sunshine."

1087
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,339
How could you not recognize Lee Byung Hun?

1088
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,310
It was too ringing.

1089
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,679
Still, we succeeded in Round One...

1090
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,879
- I know.
- and gave them the gift.

1091
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,050
Ji Woo is still fun even after a long time.

1092
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,949
Jae Suk. I really got...

1093
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,980
the answers for your questions.

1094
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,849
I got all of them by myself.

1095
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,419
I only failed to answer mine.

1096
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,820
You should've done well with yours.

1097
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,729
- Others' questions are easier.
- Gosh, seriously.

1098
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,529
Then why don't we have lunch around here?

1099
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,599
- Around here?
- Then we can move to another spot.

1100
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Shall we?

1101
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,200
It was just Round One, but we made it.

1102
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,200
I would've felt bad if we couldn't give it to them.

1103
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,070
We'd have totally felt bad.

1104
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,239
(Relieved)

1105
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,610
I know it was nothing, but it made my heart race.

1106
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,449
You can answer all of them...

1107
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,520
when you watch it on TV.

1108
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,179
This is how it feels. When I watch it on TV,

1109
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,919
I'd go, "Why can't they get it?"

1110
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,350
"They're weird."

1111
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,090
Then people will say that to me.

1112
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,260
Some people might call you.

1113
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,189
"Hey, you got that wrong?" Like this?

1114
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,199
That's right.

1115
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,859
Ji Woo has had a few issues.

1116
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,329
She's created a few legendary scenes.

1117
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,000
You even said it shouldn't be aired.

1118
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,599
There are a few restaurants across this street.

1119
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,840
- Is that so?
- Over there.

1120
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,769
- There's a ramen place in there.
- What shall we have...

1121
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,040
- Is that so?
- There's a ramen place.

1122
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,910
There's grilled pork belly on caldron lid. And then...

1123
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,550
A cod dish?

1124
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,620
Cod stew?

1125
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,089
Does cod stew sound good?

1126
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,019
- It sounds good.
- Cod stew would be nice.

1127
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,359
They have various dishes using cod as the main ingredient.

1128
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,859
- Let's go there.
- Sure. Let's go there.

1129
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,500
- Shall we go there?
- Let's go have cod.

1130
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,599
Do you have to find places for lunch yourself?

1131
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,799
- Really?
- I just choose randomly.

1132
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,270
- Really?
- Yes.

1133
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,790
- There are many things you do.
- Be careful of that.

1134
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,739
- I have to find ways.
- I know.

1135
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,900
He has a lot of things to do.

1136
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,509
Ji Woo, how old is your child?

1137
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,209
- She turned five this year.
- That's when they're most adorable.

1138
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,309
- Yes, she needs a lot of care.
- She must be...

1139
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,349
- Of course.
- She looks for her mom the most.

1140
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,489
That's right. She's at that age.

1141
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,649
- Yes.
- That's when it's the toughest.

1142
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,089
No, I think she was adorable...

1143
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,619
She was adorable when she was a baby.

1144
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,340
- They're always adorable.
- They are, yes.

1145
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,429
But if we were to talk about the period,

1146
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,360
- at her age...
- I can talk to her now.

1147
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,929
And she expresses her feelings...

1148
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,400
- through words.
- That's right.

1149
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,399
We can talk to each other now.

1150
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,270
She's easy to bring around.

1151
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,839
This is what I thought.

1152
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I thought that the human race continues to evolve.

1153
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,309
I realize that through child rearing.

1154
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,310
That's right.

1155
00:40:07,311 --> 00:40:09,249
- And they learn a lot faster.
- Exactly.

1156
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,709
- They're really quick.
- That's right.

1157
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,209
And the quality and quantity of information they encounter...

1158
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,219
- are different from our age.
- That's right.

1159
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,249
Aren't I right?

1160
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,749
And they speak so well.

1161
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,190
I'd wonder, "Where did she learn to say that?"

1162
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,359
Do you let her watch YouTube?

1163
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,759
- No, I don't.
- You don't?

1164
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,460
I don't let her watch videos.

1165
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,759
That's really not easy.

1166
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,329
I know. These days,

1167
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,830
- parents would give them phones...
- It's because...

1168
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,230
so they stay quiet.

1169
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,939
- But we set our own rules.
- If possible...

1170
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,409
We decided not to use our phones,

1171
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,840
including me and my husband, during our meals.

1172
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,210
That's our rule.

1173
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,919
The place I looked up is here.

1174
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,080
- Here? Oh, gosh.
- Here.

1175
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,019
- It looks like a good one.
- It looks good.

1176
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,689
- Right?
- They have spicy fish soup too.

1177
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,096
Let's have this. It's been a while since we had it.

1178
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,189
- I haven't had it in a while too.
- It's made of fresh cod.

1179
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,666
I haven't had cod stew for a long time.

1180
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,589
- Hello.
- This place is good, right?

1181
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,706
- Is it a famous local place?
- It obviously looks good.

1182
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,400
She gave a thumbs up.

1183
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,699
Lunchtime is over, so it's good.

1184
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,599
- Hello.
- Welcome. Hello.

1185
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,669
- There are many autographs.
- Oh, my. You're so pretty.

1186
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,169
- There are many patrons. Hello.
- Hello.

1187
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,139
Could we have a meal quietly?

1188
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,240
You can be loud.

1189
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,510
Over there?

1190
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,149
- The intestines.
- This is frozen, and this is fresh.

1191
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,479
- Is it fresh?
- Yes, it's fresh cod.

1192
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,949
- Then we should have it fresh.
- We should have fresh cod.

1193
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,479
We'll have two fresh cod stew...

1194
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,366
- and one braised cod?
- Two fresh cod stew and...

1195
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,590
- One braised cod.
- Okay.

1196
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,920
- By the way, it's quite costly.
- It's expensive.

1197
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,489
- Since it's fresh.
- That's right.

1198
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,589
We're going to make a bet and decide who pays, right?

1199
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,099
- Of course.
- It's quite costly.

1200
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,729
- Are we doing it after we're done?
- Yes, after we're done.

1201
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,600
- The cod...
- Ji Woo isn't so good at games.

1202
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,270
I'm quite good.

1203
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,499
It looks really good.

1204
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,309
- I haven't had cod stew for long.
- Me too.

1205
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,339
I love cod.

1206
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,440
Is that so?

1207
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,939
- Cod stew is good.
- When you're in Busan,

1208
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,809
- Yes, cod stew.
- they have cod stew.

1209
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,049
- Near Dalmajigogae Pass.
- Yes, Dalmajigogae Pass.

1210
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,179
- I know that place. I'm from Busan.
- We...

1211
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,320
We are... Oh, you're right.

1212
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,289
- Ji Woo, you're from Busan, right?
- Yes.

1213
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,889
My parents live in Busan, so I go there often.

1214
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,989
Thank you.

1215
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,059
- Here it is.
- What's that?

1216
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,429
- It must be braised cod.
- Oh, this is braised cod.

1217
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,160
It's not braised cod. It's fresh intestines and cod.

1218
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,599
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1219
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,899
- How do we eat it?
- Thank you.

1220
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,820
- Here you go, Ji Woo.
- Thank you for the food.

1221
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,339
- My gosh, this is...
- It's...

1222
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,739
It's been a while since I had cod guts.

1223
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,280
Seriously. The roe too.

1224
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,209
(Getting busy moving her chopsticks)

1225
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,410
Yes. Gosh.

1226
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,050
Look at that.

1227
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,580
(Gasping)

1228
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,920
- I heard this is rare.
- Yes.

1229
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,450
This is tasty.

1230
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,690
This is cod guts, right?

1231
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,530
It's tasty eating it after a while.

1232
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,500
It's creamy.

1233
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,830
It's tasty.

1234
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,230
(Taking a bite of the cod roe)

1235
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,130
(Gasping)

1236
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,939
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

1237
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,640
It tastes even better after not having it for a while.

1238
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,469
This is my first time having the gut...

1239
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,880
- on its own.
- Mine as well.

1240
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,410
It's creamy like soft tofu.

1241
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,979
It's savory.

1242
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
(Creamy like soft tofu)

1243
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,650
It's so tasty.

1244
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,190
- Our first dish is here.
- The portion is huge.

1245
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,819
(Piled high)

1246
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,920
Gosh, look at that.

1247
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,990
What?

1248
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
I know.

1249
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:11,730
This is too much food.

1250
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,659
- He's serving you.
- Go ahead. I'll take it myself.

1251
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,800
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

1252
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,370
What about you, Yeon Seok?

1253
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,729
- Here you go.
- Try it.

1254
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,769
- It looks like braised monkfish.
- This is enough...

1255
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,240
for several people.

1256
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,470
Thank you.

1257
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,480
(The brow of truth)

1258
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,380
It's tasty.

1259
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,810
It's nice having sea squirts for the first time in a while.

1260
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,690
This is tasty.

1261
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,789
There is cheek meat here.

1262
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,000
(He finds cheek meat.)

1263
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,529
I can take it. Thank you.

1264
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,600
Thank you.

1265
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,940
Thank you.

1266
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,839
- This was a great choice.
- I agree.

1267
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,640
(The clear cod cheek soup looking refreshing)

1268
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,110
This is nice.

1269
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,720
This is extremely good.

1270
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,390
After having the braised cod,

1271
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,930
- this clear soup is perfect.
- It washes away the spiciness.

1272
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,190
I love the broth.

1273
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,370
- The water parsley is delicious.
- It is.

1274
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,850
It's like fighting heat with heat. My body feels nourished.

1275
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,460
- The weather is hot.
- Right.

1276
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,106
You can eat straight from the bowl. I'll just take some.

1277
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,800
It'll get cold if you use a separate bowl.

1278
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,539
There is so much meat.

1279
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,839
I took some. You can have it.

1280
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,940
I took some.

1281
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,280
- You know what?
- What?

1282
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,379
You sometimes sound like you're trying to discipline him.

1283
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,979
What, Jae Suk? You mean me?

1284
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,749
You have an authoritative voice.

1285
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,879
- You didn't realize it, did you?
- No.

1286
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,050
I know where it comes from.

1287
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,210
- Is that how I talk?
- I've raised kids myself.

1288
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,560
You're right.

1289
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,089
- My daughter is...
- That's what I mean.

1290
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,770
- The age that needs discipline?
- There is a certain tone you use.

1291
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,399
I recognize it.

1292
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,229
- You can't raise your voice.
- No.

1293
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,876
- You need to sound authoritative.
- I see.

1294
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,269
She sounds important.

1295
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,230
(Only the experienced recognize the strict tone.)

1296
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,740
It happens to parents.

1297
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,609
I know I shouldn't do it, but I can't seem to help it.

1298
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,639
That's right.

1299
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,240
- It's strange.
- You're right, Jae Suk.

1300
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,650
It drives me crazy.

1301
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,019
- It's necessary at times.
- But I regret it right away.

1302
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,020
Of course.

1303
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:15,880
I wonder why I didn't use a kinder tone.

1304
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,090
Thank you.

1305
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,989
- You can't let your child see that.
- You're right.

1306
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,319
It would be bad for the kid.

1307
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,430
When you have children...

1308
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,259
Gosh, look at this cheek meat.

1309
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,260
Just the two of us were talking.

1310
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:29,176
- He can't relate to it.
- I can't relate to it.

1311
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,899
- You're right.
- I'm not even married.

1312
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,239
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, he wouldn't.

1313
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,339
You probably don't even know how cute kids are.

1314
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,640
- You have to experience it.
- Once you get married...

1315
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,839
and have kids, you'll realize what we meant.

1316
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,179
- I have friends with kids.
- They talk about it, don't they?

1317
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,549
When we have school reunions,

1318
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,479
friends with kids around the same age talk among themselves.

1319
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,080
- You can't relate to it, can you?
- No.

1320
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,489
- I have nothing to say.
- Right.

1321
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,490
- Since you have no interest in it.
- Right.

1322
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,059
This is tasty.

1323
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,060
(They enjoyed their lunch.)

1324
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:57,560
- It's tasty.
- Yes, it is.

1325
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,730
Should we play the number game?

1326
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,030
Yeon Seok asked AI last time. It was interesting.

1327
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,270
- Should we do that?
- What is it?

1328
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,699
Show us.

1329
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,700
(They decide to ask AI for a game recommendation.)

1330
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,910
Hi.

1331
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,040
Hi, it's nice to see you.

1332
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,740
How are you feeling today?

1333
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,279
Is there anything I can help you with?

1334
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,649
We're tight on time.

1335
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,280
We'd like to get straight to the point.

1336
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,979
Okay, got it.

1337
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,689
Tell me when you're ready.

1338
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,589
I'll help you right away.

1339
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,559
We had a delicious lunch at a fresh cod stew restaurant...

1340
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,590
in Yangjae-dong.

1341
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,499
A fresh cod stew restaurant in Yangjae-dong?

1342
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,669
I wonder how the cod stew tasted.

1343
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,700
Join us next time.

1344
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,139
Why don't you join us if you can next time?

1345
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,570
We have to choose one person to pay for the meal.

1346
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,209
I see.

1347
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,609
Why don't you do something fun to decide?

1348
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,550
- Sounds good.
- Why don't we play a number game?

1349
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,119
You can each think of a number...

1350
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,190
between 1 and 100.

1351
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,690
The person...

1352
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,690
with the number furthest...

1353
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,119
from the number I choose...

1354
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,359
will pay for the meal.

1355
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,529
That's a good idea.

1356
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,259
I like your idea.

1357
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,260
Okay.

1358
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,100
Let's start with Jae Suk.

1359
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,330
All right. We'll hear the number Jae Suk chose,

1360
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,170
- then Ji Woo, and Yeon Seok.
- Okay.

1361
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,269
- It even tells us the order.
- This is hard.

1362
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,470
- It's smart.
- This is hard.

1363
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,939
I choose...

1364
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,910
(Starting with Jae Suk, they will choose a number between 1 and 100.)

1365
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,450
I'll go with 48.

1366
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,849
- Choose a number.
- I choose 65.

1367
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,349
(Ji Woo: 65, Jae Suk: 48)

1368
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,090
Then I'll choose a smaller number.

1369
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,420
I choose 28.

1370
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,360
Then let's see who has the number furthest from mine.

1371
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,500
Can you give us a drum roll?

1372
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,829
All right.

1373
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,600
I'll do it to add tension.

1374
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,269
Drum roll.

1375
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,969
Here is the result.

1376
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,639
- It's impressive.
- Right?

1377
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,009
The number I chose...

1378
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,670
(Time to announce the result)

1379
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,610
(The person with the number furthest from the AI's number pays.)

1380
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,320
The number I chose was 50.

1381
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,849
Jae Suk, who chose 48, is 2 numbers away from mine.

1382
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,730
The difference between Ji Woo's and mine is 15.

1383
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,559
And the difference between Yeon Seok's and mine is 22.

1384
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,260
Yeon Seok chose the number furthest from mine.

1385
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,870
You're paying again.

1386
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,669
You could've chosen a number closer to mine.

1387
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,040
I'm the one paying monthly to use you.

1388
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,869
You're right.

1389
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,339
- Anyway, using a fun game to...
- What do you mean "anyway?"

1390
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,509
(What do you mean "anyway?")

1391
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,679
- She's good at this.
- She's good.

1392
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,849
She won't give me a break.

1393
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,120
- She's good.
- Thank you.

1394
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,419
Thank you.

1395
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,449
That was a good meal.

1396
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,789
Thank you, Yeon Seok.

1397
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,889
I enjoyed the meal too.

1398
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,990
I'm not sure if it's okay to let you pay every week.

1399
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,990
I haven't been on your show for a long time.

1400
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,590
I even brought my credit card.

1401
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,260
If you feel disappointed,

1402
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,469
would you like me to use your credit card?

1403
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,799
No, it's okay.

1404
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,500
We should be fair.

1405
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,740
Thank you.

1406
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,770
- That was a great meal.
- Thank you.

1407
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,569
- Thanks for lunch, Yeon Seok.
- Thank you.

1408
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,909
Food tastes better when someone else is paying, right?

1409
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,550
That goes without saying.

1410
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,980
The best meals are ones paid by other people...

1411
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,149
- Eating off other people's plates.
- or cooked by other people.

1412
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,579
- You're right.
- Those are the best meals.

1413
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,589
- Gosh.
- Yes.

1414
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,460
My AI got me today.

1415
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,359
The AI is impressive.

1416
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,430
Yes, it's impressive.

1417
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,189
Should we go to a cafe...

1418
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,070
- for 30 minutes before leaving?
- Sounds good.

1419
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,959
- Is this the right place?
- Why?

1420
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,399
If we go this way...

1421
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,099
and make a left, we'll find the bus stop.

1422
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,670
We'll go wherever you tell us to since you paid for lunch.

1423
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,540
Let's go.

1424
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,510
Let's go wherever you want.

1425
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,210
This cafe looks nice.

1426
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,809
- I'm so full.
- I'll buy the drinks.

1427
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,779
- Okay.
- Buy the drinks, Ji Woo.

1428
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,480
You should learn how to say no, Jae Suk.

1429
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,450
Buy us drinks, Ji Woo.

1430
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,719
I'll let Ji Woo buy us drinks since she offered to.

1431
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,920
I'd also like an egg tart.

1432
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,690
- Since I brought my credit card.
- Hello.

1433
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,829
I'll have a mixed grain shake.

1434
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,000
Can we have a mixed grain shake and...

1435
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,669
I'll have a tiramisu and iced Americano.

1436
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:01,739
(1 iced Americano, 1 tiramisu, 1 mixed grain shake)

1437
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,616
I'll have an iced Americano with an acidic flavor.

1438
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,439
Princess Ji Woo is buying for a change.

1439
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,010
- I can buy this much.
- She's paying.

1440
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,239
Princess Ji Woo.

1441
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,539
Ji Woo, you're awesome.

1442
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,280
(Princess Ji Woo pays coolly.)

1443
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,480
The drinks are here, Ji Woo.

1444
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,389
What is yours, Jae Suk? Mixed grain drink?

1445
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,490
Yes, a mixed grain shake.

1446
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,660
It makes me feel nostalgic.

1447
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,889
(He brings Yeon Seok's tiramisu.)

1448
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,730
He orders several things wherever he goes.

1449
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,669
He loves food.

1450
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,369
- And isn't he meticulous?
- Yes, he is.

1451
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,899
He's a perfectionist.

1452
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,000
Is he?

1453
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,139
Didn't you sense that? Am I wrong?

1454
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,679
He makes too many mistakes to be a perfectionist.

1455
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,780
Really? He's very meticulous.

1456
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,250
Yeon Seok is meticulous.

1457
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,750
He has type A blood, right?

1458
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,250
- I believe he does.
- Wait a second.

1459
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,660
Wait a second, Princess Ji Woo.

1460
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,390
What is Ahn... No.

1461
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,360
What is Yoo Yeon Seok's blood type?

1462
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,829
Could you please provide more context...

1463
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,060
Don't speak English.

1464
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,430
What is Yoo Yeon Seok's blood type?

1465
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,870
Actor Yoo Yeon Seok's blood type is A.

1466
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,070
Thank you.

1467
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,340
- It's A.
- That's how I remember it.

1468
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,310
- What?
- Ji Woo said you're meticulous.

1469
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,509
- I see.
- Yes.

1470
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,139
- I am meticulous.
- And you aim for perfection.

1471
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,339
He aims for it...

1472
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,049
- but makes mistakes.
- Yes, I do.

1473
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,656
You aim for it but aren't a perfectionist?

1474
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,280
That's why he's comfortable to be around.

1475
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,690
I'll put it that way.

1476
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,750
Thank you for the dessert, Ji Woo.

1477
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:27,990
Thank you, Ji Woo.

1478
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,929
Thank you.

1479
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,829
She even treated the production crew.

1480
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,059
(She even paid for the production crew's drinks.)

1481
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,259
- That's right.
- Yes.

1482
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,030
"That's right?"

1483
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,269
This is Princess Ji Woo.

1484
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,670
Ji Woo is an amazing person.

1485
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,470
Didn't I tell you?

1486
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,269
- Her event was broadcast live.
- That's right.

1487
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,739
No one imagined something like that back then.

1488
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,149
She created the foundation...

1489
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,249
- for K-dramas nowadays...
- That's right.

1490
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,479
To become popular...

1491
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,180
- Of course.
- in other countries.

1492
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,889
- I wonder how it must've felt.
- Come on.

1493
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,759
Actually, in China,

1494
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,459
Jang Na Ra and Ahn Jae Wook became known first.

1495
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,659
I was popular in Japan.

1496
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,229
- In Japan.
- You're sure about Japan.

1497
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,530
- Yes, I am.
- Your popularity was unbelievable.

1498
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,099
("Winter Sonata," the start of the Hallyu craze)

1499
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,109
Ji Woo is the person that started the Hallyu craze.

1500
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,839
("Winter Sonata" generates whopping economic effect of 2.4 million)

1501
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,440
They aired her arrival in Japan live.

1502
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,250
Her arrival was aired live.

1503
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,680
(Prime minister Junichiro Koizumi)

1504
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,320
(She was even invited to the prime minister's office.)

1505
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,890
(She was 28 years old at the time.)

1506
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,729
(Princess Ji Woo was popular throughout the whole of Japan.)

1507
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,129
She's Princess Ji Woo.

1508
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,470
She was unbelievable.

1509
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,139
When you aren't spending time with your daughter,

1510
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,769
what do you do in your personal time?

1511
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,309
Is there anything you specifically do?

1512
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,380
No, there isn't.

1513
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,179
Then what do you do at home?

1514
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,580
I'm so busy.

1515
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,949
- There's so much to do.
- I'm busy.

1516
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:02,379
You don't even remember how you spent your day...

1517
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,919
- when you're with your children.
- Since you have your daughter.

1518
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,689
- I'm sure.
- She's at kindergarten right now.

1519
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,219
But when she comes home, I stay with her...

1520
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,190
- unless I have work.
- I see.

1521
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,190
I do a couple things while she's gone, and then she's home.

1522
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,859
(All parents can probably relate.)

1523
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,599
- She's home before you know it?
- Yes.

1524
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,969
It's time for them to come home not long after they left.

1525
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,000
You're right.

1526
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,139
The relationship with other mothers...

1527
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,670
- is also important.
- I see.

1528
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,270
I have to meet them.

1529
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,509
I have to get to know them...

1530
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,710
for the children to hang out and go somewhere together.

1531
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,709
You also exchange parenting tips?

1532
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,990
I just run around endlessly.

1533
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,290
You do?

1534
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,319
I had her at a late age. I have no other choice.

1535
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,589
It's very tiring,

1536
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,929
- but I do my best.
- Of course.

1537
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,200
Ji Woo.

1538
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,329
She does her best.

1539
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,100
The other mothers must be younger than you.

1540
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,569
They're not just younger than I am.

1541
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,439
Some are 20 years younger.

1542
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,739
- They are?
- Yes.

1543
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,279
There are several moms that were born in the 1990s.

1544
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,809
That's right, since your daughter is five years old.

1545
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,379
I just follow them around.

1546
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,619
If they ask me if I'd like to join them,

1547
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,379
I say, "Yes, of course."

1548
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,120
I thank them and follow them around.

1549
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,789
You follow them around?

1550
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:14,459
Yes, I do my best to follow them around.

1551
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,259
You're doing a good job.

1552
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,630
- What else can I do?
- Of course.

1553
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:21,029
Since I got married at a late age,

1554
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,529
I don't feel like...

1555
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,639
I need some time for myself...

1556
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,399
while raising my child.

1557
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,770
Of course, since you...

1558
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,309
- got to do everything.
- No, I didn't.

1559
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,939
- You did pretty much everything.
- That isn't true, Yeon Seok.

1560
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,549
I wasn't in many movies.

1561
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,779
I didn't do that many things, come to think of it.

1562
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,520
Although I wanted to.

1563
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,449
But I just go with the flow of life.

1564
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,360
- I feel much more comfortable.
- I see.

1565
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,989
I need to use the restroom.

1566
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,390
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

1567
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,699
- Wait a minute.
- Yes?

1568
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,629
I'm not going home.

1569
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,529
I just said that since you were leaving for the restroom.

1570
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,699
- We should leave when you come.
- Is that what you meant?

1571
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,339
When I stood up,

1572
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,509
- she coolly said, "Bye."
- No, I didn't.

1573
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,780
- Jae Suk.
- I'll be back.

1574
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,739
- Bye.
- Bye.

1575
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,479
- We should've tried the egg tart.
- I know.

1576
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,549
- It smells so good.
- Too bad.

1577
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,049
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1578
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,320
(Current time, 2:48pm)

1579
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,549
- Yeon Seok called a taxi.
- That's it.

1580
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,819
Good job, Yeon Seok.

1581
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,020
Thank you, driver.

1582
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,190
We're traveling comfortably thanks to Yeon Seok.

1583
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,560
(Staring at the name cards)

1584
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,000
- There are so many name cards.
- Yes.

1585
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,830
Do you just choose any one?

1586
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,569
- What do you mean?
- That's not how it works, right?

1587
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,499
You already chose the guest for today, right?

1588
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,840
The rest...

1589
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:40,309
are from previous episodes.

1590
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,979
These are the guests we already visited.

1591
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,480
Why are you whispering?

1592
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,479
Why are you talking so quietly, Ji Woo?

1593
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,250
I was worried I'd make a mistake.

1594
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,920
I'm timid.

1595
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,159
I must've been out of it when we were playing the game.

1596
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,559
- I totally understand.
- I felt so rushed.

1597
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,429
- It's totally understandable.
- You...

1598
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,999
and Yeon Seok...

1599
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,630
said Mr. Seol Kyung Gu...

1600
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,969
- or Actor Lee Byung Hun.
- It's okay.

1601
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,040
I just blurted out the names.

1602
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,440
Did you get it wrong worrying about how to address them?

1603
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,269
- No, I didn't.
- No, she didn't.

1604
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,909
No, I didn't,

1605
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,409
but it kept bothering me.

1606
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,770
(I'm saying it kept bothering me.)

1607
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,180
You can drop us off in front of the school.

1608
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,050
- We're here.
- Is this it?

1609
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,290
- Kang Soo Jin.
- Soo Jin?

1610
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,929
"For my young and innocent students,"

1611
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,530
"I learn about characters from all over the world,"

1612
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,759
"including SpongeBob, Minions, and Shin-chan."

1613
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,370
"I am a new teacher."

1614
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:38,499
- I see.
- I see.

1615
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,730
Young and innocent students.

1616
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,960
"This week, I'm looking to bring in 'Tom and Jerry, '"

1617
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,439
- "'Totoro' and..."
- "My Neighbor Totoro?"

1618
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,509
Yes. "'Totoro' and 'Tom and Jerry.'"

1619
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,879
"Today, I'd like to invite..."

1620
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,400
"the Whenever Possible team for myself, who needs to recharge."

1621
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,620
Is the teacher asking us to become those characters?

1622
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,989
The animations...

1623
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,449
are for lower elementary school students.

1624
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,289
- We go in this way.
- This way?

1625
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:03,160
- It's either a kindergarten or...
- Goodness.

1626
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,130
- We're here to meet a teacher.
- Hello.

1627
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,459
- This is Yangjae Elementary School.
- I see.

1628
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,029
- The main building, 2nd floor.
- The 2nd floor?

1629
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,199
- Yes.
- To get to the second floor,

1630
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,630
- should we go this way?
- Yes.

1631
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,670
Thank you.

1632
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,999
We were right. When I heard about the animations, I thought...

1633
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,916
- it'd be an elementary school.
- You were right.

1634
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,379
We're at another elementary school.

1635
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,510
An elementary school.

1636
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,750
- It was Class 6-2.
- Yes.

1637
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,810
Then it must be class 2 of the 6th grade.

1638
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,920
- You think so?
- Look at the students' drawings.

1639
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,719
By the elementary school students.

1640
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,820
(Yangjae Dreams)

1641
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,490
I just hope there aren't any kids.

1642
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,789
- I get nervous in front of them.
- It's a lot of pressure.

1643
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,929
Children make me nervous.

1644
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,630
I hope there are only teachers.

1645
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,500
It's time for the students to go home.

1646
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,799
(Meanwhile...)

1647
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,070
(Looking around)

1648
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,380
(Gasping)

1649
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,549
Since your daughter will soon...

1650
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,209
- start school.
- Yes.

1651
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,519
- In two years.
- Take a look around.

1652
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,579
(She looks around as a soon-to-be-school-parent.)

1653
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,449
There are quite a lot of students in each class.

1654
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,189
Let's see. There are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16...

1655
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,560
Is it the next classroom?

1656
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,930
- Jerry.
- I see "Tom and Jerry."

1657
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:13,390
("Tom and Jerry?")

1658
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,930
Her name is Kang Soo Jin, right?

1659
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,469
Ms. Kang?

1660
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:18,629
Yes, hello.

1661
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,670
- Are you Soo Jin?
- Yes, that's right.

1662
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:24,810
(Second Whenever Guest, Kang Soo Jin)

1663
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,369
It's nice to meet you. Goodness.

1664
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,639
Tom and Jerry are here too.

1665
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,809
(The second Whenever Guest is an elementary school teacher.)

1666
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:29,839
Come in, Ji Woo.

1667
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,779
- Hi.
- Hi.

1668
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,779
Have all the students gone home?

1669
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,550
Yes, they just left.

1670
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,720
That's a relief.

1671
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,389
- On our way here, - Yes?

1672
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,789
We felt a lot of pressure.

1673
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,919
We were worried that if we failed...

1674
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,689
- in front of the kids, - I see.

1675
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,159
- just in case, - Right.

1676
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,259
- we'd feel so bad.
- I see.

1677
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,629
Luckily, it's just me.

1678
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,969
Why are there cartoon characters here?

1679
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,239
Why is Tom and Jerry here?

1680
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,269
I write a poem...

1681
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,169
and draw something new...

1682
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,879
once a week for the students.

1683
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,409
- I see.
- Did you draw this?

1684
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:06,050
- Yes, I drew it myself.
- What?

1685
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,350
- How did you draw that?
- You actually drew that?

1686
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,519
- Yes.
- You didn't trace it?

1687
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,589
No.

1688
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,189
Did you write the poem as well?

1689
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,190
Yes.

1690
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,330
- You're talented.
- You're so talented.

1691
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,400
Now,

1692
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,099
they don't use chalkboards.

1693
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,469
- Wait, it's a touch screen.
- Yes, it is.

1694
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,169
- Really?
- It's a touch screen.

1695
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,569
- You can zoom in and out.
- Look at this.

1696
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,600
- Goodness.
- This is amazing.

1697
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,269
- You can write on this?
- We used to write...

1698
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,840
with chalk on the board.

1699
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,140
- There are other screens too.
- What else?

1700
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,609
- Snoopy.
- Yes, we have Snoopy.

1701
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,879
Charlie Brown.

1702
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,119
- Yes, and Minions.
- You also drew Minions.

1703
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,319
- You also have Minions.
- Gosh.

1704
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,150
- It's Shin-chan.
- We have Shin-chan.

1705
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,449
- And Olaf.
- Olaf...

1706
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,920
- Gosh.
- from "Frozen."

1707
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,959
- And this.
- Gosh.

1708
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,059
(Whenever Possible)

1709
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,959
- She drew this.
- Yes, I did.

1710
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,160
- It looks like you.
- This looks exactly like Jae Suk.

1711
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,899
Are you an art major?

1712
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,599
No, I never took art classes.

1713
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,969
Then how are you so good at drawing?

1714
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:03,669
- It's a hobby of mine.
- But it's so...

1715
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,009
It's actually...

1716
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,609
- difficult to draw me.
- It's difficult.

1717
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,979
I don't have distinct features like you do.

1718
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,109
The mouth is protruding.

1719
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:17,050
She drew my teeth straighter than they are.

1720
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,989
She drew them straighter than they are.

1721
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,990
(Jae Suk loves it.)

1722
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,119
- You drew us so well.
- Gosh, look at this.

1723
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,559
Are you a sixth grade homeroom teacher?

1724
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,030
Yes, I am.

1725
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,699
How long have you been...

1726
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,769
an elementary school teacher?

1727
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,629
It's been slightly over two years.

1728
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,739
- Two years?
- Yes.

1729
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,869
What was it like being a teacher...

1730
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,139
for the past two years?

1731
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,939
Something new...

1732
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,010
- happens every single day.
- Really?

1733
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,079
But it fits my aptitude.

1734
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,909
- That's a relief.
- Yes, so I enjoy it.

1735
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,949
Was it your dream to become a teacher when you were little?

1736
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,019
Yes, since I was in elementary school.

1737
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,049
- I've always wanted...
- Gosh.

1738
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,119
To become an elementary school teacher.

1739
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,489
This is impressive.

1740
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,889
All my school records show...

1741
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,650
- that I wanted to become a teacher.
- Gosh.

1742
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,430
Is there a reason?

1743
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,099
First of all, I believe...

1744
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,669
the person around you when you are...

1745
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,239
- in elementary school...
- That's right.

1746
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,679
Affect how you grow up.

1747
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,739
I've always thought it was an important...

1748
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,480
- and valuable job.
- Soo Jin.

1749
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,849
The teachers I remember the most...

1750
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:22,249
- are from elementary school.
- That's right.

1751
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,379
What about you, Ji Woo?

1752
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,019
I remember my teachers from elementary school very well.

1753
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,359
- When I was in plays, - Right.

1754
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,830
- they encouraged me a lot.
- That's right.

1755
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,590
- I did many things at that age.
- I see.

1756
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,260
I was the school president...

1757
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,899
when I was in sixth grade.

1758
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,469
- That's impressive.
- I remember...

1759
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,170
- the election.
- How was he president?

1760
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,940
What do you mean by that?

1761
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,470
The producer looks quite surprised as well.

1762
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,439
You were the school president?

1763
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,609
I was a good student.

1764
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:50,879
It isn't easy to become school president.

1765
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,679
- That's right.
- You have to run for it.

1766
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,479
- Yes, I ran for school president.
- School president?

1767
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,550
I worked hard to prepare for my speech.

1768
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,889
I tore apart one of my indoor shoes.

1769
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,390
I held one new shoe in the other hand.

1770
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,829
I said that I'd work hard for the students...

1771
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,330
until the new shoe looked like the one torn apart.

1772
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,729
You still remember that?

1773
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,129
- Yes, I still remember it.
- Of course.

1774
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,999
You had exceptional public speaking skills.

1775
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,216
- That's impressive.
- Yes, it is.

1776
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,809
Do you still elect school presidents?

1777
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,239
- Yes, we do.
- At all schools?

1778
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,709
We do it online nowadays.

1779
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,179
You click on the number of the person you're voting for...

1780
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,309
and click "check."

1781
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,179
- That's amazing.
- The result comes out instantly.

1782
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,349
My goodness.

1783
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:27,550
- Gosh.
- It got a lot better.

1784
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,150
Even this desk is...

1785
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,350
- It's an acrylic desk.
- You can write something on...

1786
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,389
with a marker, right?

1787
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:35,190
Right. Kids can write with a marker and erase it.

1788
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,359
They can also use box cutters on it too.

1789
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,729
- They can cut things.
- It doesn't get scratched easily.

1790
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,706
- It wasn't this good in the past.
- It changed a lot.

1791
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,330
You have air conditioners now.

1792
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,539
We had air conditioners back then too.

1793
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:48,569
- When?
- We didn't have them.

1794
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,016
- We didn't have them either.
- Is that so?

1795
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,640
Only things we could have were the fans.

1796
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,569
Gosh. Now, they have air conditioners.

1797
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,609
Was it less hot in the past?

1798
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,939
- I think it was less hot.
- I think it was less hot back then.

1799
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,509
- There was a cool breeze.
- I don't remember it well though.

1800
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:59,679
- That's what I remember.
- Right.

1801
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,180
- I think I could manage with a fan.
- Right.

1802
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,119
Ms. Kang was listening to us, and it seemed like she was thinking,

1803
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,320
"What are they talking about?"

1804
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,260
"How long ago are they talking about?"

1805
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,190
- That was so...
- I'm glad we have Ji Woo today.

1806
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,429
- She agrees with me.
- Right.

1807
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,900
- Thanks, Ji Woo. I'm so grateful.
- Right.

1808
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,829
What's the toughest thing when working as a teacher?

1809
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,199
Well, since they are kids,

1810
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,239
they are so loud. Their voices are so big.

1811
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,279
- Of course.
- They're full of energy.

1812
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,309
Right.

1813
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:30,879
- When you wear an electronic watch, - Yes?

1814
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,209
If it's louder than 90dB,

1815
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,850
it warns you saying, "It might harm your hearing."

1816
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:38,919
- And that warning...
- The warning keeps coming up?

1817
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,990
It comes up every day.

1818
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,360
Several times a day.

1819
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,159
If it's over 90dB, isn't it as loud as...

1820
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,836
- a construction site?
- That's really loud.

1821
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,229
I'm sure it's louder than a construction site...

1822
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,560
- Right.
- if it's over 90dB.

1823
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,059
- Goodness.
- They don't stay still.

1824
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,230
- No, they don't.
- They move around all the time.

1825
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,599
- Right.
- I think you never stayed still.

1826
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,670
- Well, I never stayed still.
- I knew it.

1827
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,670
Back then, I spun my bag like this.

1828
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:04,509
If I think about it, I wonder why someone would do that.

1829
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,949
- You mean your shoe pouch?
- Yes, my shoe pouch.

1830
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,579
We used to carry it back then.

1831
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,020
I would spin it like this.

1832
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,349
Even when the students go home,

1833
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,159
there are things for you to do, right?

1834
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,729
Yes. When they go home, I check their homework...

1835
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,929
and do assessments of them,

1836
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,659
- That's what I do.
- There's so much to do.

1837
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,429
I think making assessments...

1838
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,199
- would be really difficult.
- It's difficult.

1839
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,570
But the teachers these days write good things.

1840
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,939
In the past, the teachers...

1841
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,339
- would say things directly.
- Right.

1842
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,909
This is the comment that I got the most.

1843
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,979
"He is in good terms with friends, but he is distracted."

1844
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,980
That's the same as me.

1845
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:38,579
"Please guide him at home..."

1846
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,950
"during the vacation." This is what they wrote about me.

1847
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,649
Ji Woo, what were the comments you got the most?

1848
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,749
"She is in good terms with friends and is lively,"

1849
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,489
"but she's distracted and..."

1850
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,489
Ji Woo, you got those comments as well?

1851
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,589
(It's a comment that many students got back then.)

1852
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,159
But they don't do it that way these days.

1853
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,689
How do you...

1854
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,759
- write comments these days?
- They write good things about them.

1855
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,799
They write good things about the students.

1856
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,369
I try to write about the good qualities...

1857
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,970
- the student has.
- Of course.

1858
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,599
Then, in the way you write these days,

1859
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,270
how would you express that we are quite distracted students?

1860
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,940
"He is energetic..."

1861
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,709
- "He is full of energy."
- "He is energetic..."

1862
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,710
"and is interested in many different fields."

1863
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,779
- "Distracted" is changed to that?
- Yes.

1864
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,680
- "Interested in many fields?"
- Right.

1865
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,289
- That's right.
- That's so nice.

1866
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,549
- It's a nice expression.
- It sounds so different.

1867
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,550
There's such a nice way to put it,

1868
01:05:19,551 --> 01:05:20,796
but why did they write that in the past?

1869
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,790
Because of that, I went to learn calligraphy.

1870
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,929
To calm down?

1871
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,729
Back then, if it says you're distracted,

1872
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,429
- you go to the calligraphy academy.
- Right.

1873
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:29,959
- A go club.
- Yes.

1874
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,670
- Abacus calculation academy.
- I went to that academy.

1875
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,539
There were so many things like this.

1876
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,469
(These old elementary school students feel unfair.)

1877
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:41,079
Ms. Kang, let's say your students are distracted by something.

1878
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,909
Is there a way to get their attention?

1879
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,180
- She needs that.
- Do you have a know-how for this?

1880
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,079
Usually, I make them chant along to get their attention.

1881
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,749
- Make them chant along?
- How do you do it these days?

1882
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,889
I would say, "Clap three times." It goes like this. "Focus."

1883
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,619
- This is how it goes.
- "Focus."

1884
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,219
You clap only 3 times. You don't say anything for 1.

1885
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,630
That's better to make them focus.

1886
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,660
Let's say we clap for four times.

1887
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,499
"Focus." It goes like this.

1888
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,199
- You do it like that.
- I say it only for the last two.

1889
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,520
- So they can chant along?
- Yes.

1890
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:07,940
If it's three times...

1891
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,839
- "Focus." You do it like this.
- Yes.

1892
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,400
- This isn't easy.
- You missed a beat.

1893
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:13,210
- You missed a beat.
- "Focus."

1894
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,780
Clap five times and say, "Focus."

1895
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,649
"Focus." Like this?

1896
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:18,749
- You...
- That was...

1897
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,849
You started a beat faster.

1898
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,330
- You started a beat faster.
- Did I?

1899
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,319
First, Ji Woo...

1900
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,019
- will roll the dice once again.
- Gosh, no.

1901
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,649
- Roll it one more time.
- Should I?

1902
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,319
It would be so nice...

1903
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,959
- if she could participate in this.
- Right.

1904
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,960
- Good.
- All right.

1905
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:37,260
(The numbers are from 0 to 2. What will it be this time?)

1906
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,070
(They got 1 coupon.)

1907
01:06:39,071 --> 01:06:40,369
- It's one.
- One.

1908
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,570
- What a relief.
- Give us a coupon.

1909
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:45,270
This is the prize for the first round.

1910
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,069
"With the beautiful students of my class,"

1911
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,509
"I'd like to make good memories before graduation."

1912
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,880
"A Polaroid and 100 sheets of film."

1913
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,620
- Gosh. That's nice.
- My goodness. I love it.

1914
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,389
- This is a nice one.
- It's a camera.

1915
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,419
I use that camera too. That's a good one.

1916
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,519
- It's a good one.
- Yes.

1917
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,520
("I want to make good memories." A Polaroid and 100 sheets of film)

1918
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:02,789
You get really nice photos with it.

1919
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:03,859
The camera is one thing, but you must have many films too.

1920
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,029
- They are expensive.
- You use them so fast.

1921
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,429
The films for the Polaroid are expensive.

1922
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,259
(The School Bell Rings)

1923
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:13,499
(Bounce a ping pong ball on the desk and ring the bell.)

1924
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,670
(They are given 5 ping pong balls.)

1925
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,190
- With a ping pong ball?
- Still,

1926
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,146
- We need to ring the bell?
- this is better.

1927
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,810
- We're used to ping pong balls.
- We're familiar with this ball.

1928
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,040
- What?
- We're familiar with it.

1929
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,856
- Jae Suk, we must ring that bell?
- This bell?

1930
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,879
- Can you even ring it with a ball?
- My goodness.

1931
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,719
- Unbelievable.
- I am...

1932
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,019
Don't you think this is too difficult?

1933
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,389
- Is it okay to hit the side?
- It shouldn't hit the side.

1934
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:34,759
It must hit the button and ring the bell.

1935
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,760
I don't think we can do this.

1936
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,161
- It must hit here?
- That's right.

1937
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,130
The ball must press the button.

1938
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,099
- This is hard.
- It looks difficult.

1939
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
It's difficult.

1940
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,229
Ji Woo. Try it.

1941
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,230
(They start practicing.)

1942
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,270
- It should go forward at least.
- You need to push the ball.

1943
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,070
- The ball should go forward?
- You need to send it forward.

1944
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,410
- Right.
- That's right.

1945
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,330
- I don't think we can do this.
- The difficulty level is high.

1946
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,410
I can make it head forward, but...

1947
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,280
Gosh, this isn't right.

1948
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,579
This is out because it didn't hit the button accurately.

1949
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,919
- But this is...
- It didn't hit it accurately?

1950
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,550
How we get the dopamine.

1951
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,220
What a shame. That was so close.

1952
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,529
(What?)

1953
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,560
- That spot is...
- We might be able to do it.

1954
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,469
For you, bouncing the ball one time seems better.

1955
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,599
- Hit it about here.
- That is...

1956
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,246
- From your position, about here.
- There?

1957
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,630
- Should I do it like this?
- Yes.

1958
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,380
(Princess Ji Woo succeeded.)

1959
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,449
(She expresses joy with all of her body.)

1960
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,050
We got this, Ji Woo.

1961
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,650
We got it, Ji Woo.

1962
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,349
- Two, three. Like that?
- Right there.

1963
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,519
Then it should hit here.

1964
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,096
- One, two, three.
- It will ring the bell.

1965
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,689
- You almost got it.
- I almost got it.

1966
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,606
- Jae Suk, you should...
- I'm getting the hang of it now.

1967
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,699
- Let's give it a go.
- Let's do it.

1968
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,799
How about 1, 2, and 2?

1969
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,029
- Okay.
- No. I want to try one.

1970
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,969
- Let's do 1, 2, and 2.
- Gosh, I'm not sure I can do this.

1971
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,700
All right. Let's say, "Here we go."

1972
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:54,939
In 1, 2, 3.

1973
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,039
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1974
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,716
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

1975
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,569
- This is our first try.
- Okay.

1976
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:00,669
(Balls remaining)

1977
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:01,740
There could be a miracle.

1978
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,480
(There was no miracle.)

1979
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,349
- Right away? Next time?
- I'm not sure about this.

1980
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,520
(He has 1 remaining ball.)

1981
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:13,989
I'm not sure about this.

1982
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,990
(It's Ji Woo's turn.)

1983
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,430
In a row?

1984
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,129
I'll just do it in a row.

1985
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,840
(Balls remaining)

1986
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,810
I'm sorry.

1987
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,749
(Balls remaining)

1988
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,810
You get a lot nervous when the game starts.

1989
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,319
Goodness. It's okay.

1990
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,449
I thought I would become cross-eyed.

1991
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,789
- Now, Yeon Seok. Let's go.
- Okay.

1992
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,989
- You can do it. Go for it.
- We never know. We might succeed.

1993
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,129
- I'm good with ping pong balls.
- Sure, you are. You can do it.

1994
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,459
- When it comes to a ping pong ball, - I think I can do this.

1995
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,230
It's one of our strong suits.

1996
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,269
- My goodness.
- That was so close.

1997
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:06,909
(Balls remaining)

1998
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,509
Where was it? Here?

1999
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,879
(Balls remaining)

2000
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,680
- Think of it as a practice.
- Okay. I will.

2001
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:15,919
(He hopelessly failed.)

2002
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,400
You really thought it was a practice.

2003
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,450
We failed? We're done?

2004
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,760
- You failed your 1st try.
- I see. It was the 1st try.

2005
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,730
Where was it? Where did I hit it?

2006
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,729
Once or twice, Jae Suk?

2007
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:30,459
- Right there.
- Try to hit over here.

2008
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,870
I'll try a little below.

2009
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,399
(He hit the mark as he intended.)

2010
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,509
- It was right here.
- What? You did it, Jae Suk.

2011
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,786
- He's great when he's practicing.
- Was that a practice?

2012
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,210
- It was a practice.
- Gosh.

2013
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,449
- This one was a success, right?
- You hit over here just now.

2014
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,810
- Right there?
- Okay, over there.

2015
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:49,156
- I think I got the hang of it.
- A little higher than that?

2016
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,449
- How about this?
- It worked.

2017
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,949
(A great success rate as he succeeded 3 times in a row)

2018
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:54,719
- No more practice. Just do it now.
- Right. Go ahead.

2019
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Let's go for it.

2020
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,459
- Okay. In 1, 2, 3.
- Right away.

2021
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,489
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2022
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,529
- You do two balls.
- Right. You can do it in a row.

2023
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,830
Where was the spot? Over here?

2024
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,129
- Over here, Jae Suk.
- Over here.

2025
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,229
Right. It was over there. I got it.

2026
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:07,129
(The target spot)

2027
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,439
(Balls remaining)

2028
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,070
(He hit the spot precisely.)

2029
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,779
- The wrong direction.
- One.

2030
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,039
A little more confidently.

2031
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,479
(Balls remaining)

2032
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,610
I bounced it too hard.

2033
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,519
Do you want to try one more?

2034
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,549
(Balls remaining)

2035
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,049
(He feels tempted.)

2036
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:26,450
When you're getting the hang of it.

2037
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:28,820
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

2038
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,960
(Snorting)

2039
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:34,230
(She handed 1 ball when he gave up.)

2040
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,170
- Please help us.
- Right here.

2041
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,269
- Bounce.
- Gosh.

2042
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,439
(It was so close, but he failed.)

2043
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,769
(Balls remaining)

2044
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,370
Ji Woo. No pressure. You can do it.

2045
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,310
You already succeeded once.

2046
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,940
(Trembling)

2047
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,249
- You can do it.
- Take it easy.

2048
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,780
(She can't help feeling nervous.)

2049
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,820
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2050
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,519
(Balls remaining)

2051
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,920
There might be a miracle.

2052
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,930
Go for it.

2053
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,430
- Right here.
- We never know. He can make it.

2054
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,400
Please do it once.

2055
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:14,100
I think he can do it.

2056
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:17,810
I missed it.

2057
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,310
What a shame.

2058
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,840
(Sighing)

2059
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,950
Like this. I'll do it a bit stronger this time.

2060
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,779
Gosh, this is difficult.

2061
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:27,819
(They start practicing again.)

2062
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:28,879
(But the success rate goes down as they practice.)

2063
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,319
Why is it not going in the right direction?

2064
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,849
(But the success rate goes down as they practice.)

2065
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,920
Bounce.

2066
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,150
Gosh, the difficulty level for this one is...

2067
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:37,120
- This is...
- It's extremely difficult.

2068
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38,689
This is difficult.

2069
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,359
(This reminds him of something.)

2070
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,730
We must break the jinx of elementary schools.

2071
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,100
(Few weeks ago, at Dochang Elementary School in Cheorwon)

2072
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,069
(Everyone encouraged and supported them.)

2073
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,310
(But...)

2074
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,210
(They failed in the end.)

2075
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,010
(That was the beginning of the jinx of elementary schools.)

2076
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,379
(And here, today...)

2077
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,449
- It's more difficult...
- Doing it is already difficult.

2078
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:03,479
- than I thought.
- It's difficult, right?

2079
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,019
- Yes.
- It's extremely difficult.

2080
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,119
(It feels ominous here at Yangjae Elementary School too.)

2081
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,219
All right. Our third try.

2082
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,319
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2083
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,690
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

2084
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,160
(They failed their third try.)

2085
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,199
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

2086
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,160
(They failed their fourth try as well.)

2087
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,969
- Just go with the flow.
- Right.

2088
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,899
(Bonus Coupon Round)

2089
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,939
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2090
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,100
The bell rang!

2091
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,339
(They keep on trying.)

2092
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,210
We're in a slump in the games these days.

2093
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:30,880
(Goodness)

2094
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,649
- Our seventh try.
- In one, two, three.

2095
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,679
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2096
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,879
(They reached their 7th try.)

2097
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,919
- It was a bit strong.
- Goodness.

2098
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,520
(And they failed their 7th try as well.)

2099
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,690
Gosh, this is so hard.

2100
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,689
This is traumatic.

2101
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:47,060
We need to break the jinx of elementary schools.

2102
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,899
(They only have three tries left.)

2103
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,200
I'll use my long reach.

2104
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:51,999
I'll be sneaky.

2105
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,200
- Will it work?
- Sure. We just need to succeed.

2106
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,640
- Gosh.
- That was good.

2107
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,009
- Okay.
- If you succeed,

2108
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,180
just go for it right away.

2109
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,479
- You got this.
- Do it now.

2110
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,749
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2111
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,219
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2112
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,850
- Here we go. I'll do three.
- Okay.

2113
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,749
- I'll do 2.
- Go for 3.

2114
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,120
Okay. Here I go.

2115
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,119
(Balls remaining)

2116
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:23,459
(Balls remaining)

2117
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,100
- Should I try 1 more time?
- Try 1 more.

2118
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,376
- Should I try 1 more time?
- Try 1 more.

2119
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,500
Do it one more time.

2120
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:29,639
Yeon Seok, you must do this. Show them what you got.

2121
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,699
- You need to do this.
- Right now.

2122
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,739
(Balls remaining)

2123
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,869
I think you'll do it.

2124
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:35,979
(Balls remaining)

2125
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:39,349
(The direction is perfect.)

2126
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,080
(Balls remaining)

2127
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,719
That was... You took so long.

2128
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,119
(Balls remaining)

2129
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,990
(Stressed)

2130
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,990
Gosh, this is stressful.

2131
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,720
- This is making me go crazy.
- This is stressful.

2132
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,359
It's giving me a headache.

2133
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,259
(Balls remaining)

2134
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,460
(A bitter smile)

2135
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,629
I don't know if I can do this.

2136
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,799
(Balls remaining)

2137
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,839
Seriously.

2138
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:08,839
(Balls remaining)

2139
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,710
Hold on. It hit the bell.

2140
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,409
- Hold on. It's a hit.
- Didn't it hit the bell this time?

2141
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:14,649
It hit the bell like this.

2142
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:15,970
Didn't it hit the bell this time?

2143
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,119
- Check it closely.
- See if it's a hit.

2144
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,220
It's a hit, right?

2145
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:21,219
Okay. It's a success.

2146
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,760
(They succeeded in Round 1.)

2147
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,259
We succeeded.

2148
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,400
(Jae Suk did it.)

2149
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,270
(It was a clean shot.)

2150
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,669
- It's a hit.
- All right.

2151
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,000
(Exclaiming)

2152
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,110
- We succeeded.
- My goodness.

2153
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,340
Gosh. It's so difficult.

2154
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:43,809
- We did it, right?
- Goodness.

2155
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,750
(Go away, our jinx at elementary schools!)

2156
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:48,620
I almost gave up when I made the shot.

2157
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,020
I almost gave up.

2158
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,149
- Ms. Kang.
- Ms. Kang, now...

2159
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,060
The problem is this. We have only two tries left.

2160
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,659
It's going to be more difficult,

2161
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,259
but it comes with a better prize.

2162
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,729
- But it's really difficult today.
- The difficulty level is...

2163
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:04,430
So, would you like to go to the next round?

2164
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,799
Or will you stop here?

2165
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,469
- It's not easy to decide.
- It's so hard.

2166
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,940
The worst scenario is this.

2167
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,199
If we need to hit twice with five balls,

2168
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,910
it would be really difficult.

2169
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,809
- Gosh, that's too much.
- I don't think it would be that.

2170
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,890
- It should be something possible.
- Ms. Kang. Okay.

2171
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,279
Please decide.

2172
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,479
- Now...
- You can stop here if you want.

2173
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,650
Ms. Kang's decision. You can stop here.

2174
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,420
In 1, 2, 3.

2175
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:28,260
I'll go for the next round even if I end up with nothing.

2176
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,629
Gosh, these days...

2177
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,459
- The production crew...
- You might not have noticed,

2178
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,900
but we clearly gave you a message...

2179
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:38,469
that it's going to get really difficult.

2180
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,229
She speaks so gently with nice words, but she said,

2181
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,499
- "Even if I end up with nothing."
- "Even if I end up with nothing."

2182
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,800
- All right.
- Okay.

2183
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:45,830
- All right.
- What do you think it is?

2184
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,979
"It takes an hour to get ready to go to work."

2185
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:51,039
"An item for your neat work look."

2186
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,849
"Dyson Airwrap."

2187
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,679
- Gosh, that's so nice.
- Ms. Kang. Seriously.

2188
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,400
- You really need to take this home.
- I really wanted to have this.

2189
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,019
- But this is...
- Goodness.

2190
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,389
- This is so nice.
- Goodness.

2191
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:01,759
- You really need this, right?
- I mean...

2192
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,889
This will make good memories with the students.

2193
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:04,990
But this one is for you.

2194
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,129
- This is what I want to give her.
- Right.

2195
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,399
- "This is for me."
- "This is for me."

2196
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,529
(An item for work look, Dyson Airwrap)

2197
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,770
- Gosh. This is quite expensive.
- It's expensive.

2198
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,729
(Round 2)

2199
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,269
(It's the same as Round 1.)

2200
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:18,770
(But this time, a desk is removed in the middle.)

2201
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,910
But every ball hit that desk.

2202
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,049
- Gosh, I didn't see this coming.
- Then...

2203
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,650
- I never imagined this.
- Then...

2204
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,749
We must make the shot...

2205
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,520
- go like this.
- Right.

2206
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,390
Gosh. This is...

2207
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,359
- It will bounce two times.
- Or...

2208
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,719
- Or one time.
- Like Yeon Seok did...

2209
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,259
- Right. Yes.
- Bounce the ball one time.

2210
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,189
- Right.
- But this is so hard.

2211
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,710
Bouncing the ball one time is a bit...

2212
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,360
- This is hard.
- Yes.

2213
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:47,999
Think that there is no desk here.

2214
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,770
- Did I say, "Here I go?"
- No, you didn't.

2215
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,609
- I didn't, right? I knew it.
- Yeon Seok, try it.

2216
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:52,839
- Of course. I didn't say it.
- Ji Woo, just like you did.

2217
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,109
Think that there's no desk here.

2218
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:56,180
By the way, Ji Woo, when you do this,

2219
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,250
you forget about all your worries, right?

2220
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,980
Yes.

2221
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,479
If you have serious worries, just visit our show.

2222
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,680
Seriously.

2223
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:07,750
Jae Suk, that was close.

2224
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,080
I just need to get the right direction.

2225
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,666
- This is how I did it earlier.
- You should practice like before.

2226
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,830
How I did it earlier.

2227
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,629
I guess you can do it this way.

2228
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:18,669
(To Yeon Seok, it's the same as Round 1.)

2229
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,830
- Earlier, I hit...
- Try getting the right direction.

2230
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,699
Gosh. We must get this.

2231
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,369
- Yes. You got this.
- This is the spot.

2232
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,690
- That's the spot.
- Right there.

2233
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:28,670
- That's the spot.
- Gosh. You have a chance.

2234
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:31,780
- Good job. Great.
- Just get the right direction.

2235
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,050
- My goodness.
- Get the right direction.

2236
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,220
Goodness.

2237
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,089
I hit it.

2238
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,889
- All right.
- You got the hang of it?

2239
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:41,989
- Let's go.
- I did, but...

2240
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,119
- He got this. Let's go.
- It's our ninth try, right?

2241
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,080
- Let's go. It's our ninth try?
- Let's cheer up.

2242
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,259
Okay.

2243
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,260
Let's cheer up and shout out.

2244
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,130
- In 1, 2, 3, let's go!
- Let's go!

2245
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,500
It's our ninth try.

2246
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,070
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

2247
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,840
All right. There could be a miracle.

2248
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,840
- Goodness.
- Show us, Jae Suk.

2249
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,840
Let me get it just once.

2250
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,310
This is hard.

2251
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,539
Let's go.

2252
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,979
(Balls remaining)

2253
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,149
- I did it.
- Goodness.

2254
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,689
(Balls remaining)

2255
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,220
(It was so close.)

2256
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,619
Jae Suk, that was so close.

2257
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,559
(Balls remaining)

2258
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,659
Ji Woo.

2259
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,259
(Balls remaining)

2260
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,459
Ji Woo, please.

2261
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,359
(Balls remaining)

2262
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,560
Please succeed just this once.

2263
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,599
(Please)

2264
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,909
(Balls remaining)

2265
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:34,140
(Balls remaining)

2266
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:37,680
You told me to relax, but it put me more pressure.

2267
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,550
Gosh, this is making me go crazy.

2268
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,210
My goodness.

2269
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:43,819
The ball went down the Grand Canyon.

2270
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:47,049
(Balls remaining)

2271
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,120
Just do it already.

2272
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,990
Yeon Seokk, we have only one try left.

2273
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,860
I got the hang of it.

2274
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,529
That's the spot.

2275
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:56,359
(Balls remaining)

2276
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,459
You got this.

2277
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,369
(Balls remaining)

2278
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,669
- All right.
- I'll go right away.

2279
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,270
Okay. You got this.

2280
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,500
I think you got this.

2281
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,109
Gosh, please.

2282
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:09,279
(Balls remaining)

2283
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,480
Hold on.

2284
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,949
It hit the bell.

2285
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:14,280
It didn't.

2286
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,670
It hit the side of the bell?

2287
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,250
(Balls remaining)

2288
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,559
Gosh. I'm really bad with balls.

2289
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:29,559
(Balls remaining)

2290
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,099
(Balls remaining)

2291
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,499
I'll do it confidently. There's nothing I can do.

2292
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,599
(Balls remaining)

2293
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,109
Goodness.

2294
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,269
(They failed their ninth try.)

2295
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,510
Goodness.

2296
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,679
(Closing his eyes tightly)

2297
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,879
Is this our last try? It's the last one?

2298
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,120
(They have only one try left.)

2299
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:53,490
This is so hard.

2300
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:56,590
My goodness. This is so hard for me.

2301
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:00,130
We're in trouble. What do we do?

2302
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:02,959
Gosh, we should practice a lot.

2303
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,530
Hold on. Ms. Kang, please have a seat.

2304
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:06,770
We're going to practice so many times.

2305
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:09,690
We're going to practice so many times.

2306
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,070
I'm going to use all the balls.

2307
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,100
- Jae Suk, when you practice...
- Seriously.

2308
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:14,840
I mean it.

2309
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,380
Yeon Seok, practice.

2310
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,710
All we can do is practice.

2311
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,410
We need to find the spot.

2312
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,049
The Airwrap is a nice one.

2313
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,449
(So it began.)

2314
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:27,050
I want to give her the prize. Seriously.

2315
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,460
We have only one try left.

2316
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,089
We did turn the tables a few times.

2317
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,359
(Ms. Kang believed in the three and said she would go for it.)

2318
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,806
- It seems like we'll get it.
- That spot.

2319
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:37,000
Practice. Practice is all we need.

2320
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:41,499
Goodness. Do you practice this much all the time?

2321
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,639
Not this much.

2322
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,969
(The bucket was full of the balls.)

2323
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:47,039
It won't be this hard...

2324
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,540
if we were to put the ball in a hole.

2325
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,079
It would be better if it were like a bucket.

2326
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,149
But that button is too small.

2327
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,020
(The Whenever Guest feels anxious.)

2328
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,640
- Ms. Kang.
- It's like we're bombing.

2329
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,860
Don't you think we're making you stressed?

2330
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,550
(She's a guest, but it's making her blood pressure go up.)

2331
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:01,690
No? My goodness.

2332
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,420
- That's the spot.
- It was moved.

2333
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,560
Let me see. Is it centered?

2334
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:09,050
- I got this. I got it.
- It looked like it hit the button.

2335
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,699
Gosh. You got it.

2336
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,829
Shall we go for it?

2337
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,500
(Yeon Seok succeeded in a row.)

2338
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,699
- That's the spot. All right.
- Go for it now.

2339
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,260
(Yeon Seok succeeded 3 times in a row.)

2340
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,039
- Here I go!
- Our last try.

2341
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,610
- In 1, 2, 3, here we go!
- Here we go!

2342
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,540
Two shots.

2343
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:24,709
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2344
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:25,710
Let's go!

2345
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:27,509
- Right here.
- We're hoping for a miracle.

2346
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,996
It's right here. Throw it at the same spot.

2347
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,879
All right. It's right here.

2348
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,949
(Yoo One Shot makes miracles from time to time.)

2349
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,219
- Yeon Seok.
- It's right here.

2350
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,689
(Balls remaining)

2351
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,850
Just get the right direction.

2352
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,320
- That wasn't it?
- That wasn't it?

2353
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,029
- Just get the right direction.
- Are you sure?

2354
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:41,159
(It hit the side, and it didn't make a sound.)

2355
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,460
- Just get the right direction.
- I need a break.

2356
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,799
- That wasn't it?
- Why?

2357
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,869
I can't believe it.

2358
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:48,670
- Keep trying.
- Didn't I get it?

2359
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,500
(He's about to go crazy.)

2360
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,109
(Jae Suk will go next.)

2361
01:22:55,110 --> 01:23:02,449
(Balls remaining)

2362
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,519
You did it! Gosh.

2363
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,980
(He failed.)

2364
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,190
(Kissing)

2365
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,890
(Kissing)

2366
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:10,789
Show us, Ji Woo.

2367
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,389
(Show us, Ji Woo.)

2368
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,330
(They are desperate for Princess Ji Woo's miracle.)

2369
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:19,600
Gosh.

2370
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,800
- I'll go for it.
- Go.

2371
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,739
- How many balls do we have left?
- Two.

2372
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,139
I can't watch! I really can't!

2373
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,340
What do I do?

2374
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,209
(They are in need of Yoo One Shot.)

2375
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:31,280
Let's go!

2376
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,309
- Gosh.
- All right. Let's make it happen.

2377
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,349
You can do it. You just need to get the right direction.

2378
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,179
(Balls remaining)

2379
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,750
I've got my aim settled.

2380
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:41,760
It's right here.

2381
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,229
I can't watch. Gosh!

2382
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,499
(Balls remaining)

2383
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,230
(Sighing)

2384
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,069
I can't watch!

2385
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,370
What? It's over already?

2386
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,770
We have one ball left.

2387
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,340
It's over? We have one ball left?

2388
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:01,140
- Give us your energy.
- We have one ball left.

2389
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,110
- Please!
- We have one ball left.

2390
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,210
We have one ball left.

2391
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,610
Here. Fill the ball up with energy.

2392
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,009
(Squeezing out the energy from the present as well)

2393
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,020
Please!

2394
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,619
Be at ease. Think of it as a practice shot.

2395
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,919
Let's think of it as a practice shot.

2396
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,219
- It's not the last shot.
- Let's go!

2397
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,689
- It's a practice shot.
- All right.

2398
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,389
- My gosh.
- It's a practice shot.

2399
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:20,206
There's something against us at elementary schools.

2400
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:22,129
We have to break away from that. It's a practice shot.

2401
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,699
(They must break the jinx they have at elementary schools.)

2402
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:29,599
(Balls remaining)

2403
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,499
(I can't watch. I'm curious though.)

2404
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:39,210
(Balls remaining)

2405
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,149
I can't use too much strength.

2406
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:47,019
(Balls remaining)

2407
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:51,390
(The last ball has left his hand!)

2408
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,570
(Groaning)

2409
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,300
(Mission failed)

2410
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,330
I should have brought it back a little.

2411
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,440
(Stunned)

2412
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:14,610
(A miracle did not happen.)

2413
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,789
(They failed to break the jinx they had at elementary schools.)

2414
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:25,290
Just a little bit back.

2415
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:30,330
Why are you in such a hurry?

2416
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:35,840
(The Airwrap and camera disappear before her eyes.)

2417
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,069
- We're so sorry.
- Gosh, thank you.

2418
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:40,039
- We're so sorry.
- Thank you so much.

2419
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,409
- It's not the Airwrap, but...
- Thank you.

2420
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,910
This is so disappointing.

2421
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,579
We're so sorry.

2422
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:49,480
We really wanted to get you the Airwrap.

2423
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,219
It would've been perfect for her hair.

2424
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,260
Students of Class 2 in 6th grade,

2425
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,860
we're so sorry.

2426
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,389
(Once again, they apologize to elementary school students...)

2427
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:00,489
(after their time in Cheorwon.)

2428
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:02,329
In my opinion,

2429
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,159
the students will watch us play this game...

2430
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,000
- and all give it a try.
- Right.

2431
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,130
- Don't you think so?
- You're right.

2432
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,770
They will be able to know how hard this is.

2433
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,640
(A few days later in the classroom of Class 2 in 6th grade)

2434
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,609
(Managing to hit it...)

2435
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,050
(again and again)

2436
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,079
(It became a popular game at Yangjae Elementary School...)

2437
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,160
(as a game that fills the students with excitement.)

2438
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,166
(They're all dressed in sky blue?)

2439
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:30,219
(Your name means sky blue.)

2440
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,760
(Kang Ha Neul, Whenever Friend)

2441
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:32,889
(Raising his hand)

2442
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:33,890
(May I ask about something I'm curious about?)

2443
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:34,890
(What is this?)

2444
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,860
(Full of curiosity)

2445
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,476
(When a Korean melon is sliced in half, )

2446
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,930
(it's filled with seeds.)

2447
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,569
(There's a rumor that if you eat the seeds, )

2448
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:44,070
(you will get diarrhea.)

2449
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,110
(The Question Bot that is off the wall)

2450
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,239
(I heard that you will get diarrhea.)

2451
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,480
(Seo Hyun Woo, the sympathizer)

2452
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:50,780
(You played a lot of villains.)

2453
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,620
(Hyun Woo is known to be a scene-stealer.)

2454
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:53,949
(What is your nickname?)

2455
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,250
(Psycho Freak)

2456
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,350
(Full of madness)

2457
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,526
(A crazy duo formed with the Question Bot and Freak)

2458
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:59,550
(Yeong Mi!)

2459
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:00,550
(I'll sweep it.)

2460
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:01,550
(Does this count?)

2461
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:02,559
What if it's like this?

2462
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,819
(Crazy games)

2463
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:04,866
(Do you not raise any plants?)

2464
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:05,936
(I find it tough enough to raise myself.)

2465
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,130
(Crazy conversations)

2466
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,260
(Let's move!)

2467
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,230
(Sucking)

2468
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,300
(You don't have to down it.)

2469
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:12,630
(Crazy tea times)

2470
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:14,500
(From Busan, from Jinju)

2471
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:17,600
(You guys are leaving me out with the Busan dialect.)

2472
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:20,970
(A crazy spare time with the crazy duo)

2473
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,310
(Whenever Possible)

2474
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:32,520
(Whenever Possible)
