00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,750
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,319
- Gosh, check this place out.
- My gosh.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,950
- The weather is great.
- Right.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,920
- What's this?
- What's this?

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,890
It's a compass.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,990
Oh, my.

7
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:22,231
The arrows indicate directions.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,700
Seoul is 75km from here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,499
- It's only 75km from here.
- Right.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,229
(It's about 75km from here. Where have the 2 MCs arrived?)

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,340
(Thud)

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,076
- That was the cannon just now.
- Oh, my.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,370
I mean, this place is...

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,339
- We're in a border area. Right.
- There are military bases here.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,709
We're in a border area.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,009
(This place offers various charms. Where are they?)

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,409
- We've come to Cheorwon today.
- Yes. We're in Cheorwon.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,679
(Today's spare time in Cheorwon)

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,549
This place isn't so far from Seoul.

20
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,379
Without traffic, it only takes...

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,949
- about an hour to get here.
- Right.

22
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,950
- Now that we're here, - Now that we're here...

23
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:50,559
I realized that it didn't take long to get here without traffic.

24
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,589
- Because the expressways improved.
- Right.

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,489
My gosh. Are we at the Torch Observatory now?

26
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,559
The Torch Observatory.

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,859
Gosh, it was built recently.

28
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,059
- There's a flame-shaped top.
- Right.

29
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,499
- Like the one in the torch.
- The lights... Yes.

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,729
It's in the shape of a flame.

31
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,899
- From afar, it looks like a torch.
- Oh, my.

32
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,870
- There's a place I want to visit.
- Where?

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,909
Goseokjeong Flower Garden.

34
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,039
Goseokjeong?

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,879
That's a famous spot. The columnar joint is famous here.

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,739
- Right.
- We're close...

37
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,909
- to the Hantan River.
- That's another cool spot.

38
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,179
- You can walk along the river.
- Right.

39
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,579
Once you come to Cheorwon,

40
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,449
you'll find a lot of cool places to visit.

41
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,490
Right.

42
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,759
Anyway, we've arrived in Cheorwon.

43
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,459
When I was on my way here,

44
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,189
I didn't know who today's Whenever Friends were.

45
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,199
- I knew who they were.
- Then one of them texted me.

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,660
I got the text too.

47
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,399
- Right?
- Yes. But they had...

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,899
no ties to Cheorwon.

49
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,999
Both of their last names are Yoo.

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,539
Yoo Yeon Seok and Yoo Jae Suk.

51
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,540
You're right.

52
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,910
Seriously.

53
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,740
- They're here.
- They're here.

54
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,539
- Hello.
- HOSHI.

55
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,879

57
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,750

- MINGYU is here too. My gosh.
- It's been a while.

- Hey, Jae Suk.
- MINGYU.

70
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,779
It's been a while, Yeon Seok.

71
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,256
- Have you been well?
- How long has it been?

72
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,449
- Hello.
- Hello.

73
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,980
- MINGYU.
- Nice to meet you.

MINGYU and HOSHI.

75
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,090
They come as a package deal.

76

I don't know why we keep smiling.

80
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:37,229
As I said earlier,

81
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,999
this is SEVENTEEN's tenth year since their debut.

82
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
- Right. Gosh.
- My gosh.

84
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,790
- This isn't an easy feat.
- Gosh.

85
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,099
- Our group is ten years old now.
- This is...

86
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,439
It's already ten years old now?

87
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,569
- Yes. Our group just turned ten.
- Gosh.

88
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,339
It's not easy for a group to stay together for years.

89
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,639
Right. TWICE was on our show recently.

90
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,549
- Right.
- Yes. This is their tenth year too.

91
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,680
- Right.
- Yes.

92
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,779
You guys had a concert at the Jamsu Bridge a few days ago.

93
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,149
Right. It was two days ago. It was on Sunday.

94
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,350
- Okay.
- We had a comeback showcase there.

95
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,836
(About 60,000 people showed up at the Jamsu Bridge.)

It looks like SEVENTEEN does things on a big scale.

101
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,069
Not any group can have...

102
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,199
- a showcase at the Jamsu Bridge.
- Right.

103
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,439
- There were fireworks and lights.
- That's not an easy thing to do.

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,709
- Right.
- I bet you needed a permit.

105
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,739
- Right?
- Yes.

106
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,009
- It's not an easy thing to do.
- MINGYU, not any group can do it.

107
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,010
We were lucky too.

108
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,379
Only a handful of groups in Korea can pull that off.

109
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,109
- It's not an easy feat.
- We were the first group to do it.

110
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,110
Is that so?

111
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,019
Personally, I love being the first one.

112
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,119
Yes. You should boast.

113
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,749
"The first, the best, and the strongest."

114
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,789
You like that, don't you?

115
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,289
- We love stuff like that.
- "The champion."

116
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,219
Everyone likes that, but MINGYU particularly loves it.

117
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,729
- Naturally, yes. The first...
- Right.

118
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,659
I hope the two of you can also fall in love with...

119
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,599
- Yes.
- the charm of Cheorwon.

120
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,599
- On our way here, we thought, - Yes.

121
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,769
"This is a nice city."

122
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,900
You fell asleep in the car.

123
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,869
You didn't check out the city to appreciate it.

124
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,110
Gosh, I meant that when we had gotten close to Cheorwon.

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,609
All right. Today,

126
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,669
let's explore the charms...

127
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,809
- Cheorwon has to offer.
- Yes.

128
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,979
- Okay.
- We should be on our way to meet...

129
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,039
- our first Whenever Guest.
- We should get going.

130
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,110
- Okay.
- Here it goes. Ta-da.

131
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,549
(Intrigued)

132
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,319
Here are our first Whenever Guests.

133
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,349
Where is the location?

134
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,890
- Seo Myung Hee and Lee Hang Gyu.
- Okay.

135
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,796
"A wife who dreamed of becoming a military officer."

136
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,260
"A husband who's a sewing expert with precise craftsmanship."

137
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,759
"We are a married couple, born and raised in Cheorwon,"

138
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,199
"and begin our day with a military drama."

139
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,830
- I see.
- Okay.

140
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,799
"We take care of dozens of our sons every day."

141
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,799
"It's like Las Vegas of Cheorwon with many sons."

142
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,910
"Please come and check out Wasu Vegas."

143
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,039
Then were they military officers before this?

144
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,479
- But now...
- Are they tailors or something?

145
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
- Right.
- Is that it?

146
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,179
- To sew in the name tags...
- I see.

147
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,609
- Right.
- In the second half of this year,

148
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,290
- I'm enlisting to serve my duty.
- I see.

149
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,619
- He'll have a lot to learn today.
- Right.

150
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,119
I'm enlisting in the second half of this year.

151
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,419
- What if he's stationed here?
- Today...

152
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,859
I'm glad you came to Cheorwon today.

153
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,189
I could end up here.

154
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,089
That's why I thought you chose Cheorwon on purpose for him.

155
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,229
- No, that's not why.
- There is...

156
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,599
- a connection then.
- That's not why.

157
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,906
- HOSHI has a connection here.
- We didn't do this on purpose.

158
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,829
Sewing in the name tags is an important job.

159
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,469
- Right.
- You need to make sure...

160
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,669
- the name tags are on your uniform.
- Of course.

161
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,139
- Or the badges of your unit.
- Right.

162
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,339
- Right.
- And the name tags.

163
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,839
- They must be sewn in nicely.
- You bet.

164
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,709
- Right.
- Let's get going right away.

165
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,710
- Okay.
- We...

166
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,056
It's been a while since we filmed a show outdoors.

167
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,180
- Really?
- Yes.

168
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,609
It'll be hot starting this weekend.

169
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,856
It's going to get really hot now.

170
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,919
I see.

171
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,119
- MINGYU. I heard...
- I heard a lot about you.

172
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,896
- I always wanted to meet you.
- Please drop the honorifics.

173
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,619
I saw you when we were playing a game in one of our episodes.

174
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,259
Your photo came up.

175
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,329
- Really?
- When was that?

176
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,129
It was when Jong Kook joined our show.

177
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,399
- Right.
- Who is that?

178
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,229
- That's SEVENTEEN.
- Right.

179
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,299
- Anyang.
- Yes.

180
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,200
"Who is that?" "That's MINGYU."

181
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,169
I was disappointed in Jong Kook again.

182
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,270
- Gosh, this car...
- Oh, my. Look at that.

183
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,469
- It's an electric vehicle.
- An electric vehicle.

184
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,479
(They will drive an electric vehicle.)

185
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,810
- Will you drive today?
- Yes, I ought to try it out.

186
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,009
- Then you two get in the back.
- You...

187
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,379
- You should sit in the front.
- We'll sit in the back.

188
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,820
(The oldest guy will drive the car.)

189
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,650
- Hey. Gosh.
- Gosh, this is a nice car.

190
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,050
Gosh, this is really nice.

191
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,989
- I see.
- Hold on. The sunroof...

192
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,260
The sunroof...

193
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,966
This is incredible. You can set it to transparent or semi-transparent.

194
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,599
- This is the transparent setting.
- It's transparent now.

195
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,429
- This feels so open.
- Did you see that?

196
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,099
- I can see the observatory.
- Right.

197
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,900
- Right.
- Let me set it to semi-transparent.

198
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,569
- I can block out the view.
- This is nice.

199
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,850
Cars these days are really nice.

200
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,040
- Seriously.
- Nice.

201
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,980
"Wasu-ro 173-gil."

202
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,210
- There it is.
- There.

203
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,750
- It's good, isn't it?
- It will take 28 minutes.

204
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,479
- This is a cute car.
- Let's go.

205
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,820
(They set out to their first spare time spot.)

206
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,189
(Glancing over)

207
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,220
It's nice and quiet.

208
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,919
The rice seedlings are planted beautifully.

209
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,429
They already planted rice seedlings.

210
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,430
They did a beautiful job.

211
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,060
- The season has begun.
- It's begun.

212
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,669
I should travel around Korea this year.

213
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,799
- Traveling around Korea is great.
- Yes.

214
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,839
There are so many great places to visit within Korea these days.

215
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,399
- Right. I heard there were tons.
- Yes.

216
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,769
I often go abroad because we go on tours.

217
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,439
- I travel when I don't have shows.
- Right.

218
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,579
I can use my spare time that way.

219
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,439
- Right.
- But I don't get to do that here.

220
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,479
HOSHI. Do you go out often on your days off?

221
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,619
I mostly stay home on my days off.

222
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,379
- I see. So...
- My parents live in Namyangju.

223
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,489
So I go there often.

224
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,920
- They live in Namyangju.
- Yes.

225
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,860
And we have a dog.

226
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,389
What's the name of your dog?

227
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,419
Latte.

228
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,860
- Latte?
- Latte.

229
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,930
Why Latte?

230
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,729
It has to do with the colors of the fur.

231
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,729
Latte has brown fur, except on the chest.

232
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,799
- That's why?
- I see. That's why.

233
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
- Yes.
- Because it looks like a latte.

234
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,400
I wondered if your dog acted like a boomer.

235
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,116
- It sounds like "back in my day."
- Right. "Back in my day..."

236
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,879
- How can a dog act like a boomer?
- Well,

237
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,609
maybe, it's the way the dog behaves toward the owner.

238
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,949
- When you ask for the paw, - The dog might not do the trick.

239
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,309
- the dog might do it reluctantly.
- Right.

240
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,379
"How dare you ask for my paw..."

241
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,419
- "without any snack?"
- Right.

242
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,701
- "Back in my day..."
- And the dog might not move a lot.

243
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,519
This place looks like...

244
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,889
- This must be the downtown area.
- Yes.

245
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,330
- It must be the downtown area.
- We're in the downtown area.

246
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,989
I don't know why I want to eat jjajangmyeon in places like this.

247
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,390
- You know that vibe.
- Gosh.

248
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,199
- Places like this...
- You must try...

249
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,499
the local jjajangmyeon.

250
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,340
- The jjajangmyeon with green peas.
- I see a Chinese restaurant there.

251
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,300
You must try the local jjajangmyeon.

252
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,069
- It feels like we're on a trip.
- Yes.

253
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,140
Right.

254
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,710
Gosh, this is nice.

255
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,710
- This place is cozy.
- It's peaceful here. Right?

256
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,079
- I think this is the place.
- What? Hold on.

257
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,409
- "Department Store for Officers."
- I see.

258
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,210
(They arrive near the first spare time spot.)

259
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,649
- I'll get to experience that.
- This is the place.

260
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,990
- "A-Quality Overlock."
- It says "overlock" there.

261
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,190
"Overlock."

262
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,789
It must be somewhere on this street. Right?

263
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,790
(Military stores are clustered on this street.)

264
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,390
My gosh. Look at this place.

265
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,129
- Gosh, nice.
- This is amazing.

266
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,130
(Welcome to Wasu Vegas.)

267
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,969
Actually, I wanted to wear a shirt like that.

268
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,970
- What shirt?
- The one that says "ROK."

269
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,569
- The one that says "Army."
- Yes.

270
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,870
- The ROKA shirt?
- Yes, that.

271
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,670
You'll soon get to wear it.

272
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,770
(Laughter trailing off)

273
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,539
- Thank you for driving.
- Thank you.

274
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,740
Thank you.

275
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,279
Jae Suk, I'm excited to visit...

276
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,479
a department store for military officers.

277
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,819
You know what? This is my day.

278
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,849
Yes, it is.

279
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,050
- Today...
- This way.

280
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,189
- This place feels so cozy.
- Yes.

281
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,520
- The vibe here is so different.
- Right?

282
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,189
Gosh, this is nice.

283
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,930
Wait. What were their names again?

284
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,860
Seo Myung Hee and Lee Hang Gyu.

285
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,399
- Seo...
- Seo Myung Hee and Lee Hang Gyu.

286
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,529
Lee Hang Gyu? Hello.

287
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,530
- Is this the place?
- It was... Hold on.

288
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:50,599
- This is the place.
- It was...

289
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,199
- This is the place. Hey.
- This is it?

290
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,516
- This is the place.
- This is the place?

291
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,969
- Hello.
- Hello.

292
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,869
- This is the place.
- Are you Ms. Seo Myung Hee?

293
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,310
- This is the place.
- Yes.

294
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,050
- Hello. My gosh.
- Gosh, that's why...

295
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,409
- you referred to them as your sons.
- Yes.

296
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,479
Right.

297
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,579
I call them my sons.

298
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,549
It looks like you sell...

299
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,960
- military-related goods here.
- Yes.

300
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,789
- And you sell overlock tags.
- Yes.

301
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,930
- You sew in tags like name tags.
- Yes.

302
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
I've never been to a place like this.

303
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,330
- He's great at that.
- Yes.

304
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,599
He will soon enlist.

305
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,169
- He'll enlist soon.
- I see.

306
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,139
- I'm enlisting in the 2nd half.
- He's enlisting in the 2nd half.

307
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,369
Join Division Three.

308
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,569
(Responding)

309
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,470
HOSHI wanted to wear ROKA shirts.

310
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,839
- I see a lot of them here.
- I was curious.

311
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,009
- We have a lot of them here.
- Yes.

312
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,249
- There's one with tigers.
- Gosh, this is...

313
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,949
(They start browsing in earnest.)

314
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,149
- This is fascinating.
- This is a great episode for you.

315
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,989
By the way, I found something unique here.

316
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,310
- Girl groups...
- Girl groups...

317
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,030
There's merchandise for girl groups.

318
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,430
- This is...
- The celebrity photos?

319
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,660
- Right.
- Officers' favorite...

320
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,089
After their bootcamp training,

321
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,736
- Officers' favorite girl groups.
- once they are assigned to bases...

322
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,059
K-pop is alive here.

323
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,469
K-pop merchandise is here.

324
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,930
K-pop is everywhere.

325
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,699
What's the name of your dog?

326
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,339
- It's Crong. Yes.
- Crong?

327
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,509
- Crong.
- Crong from "Pororo?"

328
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,979
- Yes.
- All right. So...

329
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,180
- we read the letter you sent us.
- Okay.

330
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,679
We could guess that you worked in a military-related field.

331
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,549
I wanted to be a military officer.

332
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,219
- You wanted to be an officer.
- Really?

333
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,849
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

334
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,090
That's why I've been running this for 40 years now.

335
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,689
For 40 years?

336
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,029
- You were born and raised here.
- For 40 years?

337
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,029
- That's right.
- We have a long way to go.

338
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,600
(They've been performing for 10 years.)

339
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,869
Running this store for 40 years...

340
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,199
- That's been my job.
- That's impressive.

341
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,599
- It's not easy.
- Right.

342
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,139
I manually overlock...

343
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,339
- everything.
- Yes.

344
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,640
It could be an insignia or a name tag. I overlock them.

345
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,480
Whenever young men I see as my sons come to our store,

346
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,880
- I give them what they need.
- Right.

347
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,150
So I had a sense of pride about my job.

348
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,689
Right. And the names on the tags have to be stitched in nicely too.

349
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,029
Right. Everyone has different handwriting.

350
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,090
- Right.
- Yes.

351
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,529
- That's really fascinating.
- It depends on the embroiderers.

352
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,859
- It's separate?
- That's why...

353
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,999
people go to the embroiderers with good handwriting.

354
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,299
- Right.
- There are many stores...

355
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,499
- in front of the base.
- Words get around.

356
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,139
"They use thick threads over at that store."

357
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,199
Right.

358
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,509
"Their handwriting is good."

359
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,169
Have you noticed any big changes...

360
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,809
in the recent generation of officers...

361
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,379
compared to the old days?

362
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,749
There are many big changes.

363
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,309
First of all, the military uniforms underwent a few changes.

364
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,379
- Right. There were many changes.
- Yes.

365
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,989
Even the fabric changed. They're digital uniforms now.

366
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,219
Yes. Back in the day, uniforms came in a single color.

367
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,319
Right.

368
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,689
Then the next uniforms had the frog-patterned design.

369
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,019
After that, they became digital uniforms.

370
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,540
- They became digital uniforms.
- Yes.

371
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,529
- The thermal jackets...
- They went through changes too.

372
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,659
- had some changes too.
- Right.

373
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,829
How did they change?

374
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,599
The very first jackets before the thermal jackets...

375
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,969
- were yellow.
- That's right.

376
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,269
- Over there.
- The one over there.

377
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,699
- That's for kids.
- Yes.

378
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,070
- They were V-neck jackets.
- Right.

379
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,469
Now, they're digital jackets.

380
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,110
And they come in black.

381
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,579
- They come in black?
- Right.

382
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,449
- Black ones are commercial.
- We sell black ones...

383
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,879
as commercial jackets.

384
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
- I see. That over there?
- Yes.

385
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,561
Officers wear digital jackets in the base.

386
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,750
Gosh, I haven't heard that in a while.

387
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,749
- It's been a while.
- "Commercial."

388
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,919
- "Commercial."
- "Commercial."

389
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,559
- So you sell that here.
- Yes.

390
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,829
People who used to serve in the military...

391
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,129
when the yellow jackets were around...

392
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,759
wore them at home for a while.

393
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,199
- People still do.
- That jacket is perfect.

394
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,499
- A lot of people still buy them.
- In winter...

395
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,269
- That jacket keeps you warm.
- Right.

396
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,569
That helps you fall asleep.

397
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,739
- The thickness is just perfect.
- Yes.

398
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,809
Anyway, what kind of spare time is this for you?

399
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,079
- This is our lunch break.
- Right?

400
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,540
This is when things slow down.

401
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,279
Then when is your busiest time?

402
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,980
From 7am to 9:10am.

403
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,219
Officers have to take the bus when they go on leave.

404
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,580
- Officers who go on leave.
- Yes.

405
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,959
- Officers on leave.
- So you start your days very early.

406
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
- Yes.
- My gosh.

407
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,859
- Right. You have to.
- To match the bus schedule.

408
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,159
- And...
- When they stop by here, what...

409
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,070
They stop by here and buy T-shirts for their parents.

410
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,799
Really?

411
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,899
They give their parents...

412
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,460
- military T-shirts as presents?
- Yes.

413
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,869
I bet a lot of them come back after their discharge.

414
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,379
Some people came back after 20 or 30 years.

415
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,539
- Really?
- Yes.

416
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,909
- So...
- I bet they came here on a trip.

417
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,349
- They'd come here on a trip.
- Did they say they served here?

418
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,719
"This store is still here."

419
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,420
When I heard that, I felt so proud.

420
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,850
I loved it.

421
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,749
- That's amazing.
- What made you write to our show?

422
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,189
I watched your show by chance.

423
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,059
I found the show very entertaining.

424
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,359
I'm planning to run this store for 5 to 6 more years.

425
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,570
- Really?
- I wanted to make good memories.

426
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,369
Is there a reason you're planning to retire in 5 or 6 years?

427
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,969
- Could you tell us?
- The bootcamp for Division Three...

428
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,969
will be closed in 2030.

429
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,039
- This too?
- Really?

430
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,439
- In 2030?
- Yes.

431
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,109
- I see.
- There aren't that many officers.

432
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,680
- Did you not know?
- He didn't know.

433
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,840
You've been running the store for 40 years here.

434
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,120
I'm only in charge of sewing.

435
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,420
- Yes.
- I see.

436
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,760
- She takes care of the operations.
- She's in charge overall.

437
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,329
Embroidering names on the tags is so fascinating.

438
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,359
How do you do that?

439
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,399
- You had to learn that, right?
- Would you like...

440
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,799
- Of course.
- You do it without any sketch?

441
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,360
- He doesn't do any sketches.
- Well...

442
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,469
- Then...
- Could you do one...

443
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,369
- for HOSHI?
- You should get one in advance.

444
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,370
- Should I?
- Yes.

445
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,169
- We'll give you one as a present.
- Get one in your real name.

446
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,839
- His real name?
- Could you make one for him?

447
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
- Should I do one?
- Yes, please.

448
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,620
- This is sudden.
- Let's do it.

449
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,149
- Just do what you've been doing.
- I'm sure it won't take long.

450
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,470
- He's been doing this for 40 years.
- It won't take long.

451
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,449
- Gosh.
- This is an impressive skill.

452
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,819
They write the names without any sketches.

453
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,849
- Right.
- You know?

454
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,859
Nowadays, when they first enlist,

455
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,119
they get machine-embroidered name tags.

456
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,520
- Right, they can use computers now.
- But I do it manually.

457
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,899
Once they're in the military,

458
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,776
they change the tags to the ones embroidered by me.

459
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,499
- I guess the first one isn't hip.
- Right.

460
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,369
- So this is...
- This is full of soul.

461
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,199
- Right.
- That's right. It's got some soul.

462
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,269
- Yes.
- This is great...

463
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,339
that I get to experience this before I enlist.

464
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,109
- Nice.
- My gosh. Because...

465
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,750
so many of you are watching, I'm nervous.

466
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,110
A lot of people are watching indeed.

467
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,440
- He's been doing this for so long.
- How fascinating.

468
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,390
(He begins without hesitation.)

469
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,789
(Amazed)

470
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,230
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

471
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,580
It's like he's doing calligraphy.

472
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,530
- Could you...
- Soon.

473
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,940
What if your fans start crying after watching this?

474
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,040
- This is...
- There should be more time.

475
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,810
(A series of gasps and amazement)

476
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,209
- By the way, this is impressive.
- Oh, my.

477
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,309
(His last name in English is done in one go.)

478
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,580
He's doing that in one go.

479
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,219
- This is amazing.
- This is so cool.

480
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,549
- He's been doing this for 40 years.
- My hands were shaking a lot.

481
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,550
- It didn't come out nicely.
- No, it looks great.

482
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,420
Kwon Soon Young.

483
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,659
(Kwon Soon Young)

484
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,340
- I...
- That will go on here pretty soon.

485
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,760
- Thank you.
- My gosh.

486
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,859
- Please come this way.
- Thank you.

487
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,969
Gosh, this is beautiful.

488
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,306
- Your handwriting is great.
- I didn't expect... You think so?

489
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,699
I totally get why you wanted to see this.

490
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,646
- Right. This is fascinating.
- It's fascinating.

491
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,269
So you've been doing this...

492
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,910
- for 40 years. My gosh.
- For 40 years.

493
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,779
- Now, it's hitting me.
- Right?

494
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,280
It's starting to hit me now.

495
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,019
With this name tag, this feels so real now.

496
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,390
- Now that HOSHI has the name tag...
- My gosh.

497
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,450
Earlier, he was so happy. "Sounds good!"

498
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,790
Now that he has the name tag...

499
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,060
The reality is hitting him.

500
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,889
- All right.
- I have a lot on my mind now.

501
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,029
How does it feel?

502
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,700
Should I sew the tag on your shirt?

503
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
- On the shirt?
- The shirt is sponsored.

504
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,770
The shirt is sponsored. He must return the shirt.

505
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,970
- I see. Sew in the tag?
- He should enlist today.

506
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,909
- Anyway, now that we're here, - Yes.

507
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,010
- we must begin our mission.
- Let's start our game.

508
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,679
- HOSHI, you do it.
- Let me try it.

509
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,909
- You do it, HOSHI.
- You go first.

510
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,310
- It has 0, 1, and 2.
- Yes.

511
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,879
- I'll roll it.
- Okay.

512
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,050
Don't be scared.

513
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,690
(They obtain 2 coupons.)

514
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,789
Okay.

515
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,790
(They obtain 2 coupons.)

516
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,120
- We got two.
- You're the best.

517
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,299
- All right. This is important.
- What's that?

518
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,399
Let's check the prize for Round One.

519
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,070
- Okay.
- Yes.

520
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,740
"We've been on the path of life as a married couple."

521
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,040
"Now, we can hike side by side."

522
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,379
"Matching hiking shoes from North Face."

523
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,556
(Prize for Round 1, matching hiking shoes)

524
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,039
(Two pairs of matching hiking shoes)

525
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
(We can hike side by side.)

526
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,096
- Here's the thing about us.
- They couldn't win in the end.

527
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,889
I'm not trying to spoil the mood.

528
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,530
Probability-wise, whenever we had shoes as a prize, we couldn't...

529
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,390
- Really?
- You couldn't win?

530
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,229
- Why would you say that?
- Probability-wise?

531
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,329
- Why would you say that?
- Yeon Seok.

532
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,010
- Please don't say that.
- Think about it.

533
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,699
- We must break the jinx today.
- We must break it today.

534
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,006
- Jae Suk.
- You should help us, guys.

535
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,030
Look at my shoes.

536
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,231
- I don't have shoes.
- Right.

537
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,470
Let's show them.

538
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,540
- Take a look.
- Yes. Take a look.

539
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,870
- Great.
- My gosh.

540
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,879
- They look good.
- Please do a good job.

541
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,009
- Yes.
- Great.

542
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,040
- This is a lot of pressure.
- We can...

543
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,709
(Matching hiking shoes are at stake on this mission.)

544
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,620
(Rubber Band Shooting)

545
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,519
(They must use their fingers to shoot the rubber band...)

546
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,050
(and hit the canteen off the table.)

547
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,319
(Round 1)

548
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,020
(Hit 2 canteens off the table.)

549
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,190
(The location of canteens, the shooting location)

550
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,260
Gosh, that's...

551
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,459
- Gosh, this will be hard.
- Gosh.

552
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,899
- We have to use our fingers...
- I see.

553
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,029
- to shoot the band.
- Is this it?

554
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,600
Aren't canteens heavy?

555
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,870
- I see. The rubber bands are big.
- I see. That?

556
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,309
So let me tell you what this is.

557
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,209
- You put on the rubber bands...
- Okay.

558
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,739
Around the bottom of your pants like this.

559
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,809
What's that for?

560
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,091
- To fix the bottom of your pants.
- This is what you do.

561
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,709
- Really?
- Put it around your pants.

562
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,250
Then tuck in the hems of your pants.

563
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,750
- I see.
- Soldiers...

564
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,470
- That's how you do it.
- This is how it's done.

565
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,219
- You do this on your uniform.
- Just like this.

566
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,836
- I thought it was a hairband.
- It's elastic.

567
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,889
- A hairband?
- This is...

568
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,229
But if we're using this...

569
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,299
- I thought it was a hairband.
- It's elastic.

570
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,540
- Really?
- While sitting down?

571
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Gosh, this will be hard.

572
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,870
Try to zero in on it. Give it a try.

573
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,530
- It's too far.
- It's way too far.

574
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,660
- This isn't easy.
- We're in trouble.

575
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,670
My gosh.

576
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,710
(HOSHI aims at it.)

577
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,280
- Gosh.
- Wait.

578
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,849
- But this is so far.
- I see.

579
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,910
It's way too far.

580
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,810
My gosh. This...

581
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,450
When I was in the military, I was a pretty good shot.

582
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,020
I was an ace marksman in the military.

583
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,910
I was an ace marksman in the military.

584
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,289
- Hey.
- I told you I was an ace marksman.

585
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,559
- How did you do it?
- How did you do it?

586
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,599
- Yeon Seok.
- We have to learn it.

587
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,759
We must find the best way to do this.

588
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,269
- I have to spread my fingers.
- You must be good at this, HOSHI.

589
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,529
- I should do well?
- Yes.

590
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,970
- To win a lot of days off.
- Yes.

591
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Give that to me.

592
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,270
Here's what's called zeroing in.

593
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,940
- Great.
- Close one of your eyes.

594
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,210
Close one of your eyes.

595
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,279
Align your finger with the target.

596
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,780
That's the target.

597
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,519
Then let go.

598
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,550
- Great.
- From here...

599
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,549
- There you go.
- I did it.

600
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,020
(MINGYU was listening to him.)

601
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,219
(Bullseye!)

602
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
- Hey.
- Yes.

603
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,589
- I can zero in on the target.
- MINGYU got this.

604
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,359
- Okay, I got it.
- All right, Soon Young.

605
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,460
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's do this.

606
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,059
- Here we go.
- All right.

607
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,069
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

608
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,130
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

609
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,670
- This is our 1st try.
- We just have to get 2 of them.

610
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,186
- We just need to get two of them.
- Yes.

611
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,930
- Should MINGYU go first?
- Should I start?

612
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,579
- Gosh, I'm nervous.
- Just do what you just did.

613
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,839
- Just do what you just did.
- Do it smoothly...

614
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,110
like overlocking a tag.

615
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,610
There.

616
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,779
- That's good.
- Do it the other way.

617
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,049
- He got close.
- Good try.

618
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,150
His aim is good.

619
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,090
- Pull it.
- There you go.

620
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,829
- Hey.
- What just happened?

621
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,929
- Hey.
- What just happened?

622
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,260
- What?
- Hey.

623
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,930
What...

624
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,540
Gosh. I'm sorry.

625
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,539
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

626
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
(Passionate reaction)

627
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,470
- I got too excited.
- That was amazing.

628
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,639
- Let's go. All right.
- Wait.

629
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,940
- I get it.
- All right.

630
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,250
- I get it now. It works.
- You can finish this now.

631
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,520
- A civilian succeeded.
- That was amazing.

632
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,730
As someone who already served, I must succeed. Wait.

633
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,660
- Yeon Seok.
- That was amazing.

634
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,850
If you finish this, we'll complete Round One.

635
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,120
Stay calm.

636
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,890
Zero in.

637
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,290
I was pretty good when I was in the military.

638
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,100
- Okay.
- All right. Now...

639
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,330
- Now, - Hey.

640
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,340
- only Jae Suk remains.
- Don't coach him.

641
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,799
- Show us, Jae Suk.
- Well,

642
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,969
I have to succeed now.

643
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,200
Only Jae Suk remains.

644
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,140
- This is your chance.
- So this...

645
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,409
Right.

646
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,609
(HOSHI gave them a chance to succeed.)

647
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,940
Soon Young did a great job.

648
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,250
That was so close.

649
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,880
That was so close.

650
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,189
- I should've hit it a bit harder.
- That was so close.

651
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,790
Gosh, I should've hit it just a bit harder.

652
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,519
I got the hang of it.

653
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,719
- I think I know how to do this.
- Wait.

654
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,789
Try number two.

655
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,129
- You and I should finish this.
- Zeroing in...

656
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,289
Let's not let it go to them.

657
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,690
Right. You guys should finish this.

658
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,330
- Please believe in us.
- Gosh. I'm not worried.

659
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,300
- We get ten tries, right?
- Of course.

660
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,869
- Round 2. Shall we?
- Round 2.

661
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,146
- You mean, try number 2.
- Try number 2.

662
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,210
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

663
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,316
- Should I start? I'll start.
- Should we go first?

664
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,679
(Jae Suk will go first this time.)

665
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,179
- I was pretty good earlier.
- Yes.

666
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,980
- The guys...
- I shouldn't be nervous.

667
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,080
I can't be nervous.

668
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,059
(Jae Suk fails.)

669
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,519
- All right. You should hit one.
- Just do what I've been doing.

670
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,130
(Next up is Yeon Seok.)

671
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,099
- That was close.
- It brushed by the canteen, right?

672
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,099
(Try Number Two: Yeon Seok fails.)

673
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,060
- I heard the ringing sound.
- That was so close.

674
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,499
- Get the left one.
- You made things...

675
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,180
- I'll get the right one.
- difficult now.

676
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,570
(Now, 2 rubber bands and 2 canteens remain.)

677
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,810
(If HOSHI knocks over the canteen, they'll have a shot.)

678
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,020
HOSHI.

679
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,179
(Hitting bullseye again)

680
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,419
HOSHI. Hey!

681
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,619
- What?
- Who are you?

682
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,919
- What just happened?
- Who are you?

683
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,919
- He hit two canteens so far.
- Who are you?

684
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,790
I even tried to get the left one.

685
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,960
Don't say that now.

686
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,260
- Great. Well done.
- I...

687
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,899
- Military officers will love him.
- You're amazing.

688
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,329
- How did I do that?
- MINGYU.

689
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,539
- MINGYU.
- I'll finish it.

690
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,400
- Yes, finish it.
- I must close my left eye.

691
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,610
(If MINGYU knocks over the canteen, they will have completed Round 1.)

692
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,180
(Please believe in us.)

693
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,379
(He fails.)

694
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,920
Gosh, HOSHI...

695
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,720
- HOSHI is good.
- Gosh.

696
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,649
- Could you switch seats?
- Wait. I mean...

697
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,696
- I don't want to sit on the edge.
- What's going on?

698
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,889
- HOSHI should go last.
- You're our only hope.

699
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,959
- HOSHI. You should go last.
- Okay.

700
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,329
- You go first.
- Okay.

701
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,599
- Can I go 2nd?
- You can go 2nd.

702
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,730
- Okay.
- This is...

703
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,270
Hold on. Let me practice.

704
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,600
- Should I not care?
- We should.

705
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll be indifferent and shoot.

706
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,739
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

707
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,139
- Hold on.
- All right.

708
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,260
(Is this not how you do it?)

709
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Breath control is important in shooting.

710
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,210
Gosh, enough. Just hit it already.

711
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,920
You keep delaying.

712
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,989
- Breath control...
- People might think...

713
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,349
- you're a military officer.
- Gosh.

714
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,190
- Breath control is important.
- Come on.

715
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,390
- Seriously. We're stacking them up.
- What?

716
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,029
Okay. I got it.

717
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,229
- Good. Let's do it.
- I got my aim.

718
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,370
Yeon Seok. You must do well when it counts.

719
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,040
- Hook it on my finger.
- All right.

720
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,440
Let's do a group cheer.

721
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,139
- Put your hands up.
- In 1, 2, 3.

722
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,709
- Let's go! Who will go first?
- Let's go!

723
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,739
- Yeon Seok?
- Me first.

724
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,909
- Okay.
- Breath control...

725
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,609
- Do this for us, Yeon Seok.
- Wait.

726
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,380
As you exhale half of your breath,

727
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,879
you let go of the band...

728
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,280
- at the two-thirds point.
- I see.

729
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,849
- Just hit the canteen.
- This is fun.

730
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,079
If you can hit the canteen,

731
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,319
- you'll sound credible.
- All right.

732
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,589
- Let me show you my breathing.
- Okay. Great.

733
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,430
(Showing his breathing technique for shooting)

734
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,590
- This is the time.
- Great.

735
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,129
- Hold on.
- I mean...

736
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,730
you're not supposed to talk when you stop breathing.

737
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,259
- So...
- I wanted to explain it.

738
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,599
- Then...
- "This is the time."

739
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,040
He's not doing what he's showing us.

740
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,500
Here I go.

741
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,440
Now.

742
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,210
(He hits the canteen!)

743
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,680
Jae Suk! It's the breath control.

744
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,349
- I mastered breath control.
- Right.

745
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,850
- Well done.
- Okay.

746
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,519
(The success notification is on.)

747
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,489
- Crong is going wild. Yes.
- Great.

748
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,226
- I mastered breath control.
- MINGYU is up next.

749
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,350
MINGYU got this.

750
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,890
- Yes. That's it. Just like that.
- Okay.

751
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,760
- HOSHI will go last.
- We got HOSHI.

752
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,559
- We got HOSHI.
- You guys can relax and do it.

753
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,799
- Okay.
- I'll do the breathing technique.

754
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
- Great.
- At the two-thirds point.

755
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:22,041
- Yes.
- Let's do this, MINGYU.

756
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,730
Your mouth...

757
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,439
- Nice try.
- Your aim was slightly off.

758
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,569
- It was so close.
- I should do it.

759
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,910
Should I use my thumb?

760
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,339
It's my turn.

761
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,840
(Jae Suk will go next.)

762
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,050
Darn.

763
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,720
Jae Suk. What was that?

764
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,550
- Did you even shoot it?
- Why...

765
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,419
- You didn't drop it, right?
- Greed got the better of me.

766
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
That's...

767
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:47,519
I wanted to put Yeon Seok...

768
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,630
- in his place.
- Come on.

769
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,730
I'm sorry. I tried too hard.

770
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,429
- Go, HOSHI.
- Do it like you did earlier.

771
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,430
You got this.

772
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:56,069
- Do it like you did earlier.
- You got this.

773
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,070
Do what you've been doing.

774
00:24:57,071 --> 00:24:58,669
- This is a critical moment.
- Perfect aim HOSHI.

775
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,839
This is what I did earlier.

776
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,169
Pull it back and aim.

777
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,410
(They will clear Round 1 if he does as well as earlier.)

778
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,680
(Shaking)

779
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,320
It didn't work.

780
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,889
- It hit the canteen.
- You're good at this.

781
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,489
- That was amazing.
- No.

782
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,719
- You're good at this.
- You really are.

783
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,336
- How are you so good?
- How are you so good?

784
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,889
He'll be good at shooting.

785
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,989
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

786
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,659
Should we use a bonus coupon?

787
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,800
- Should we?
- Yes.

788
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,669
Mr. Lee, why don't you try instead of me?

789
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,670
- Me?
- Yes.

790
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:31,739
- I think...
- Good luck.

791
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,870
(Coupon)

792
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,969
I think he'd have good marksmanship.

793
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,869
He was here for 40 years.

794
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,640
Does that have anything to do with this?

795
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,116
- Why don't you practice?
- Can I try several times?

796
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,680
I have to make it curve, not go straight.

797
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,849
(His approach is fit for someone from Cheorwon.)

798
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,180
It has to go in a curve. Going straight won't work.

799
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,690
- It isn't as easy as it seems.
- Right.

800
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,220
(Mr. Lee practices.)

801
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,900
I knew it. He's been here for 40 years.

802
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,499
(The success alarm malfunctions.)

803
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,029
Calm down.

804
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,939
- We'll use the bonus coupon.
- Okay.

805
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,339
In 1, 2, 3.

806
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,369
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

807
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,240
- Let's go.
- Should I go first?

808
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,369
Can we change seats so I can go first?

809
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,279
- Do you want that? Okay.
- I don't want to feel too burdened.

810
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,609
I wasn't able to hit it at all today.

811
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,880
We'll start with MINGYU.

812
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,919
- I'd be great if MINGYU hit it.
- Then this would be our last round.

813
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,319
MINGYU's shots are powerful.

814
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,690
It'll be a clean shot.

815
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,290
MINGYU.

816
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,889
- Did you play?
- Yes.

817
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,359
- What happened?
- Where did it go?

818
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,430
Did you play?

819
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,759
- It flew past the canteen.
- It did?

820
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,929
- He scolded himself. "MINGYU."
- "MINGYU."

821
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,600
It really doesn't work.

822
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,400
- It isn't easy.
- All right.

823
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,940
(He controls his breath again.)

824
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,010
Are you part of a security service?

825
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
(He can't help but comment.)

826
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:47,880
- What is with you?
- Look at you.

827
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,580
- I drove the security escort.
- I see.

828
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,750
(Now he really gets ready to shoot.)

829
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,829
(He missed it by a mile.)

830
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,359
I pushed my arm toward the end.

831
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,429
(Staring at Yeon Seok)

832
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,460
You did?

833
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,160
Only you know.

834
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,169
Yeon Seok is very nervous.

835
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,000
- He is sweating profusely.
- Seriously.

836
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,539
(However, there are two skilled people left.)

837
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,970
- He has to hit it.
- Sir.

838
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,279
(The curved shot misses.)

839
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
HOSHI.

840
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:24,749
Try getting both.

841
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,150
- Jae Suk.
- It's possible.

842
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
(Not even close)

843
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,420
- This is hard.
- This is hard.

844
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,719
We used a bonus coupon, so it's okay.

845
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,619
The disappointment is bigger when I'm sitting here.

846
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,936
- Where you sit is important.
- I'm sorry.

847
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,306
- No, don't worry.
- No, don't worry.

848
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,399
- We used a coupon.
- That was a bonus round.

849
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,829
- We don't lose a try.
- No?

850
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,559
- I see.
- This makes me so nervous.

851
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,629
Why am I only good at this when I'm practicing?

852
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,700
Did it go too far to the right earlier?

853
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,139
- Why is it so difficult?
- How can I not hit it once?

854
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,440
- Don't beat yourself up.
- Why won't this work?

855
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,240
This is my bullet.

856
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,180
This is mine. I got a good feeling.

857
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,080
(Jae Suk aims.)

858
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,950
- I got it.
- It worked.

859
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,419
- It worked.
- Let's try right away.

860
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,926
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

861
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,489
- I'll go 1st.
- It's already our 6th try?

862
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,559
We have try 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 left.

863
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,259
- Pretend you're practicing.
- I'm practicing.

864
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,959
- Don't feel any pressure.
- I'm practicing.

865
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,189
I got this.

866
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,860
- Just shoot it.
- Carelessly.

867
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,400
Go for it.

868
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,529
- Here we go again.
- Carelessly shoot the two canteens.

869
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,800
- Go.
- Shoot.

870
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,970
(MINGYU fails.)

871
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,409
Why does mine keep going through the middle?

872
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,039
(The 1st 2 people failed again.)

873
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,410
I'm going to hit it.

874
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,009
- Please.
- I have a feeling.

875
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,950
(Yeon Seok and HOSHI both have to succeed.)

876
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,650
(Sixth try: Jae Suk, MINGYU, Yeon Seok, HOSHI)

877
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,120
Let's see.

878
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,819
- Shoot it carelessly.
- Gosh, you did it.

879
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,419
- He's good.
- Okay, HOSHI.

880
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,130
- HOSHI.
- You got this.

881
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,589
Let's go, HOSHI.

882
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,910
(If HOSHI hits it, they succeed.)

883
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,200
Let's go.

884
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,900
Let's go.

885
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,000
Let's go, HOSHI.

886
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,580
(They clear Round 1!)

887
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,609
(The marksman's great achievement)

888
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,850
- HOSHI.
- Hey.

889
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,749
- HOSHI.
- You're the best.

890
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,920
He has perfect aim.

891
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,856
- He has perfect aim.
- He has perfect aim.

892
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,890
Gosh.

893
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,490
We did it.

894
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,190
- We cleared Round One.
- Congratulations.

895
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,790
(They won the matching sneakers for Round 1!)

896
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,130
- HOSHI really has perfect aim.
- Gosh.

897
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,160
How am I so good?

898
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,500
That's interesting.

899
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,869
You'll be a top marksman in the military.

900
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,539
- He will, won't he?
- Yes.

901
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,969
You get a special leave if you become top marksman.

902
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,970
- You do?
- That's right.

903
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:29,070
Of course.

904
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,370
- All right.
- Okay.

905
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,209
This is the most dangerous moment.

906
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,340
- We now have...
- Yes.

907
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,209
Four tries...

908
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,549
and a free chance with the bonus coupon.

909
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,719
- That's 5 tries.
- So we have 5 tries left.

910
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,149
- I see.
- That's how it works.

911
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,419
- Yes.
- There's no pressure.

912
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,649
- What should we do?
- You can stop now.

913
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,919
- Why are you looking at me?
- I just...

914
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,360
- We should continue.
- Go.

915
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,129
Why did you ask me?

916
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,230
We should continue.

917
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,830
Yes, of course.

918
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,340
When else would I get the chance to laugh like this?

919
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,069
- That's right.
- That's why.

920
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,369
It's okay if we don't win the prizes.

921
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,599
All right.

922
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,739
Why don't we have...

923
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,599
- Why don't you...
- Mr. Lee open the fortune cookie?

924
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,439
- Which one?
- The second one.

925
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,669
"Sleep is the best medicine."

926
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,739
"Relax after a tiring day."

927
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,409
"A bedding set."

928
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,249
- A bedding set.
- That's a really nice brand.

929
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,919
- This is the bedding set.
- Gosh.

930
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,979
- Gosh.
- What's our next mission?

931
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,619
(Round 2)

932
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,490
(The target becomes smaller.)

933
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,159
- Then...
- That's way too small.

934
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,629
Isn't that too small?

935
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,260
Those are the lids of canteens.

936
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,659
Seriously?

937
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,699
That's too small.

938
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,229
This isn't a disadvantage.

939
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,669
- You're right.
- As long as you hit it,

940
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,099
it might fall off easily.

941
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,239
- You're right.
- Wait a second.

942
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,109
- This works well for me.
- We don't need much force.

943
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,779
- You just have to aim correctly.
- I can't do this.

944
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,780
Try it, HOSHI.

945
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,350
- This is tough.
- MINGYU.

946
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,719
I think you and I should hit it this time.

947
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,849
You're right.

948
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,650
- This is hard.
- I haven't hit anything yet.

949
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,159
- This is hard.
- HOSHI and you did it last time.

950
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,320
It was so close.

951
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,999
- You have good aim.
- That was amazing.

952
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,429
- You're a sharpshooter.
- HOSHI.

953
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,629
HOSHI did it.

954
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,750
- HOSHI is good.
- Good job.

955
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,469
- Should we give it a try?
- Okay, let's go.

956
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,739
(HOSHI and MINGYU got the hang of it.)

957
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,509
In 1, 2... This is our 7th try.

958
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,709
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

959
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,790
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

960
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,139
Should I go first?

961
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
- Would you like to go first?
- Let's start with HOSHI.

962
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,309
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

963
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,449
- Since you're good, HOSHI.
- He got the hang of it.

964
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,549
Let's start with one down.

965
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,790
(HOSHI succeeded a moment ago.)

966
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,389
He has good aim.

967
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,820
(The sharpshooter missed.)

968
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,289
(Next is Yeon Seok.)

969
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,590
I was too hasty.

970
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,600
- That was close.
- It was so close.

971
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,959
You would've hit it...

972
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,706
- if it were a canteen.
- This is driving me crazy.

973
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,999
- You're right.
- You would've hit a canteen.

974
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,100
(MINGYU succeeded when he practiced.)

975
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,569
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

976
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,010
It was aimed in the right direction.

977
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,840
- Gosh.
- What?

978
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,949
- It didn't fall off.
- Gosh.

979
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,350
(He hit it, but...)

980
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,750
You did hit it.

981
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,450
Why does it only work when we're practicing? Wait.

982
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,460
Let's see.

983
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,860
The target is too small.

984
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,700
(Even HOSHI, the sharpshooter, feels nervous.)

985
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,460
We have two tries left.

986
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,930
We have two tries left.

987
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,269
Wait a minute.

988
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,929
I have a feeling...

989
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,799
I made a comment I shouldn't have.

990
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,369
Why would you say something so ominous?

991
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,980
There's something about the shoes.

992
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,410
(The curse of the shoes?)

993
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,450
Aiming properly is more important that strength.

994
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,630
- You're right.
- Aiming properly is important.

995
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,689
- Gosh.
- Good job.

996
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,090
(He succeeds in aiming at the lid.)

997
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,889
Yeon Seok is finally...

998
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,819
- showing off his skills.
- Yes.

999
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,990
(He tries again.)

1000
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,899
(He succeeds twice in a row!)

1001
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,559
- I got the hang of it.
- You got the hang of it.

1002
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,046
- We got this. Let's try.
- You got this.

1003
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,169
- I got the hang of it.
- We have two tries left.

1004
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,540
Okay, we'll try.

1005
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,670
I'll go first.

1006
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,109
- Hit one.
- What is this?

1007
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,409
It's about time you showed us your skills.

1008
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,739
Hit one and show us.

1009
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,979
It's about time you showed us your skills.

1010
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,909
- I know.
- Stop being funny.

1011
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,109
- You're right.
- That's right.

1012
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,550
- I've done enough.
- Hit it.

1013
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,020
Wait a second.

1014
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,459
(The cheerleading captain is in the field.)

1015
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,959
- Calm down.
- I'll give you a snack.

1016
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,530
- The gallery stepped in.
- Yes.

1017
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,230
- The gallery.
- It's okay.

1018
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,400
- We're watching you closely.
- I know.

1019
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,639
(Jae Suk fails again.)

1020
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,170
- Jae Suk doesn't even groan now.
- You didn't hit any.

1021
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,579
It was because of Crong.

1022
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,100
If I tried earlier, I would've hit it.

1023
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,380
Here I go.

1024
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,280
(Next is Yeon Seok, who succeeded twice in a row while practicing.)

1025
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,350
It's over.

1026
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,350
- It's over.
- Gosh.

1027
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,589
Why did you say, "It's over?"

1028
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,590
(Yeon Seok's turn is over.)

1029
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,311
- It's what they say in archery.
- Archery?

1030
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,730
It went in the right direction.

1031
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,260
- It didn't work.
- Too bad.

1032
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,970
- I almost hit it.
- MINGYU.

1033
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,140
- Show us something amazing.
- Just hit one.

1034
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,009
Show us what you got.

1035
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,780
I haven't shown you anything yet.

1036
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,109
It's time.

1037
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,110
(Their success depends on these two.)

1038
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,680
(MINGYU hits it!)

1039
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,790
- Nice.
- What?

1040
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,666
- It's about time.
- Just do what you've been doing.

1041
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,889
- Hey.
- Do what you've been doing.

1042
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,059
We got this. Okay, HOSHI.

1043
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,380
Our hero is next. Please succeed.

1044
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,230
(They have a chance to clear Round 2 on their 9th try.)

1045
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,270
(Our hero is up next!)

1046
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,470
(They clear Round 2 if HOSHI hits the lid.)

1047
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,090
(HOSHI and MINGYU did it!)

1048
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,259
(Thanks to their spectacular performance, )

1049
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,729
(they clear Round 2!)

1050
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,170
- Round Two, success!
- Success.

1051
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,639
(Even Crong is jumping in happiness.)

1052
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,070
- How are you so good?
- Amazing.

1053
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,930
- What's with him?
- How is he so good?

1054
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,079
How am I so good?

1055
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,909
He's truly a sharpshooter.

1056
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,550
You're seriously a sharpshooter.

1057
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,889
- You're seriously a sharpshooter.
- How did that work?

1058
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,790
You'll be recruited from training camp.

1059
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:22,089
(He learns of his amazing skill today.)

1060
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,190
Think of that as a comment from your division commander.

1061
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,830
We did it.

1062
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,999
We have one try left.

1063
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,329
I think it'll become even harder.

1064
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,070
- You're right.
- It becomes even harder.

1065
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,710
Make a decision. In 1, 2, 3.

1066
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,510
- Out.
- Stop.

1067
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,909
- She said, "out."
- That's wise of you.

1068
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,109
(Relieved)

1069
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,856
- We thought you'd be too stressed.
- You know what?

1070
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,649
- We did it.
- You two were amazing.

1071
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,879
- We did it.
- We did it.

1072
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,449
(SEVENTEEN was amazing.)

1073
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,949
MINGYU finally showed us his skills at the end.

1074
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,289
I showed you.

1075
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,390
- You overcame the pressure.
- Good job.

1076
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,429
Thanks to you, we'll wear these...

1077
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,689
- when we go hiking.
- Go hiking in them.

1078
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,899
Please take good care of the soldiers.

1079
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,270
- Of course.
- Okay.

1080
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,929
Should we buy ROKA T-shirts here?

1081
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,100
- Should we?
- Yes.

1082
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,039
- Can we buy two of these?
- Nice.

1083
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,009
- Hey.
- Myung Hee, can you help them out?

1084
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,470
I'll buy it for you.

1085
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,939
- Really?
- Jae Suk is paying for them.

1086
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,180
This is mine.

1087
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,749
- Wear it when you work out.
- Let's change into them right now.

1088
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,549
- Can I have some insoles for HOSHI?
- Insoles?

1089
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,079
- Yes.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

1090
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,890
- It's okay.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

1091
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,789
- You need these.
- For my military boots?

1092
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,470
Yes, you need them in your military boots.

1093
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,819
Yeon Seok...

1094
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,130
seems to be sending HOSHI off to the military today.

1095
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,429
I don't know when we'll be able to meet...

1096
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,799
to give this to him since we're busy.

1097
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,439
- Wait.
- What's this?

1098
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,869
It's to share with the production crew.

1099
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,270
- Seriously... Thank you.
- The apples are delicious.

1100
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,669
Thank you.

1101
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,880
- Thank you.
- Did you visit your hometown?

1102
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,749
- HOSHI.
- Visit us again.

1103
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,009
- HOSHI, is this your hometown?
- I know.

1104
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,649
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1105
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,749
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1106
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,490
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1107
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,959
- Our hands are full.
- HOSHI.

1108
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,989
- It looks like...
- I know.

1109
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,189
You are returning after a military leave.

1110
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,190
Jae Suk!

1111
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

1112
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,629
- It's HOSHI.
- Hello.

1113
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,799
Hello.

1114
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,930
MINGYU.

1115
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,130
They know us. That's interesting.

1116
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,940
I'm having so much fun today.

1117
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,569
- Hey.
- We cleared two rounds.

1118
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,886
- Seriously.
- How is that possible?

1119
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,140
- You're a sharpshooter.
- That's right.

1120
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,809
I got a good feeling at the end.

1121
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,879
- You hit the target every time.
- That's right.

1122
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,896
- He really hit it every time.
- Wasn't it thrilling?

1123
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,080
I didn't know I could do it.

1124
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,719
- Should we have lunch?
- Yes, let's have lunch.

1125
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,850
What should we have?

1126
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,389
We have to travel 8km.

1127
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,919
Let's move to that area and eat, Yeon Seok.

1128
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,090
Who volunteered to drive?

1129
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,889
- I'll drive.
- I'm driving.

1130
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,530
- I'll drive.
- Right, MINGYU is driving.

1131
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,059
Let's go.

1132
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,159
(MINGYU drives this time.)

1133
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,070
- Let's see what we feel like.
- Okay.

1134
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,470
- Off we go.
- Let's go.

1135
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,569
If there is anything that looks good...

1136
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,509
- on our way there...
- There's nothing in that area.

1137
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,540
I see.

1138
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,510
(Yeon Seok finds something.)

1139
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,180
It looks like a noodle place.

1140
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,079
What do you think of banquet noodles?

1141
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,040
- That sounds good.
- Banquet noodles sound good.

1142
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,350
They even have cold banquet noodles.

1143
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,989
We can have it with suyuk.

1144
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,159
(Exclaiming in excitement)

1145
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,659
- You like that?
- Yes, it has protein.

1146
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,729
- Banquet noodles are good.
- Good.

1147
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,599
- You're okay with noodles?
- I love it, Yeon Seok.

1148
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,659
- Okay.
- Where is it?

1149
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,829
Is it close by?

1150
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,600
- We turn right, and it's close by.
- I'm starving.

1151
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,439
- I'm hungry too.
- Right?

1152
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Yes.

1153
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:25,810
HOSHI did great today.

1154
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,710
- Jae Suk.
- You're Perfect Aim HOSHI.

1155
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,980
He didn't miss a single time.

1156
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,279
I was surprised to learn of my skills.

1157
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,760
You hit the target almost every time.

1158
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,150
This rarely happens.

1159
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,149
I'd say it never happens, not rarely.

1160
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,789
It never happens?

1161
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,489
- You're right.
- It never happens.

1162
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,529
- You're right.
- Yes.

1163
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,989
You feel a burst of dopamine, don't you?

1164
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,089
- Yes.
- Seriously.

1165
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,329
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yes.

1166
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,659
- This is the taste of success.
- It's unbelievable.

1167
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,129
- It's so good.
- Yes, it is.

1168
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,200
Gosh, it's a tank.

1169
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,569
- Isn't that a tank?
- I don't think it's a tank.

1170
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,269
- It's an armored vehicle.
- It's an armored vehicle.

1171
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,639
The White Skull unit is well-known.

1172
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,409
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, the White Skull unit.

1173
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,580
They say, "White Skull" when saluting.

1174
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,979
I'll be back safely.

1175
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,350
Okay, but don't say goodbye yet.

1176
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,650
We're here. I think it's the next place.

1177
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,959
- I see the restaurant.
- Yes, with the red sign.

1178
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,059
- Can I park here?
- You can park here.

1179
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,260
- I'll park here.
- Okay.

1180
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,100
- MINGYU is a good driver.
- There's another restaurant.

1181
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,529
His driving is smoother than yours.

1182
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,799
- Really?
- Yes.

1183
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,930
"Really?"

1184
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,640
You're even good at parallel parking.

1185
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,640
I had to do it again the moment you said that.

1186
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,040
- That's good.
- That's good.

1187
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,850
- Let's go.
- Thank you for driving.

1188
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,420
- This is it.
- I can't wait to eat.

1189
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,750
- This is good.
- Are they open?

1190
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,590
- Let's ask.
- Gosh.

1191
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,990
- I don't believe it.
- Hello.

1192
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,929
Are you open?

1193
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,899
- Yes.
- Hello.

1194
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
- Gosh.
- Gosh, I don't believe it.

1195
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,770
- We are filming in the area.
- Goodness. I see.

1196
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,869
It's quite an experience visiting places with Jae Suk.

1197
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,810
(An extra warm welcome wherever they go)

1198
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,080
What's on the menu?

1199
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,609
- Young radish noodles.
- Yes, and spicy noodles.

1200
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,949
- Suyuk.
- Banquet noodles.

1201
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,109
The suyuk sounds good.

1202
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,519
They recommend...

1203
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,496
- the young radish noodles.
- I can't make up my mind.

1204
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,220
The owner recommends suyuk.

1205
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,420
We'll have one suyuk.

1206
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,989
- Should we have the bulgogi?
- Yes.

1207
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,989
- Two of them?
- Yes.

1208
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,429
We have to choose the noodles.

1209
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,260
- I want young radish noodles.
- Me too.

1210
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,469
I'm having young radish noodles as well.

1211
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,569
- I'll have banquet noodles.
- Okay.

1212
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,099
We'll also have fritters.

1213
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Fritters?

1214
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,009
- The spicy noodles sound good too.
- Should we order one?

1215
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,469
We'll have 1 banquet noodles, 1 spicy noodles,

1216
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,510
- and 2 young radish noodles.
- Okay, 2 young radish noodles.

1217
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,710
Then... What am I having?

1218
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,279
Since we ordered two young radish noodles,

1219
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,049
- let's share it.
- Okay.

1220
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,220
Gosh.

1221
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,220
I like this restaurant.

1222
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,460
Good job in finding it.

1223
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,929
- Good job in finding it.
- Thanks.

1224
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,230
And the timing is perfect.

1225
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,360
What do you usually have for lunch, HOSHI?

1226
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,370
I start with protein after my workout...

1227
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,769
and try to have something clean...

1228
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,499
for lunch.

1229
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,110
- You know the salads with rice.
- I see.

1230
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,279
- Like poke?
- Yes.

1231
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,800
Then I eat whatever I want for dinner.

1232
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,749
I'm totally the opposite.

1233
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,879
- You are?
- Yes.

1234
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,679
I eat whatever I want for my first meal of the day.

1235
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,560
Then I have a light dinner before going to bed.

1236
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,790
That's a good routine.

1237
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,419
You both have two meals.

1238
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,790
- Yes, two meals.
- Right?

1239
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,430
- This is what I heard.
- What?

1240
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:34,999
There is a certain amount of food I can digest...

1241
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,130
in my whole life.

1242
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,900
- I see.
- Some people say that.

1243
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,970
Where did you hear that?

1244
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,786
- Can you tell us the source?
- It's very...

1245
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,739
The source...

1246
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,040
is a friend from my hometown.

1247
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,949
The source lacks credibility.

1248
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,379
He heard it from someone as well.

1249
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,779
(The source seems to lack credibility.)

1250
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,190
TWICE and SEVENTEEN...

1251
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,630
both debuted over ten years ago.

1252
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,189
It was our tenth anniversary a few days ago.

1253
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,729
And our fans posted old videos of us.

1254
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,769
There was a video of us imagining our tenth anniversary...

1255
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,030
at our first anniversary.

1256
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,039
We congratulated one another for doing a good job...

1257
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,120
for the past 10 years when we were in our early 20s.

1258
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,550
(19-year-old MINGYU, 20-year-old HOSHI)

1259
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,949
MINGYU is very popular right now.

1260
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,179
- That's right.
- You're quite popular.

1261
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,419
- I have to leave now.
- Where to?

1262
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,566
- Where are you going?
- To Hollywood.

1263
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,920
- Hollywood?
- Hollywood?

1264
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,360
DK recently got married.

1265
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,659
(Young and fresh)

1266
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,129
We mentioned someone getting married,

1267
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,700
and some of us were wearing mustaches.

1268
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,199
We were pretending it was our tenth anniversary.

1269
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,929
You thought you'd be old...

1270
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,399
- and married in ten years.
- We exaggerated.

1271
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,139
We mentioned so many changes,

1272
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,769
but ten years have passed,

1273
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,779
and everything is pretty much the same.

1274
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,049
So that felt weird.

1275
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,249
- It's a good thing.
- I love it.

1276
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,079
After being in this industry for ten years,

1277
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,219
I think I'd say that I released a new album...

1278
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,549
and that I'm having a concert when I'm 40.

1279
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,689
- That is possible.
- Yes.

1280
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,990
- Of course.
- You're right.

1281
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,759
(Glancing over his shoulder)

1282
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,090
It'll be relaxing.

1283
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,360
That looks tasty.

1284
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,059
- It's our fritters.
- Should I help serve the food?

1285
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,400
She's working alone.

1286
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,729
Should I take the fritters?

1287
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,799
I'll bring it to you.

1288
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,269
- We'll take it.
- Can I take this?

1289
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,999
- Can I take these two?
- Yes.

1290
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,410
We'll help you.

1291
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,179
- Look at this.
- We have to cut the fritters...

1292
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,580
and dip it in the noodles.

1293
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,710
The suyuk looks tasty.

1294
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,049
Thank you for the food.

1295
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,949
It's a seaweed roll.

1296
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,289
(Freshly fried fritters)

1297
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,590
(Crisp)

1298
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
(Exclaiming)

1299
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,760
(Moaning)

1300
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,000
- The freshly cooked...
- It's tasty.

1301
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,799
- Food tastes the best...
- When it was just cooked.

1302
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,280
- when it's freshly cooked.
- Indeed.

1303
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,340
Right?

1304
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,040
(Standing up)

1305
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,470
Ma'am.

1306
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,579
Yes?

1307
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,679
- Can I take some small plates?
- I'll bring them to you.

1308
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,750
That guy.

1309
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,250
He speaks so kindly.

1310
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,379
- He's very considerate.
- Yes.

1311
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,390
(Polite)

1312
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,049
This suyuk is great.

1313
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,890
- Noodles would go great with it.
- It's so...

1314
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,919
- savory.
- I like this bulgogi too.

1315
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,460
So do I.

1316
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,060
She mixes it right away.

1317
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,729
(Noodles sliding down)

1318
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,930
She's mixing them on the spot.

1319
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,269
I need to go and check it out.

1320
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,370
- That looks great.
- Mixing them on the spot.

1321
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,070
I thought we promised to live relaxedly.

1322
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,040
- It looks delicious.
- It looks so good!

1323
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,540
That looks amazing.

1324
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,710
It looks scrumptious.

1325
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,179
Young radish...

1326
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,579
- Young radish noodles.
- Okay.

1327
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,790
(The main dishes are here.)

1328
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,589
He ordered the spicy noodles.

1329
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,320
(The spicy noodles arrive right after.)

1330
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,160
Some warm banquet noodles must go well with these.

1331
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,360
It looks...

1332
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,360
- It looks so good.
- It does.

1333
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,900
It must be spicy.

1334
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,169
Wrap it up with noodles and put it in.

1335
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,740
(Slurping the noodles instantly)

1336
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,520
It tastes just like noodles my mom makes on a weekend morning.

1337
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,050
- The young radish kimchi is great.
- It is.

1338
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,320
Young radishes are in season.

1339
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,019
They are.

1340
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,460
(Slurping)

1341
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,790
(Slurping as well)

1342
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,260
(Moaning)

1343
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,160
The banquet noodles...

1344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,400
taste good after some spicy food.

1345
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,780
You all must have been starving.

1346
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,140
I was starving.

1347
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,570
I love these banquet noodles.

1348
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,040
- Do you?
- It's amazing.

1349
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,680
It's so good, ma'am.

1350
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,280
One plate of fritters.

1351
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,150
This is lovely, HOSHI.

1352
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,720
(Drinking out of the bowl)

1353
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,060
(Exclaiming)

1354
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,930
It's delicious.

1355
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,589
(They finished the food in no time.)

1356
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,460
- It tastes awesome with fritters.
- Yes.

1357
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,990
The microphone belt is tightening.

1358
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,529
- What's tightening?
- The microphone belt.

1359
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,769
(They had one hearty meal.)

1360
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,540
You're eating a lot today.

1361
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,739
Did you bring your cards?

1362
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,270
- We did.
- We did.

1363
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,680
- Okay. That's good.
- We need to play a game.

1364
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,410
How about this?

1365
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,380
The production crew picks a dish that's on the table...

1366
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,320
and writes it down.

1367
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,820
We'll each pick a dish and say it out loud.

1368
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,989
The one who says the dish that the crew picked...

1369
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,350
- He'll have to pay.
- has to pay.

1370
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,259
You have to say the name...

1371
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,559
- that they didn't pick.
- They didn't pick.

1372
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,169
- Okay.
- From the entire menu?

1373
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,499
- Just among the ones we ordered.
- Sure.

1374
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,899
- Okay.
- Young radish noodles,

1375
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,639
spicy noodles, banquet noodles, suyuk, bulgogi, and fritters.

1376
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,570
Tell us right away if one of us loses.

1377
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,340
I'll go with the one that they won't choose.

1378
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,050
- I feel like you'll lose.
- I might.

1379
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,479
All right. Fritters?

1380
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,819
(Menu)

1381
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,890
- Pass?
- I survived.

1382
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,990
Banquet noodles.

1383
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,989
- You've survived.
- Good.

1384
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,060
(HOSHI survives.)

1385
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,590
They seem flustered.

1386
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,730
(The next person gets cautious.)

1387
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,529
Hold on.

1388
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,829
- MINGYU.
- Suyuk.

1389
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,899
(Menu)

1390
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,140
- Pass?
- You survived.

1391
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,339
- Pass.
- What else is left?

1392
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,109
- What else is left?
- I hope he loses.

1393
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,309
I'm good to go now. There are only three dishes left.

1394
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,509
- Young radish noodles. Bulgogi.
- Young radish, spicy...

1395
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,149
Young radish noodles, spicy noodles, and bulgogi?

1396
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,150
Yes.

1397
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,819
I think my seat is the best.

1398
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,990
Since the owner of this place...

1399
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,419
recommended young radish noodles,

1400
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,089
they may have written that down.

1401
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,090
So, I won't pick that.

1402
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,459
- Spicy noodles?
- Bulgogi.

1403
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,599
(Menu)

1404
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,660
You survived.

1405
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,939
(No way.)

1406
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,840
(Sad and happy)

1407
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,079
- Now...
- That means...

1408
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,679
- it's either of them.
- Yes.

1409
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,586
You have young radish noodles and spicy noodles left.

1410
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,580
Do you want to hold it up?

1411
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,579
Pick one of these two.

1412
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,250
What do you want to choose?

1413
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,259
(Young radish noodles or spicy noodles?)

1414
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,719
Either you win now and HOSHI pays...

1415
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,259
or HOSHI wins.

1416
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,160
- Young radish noodles!
- Spicy noodles, then.

1417
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,860
Jae Suk...

1418
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,899
(Who will pay for the food?)

1419
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,900
Jae Suk,

1420
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,900
you survived.

1421
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,940
(HOSHI loses.)

1422
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,640
- How did we go through everything?
- This is your day.

1423
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,949
This is your day, man.

1424
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,609
Your accuracy rate is 100 percent today.

1425
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,849
It is 100 percent.

1426
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,949
- Something's wrong with you today.
- HOSHI, you...

1427
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,589
It went around a whole lap?

1428
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,159
- I can't believe we got to the end.
- One, two, three, four...

1429
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,420
You were the last one.

1430
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,050
Your accuracy rate is 100 percent.

1431
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,129
I'll pay for the food!

1432
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,360
- Okay.
- All right.

1433
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,036
- Thanks for the food, ma'am.
- HOSHI is doing everything.

1434
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,599
- Thanks for the food, HOSHI.
- Thank you.

1435
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,730
Here's the card.

1436
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,339
- How...
- He's doing everything.

1437
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,500
Yes, the whole table.

1438
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

1439
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:59,910
(MINGYU went to the bathroom.)

1440
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:02,279
- Man, I'm full.
- I got you some presents.

1441
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,379
- What are those?
- What are they?

1442
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,980
It's fresh kimchi. It recently came out.

1443
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,979
- What's this?
- I'm the model for this brand.

1444
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,050
You are?

1445
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,049
I'm a model for a kimchi brand.

1446
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,190
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1447
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,619
I even went to a pop-up store in Japan recently.

1448
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,059
- Really?
- That's nice.

1449
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,129
Your accuracy rate is 100 percent today.

1450
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,490
Everything leads back to him.

1451
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,776
I'm the first idol singer to model for a kimchi brand.

1452
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
You're the first one?

1453
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:25,001
- You really like that title.
- I'm the very first one.

1454
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,099
Thank, HOSHI.

1455
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,999
We should have eaten it with banquet noodles.

1456
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,840
We could have eaten it with the food just now.

1457
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,680
Thanks. I'll enjoy it at home.

1458
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,839
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you for the food.

1459
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,249
- Sure.
- The food was delicious.

1460
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,179
- Goodbye.
- Thank you very much.

1461
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,350
Take care.

1462
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,319
I even got presents today.

1463
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,819
What did you do while I was gone, HOSHI?

1464
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,459
- He gave us kimchi.
- He gave us kimchi.

1465
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,359
- I got you one too.
- He's the model.

1466
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,990
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

1467
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,029
Take it. It's fresh kimchi.

1468
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,000
HOSHI is...

1469
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,399
- giving us so many good things.
- I love it.

1470
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,540
It makes me feel good.

1471
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,339
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

1472
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,969
- Let's go.
- Let's go, guys.

1473
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,339
We have about 30 minutes left.

1474
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,279
- Should we get some coffee?
- Should we?

1475
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,709
Why don't we have coffee?

1476
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,780
I'll look it up. There must be a shop nearby.

1477
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,579
- Let's find a coffee shop.
- Yes.

1478
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,120
It's a little far.

1479
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,489
- On foot?
- No, let's take the car.

1480
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,159
- Take the car?
- It's at the end of this road.

1481
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,159
- Let's walk, then.
- Shall we?

1482
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,690
- Yes.
- Let's digest our food, then.

1483
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:24,960
Sure.

1484
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,560
Hold on.

1485
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,130
This is...

1486
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,900
How should I put it?

1487
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,400
I love the view.

1488
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,840
- Should we drive there?
- Why? Is it too far?

1489
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,310
No, there's a coffee shop with a nice view.

1490
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,010
It's on the way too. What do you say?

1491
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,590
The one we're going now is at the end of this road.

1492
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,950
Coffee to go?

1493
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,790
No, it's only a three-minute drive.

1494
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,490
Fine.

1495
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,770
It is a lot of work, but...

1496
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,790
I think it's cumbersome, but since you want to go...

1497
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,729
I found a different one with a better view.

1498
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,090
I wouldn't call it a view, though.

1499
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,229
It's better to drive than to walk.

1500
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,390
- It's on the way, anyway.
- It is pretty hot outside.

1501
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,870
Counting stars

1502
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,380
- Pearls in the night sky - But we have to be there...

1503
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,450
- by 2:30pm.
- Yes, it's the same direction.

1504
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,679
- We have to go up, anyway.
- Okay.

1505
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,920
HOSHI literally did everything.

1506
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,420
- HOSHI.
- Are we driving there?

1507
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,149
What's that?

1508
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,890
- What is it?
- We got changed.

1509
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,419
- Get in.
- Salute.

1510
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,090
- We changed into it.
- Salute.

1511
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,160
- Okay. Good.
- Let's go!

1512
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,899
One might think you finished your military duty.

1513
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,100
This is great.

1514
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,899
Now, that's a patriot.

1515
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,439
- Indeed.
- Good.

1516
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,210
- To show support for the ROK Army.
- Yes.

1517
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,809
You're naturally curious about those T-shirts before you go.

1518
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,940
- I didn't go to the army yet, - Yes.

1519
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,579
So I do wonder.

1520
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,620
And many people wear those T-shirts nowadays.

1521
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,379
- It's nicely designed.
- It is.

1522
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,019
Also, now I know what size I should wear.

1523
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,219
A size 100 is too big for me.

1524
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,359
- I should wear a size 95.
- Does a size 95 suit you?

1525
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,460
Yes.

1526
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,190
It's scorching outside.

1527
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,789
I think we're here.

1528
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,900
It's over 30°C.

1529
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,430
- Are we there yet? Where?
- We're taking this road?

1530
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,270
Wait. Is this it?

1531
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,340
Where are you taking us?

1532
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,799
- What...
- Are we...

1533
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,170
going to plant rice?

1534
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,320
Are you sure we're going to a coffee shop?

1535
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,770
It says it's this way.

1536
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,510
Really?

1537
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,479
- Yes.
- Yeon Seok, you really...

1538
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,849
(There's a coffee shop at a place like this?)

1539
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,480
- Is this really it?
- It must be.

1540
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,120
Is there really a coffee shop?

1541
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,019
Where are you taking us?

1542
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,020
(Distrustful)

1543
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,219
That's what it says.

1544
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,119
I like how boldly you drive.

1545
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,320
I used to be a driver soldier.

1546
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,060
This is it.

1547
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,590
Here?

1548
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,899
"Here?"

1549
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,859
Where did you bring us?

1550
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,800
I knew we should have gone to the first one.

1551
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,030
But he is following the GPS.

1552
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,670
Is it a coffee shop for cows?

1553
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,539
There's no way there's a coffee shop here!

1554
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,540
But this is it.

1555
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,969
- That's not a coffee shop.
- It's a coffee shop.

1556
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,280
- It is.
- See?

1557
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,379
(How come there's a coffee shop here?)

1558
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,410
It really is.

1559
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,149
- Yeon Seok.
- How...

1560
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,349
- It is a coffee shop.
- I think we went behind it.

1561
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,419
- Not the main road.
- I see.

1562
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,489
Hold on.

1563
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:08,290
- The coffee shop is...
- And it's a view of rice paddies.

1564
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,089
We should be driving a cultivator.

1565
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,900
Yes, it's literally a farm road.

1566
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,260
This is such a rare place...

1567
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,800
- to open a coffee shop.
- It certainly is.

1568
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,729
- There's the coffee shop.
- Over there.

1569
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,640
- Yes.
- Here it is.

1570
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,440
It's got a large parking lot.

1571
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,540
- Here it is.
- Look at that.

1572
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,840
- It's so unique.
- This is something.

1573
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,110
Let's check it out.

1574
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,810
This place is awesome.

1575
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,419
It really is.

1576
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,679
I told you there was a coffee shop!

1577
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,249
- Stop doubting me.
- And it's a pretty one.

1578
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,289
- You were right.
- It looks very nice.

1579
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,426
- It even looks nice.
- I thought it'd have a nice view.

1580
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,089
- It even looks new.
- What the heck?

1581
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,959
You two look like soldiers on leave.

1582
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,030
Right?

1583
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,460
(Sitting outside after ordering)

1584
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,499
(Opening)

1585
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,099
- Streusel buns suit you perfectly.
- This is...

1586
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,469
- You think so?
- something you see...

1587
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,569
- Why does it suit you so well?
- This feels weird.

1588
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,009
- Give it a taste.
- Okay.

1589
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,739
It even resonates.

1590
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,639
Yes, there's an echo.

1591
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,640
Right.

1592
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,880
- It's good.
- Yes.

1593
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,300
Why does it feel like it's been so long since my last streusel bun?

1594
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,790
- Right?
- Yes.

1595
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,190
It's so nice and moist.

1596
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,859
- They have great buns.
- Right?

1597
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,890
(Enjoying their break with the reminiscent buns)

1598
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,030
This is true bread.

1599
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,259
(Healing with a peaceful backdrop)

1600
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,269
It's so good.

1601
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,769
(The view of rice paddies)

1602
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,400
I love how we can see the rice paddies.

1603
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,270
I feel so happy.

1604
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,469
- It's therapeutic.
- It's been so long.

1605
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,640
- Right? It feels pretty nice.
- It does.

1606
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,639
- Shall we get going now?
- Yes.

1607
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,680
Let's go.

1608
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,610
That was great. Thank you for the food!

1609
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,049
Thank you for the food.

1610
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,650
- Thanks for the food.
- Thank you.

1611
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,349
- Thank you!
- I hope your business thrives.

1612
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,990
- Your bread tastes so good.
- Thank you.

1613
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,560
I'm full.

1614
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,360
Yoo Jae Suk!

1615
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,089
Hello, ma'am!

1616
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,530
There's a senior center right next to it.

1617
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,000
We need to be somewhere by 2:30pm, so...

1618
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,039
- Stay healthy!
- Stay healthy!

1619
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,939
(Drive safely.)

1620
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,310
- Man.
- They're adorable.

1621
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,150
You get a free pass when you're with Jae Suk.

1622
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,149
(Spotting someone)

1623
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,150
There they are.

1624
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:15,719
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1625
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,819
- Their smiles are so...
- They're so welcoming.

1626
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,719
I know, right? It's beautiful.

1627
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,020
They're so warm-hearted.

1628
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,790
This is...

1629
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,790
peace at its finest.

1630
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,599
- How can it be this peaceful?
- Right?

1631
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,730
There are so few people too.

1632
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,530
When I get older,

1633
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,999
I'm thinking of becoming a farmer.

1634
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,140
Seriously?

1635
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,910
I feel like you can.

1636
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,310
- I think it'll suit me.
- I agree.

1637
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,179
Growing plants...

1638
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,239
- You like such things.
- and working at a farm.

1639
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,379
- And build a fire.
- Yes.

1640
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,780
- You can start a fire well.
- Yes.

1641
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,320
He knows how to light a fire.

1642
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,890
We're here.

1643
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:54,090
We're almost there. It's just one more turn.

1644
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,059
Yu Ja Yeong.

1645
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,060
- Yu Ja Yeong.
- Yu Ja Yeong.

1646
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:59,529
"Operation Find Kim Da Hun."

1647
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,799
- What?
- What?

1648
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,059
"Specialties, soccer and riding a unicycle."

1649
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,330
- No way.
- "Hobbies."

1650
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,839
"Chatting with friends, looking at stars, and camping."

1651
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,339
"Be a surprise gift to my son, Da Hun,"

1652
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,439
"who's living energetically with his 23 friends."

1653
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,979
- Wait.
- "If you greet him by saying,"

1654
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,049
"'White Skull, ' he'll love it."

1655
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,079
What?

1656
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,409
We must be going to the division of White Skull.

1657
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,479
Right. Did his mother apply for this?

1658
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,519
- I guess so.
- She sent us to her son's unit.

1659
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,820
- I guess so.
- That must be it.

1660
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,190
Is it a military camp?

1661
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,190
No, right? That would require...

1662
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,860
"School zone."

1663
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,399
- That means...
- I think we're going to a school.

1664
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,770
- we're going to a school.
- Yes.

1665
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,629
- It feels...
- But...

1666
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,940
if we fail with all those children watching...

1667
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,039
- Oh, no.
- That's a lot of pressure.

1668
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,440
It's going to be a lot of pressure.

1669
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,739
It'll be really pressuring.

1670
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,910
- Their dreams and hopes...
- I was right.

1671
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,309
It's an elementary school.

1672
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,579
(Headed to an elementary school)

1673
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,820
- Good English.
- Elementary school. Okay.

1674
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,450
- Here?
- Here.

1675
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,749
Here. Thank you.

1676
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,050
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you.

1677
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,519
Who did you say bye to?

1678
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,590
To all of you.

1679
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,129
(They arrived at their second spare time.)

1680
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,600
I ate so much, though.

1681
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,130
Do you want to take a photo?

1682
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,199
We need to take a selfie.

1683
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,400
(The ROKAs take a photo to remember this moment.)

1684
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,200
That looks...

1685
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,269
like a mirror selfie for Gen Z.

1686
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,310
I like it.

1687
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,740
I'm going to do a tiger pose.

1688
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
Salute.

1689
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,779
In 1, 2, 3. Okay.

1690
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,809
(The variety show commander and new recruits)

1691
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,579
Hang on. Is school over?

1692
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,749
(They're at Dochang Elementary School.)

1693
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,019
- No, I think...
- It must be lunchtime.

1694
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,989
Will elementary school kids know who SEVENTEEN is?

1695
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,119
Of course, they do.

1696
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,190
Do you think so?

1697
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,130
This is a nice-looking school.

1698
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,589
- I know.
- It looks beautiful.

1699
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,199
- Right? It's so lovely.
- It's colorful.

1700
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,959
They're separated...

1701
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,329
- into different buildings.
- It's because the number...

1702
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,399
- of students has reduced.
- Right.

1703
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,569
(A small school with various colors)

1704
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,969
- The elementary school...
- It's adorable.

1705
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,039
- The colors make it...
- Yes.

1706
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,569
- look like a Lego school.
- It's so colorful.

1707
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,339
Wait. Are we going that way?

1708
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,380
- Is that where we're going?
- Was his name Da Un?

1709
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,379
- Da Hun.
- Da Hun?

1710
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,679
Do they have from 1st-graders to 6th-graders?

1711
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,380
- I believe so.
- Yes.

1712
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,149
HOSHI and MINGYU,

1713
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,249
- when you went to school, - Yes.

1714
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,489
How many students were there in a class?

1715
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,560
We had 40.

1716
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,819
- That's still a lot.
- I think we also had 40.

1717
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,829
That's a lot.

1718
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,259
We had like 6 to 8 classes in a grade,

1719
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,199
- so there were about 300 students.
- That's so many.

1720
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,869
- Same.
- There are still that many kids...

1721
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:17,899
- in their generation.
- Yes.

1722
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,529
But that's not the case nowadays.

1723
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,769
Don't be too surprised when I say this.

1724
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:22,069
Back in my days, we had 62 kids in a class.

1725
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,639
Seriously? In one class?

1726
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,369
- Sixty-two?
- Sixty-two.

1727
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,039
- Oh, 62 kids.
- And there were 14 classes or so.

1728
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,839
- That's true.
- Gosh.

1729
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,179
- "Visitors."
- "Visitors."

1730
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,379
They have a shoe rack for visitors.

1731
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,509
(They find a shoe rack.)

1732
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,880
It feels so...

1733
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,479
Hang on.

1734
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,749
Here's Da Hun.

1735
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,119
There he is.

1736
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,289
We found him.

1737
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,889
- Who is it?
- Hi.

1738
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,919
- Is Da Hun here?
- Yes.

1739
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,259
- Who's Da Hun?
- Where is he?

1740
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,189
- I saw you on TV!
- It's Yoo Jae Suk.

1741
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,199
Yes, it's Jae Suk.

1742
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,029
- Da Hun...
- I saw you on TV!

1743
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,869
I've only seen you on TV.

1744
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,200
- Really?
- It's crazy to see you in person!

1745
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,539
(Finding her cute)

1746
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,010
I also think it's crazy.

1747
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,339
- Where?
- He's in fourth grade.

1748
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,939
- Fourth grade.
- He's in fourth grade?

1749
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,139
Da Hun is in fourth grade?

1750
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,509
- He's in fourth grade.
- Wait. This school looks pretty!

1751
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,410
- It's so nice.
- Gosh.

1752
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:07,779
- How...
- Oh, my.

1753
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,379
- They have an inner court.
- It looks so nice.

1754
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,719
- It's fantastic.
- It's like the one on TV.

1755
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,720
(Full of warm sunlight)

1756
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:14,590
- It's very nicely designed.
- I know.

1757
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,919
- This is...
- How...

1758
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,989
This is...

1759
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,259
- Hello.
- Hello.

1760
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,399
- No way!
- Is Da Hun...

1761
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,629
He's over there.

1762
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,100
- Is he?
- In fourth grade?

1763
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,606
- Look at their genuine reactions.
- School's not over yet, right?

1764
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,269
- I'm looking at it in real-time.
- It's over.

1765
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,099
- School's over?
- Yes.

1766
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,040
Great. Kids.

1767
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,980
It's Yoo Jae Suk!

1768
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,709
(Rushing)

1769
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,056
- It's Mr. Yoo Jae Suk.
- Call me Mr. Yoo.

1770
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,009
(Right into his arms)

1771
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,080
Do I...

1772
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,980
Do I know you?

1773
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,950
Thank you for the warm welcome.

1774
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,360
They're members of SEVENTEEN.

1775
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,729
HOSHI and MINGYU.

1776
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,259
- Do you know SEVENTEEN?
- Hello.

1777
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,329
- Good.
- Hi.

1778
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,199
- And this is Yeon Seok.
- Hi.

1779
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,400
- He's one polite kid.
- He is.

1780
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,629
(Get over here.)

1781
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,869
- Why...
- She dragged him away.

1782
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,339
I think he's in the class for fourth-graders.

1783
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,740
(Everything is unpredictable here.)

1784
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,979
He came right into his arms.

1785
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,379
Hello.

1786
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,380
(Carefully entering the class for 4th-graders)

1787
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:10,779
- You must be Da Hun!
- Hi.

1788
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,049
- How did you know?
- Is Da Hun here?

1789
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,419
- Yes.
- How did you know?

1790
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,879
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1791
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,119
(Pointing at Da Hun)

1792
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,519
- Are you still in class, ma'am?
- So you're Da Hun.

1793
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,989
No. The kids were waiting...

1794
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,559
- for the after-school programs.
- I see.

1795
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,520
- Will you come with us?
- Will you come with us?

1796
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,229
- Follow us.
- Come over here.

1797
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,259
(They'll leave the classroom and talk more.)

1798
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,259
Is your mother Yu Ja Yeong?

1799
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,169
- Yes.
- It really was his mother.

1800
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,039
Your mother applied for this.

1801
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,970
I think your mother did.

1802
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,640
- She asked us to find you.
- This is...

1803
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,339
- the best part of life.
- Right.

1804
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,409
Come here, kids.

1805
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,410
(Getting ready to talk to the kids)

1806
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,410
Come on.

1807
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:44,749
What's going on all of a sudden?

1808
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,979
This is so sudden.

1809
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,580
What is happening?

1810
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,419
I think your mom applied for something.

1811
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,449
I guess.

1812
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,350
(Dumbfounded)

1813
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,089
(What is going on?)

1814
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,490
More friends are coming.

1815
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,860
Hi.

1816
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,260
You're handsome.

1817
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,200
We weren't the only ones.

1818
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,439
(The students of Dochang Elementary gather one by one.)

1819
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,839
- Hi.
- Here...

1820
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,840
The soldiers are watching.

1821
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,780
What?

1822
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,480
Oh, there they are.

1823
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,309
(They spotted actual soldiers.)

1824
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,379
White Skull!

1825
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,119
- White Skull!
- White Skull!

1826
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,480
Salute!

1827
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,589
(The way they all salute is pretty out of the ordinary.)

1828
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,959
Probably all our dads are soldiers, except for his.

1829
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,959
His, mine, and Min Ji's.

1830
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,029
Oh, most of their fathers are soldiers.

1831
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,390
- I see.
- I see.

1832
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,729
(If you greet him by saying, "White Skull," he'll love it.)

1833
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,130
(Oh, that's why she wrote that!)

1834
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,770
In fact,

1835
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,169
Da Hun's mother...

1836
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,139
- applied for this.
- She did.

1837
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,640
Did you not know, Da Hun?

1838
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,179
Sorry?

1839
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,180
He didn't know.

1840
01:01:48,181 --> 01:01:49,939
She did say something,

1841
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,050
but she never told me someone was coming.

1842
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,419
She totally kept you in the dark.

1843
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,720
I was on my way to class at the playground,

1844
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,559
- and I saw a camera for TV.
- Right.

1845
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,519
I thought, "Are they filming a show here?"

1846
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,160
And the other guys screamed, "Yoo Jae Suk is here!"

1847
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,059
He said...

1848
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,659
that Yoo Jae Suk was here in the library.

1849
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,169
So, we ran out...

1850
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,229
(Almighty Yoo's visit was the talk of the town.)

1851
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,629
Thanks, kids.

1852
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,569
I think I can stay in this industry...

1853
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,769
for ten more years because you recognized me.

1854
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,209
Thank you very much.

1855
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,879
Yes, ten more years.

1856
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,339
- That was...
- She clapped as she said that.

1857
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,549
(Happy)

1858
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,110
Thank you, Bo Reum.

1859
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,619
Sorry for the late introduction.

1860
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,419
I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

1861
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,089
That's Uncle Yoo Yeon Seok.

1862
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:33,449
- Hello.
- Yes.

1863
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,289
And you know about SEVENTEEN, right?

1864
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,319
- Yes!
- Yes!

1865
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,359
- You do?
- From SEVENTEEN,

1866
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,729
- MINGYU...
- My aunt is a fan.

1867
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:40,899
Your aunt...

1868
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,229
She's a fan of yours.

1869
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,260
Her aunt?

1870
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,730
- She's a fan.
- Well, it's a ten-year-old band.

1871
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,800
"Aunt?"

1872
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,269
- You're a ten-year-old band, so...
- How time flies.

1873
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,270
Her aunt is a fan.

1874
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,370
MINGYU just said, "Aunt?"

1875
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,809
Thank you. Will you thank her for me?

1876
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,779
They're HOSHI and MINGYU.

1877
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,820
They're members of SEVENTEEN.

1878
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,920
A big round of applause!

1879
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,189
Thanks. Do you know the song "Super?"

1880
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,949
- Yes.
- Thanks, everyone.

1881
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,789
This school looks pretty small.

1882
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,189
How many students are there in total?

1883
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:11,489
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-three.

1884
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,330
There are 23 kids in total?

1885
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,230
And how many of them are here?

1886
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,599
- We have 12 of them.
- Half of them are here.

1887
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,169
- Half of them came?
- Yes.

1888
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,829
Are the four of you the only fourth-graders?

1889
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

1890
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,899
Half of the school is with us.

1891
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,109
Oh, I see.

1892
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,839
Is there a class president?

1893
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,079
- We don't have a class president.
- We don't have a class president.

1894
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,379
You don't have a class president.

1895
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,439
We have one in third grade.

1896
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,679
- There's one in third grade.
- Ha Eun is.

1897
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,179
- Ha Eun is the class president?
- Ha Eun is the class president?

1898
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,520
- In third grade?
- Yes.

1899
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,349
But we take turns to do it.

1900
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,819
You take turns to be the class president.

1901
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,620
- All of us do it once.
- Is that so?

1902
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,619
Which hair salon do you guys go to?

1903
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,729
- Your styles are similar.
- We...

1904
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,650
- His mother's place.
- His mother's hair salon.

1905
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,630
I knew it. All of you were so stylish.

1906
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,169
- HOSHI.
- Yes?

1907
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,199
I never thought about...

1908
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
- asking that question.
- That was good.

1909
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:56,269
Their hairstyles had this similar gap.

1910
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:57,539
They were neat.

1911
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,039
So you all go to Chan Yeong's mother's hair salon?

1912
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,409
- Yes.
- His mother must be...

1913
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,739
a really good hairdresser.

1914
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,440
She styled their hair for them.

1915
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,679
Da Hun, did you attend this school...

1916
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,549
since you were a first grader?

1917
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,319
- No.
- Did you transfer to this school?

1918
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,419
- Yes.
- I see.

1919
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,426
What do you think about this school since you transferred to here?

1920
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,559
I like it. There are many physical activities.

1921
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,889
I see. Because there are many physical activities.

1922
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:16,890
There must be many activities that you can use your body.

1923
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:20,759
Oh, right. There were hints for us to find you.

1924
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,799
- There were soccer and unicycle.
- That's right.

1925
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,269
- A unicycle?
- Can you ride a unicycle, Da Hun?

1926
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,440
Well, I'm not that good, but...

1927
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,769
- You know you're good at it.
- He can ride it well?

1928
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,039
If your friends say so, it means you're really good at it.

1929
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,239
- You're friends are saying so.
- He's the best...

1930
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,439
among the fourth graders.

1931
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,609
- I see.
- Among the fourth graders?

1932
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,110
(He's acknowledged as the best unicycle rider.)

1933
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,449
When we run a lap, he runs 30 laps.

1934
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,450
- Really?
- He said so.

1935
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:45,689
Not 30 laps, but...

1936
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,259
So Da Hun is a friend who Soo Hyuk respects.

1937
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,260
There's nothing Da Hun can't do.

1938
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,859
- My goodness.
- So Da Hun is a role model for you.

1939
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,229
- Yes.
- A cool friend.

1940
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,029
- That's true.
- He's a friend who he respects.

1941
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,030
- Is that so?
- He's almost like...

1942
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:00,769
So Da Hun is good at riding a unicycle.

1943
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,199
What are you good at, Si Yoon?

1944
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,239
- I don't know.
- He's good at running.

1945
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,240
- He's good at running?
- Running.

1946
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:05,369
- He's the fastest...
- He's the fastest one.

1947
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,686
- among the third graders.
- He's fast?

1948
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:07,979
Then Chan Yeong...

1949
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,510
But he's no match for Da Hun.

1950
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,479
- Goodness.
- He is...

1951
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,309
- I can see that he respects Da Hun.
- He's fast though.

1952
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,119
- Right.
- I see.

1953
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,719
- And Ha Eun plays the piano well?
- No.

1954
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,149
- Chan Yeong too.
- It's Chan Yeong.

1955
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,589
- He's good at playing the piano.
- Is that so?

1956
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,590
So he plays the piano well. How about Eun Ji?

1957
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,159
- Drawing.
- She's good at drawing.

1958
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,489
- So she's a good painter.
- I'm good at drawing too.

1959
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,460
- What about Hae Eun?
- You see...

1960
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,260
They all know each other very well.

1961
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,129
Even if they don't answer directly,

1962
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:33,629
- They know each other inside out.
- their friends tell us everything.

1963
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,340
- I know.
- They can tell us everything.

1964
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,899
What about Soo Hyuk? What are you good at?

1965
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,509
- Ssireum.
- Are you good at ssireum?

1966
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,270
- Ssireum.
- You lost to me.

1967
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,079
Keep it down.

1968
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,109
Min Hyuk.

1969
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,249
I don't think Soo Hyuk would lose to someone easily.

1970
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,250
(Fuming)

1971
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,480
Keep it down.

1972
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:50,520
- He told him to keep it down.
- "Keep it down."

1973
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,750
(It really hurt his pride.)

1974
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,190
I won all of them except her.

1975
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,659
So you won all of them except for Eun Ji?

1976
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,090
- Yes.
- You're lying.

1977
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,930
I told you to stop.

1978
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,229
(It gets tense as it's a matter of their pride.)

1979
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,239
You know what? We're going to...

1980
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,969
- play a game now.
- Okay.

1981
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,440
There are a total of 3 rounds. If we succeed in 10 tries,

1982
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,516
- we'll give you presents.
- That's right.

1983
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,679
I saw it.

1984
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,009
- You did?
- I saw it too.

1985
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,549
- You guys saw it?
- Yes.

1986
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,220
I saw them bouncing a ping-pong ball.

1987
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,880
(She gets nervous already.)

1988
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:26,689
We'll throw the dice to get a number to decide how many times...

1989
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,689
- Da Hun can participate.
- Right.

1990
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,989
- Let MINGYU do it this time.
- Right. MINGYU, you throw it.

1991
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,789
It'll be more fun when we do it together,

1992
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,160
so I'll try to roll a two.

1993
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,400
All right.

1994
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,700
(Curious)

1995
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,570
- Here it goes.
- Please.

1996
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,910
(He got a 0.)

1997
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,710
(Here it is.)

1998
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,280
My goodness.

1999
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,010
- Zero?
- We got a zero.

2000
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,749
I'm so sorry.

2001
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,089
- Zero, it is.
- Gosh, this is...

2002
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,730
We should have gotten a different number.

2003
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,359
- There's no mercy here.
- There's no mercy.

2004
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,619
- So there's no way around it?
- Well...

2005
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,829
- No, there's none.
- There's no way.

2006
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:07,399
When you break this cookie, it'll show you the present.

2007
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,600
Do you want to break it?

2008
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,329
- Gosh, fortune cookies.
- Break it in here.

2009
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,869
- Cookies.
- You'll see the present in it.

2010
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:12,970
Please read it.

2011
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,070
What is it?

2012
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,799
- "Twelve Nike backpacks."
- Two Nike backpacks? No, twelve.

2013
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,870
Twelve.

2014
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,740
- We must win them.
- What is it?

2015
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,379
- What is it?
- Twelve Nike backpacks.

2016
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,500
(He feels pressure already.)

2017
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,810
- Twelve?
- My goodness.

2018
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,879
Twelve Nike backpacks.

2019
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,320
(All eyes are on the present.)

2020
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,219
- We must win them.
- Amazing.

2021
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,819
(We become 1 with our favorite friendship item, 12 Nike backpacks)

2022
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,259
It would be so nice.

2023
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,160
Remember. You will all have them if we win.

2024
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,729
- We're getting all of them?
- So...

2025
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,199
- Yes, you'll have them all.
- So...

2026
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,829
You have to cheer for us, okay?

2027
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:45,869
- Okay.
- Okay.

2028
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,670
- We'll do well.
- Okay.

2029
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,499
- Okay.
- We need to focus.

2030
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,500
- We can do it.
- Right.

2031
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:51,539
So what's the game?

2032
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,439
(Cooperation! Bouncing Ball)

2033
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,450
(Four players bounce a ball using a board to throw it into a goal.)

2034
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,249
- With a board?
- What is the board?

2035
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,619
- You bounce the ball like this.
- I see. Like this.

2036
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,690
So it needs teamwork.

2037
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,489
Do we have to keep bouncing it?

2038
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,960
- Hold the strings.
- Right.

2039
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:10,790
Grab two strings each. We should...

2040
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,789
- We should do it like this.
- Gosh.

2041
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,790
(They need to bounce the ball and put it into the goal.)

2042
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:15,699
- This is so hard.
- Gosh, this is tough.

2043
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,429
- We've done that with the jegi.
- We've done it.

2044
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:19,929
- That's right.
- We messed it up.

2045
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,939
That's really tough.

2046
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:21,969
This is going to be tough.

2047
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,546
- Let's try. Let's practice.
- Ready, go.

2048
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,669
- Gosh.
- What is this?

2049
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,709
- You can do it!
- Let's do it at the same time.

2050
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,379
- We got this.
- You can do it.

2051
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,610
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2052
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,479
- Gosh, what is this?
- This is tough.

2053
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,679
(It's not easy to move forward.)

2054
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,296
- What do we do?
- It'll be hard for the kids too.

2055
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,619
How will they do this?

2056
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,719
- You should make the grip short.
- Make it short.

2057
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,719
- A short grip?
- Make it shorter.

2058
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,859
Someone who's close to the ball should follow it.

2059
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,259
- We should follow it?
- I see.

2060
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,989
Okay. Here we go.

2061
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,960
- Ready.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2062
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,799
- Good.
- It's better with a short grip.

2063
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,529
- All right.
- We got this.

2064
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,469
- I think we can do it. Good.
- Okay.

2065
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:57,270
- Five, six.
- We can do this.

2066
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,109
(They advance to the goal.)

2067
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,909
- Hold on.
- All right.

2068
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,480
- Good.
- Okay.

2069
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,109
- Gosh. It came out.
- It's out?

2070
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,590
(The ball bounced off from the goal.)

2071
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,549
- Gosh. It came out.
- It's out?

2072
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,649
We need to make it a bit weaker.

2073
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,119
(They must not be off guard until the end.)

2074
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,549
Gosh, that was close.

2075
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,510
- They were practicing anyway.
- You can do this.

2076
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,959
- Let's practice the last part.
- All right.

2077
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,189
I think we'll be able to get to the goal.

2078
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,729
Ready, go.

2079
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,459
(They practice in front of the goal.)

2080
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,460
Go this way.

2081
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,959
- Go this way. All right.
- Okay.

2082
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,069
Here.

2083
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,229
(It bounced off after hitting the goal.)

2084
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,170
- I think we can do this.
- Let's go!

2085
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,039
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2086
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,669
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2087
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,039
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2088
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,679
- This is...
- Let's practice one more time.

2089
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,109
- We need to finish it in one go.
- If we fail...

2090
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,750
- in front of the children...
- Let's go!

2091
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,919
- We should get them the backpacks.
- Right. We must get them.

2092
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,679
- Let's do this.
- Let's bounce the ball lower.

2093
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,779
- Let's do it.
- All right.

2094
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,789
We got this.

2095
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:45,790
(Positive HOSHI)

2096
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:48,119
We'll go now. Can you give us a cheer?

2097
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,559
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2098
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,489
If we put this in it, you can take the backpacks, okay?

2099
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:52,560
All right!

2100
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,460
- We must take that backpack.
- Please.

2101
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,360
All right. The first try.

2102
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,699
- Okay. Good. Let's do it well.
- Make it low.

2103
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,269
- Let's do it right.
- Okay.

2104
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:02,869
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

2105
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,269
Tighten the rope, okay?

2106
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,609
(They begin their first try.)

2107
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,309
- Make it slow.
- Okay.

2108
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,909
- All right.
- We're doing great.

2109
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,779
- It's okay.
- We got this. This is good.

2110
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,479
- Good.
- One, two.

2111
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,849
- Go. Make it slow. Hey.
- Okay.

2112
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:17,219
- Good.
- One, two, three, four.

2113
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,849
- It's done when we put it in.
- Let's go.

2114
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,049
- Slowly.
- Okay. Good.

2115
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,260
(The children look at them with high expectations.)

2116
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,059
(They arrived at the goal.)

2117
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,559
- Don't trip the goal.
- We got this. All right.

2118
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,060
- Let's make it low.
- Hold on. Okay.

2119
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,800
(They just need to put it in the goal.)

2120
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,830
Okay.

2121
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,070
Okay.

2122
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,640
- All right. Hold on. Okay.
- Let's make it low.

2123
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,550
Okay.

2124
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,850
(Very nice)

2125
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:52,790
Okay.

2126
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,990
(They succeeded on their first try.)

2127
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,489
Yes!

2128
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:00,190
(Exclaiming)

2129
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,530
- Yes!
- I love you!

2130
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,970
I love you!

2131
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,799
(Soo Hyuk hugs Jae Suk.)

2132
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,000
- Okay.
- Goodness.

2133
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,040
We succeeded.

2134
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,240
- My goodness.
- We did it.

2135
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,779
(They're so proud of themselves.)

2136
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,650
Did you see it?

2137
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:22,779
- Did you see it?
- We did. We saw it clearly.

2138
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,490
- We succeeded.
- Round one. Success.

2139
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,289
(They succeeded in Round 1.)

2140
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,690
- Goodness.
- We succeeded.

2141
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,359
- How did we do this?
- It was amazing.

2142
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,829
- This wasn't easy.
- It was amazing.

2143
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:32,929
Gosh, we did it.

2144
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:33,930
(Everything works for HOSHI today.)

2145
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:36,059
- Gosh, we did it today.
- We did it.

2146
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,400
(The ROKAs are on a roll today.)

2147
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,899
- It was amazing, right?
- Yes.

2148
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,500
Everyone. You got the backpacks.

2149
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,210
Applaud.

2150
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,810
So now,

2151
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,609
- Da Hun.
- Yes?

2152
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:53,449
You need to decide whether you want to go for the second round or not.

2153
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:54,949
- Well, what should I do?
- Let's go.

2154
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:58,489
For Round Two, there will be a better prize,

2155
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,019
but the game would be harder.

2156
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,289
We have many tries left though.

2157
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:03,420
- We have nice tries left.
- Okay.

2158
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,059
You need to decide whether you want to go or stop.

2159
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,429
- For the second round.
- Let's do it.

2160
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:10,329
- Should we try it? Shout, "Go!"
- In 1, 2, 3.

2161
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,470
- Go!
- Go!

2162
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,929
- Go.
- Okay.

2163
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,940
Men should go for it no matter what.

2164
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,569
"I want to see the stars more clearly."

2165
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,569
- "NASA astronomical telescope."
- "NASA astronomical telescope."

2166
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,309
"NASA astronomical telescope."

2167
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:24,710
- It's a telescope.
- "NASA astronomical telescope."

2168
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,209
(The present for the 2nd round is an astronomical telescope.)

2169
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,019
For your reference, it's 700 dollars.

2170
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,919
- It's 700 dollars?
- My goodness. It's 700 dollars?

2171
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,689
If it's for the school, we can look at the stars together.

2172
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,836
Come to school at night on a clear day to see the stars.

2173
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,119
If we succeed.

2174
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,189
(Round 2)

2175
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,259
(There's no board now.)

2176
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,260
(Score the goal as you play volleyball.)

2177
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,699
I got it.

2178
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,246
(In Round 2, they'll use their hands instead of the board.)

2179
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:47,270
All right.

2180
01:12:47,271 --> 01:12:49,676
(They must do it as if they're receiving the ball in volleyball.)

2181
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,369
- We must pass the ball to others?
- Yes.

2182
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,769
- I can't hit it twice?
- We need to pass the ball.

2183
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:53,969
(One person can't hit the ball twice in a row.)

2184
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,609
- Okay.
- It's fine if we pass the ball.

2185
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,950
- Right.
- Ready, go.

2186
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,379
- Okay.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

2187
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,479
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

2188
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,490
It goes... Okay.

2189
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,149
This feels nice.

2190
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,519
- It's better than we expected.
- We could try running to the goal.

2191
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,159
- Hey, how about you...
- Yes?

2192
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,659
We'll succeed fast.

2193
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,729
- You pass the ball to me and run.
- Give them some water.

2194
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:16,329
- Okay.
- I'll hit the from ball here.

2195
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,559
- I'll pass the ball...
- Let's go slowly first.

2196
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,946
- to Yeon Seok or Jae Suk.
- Then, you hit the ball.

2197
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,610
- Should we gather at first?
- From here.

2198
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,676
- Yeon Seok, pass it to Jae Suk.
- Hit it lightly.

2199
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,970
You run to the goal. Okay, here you go, MINGYU.

2200
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,240
(MINGYU is the striker.)

2201
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,970
- I think we can do it like this.
- So this is how it goes.

2202
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:35,379
- That was good. Let's try this.
- So this is how it goes.

2203
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,740
- We should do it like this.
- Don't hit it too many times.

2204
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,449
- Shall we try it?
- Okay.

2205
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:41,236
Let's practice one more time. Are we going right away?

2206
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,460
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

2207
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,590
- MINGYU will make a serve.
- It's Round Two.

2208
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,960
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2209
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,430
Let's do this!

2210
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,730
All right.

2211
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,900
Ready, set.

2212
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,970
Go.

2213
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,320
- My goodness.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

2214
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,100
- Goodness.
- That was my mistake.

2215
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,370
It's okay.

2216
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,840
- Goodness.
- That was my mistake.

2217
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,180
(MINGYU ran for nothing.)

2218
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,380
- Goodness.
- That was my mistake.

2219
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,380
It's okay.

2220
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,390
- Guys, I'm sorry.
- It was my fault.

2221
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,990
- It's okay.
- Guys, I'm sorry.

2222
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,259
It's okay.

2223
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,690
- It's okay. You can do it again.
- It's okay.

2224
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,159
It's okay.

2225
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,160
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2226
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,476
- Okay. I think we can do it.
- I'll show you.

2227
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,980
It would be hard for us to go slowly with short passes, right?

2228
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,229
- We can try it with short passes.
- Shall we try it?

2229
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:29,369
- With short passes?
- It's not easy to make it short.

2230
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,739
- Right. Try it.
- Okay.

2231
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:32,039
This is a practice.

2232
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,370
Short passes like this.

2233
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,579
- Right.
- This would be good enough.

2234
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,609
- Yes.
- Yeon Seok.

2235
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,639
- Goodness.
- I got this.

2236
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,679
All right.

2237
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,840
This is practice. Why are we so good when we practice?

2238
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,320
Gosh, that won't do it.

2239
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,319
All right. Let's try it this way.

2240
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,196
- One more time in this way?
- Yes. Let's do it.

2241
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,460
Guys, we need to cheer for them.

2242
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,529
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2243
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,090
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2244
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,459
- Let's go!
- Let's do this.

2245
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,259
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2246
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,499
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2247
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,800
We'll succeed.

2248
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,469
We must succeed in the second round.

2249
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:01,769
- This is our 3rd try, right?
- It's our 3rd try.

2250
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,840
Let's do this!

2251
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,740
Ready, set.

2252
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,539
This is hard.

2253
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,770
- Yes.
- Good.

2254
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,340
- I got it.
- Good.

2255
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,839
- Good.
- It's okay.

2256
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,509
- Good job.
- Let's do it this once.

2257
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:14,920
- Good.
- Just this once.

2258
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,850
(They just need to put the ball in the goal now.)

2259
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,620
- Gosh.
- Nice!

2260
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:23,990
- Good.
- Just this once.

2261
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,590
Good.

2262
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,740
Gosh, he touched the ball twice.

2263
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,460
Good.

2264
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,729
Gosh, he touched the ball twice.

2265
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:32,799
(MINGYU touched the ball twice because he was in a hurry.)

2266
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,530
- It was good though.
- You did well.

2267
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,740
(They failed their third try.)

2268
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:40,470
- Let's practice scoring the ball.
- Okay.

2269
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,750
You did well. It's okay.

2270
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,310
Now we know that we have a chance.

2271
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,079
- We have a chance now.
- Hold on. How about...

2272
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,120
- Let's practice scoring the ball.
- Let's do that.

2273
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:52,996
- We should practice scoring it.
- Okay.

2274
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,120
When we get here.

2275
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
Someone has to finish it.

2276
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,590
The finish...

2277
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,629
- Goodness.
- But this is...

2278
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,470
- This is easy.
- We can hit it with one hand.

2279
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,760
- Yes. Of course.
- We just need to touch the ball.

2280
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,960
- What's wrong with your neck?
- My shoulder is...

2281
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,920
- Are you okay?
- My trapezius muscle is tensed.

2282
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,740
- Is it stiff?
- My trapezius muscle is...

2283
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,409
- It got stiff.
- Since the children are watching.

2284
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,010
Because the kids are watching...

2285
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,760
- Hey.
- My trapezius musle got so...

2286
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:18,750
- I suddenly feel the pressure.
- My goodness.

2287
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,819
- It's different from earlier.
- It's different.

2288
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,519
It's good that we succeeded in the first try.

2289
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,580
Again.

2290
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,650
Good.

2291
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:28,859
- This was good.
- With short passes.

2292
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,300
- We should do it like this.
- Okay.

2293
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,859
We got this. Guys, we got this.

2294
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,466
- Jae Suk, you got this?
- Guys, we'll do it this time.

2295
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,099
- We'll succeed in it this time.
- If you succeed,

2296
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,860
I'll run a lap of the field in my bare feet.

2297
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,869
- You two will run?
- If you succeed.

2298
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:40,499
In your bare feet? You don't have to do that.

2299
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,200
- No.
- We got this, so don't do it.

2300
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,239
Please.

2301
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,269
Let's shout, "Here we go."

2302
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,739
In 1, 2, 3.

2303
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,040
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2304
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,739
Don't cry, Soo Hyuk.

2305
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,209
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

2306
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:53,580
- Let's go.
- Jae Suk will begin.

2307
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,920
Goodness.

2308
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,320
- Gosh.
- Good.

2309
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,920
Let's use the field widely and hit it gently.

2310
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:03,790
I'll receive the ball and hit it gently.

2311
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:06,630
I'll receive the ball and hit it gently.

2312
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,730
I'll receive the ball and hit it gently.

2313
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,400
I'll receive the ball and hit it gently.

2314
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:16,770
(Exclaiming)

2315
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,569
(They failed again in front of the goal.)

2316
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:20,710
Goodness.

2317
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,749
We have six tries left now.

2318
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,010
That was close.

2319
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,280
- I'm sorry.
- Guys, sorry.

2320
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,520
Bo Reum, I'm sorry.

2321
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,690
I'll do a better job, okay?

2322
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,790
This is harder than we think.

2323
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:38,790
- Let's do it.
- Why don't we make it clear?

2324
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,029
- Why don't we set the order?
- Okay.

2325
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,229
- I'll receive the ball...
- When it's...

2326
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,459
- and give it to you.
- Okay.

2327
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,329
- Call out if you'll get it.
- I'll head out then.

2328
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:46,690
- Okay. You head out.
- All right.

2329
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,939
- In 1, 2, 3, here we go.
- Here we go.

2330
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,540
- Without a practice? Okay.
- Let's go.

2331
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,610
Okay. And I think we can do it now.

2332
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,509
No. I think they can do it.

2333
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,910
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

2334
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,680
Let's go.

2335
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:01,650
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2336
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,420
HOSHI.

2337
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,589
(They failed their sixth try.)

2338
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,120
I don't think he can make it.

2339
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,590
(Screaming)

2340
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,890
Gosh, this is so hard.

2341
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,930
- I made a wrong serve at first.
- No, you didn't.

2342
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,729
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2343
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,690
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2344
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,010
- I got it.
- My goodness.

2345
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:28,139
(They even failed their seventh try.)

2346
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,340
Oh, no.

2347
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,580
They need to really succeed now.

2348
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,779
(Suddenly, they only have three tries left.)

2349
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,356
- Gosh, this is...
- It wasn't bad though.

2350
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,120
- I didn't expect this.
- It's not easy.

2351
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,489
Why is it even harder when we use our hands?

2352
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:42,689
I thought we'd be better at this.

2353
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,166
But doing this with our hands is more difficult.

2354
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,230
- I don't know where it will go.
- When we do it...

2355
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,100
We got 3 tries. We still have 3 tries left.

2356
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:49,976
- We have to do it.
- Let's cheer up.

2357
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Shall we practice?

2358
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:53,241
Don't ask them to cheer us up. Let's do it by ourselves.

2359
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,569
- Okay.
- Right.

2360
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,240
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2361
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,409
- We can do this.
- Here we go.

2362
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,469
All right.

2363
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:03,039
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2364
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,539
(Desperate)

2365
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,350
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2366
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,020
I got it.

2367
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:16,260
- All right.
- Jae Suk.

2368
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,890
- All right.
- Jae Suk. We got this.

2369
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:21,529
- Jae Suk.
- All right.

2370
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,836
- Jae Suk. We got this.
- My goodness.

2371
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,930
(The ball hit the goal.)

2372
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:26,329
My goodness.

2373
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,370
(It's out.)

2374
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,400
- All right.
- Jae Suk. We got this.

2375
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,909
My goodness.

2376
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,810
(The ball hit the goal, and it's out.)

2377
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,280
Sorry.

2378
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,710
(They failed their eighth try.)

2379
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,649
My goodness.

2380
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,690
(It's making him go crazy because it was so close.)

2381
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,289
(They have two tries left now.)

2382
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:49,560
Oh, no.

2383
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:54,729
- Hold on. This is bad.
- My goodness.

2384
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:56,059
I feel so bad...

2385
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,776
- to see them get disappointed.
- This is crazy.

2386
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,929
This shouldn't happen.

2387
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,070
Let's do it well this time.

2388
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:01,639
Let's relax and do it.

2389
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,900
Please.

2390
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,910
The one close to the goal should do it.

2391
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,940
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

2392
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,810
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

2393
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,209
- We must do it this time.
- Let's be calm.

2394
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:15,580
Next try will give us too much pressure.

2395
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,249
- Let's think of this as practice.
- As if we're practicing.

2396
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,319
- In 1, 2, 3.
- We're good when we practice.

2397
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,689
- Is this a practice? We're going?
- No, we'll go for it.

2398
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,749
- In 1, 2, 3.
- We're going for it.

2399
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,889
- Here we go.
- Like a practice round.

2400
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:23,166
Let's think of this as practice.

2401
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,759
- Okay.
- Like a practice.

2402
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,189
We'll do this, and we have another chance too.

2403
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:28,150
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2404
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,230
Okay.

2405
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,640
- Move forward.
- You got this.

2406
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,230
- Move forward.
- Goodness.

2407
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:35,700
Move forward. Good.

2408
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,200
They're moving forward.

2409
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,410
Move forward. Good. Go.

2410
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,179
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2411
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,940
(Yeon Seok touched the ball twice in a row.)

2412
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,950
Go.

2413
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,049
(Yeon Seok touched the ball twice, )

2414
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,349
(and the ball went in the goal.)

2415
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,520
My goodness.

2416
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:53,549
(They failed their ninth try because Yeon Seok touched the ball twice.)

2417
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,620
That was so close.

2418
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,490
We're in trouble.

2419
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,060
That was close.

2420
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,059
Oh, no.

2421
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,470
They are getting away from us.

2422
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,799
(Now, they have only one try left.)

2423
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,999
Gosh, we're in trouble.

2424
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,270
This is too hard.

2425
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,510
This is crazy.

2426
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,440
This is bad.

2427
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,349
No, they can do it.

2428
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:22,420
We can win if they succeed in this time.

2429
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:25,090
The look on their faces.

2430
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,520
Their dreams and hopes.

2431
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,219
(Grunting)

2432
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:31,359
- Let's practice once.
- Okay. Let's practice.

2433
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,990
It'd be better if we practiced for it.

2434
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:34,630
Let's practice enough.

2435
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:35,860
All right.

2436
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,130
Okay.

2437
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:39,729
Hey.

2438
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:40,900
- Okay.
- Here.

2439
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,840
- You got this.
- I'm sorry.

2440
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,310
We get here fast though.

2441
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,769
(They practice again.)

2442
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:48,840
I got it.

2443
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,010
It seems like it's better to pass the ball...

2444
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,010
- when we move forward, right?
- Yes.

2445
01:21:51,011 --> 01:21:52,049
Let's come up with a strategy...

2446
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:54,050
- and do it right just once.
- Let's try it again.

2447
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,649
(Practicing)

2448
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:59,320
(Practicing again)

2449
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:03,120
HOSHI.

2450
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:05,360
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2451
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,490
- You don't need to use both hands.
- Right.

2452
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:08,799
- You don't need both hands.
- Let's use one hand.

2453
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,976
- You can do it like this.
- Hit it once like this.

2454
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,700
- You just need to hit it once.
- Okay.

2455
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,730
They're practicing so hard.

2456
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,700
It's harder than it seems.

2457
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,770
Gosh, I really want to win this.

2458
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,509
Hit it high.

2459
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:20,610
I got it.

2460
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:21,940
Good.

2461
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,180
HOSHI.

2462
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,050
- We got it. Okay.
- Nice.

2463
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:28,280
Goodness. This is what we need to do.

2464
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,750
- This...
- We came this far.

2465
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,319
Shall we go for it now as we might get exhausted?

2466
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,320
Okay.

2467
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,719
- I think we can do this.
- It's so hot today.

2468
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,259
It's okay if you don't make it!

2469
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,260
- It's okay?
- Really?

2470
01:22:37,261 --> 01:22:38,889
- Yes.
- We'll do our best, Soo Hyuk!

2471
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:40,159
- Let's go.
- Let's do our best!

2472
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,160
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2473
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,459
- All right.
- It's the last try.

2474
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,330
We'll try our best.

2475
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:46,829
- We'll try our best.
- We'll try our best.

2476
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,539
- We'll try our best, everyone.
- Let's go.

2477
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,640
Let's go!

2478
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:50,940
- Let's go!
- Come.

2479
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,339
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2480
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,040
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2481
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:57,280
Let's do our best even if we may fail!

2482
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,620
Don't give up!

2483
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,020
Let's go for it.

2484
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,510
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

2485
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,290
All right.

2486
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,460
We will make sure to make it!

2487
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,890
We have to cheer up.

2488
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,260
Let's go!

2489
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,870
- Gosh.
- Here.

2490
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:21,740
- Let's go!
- Are we ready?

2491
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:23,540
- In, 1, 2, 3, - In, 1, 2, 3,

2492
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,639
- here we go!
- here we go!

2493
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,509
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2494
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,609
It's the last try.

2495
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,610
Let's not fail miserably.

2496
01:23:28,611 --> 01:23:30,339
- Call for the ball.
- Okay.

2497
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,379
- Right.
- Call for the ball.

2498
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,900
- Get ready to get it from me.
- Okay.

2499
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,310
Get ready.

2500
01:23:34,311 --> 01:23:37,849
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2501
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:38,850
Get ready.

2502
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,160
- And...
- Let's go.

2503
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,090
(They begin their last try.)

2504
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,290
It went too far. Here.

2505
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,730
Here.

2506
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:50,560
Here.

2507
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,900
Here.

2508
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,240
They failed.

2509
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,940
(Mission failed)

2510
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,520
They failed.

2511
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:13,490
(It's over.)

2512
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,690
We have no tries left.

2513
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,390
It's over now.

2514
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,330
It's over.

2515
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,600
We have no tries left.

2516
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:33,110
- There goes the telescope.
- We have no tries left.

2517
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:34,810
It's over now.

2518
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,139
- We're doomed.
- It's over now.

2519
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,610
(The last try ends disappointingly.)

2520
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,360
Gosh.

2521
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,730
(Taking back the present)

2522
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,730
- No!
- No!

2523
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,799
Do we get something else?

2524
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,469
No! Don't take it back!

2525
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,940
My backpack is gone.

2526
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,569
Right. We don't have any tries left.

2527
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:07,769
My gosh.

2528
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:09,680
Should we try practicing?

2529
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,150
Are they taking away the backpacks right now?

2530
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,050
It's over now.

2531
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,679
- My backpack!
- I'm sorry.

2532
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,849
You still get something!

2533
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,019
(Souvenirs for the children who gave them their support)

2534
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,419
- We prepared presents for you.
- This is...

2535
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,819
a T-shirt from our show.

2536
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,229
- I'm sorry, Seung Ho.
- Here.

2537
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,329
Take one each.

2538
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,829
- I'm sorry, Da Hun.
- I'm sorry.

2539
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,960
I like this better than what we got earlier!

2540
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,199
- Here.
- I like this better!

2541
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,700
I'm sorry, everyone.

2542
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,740
We tried our best, Da Hun.

2543
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,469
- We failed though.
- We know your hearts.

2544
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,969
You know our hearts? I'm sorry though.

2545
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:41,979
- I'm sorry, Seung Ho.
- I'm sorry.

2546
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:44,079
I wanted to put together a drama scene.

2547
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,800
- A drama scene?
- It didn't happen though.

2548
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:47,809
Dramas aren't real.

2549
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,420
- What?
- Dramas aren't real?

2550
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,479
But sometimes, you experience things...

2551
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,650
that are more unrealistic than movies or dramas.

2552
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,830
There's just a low chance of those things to happen.

2553
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,590
Right.

2554
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,629
Gather together, everyone.

2555
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:02,060
- You too, Ha Eun.
- Kimchi!

2556
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,929
You're away from the camera.

2557
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,129
(A midsummer drama that will be remembered forever...)

2558
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:06,269
(with the ray of sunlight and a drop of sweat)

2559
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,429
- I'm sorry!
- We didn't make it though.

2560
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,740
- I'm sorry, kids.
- I'm sorry, kids!

2561
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,709
(June, 2025)

2562
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:15,950
(It's the beginning of summer.)

2563
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:17,680
(All of a sudden, )

2564
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:19,480
(a few people from that side...)

2565
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,250
(wanted to give presents.)

2566
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,280
(Four mysterious men that want to give presents)

2567
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,890
(Let's go for it.)

2568
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,050
(Their challenge begins.)

2569
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:30,660
Please!

2570
01:26:30,661 --> 01:26:32,360
(They keep failing.)

2571
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,730
(At that moment, )

2572
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,360
(the son of Suyu appears!)

2573
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,900
(Will the tide be turned?)

2574
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,030
He did it!

2575
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:41,530
(The son of Suyu does an excellent job!)

2576
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,320
(Even the husband of Suyu makes an appearance.)

2577
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,610
(I think Hyun Sung will make something happen.)

2578
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:48,609
(Sighing)

2579
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:50,050
(This makes me feel really nervous.)

2580
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,539
(The guy from "A Story about the Day...")

2581
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:52,610
(faces a crisis.)

2582
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:54,279
(A story about the day...)

2583
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,479
(of an endless journey...)

2584
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,180
(for presents)

2585
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,720
(Yeon Seok looks really happy to have Dae Myeong here.)

2586
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,349
Yes!

2587
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,690
(How will they do?)

2588
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,890
(Whenever Possible)

2589
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:14,070
(Whenever Possible)
