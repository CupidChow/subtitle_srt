00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,510
(Whenever Possible)

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,050
(Verdant)

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,719
This is one of my favorite botanical gardens.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,490
Gardening is one of your interests.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,760
- This botanical garden is amazing. - Right. This place is amazing.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,790
Seriously. Magok...

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,200
went through a lot of massive improvements.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,199
During the past ten years,

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,930
- it changed a lot. - Right?

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,569
A lot of new buildings...

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,200
- are set up here now. - Right.

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,370
(Magok 10 years ago)

13
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,669
- The Arts Center moved here too. - Right.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,680
- Right. The Arts Center. - Yes.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,280
So the dress code for today is...

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,079
sky blue.

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,420
Well, it has to do with our Whenever Friend.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,449
- I heard who it was. - His name means...

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,950
- Right. - sky as in sky blue.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,520
Yes. Sky.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,089
I was skeptical at first.

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,160
Right.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,589
(Meanwhile...)

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,700
Have you often come to botanical gardens like this?

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,830
Botanical gardens? Well...

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,529
(Chuckling)

27
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,039
I don't think I had been to one even as a kid.

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,300
Same here. Wait. Have I been to one only as a kid?

29
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,570
- There they come. - Here they are.

30
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,270
My gosh.

31
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,179
- My gosh. - Hello.

32
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,639
- My gosh, Ha Neul. - Ha Neul.

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,649
- Hello. - Hello.

34
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,580
(Today's Whenever Friends, Seo Hyun Woo and Kang Ha Neul)

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,290
(Starting with his role as Yong Sik in "When the Camellia Blooms,")

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,519
(he showcased a broad spectrum of acting performances.)

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,760
(The actor on the rise, Kang Ha Neul)

38
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,159
(He pulled off his role perfectly in "The Fiery Priest 2,")

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,729
("A Shop for Killers,")

40
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,130
(and ""Our Movie.")

41
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,569
(A superb actor in any genre, Seo Hyun Woo)

42
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,639
- Hello. - My gosh.

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,169
- Hello. - Ha Neul.

44
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,639
- Hello. - Hello.

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,979
- Hello. - Oh, my.

46
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,309
It's my first time meeting you, Hyun Woo.

47
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,639
Hello, sir.

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,180
My gosh. Seriously.

49
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,149
- I wanted to meet you in person. - No?

50
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,220
My gosh.

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,919
- You look very hip today. - My gosh.

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,089
(Polite)

53
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,920
- It's been a while, Yeon Seok. - My gosh.

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,320
- You... - It's been a while.

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,059
- Hello. - Hello, Yeon Seok.

56
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,629
- I'm seeing you a lot these days. - My gosh. We're meeting a lot now.

57
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,659
- Yes. We're meeting a lot nowadays. - I'm seeing Ha Neul a lot now.

58
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,599
- Right. We're meeting a lot now. - Yes.

59
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,069
- I see him more than you. - Really?

60
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,169
(On the other hand, Hyun Woo has never met them before.)

61
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,239
- Take a seat. - Please sit down, Hyun Woo.

62
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,299
- Okay. - Where should we sit?

63
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,400
(The variety show rookie feels out of place.)

64
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,869
(Looking around)

65
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,039
By the way, we're all dressed in sky blue.

66
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,379
- It's for you. - Your name means sky.

67
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,179
- I see. - I see.

68
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,049
- What? Seriously? - That's why?

69
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,379
- Hear me out. - That's why.

70
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,679
My stylist brought me...

71
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,079
multiple outfits today.

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,490
- He told me to pick one. - Okay.

73
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,249
- But they were all sky blue. - Okay.

74
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,790
I wondered why that was the case.

75
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,420
- Your name means sky. - I see.

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,659
- Our outfits... - I see.

77
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,730
Thank you.

78
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,259
- Can we drink this? - Yes, you can.

79
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,529
- Okay. Thank you. - Go ahead.

80
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,199
Did you give him a sky blue straw on purpose too?

81
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,530
- Thank you. - My gosh.

82
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,769
Actually, sky blue is my favorite color.

83
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,200
- Really? - Yes.

84
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,039
We've never met, Hyun Woo.

85
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,839
Yes. We finally meet. Hello.

86
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,939
- My gosh. - Okay.

87
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,179
(Shy)

88
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,610
- He's in "Our Movie" too. - Yes.

89
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,650
I recognize him from "Uncle Samsik."

90
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,719
From "Uncle Samsik."

91
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,819
Yes. I was quite impressed by his performance in the drama.

92
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,089
- I was. - I always wanted to meet you.

93
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,289
- Same here. - I really did.

94
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,759
We only briefly ran into each other in passing...

95
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,059
- at events or gatherings. - Well, yes.

96
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,029
- Only at events. - You never got acquainted properly.

97
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,729
- No. - We never got to work together.

98
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,769
- Right. Not yet. - Right.

99
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,240
When we were on standby earlier, he asked me this.

100
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,609
He said, "Yeon Seok is really nice in person, right?"

101
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,339
So I said, "Wait. Do you know him well?"

102
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,939
But he told me that you guys had never met in private.

103
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,179
You only said hello to each other, but you were always so cheerful.

104
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,509
- Really? - Yes.

105
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,250
Did some people tell you that he was a nice person?

106
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,619
Today was the first time I heard it.

107
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,090
(Joking)

108
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,020
I guess not that many people heard about that.

109
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,060
- I'm only joking. - I see.

110
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,689
Please tell people how nice I am.

111
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,129
- I hear that he's easygoing. - I wish people knew that.

112
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,029
- Right. - Please tell people how nice I am.

113
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,960
- Right. He's super easygoing. - Yes.

114
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,470
- We filmed "Tastefully Yours." - Right.

115
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,129
Wasn't that early this year?

116
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,069
- Right. It was early this year. - We filmed it together then.

117
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,099
- You guys filmed it together. - Yes. We did.

118
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,269
Yeon Seok was in the drama?

119
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,569
- I made a special appearance. - Yes.

120
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,279
- I see. A special appearance. - Yes. It was a special appearance.

121
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,609
- Well... - I was especially in many scenes.

122
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,209
He really was in a lot of scenes.

123
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,279
- Right. I was in several episodes. - I see.

124
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,609
- Right. - Yes.

125
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,379
The director of the drama and I went to the same school.

126
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,680
- I see. - That's why.

127
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,520
You're landing a lot of jobs through your connections.

128
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,319
- Through my connections? - That's how he gets his gigs.

129
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,689
Don't put it that way.

130
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,760
I shouldn't? Okay. That can't be the only reason.

131
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,999
- It must've turned out naturally. - It happened organically.

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,159
- It can't be about his connections. - Right.

133
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,099
- Right. That's it. - Yes.

134
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,670
Wait. Hyun Woo. Where...

135
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,770
- Are you asking me about my school? - Yes.

136
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,569
- Korea National University of Arts. - I see.

137
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,069
- You went to KNUA. - I see.

138
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,310
So no one went to my school? Anyone?

139
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,479
- There are many graduates nowadays. - Right.

140
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,180
- Many of them are in our field now. - That's right.

141
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,949
So didn't you guys work together on a project recently?

142
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,879
- I watched the teaser. - Yes, that's right.

143
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,249
- It'll air on a streaming platform. - Yes.

144
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,889
- Is it called "Wall Between Wall?" - Right.

145
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,789
- It's "Wall to Wall." - I see. "Wall to Wall."

146
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,760
- "Wall to Wall." - It's not "Wall Between Wall?"

147
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,319
- The title is referring to... - So...

148
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,129
- the standard size of a house. - Right.

149
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,989
- It's about noise between floors. - So...

150
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,499
- Yes, in apartments. - He won the housing lottery.

151
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,529
- Right. - My character...

152
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,469
- pulled all of his money... - Right.

153
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,569
- and spent every penny he had. - That's right.

154
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,339
- He even pulled out the deposit. - I see.

155
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,239
- He barely managed to buy a unit. - Your character bought the house.

156
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,069
- He used all of his assets. - But things start to get worse.

157
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,579
- Once he moves in, the noise... - Right.

158
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,210
- between floors gets worse. - It's awful.

159
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,479
("Wall to Wall," scheduled to premiere on July 18)

160
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,189

161
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,719
(a standard-sized apartment unit, but he suffers from...)

162
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,960
(mysterious noise between floors in this unpredictable thriller.)

163
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,490
Talk to the neighbor upstairs!

("The Duo Stars in 'Wall to Wall' Together")

167
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,299
I wouldn't say it's a horror movie.

168
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,729
- It's a thriller. - Yes, it's a thriller.

169
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,239
- It's a thriller? - Yes.

170
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,699
- In the movie... - My character suffers...

171
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,369
from noise between floors like Ha Neul's character.

172
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,409
- And that's when he moves in. - Right.

173

My character meets another guy in the same boat.

174
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,309
So we try to get to the bottom of it together.

175

- You investigate together. - Yes.

176
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,979
- Yes. - Aren't you nervous...

177
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,250
about the premiere?

178
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,189
I'm very curious about how our movie came out.

179
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,089
- You haven't watched it yet? - No. I haven't yet.

180
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,520
- You haven't? - Me neither.

181
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,860
It's not easy for the cast to watch it before the premiere.

182
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,429
- I see. - It's rare for the cast...

183
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,830
- Yes. - to watch it before the premiere.

184
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,499
- We're in the same boat. - Right.

185
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
- They won't let us watch it. - Right.

186
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,839
- Right. - We watch those sneak peeks...

187
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,570
- just like everybody else. - Right.

188
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,010
- We watch it on TV when it airs. - Yes.

189
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,909
We can't watch things in advance.

190
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,179
- Right. - Yes.

191
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,880
Did Yeon Shik make a special appearance in this?

192
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,149
They didn't ask me.

193
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,320
- Why does he call you Yeon Shik? - Really?

194
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,050
He keeps changing Seok to Shik.

195
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,660
Since my name has the same syllable, I changed it to Shik.

196
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,859
- We're Suk and Shik. - I see.

197
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,129
- I should change his name too. - Nice.

198
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,259
- Suk and Shik. - Suk and Shik.

199
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,859
- Doesn't that sound friendlier? - Suk...

200
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,100
- Yoo Yeon Shik. - Suk and Shik.

201
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,300
- On variety shows, he's Yeon Shik. - Right.

202
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,700
- And Yeon Seok in dramas and films. - That's nice, Yeon Seok.

203
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,270
That's nice, Yeon Seok.

204
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,280
- It's your secondary character. - Jae Shik.

205
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,779
- Jae Shik doesn't sound right. - Right.

206
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,679
- Can you call me Neul? - Neul?

207
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,779
- Neul. - Neul.

208
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,650
- It doesn't roll off my tongue. - Neul.

209
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,750
- What about Hyun Woo? - Woo doesn't sound right.

210
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,020
- Actually, my family at home... - It's not like I'm booing him.

211
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,289
Called me Wooya.

212
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,320
Wooya?

213
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,929
- That sounds loving. - Wooya?

214
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,759
- People in Gyeongsang Province... - Wooya.

215
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,130
(An affectionate nickname from Gyeongsang Province)

216
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,630
- Which part of Gyeongsang Province? - So...

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
I was born in Busan, but I went to school in Tongyeong.

218
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,400
- I see. Tongyeong. - I see.

219
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,869
Heo Kyeong Hwan is from Tongyeong.

220
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,340
- Yes, that's right. - Right.

221
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,770
- My father... - You must be about the same age.

222
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,379
Seems to know his father somehow.

223
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,240
- I see. - He's the son of my dad's friend.

224
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,309
- Really? - That's such a small town.

225
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,349
- It's a small town. - Really?

226
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,579
Everyone knows each other in Tongyeong.

227
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,150
- Right. - Yes.

228
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,819
- Kyeong Hwan... - Is he a year older than Hyun Woo?

229
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,890
How old is he? Wait.

230
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Was he born in 1982?

231
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,920
How old is Heo Kyeong Hwan?

232
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,390
- Are you making a call? - No.

233
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,199
He was born on February 16, 1981.

234
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,629
- I see. - See?

235
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,429
He was born on February 16, 1981.

236
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,929
- I see. - See?

237
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,139
So he was born in 1981.

238
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,769
- We're 2 years apart. - They're 2 years apart.

239
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,009
- Weren't you born in 1983? - You're about the same age.

240
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,440
(What was that? Who just spoke? What's going on?)

241
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,940
You're about the same age.

242
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
- What? - What was that just now?

243
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,249
- What was that? - It's that thing.

244
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,749
- What was that? - It's the AI program.

245
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,579
- It's the AI program on my phone. - Can I try that?

246
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,420
- You can. You just press this. - Can I try it?

247
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,249
- Press it on the side? - Yes, press it on the side.

248
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,289
- Do I need to press it long? - Yes.

249
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,660
Keep pressing it while you talk.

250
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,759
How old is Seo Hyun Woo?

251
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,790
(Excited)

252
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,929
Actor Seo Hyun Woo was born on November 20, 1983.

253
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,730
You didn't know it was AI?

254
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,130
- This is... - He's more old school...

255
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,139
than you think.

256
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,439
- I see. - Yes.

257
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,369
This AI program is built in my phone.

258
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,080
But Yeon Seok pays the subscription fee for it.

259
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,779
- My gosh. That's... - You pay for it?

260
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,009
- He has to pay a fee. - I have to pay a fee.

261
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,849
The quality of the paid AI service is different.

262
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,109
How much more information does the paid version give you?

263
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,419
Does it also give you the time of his birth?

264
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,380
- It's the quality of conversations. - It's different.

265
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,449
The paid version is different.

266
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,119
- It requires a fee for a reason. - Right.

267
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
(He's moved by the discovery of AI.)

268
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,959
Hold on. We must go and meet the Whenever Guests...

269
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,189
- for our mission. - We should get going.

270
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,660
We should go and meet the Whenever Guests.

271
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,659
- That's what you call them. - The Whenever Guests.

272
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,259
- My gosh. Oh, my. - That's really long.

273
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,399
You seem impressed.

274
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,329
(Zealously responding)

275
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,600
You know what? I can play the accordion with this now.

276
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,040
- You... - My gosh. That's nice.

277
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,940
- He's the king of reaction. - He's playing along. My gosh.

278
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,649
- Thank you. - Gosh, no.

279
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,980
- Thank you. - He's indeed the king of reaction.

280
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,080
I feel so encouraged.

281
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,780
I didn't know how to respond to that.

282
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,619
But you went, "Oh, my."

283
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,050
(Impressed)

284
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,060
All right. Her name is Park Hye Min.

285
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,159
- Hye Min. - Hye Min.

286
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,060
"A hoe in my left hand. A shovel in my right hand."

287
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,059
"I'm a plant enthusiast..."

288
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,930
"who takes care of about 3,000 plant species."

289
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,029
That's why we're at a botanical garden.

290
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,300
I see. Because she works at a botanical garden?

291
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,170
But 3,000 plant species?

292
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,539
"At times, I worry the high humidity might kill them."

293
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,069
"At times, I worry the sun will scorch them to death."

294
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,739
"But they are such a lovely sight..."

295
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,410
"when they stand tall and begin to sprout."

296
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,449
"I'd like to show off my babies..."

297
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,349
"to everyone in Korea through your show."

298
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,479
"P.S. It's hard to find this place. I'll come and pick you up."

299
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,490
What?

300
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,190
I see. It must be in this botanical garden.

301
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,419
That must be it.

302
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,329
- It must be closed to the public. - So...

303
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,830
(The Whenever Guest will pick them up.)

304
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,859
This is a big garden, right?

305
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,059
It's 70 times the size of a soccer field.

306
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,469
- Seventy times? - Seventy times?

307
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,600
- This garden is that big? - Yes.

308
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,699
I noticed earlier that people were riding carts.

309
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,340
This place is huge.

310
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,640
This is crazy.

311
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,779
It's 70 times the size of a soccer field?

312
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,809
My gosh. Then...

313
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,610
(Someone is walking toward them.)

314
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,919
- So this is... What? She's here? - Right.

315
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,450
- Gosh. She's here? - Oh, my.

316
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,649
- Hello. - Hello.

317
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,089
- Are you Hye Min? - Yes.

318
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,090
(Shy)

319
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,220
- Hello. - Hello.

320
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,329
(The first Whenever Guest, Park Hye Min)

321
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,459
- She really came to pick us up. - Hello.

322
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,929
We usually go to Whenever Guests.

323
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,599
This is the first time a Whenever Guest came to us.

324
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,499
- Please come here. - You guys always went...

325
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,869
- to them in the videos I watched. - Right.

326
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,870
(They're all acting flustered as they're surprised.)
- We're so surprised. - Hello.

327
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:33,969
- Should we... - Should we get going?

328
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,469
- We should go to her place. - Let's get going then.

329
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,940
- Okay. - Let's go.

330
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,009
- That's why we're here today. - I see.

331
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,710
- You don't have to drink it up. - But still.

332
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,710
- But still. They must drink it up. - Yes.

333
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
Let's go.

334
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,190
- So do you work here? - Yes. I do.

335
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,789
By the way, this place is huge.

336
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,060
Yes. This is...

337
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,429
a combination of a park and a botanical garden.

338
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,890
- I didn't know it was this big. - So it's pretty big.

339
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,499
Then if you forget something on your way home after work,

340
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,600
it must be a long way back.

341
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,369
- Yes, it is. - What an original way...

342
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,539
to look at this.

343
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,699
(A novel way to look at it)

344
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
You're right.

345
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,540
- Hearing about it tires me out. - Right.

346
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,110
She must pass by 70 soccer fields.

347
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,240
- That's a dizzying thought. - This place is huge.

348
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,309
Won't employees get a cart or something?

349
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,449
We do get to ride a cart,

350
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,749
but there are so many places we must visit.

351
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,050
So we end up walking.

352
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,589
By the way, isn't it tough to work here...

353
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,919
when the weather gets hot?

354
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
- Right. - My gosh.

355
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,359
That's why I'm a bit worried about today.

356
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,130
But it's quite cloudy today.

357
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,429
So we'll be fine.

358
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,499
Does the air conditioner not work?

359
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,230
There's no air conditioner.

360
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,269
- Then... - Is it to maintain the temperature?

361
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,699
- You must work in a greenhouse. - Well...

362
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,170
Yes. We're heading to a cultivation greenhouse.

363
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,039
It houses plants that can't survive in cold weather.

364
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,109
Or young plants are cultivated in this greenhouse.

365
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,850
So it's always warm in the greenhouse.

366
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,319
Then why don't we go to a greenhouse...

367
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,250
for plants that can't grow in hot weather?

368
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,890
- You must be talking about us. - So...

369
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,530
- We can't survive in hot weather. - We can't handle the heat.

370
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,800
Would it be difficult to go there instead?

371
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,670
There are so many bugs in that greenhouse.

372
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,469
Personally, I really hate bugs.

373
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,169
We all gave up at the mention of bugs.

374
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,469
- Do you all hate bugs? - That shut us up.

375
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,609
- That's understandable. - My gosh.

376
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,979
- So this is... - That's understandable.

377
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,780
- This is the place. Yes. - Is this the place?

378
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,709
- This place isn't open to visitors. - They can't enter here, right?

379
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,480
- No, they can't enter this place. - Right.

380
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,349
- Let's go inside. - Are we allowed inside?

381
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,620
- I'll invite you. - I see. With you...

382
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,890
- Should we disinfect ourselves? - Okay.

383
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,120
- Come on in. - Okay.

384
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,330
Oh, my.

385
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,330
This place is nice.

386
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,329
- This place is huge. - It's not that bad in here.

387
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,600
(The cultivation greenhouse is massive.)

388
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,669
The greenhouse is more pleasant than I thought.

389
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,970
- Really? - Yes.

390
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,799
So you handle all 3,000 species?

391
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,339
I handle about 3,000 species.

392
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,739
But the botanical garden has about 6,000 species.

393
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,879
That's amazing.

394
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
(This is the incubator of the botanical garden.)

395
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:55,109
Look at the plants. They already look fresh and young.

396
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,250
- Right? - Yes.

397
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,519
- And the air feels different. - Right?

398
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,549
Yes. The air feels fresher.

399
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
(The Whenever Guest manages all the plants in the greenhouse.)

400
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,019
There are so many interesting plants here.

401
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,289
- So... - I love plants.

402
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,290
- Really? - Yes.

403
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,959
- Gardening is his hobby. - Yes.

404
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,929
- It is. I grow plants too. - Really?

405
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,399
- He laid down a fresh lawn... - Really?

406
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,099
- last Sunday. - A fresh lawn?

407
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,870
- You put in new grass? - Yes.

408
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,800
I bought rolls of new grass.

409
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,639
- That's not an easy job. - Rolls of new grass?

410
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,809
Yes. I bought the rolls.

411
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,939
- He did it himself. - I laid them down.

412
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,779
- Did you add soil conditioners too? - Yes.

413
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,480
Would you like a job here?

414
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,009
I would be so happy working here.

415
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,519
(She tries to recruit him when she gets a chance.)

416
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,580
Let's sit down.

417
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,819
Like this.

418
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,320
How is it working in the botanical garden?

419
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,689
Why are you laughing all of a sudden?

420
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,029
Are you thinking of getting a new job?

421
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,030
(Flustered)

422
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,329
- No. - Seeing Jae Suk can make you...

423
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,430
feel flustered like that.

424
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,099
- I never thought... - Seriously. Seeing him...

425
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,199
he would ever be in my workplace.

426
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
- Really? - Yes.

427
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,840
What made you apply to be on our show?

428
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,809
This is the off season for me. I get to take it easy...

429
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,279
because it's way too hot.

430
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,909
There aren't a lot of things I can do for the plants.

431
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,519
I organized and went through the plants from spring.

432
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,289
Then I can barely get to do anything...

433
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,220
other than watering them.

434
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,189
This is the low season for me.

435
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,089
- I see. So you literally had... - Yes.

436
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,959
- spare time from work. - Yes.

437
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,199
- Yes. - So she really has some spare time.

438
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
(Chuckling)

439
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:25,069
I need to recharge now.

440
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,569
So I can work hard in the second half of the year.

441
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,109
You're busy in spring and fall,

442
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,639
- right? - Yes, I am.

443
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,339
In spring, you have to do...

444
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,810
- You know so much about gardening. - That's right.

445
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,909
- Spring is the time... - Right.

446
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,650
- when you plant a lot of things. - That's true.

447
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,520
- You have to prune them in fall. - That's right.

448
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,589
- You know that too? - And when it rains...

449
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,089
- So during the rainy season, - Yes.

450
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,960
How are things? How does the rain affect managing the garden?

451
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,059
My gosh. First of all, it's really difficult to work here...

452
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,029
- because of the humidity. - I bet.

453
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,559
- We talked about that earlier. - Yes.

454
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,699
And our plants tend to melt down in the humidity.

455
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,299
- Right. - That's what I heard too.

456
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,329
- That's hard. - Right.

457
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,899
That's the thing about...

458
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,499
- raising anything. - Right.

459
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,039
- Right. - It's a tough job.

460
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,569
- Right. - It's difficult...

461
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,070
for entertainment agencies to cultivate new talent.

462
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,510
Raising kids is tough.

463
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,510
Raising plants is tough too.

464
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,719
- Right. - Helping me grow as an MC...

465
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
is tough. Right?

466
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:13,950
It's so tough.

467
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,760
- Not all of my efforts bear fruit. - Right.

468
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,690
- He's MC Mom. - One more thing.

469
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,389
It's not easy for viewers to grow...

470
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,259
- any new talent. - That's so true.

471
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,060
- Right? - That's so true.

472
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,629
- Ha Neul, do you raise anything? - Seriously.

473
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,799
Like plants.

474
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,070
First of all, looking after myself is already tough.

475
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,609
- Right. - Seriously.

476
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,610
- That's true. - My gosh.

477
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:38,279
I'll try to raise anything after growing myself first.

478
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,979
What about you, Hyun Woo?

479
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,550
I should look after myself first.

480
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,680
I need to raise myself first.

481
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,619
(Looking after oneself is tough in this world.)

482
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,689
I planted some bulbs last fall.

483
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,359
- So I planted tulip bulbs. - Okay.

484
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,429
I felt so proud when the tulip bulbs turned into flowers.

485
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,559
- I bet. - Seriously.

486
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,659
Did you say "pulp?"

487
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,429
- Not pulp. - That's...

488
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,230
- I said, "bulb." - "Bulb." I see.

489
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,630
I thought you said "tulip pulp."

490
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,600
So I was like, "Tulips have pulp?"

491
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,440
Gosh, Ha Neul. Why would anyone plant pulp?

492
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,009
- Bulbs as in tulip seeds. - I know the word.

493
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,209
- I know what they are. - They look like onions.

494
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,410
But the words sound similar.

495
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,110
Well...

496
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,279
By the way, you seem to have a calm personality.

497
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,349
- Me? - You do, right?

498
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,779
What was your nickname in school?

499
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,089
- My nickname? - Yes.

500
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,289
I was sensitive.

501
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,519
- Okay. - So they called me Sensitive Min.

502
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,020
- Really? - Sensitive Min.

503
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,219
Sensitive Min.

504
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,389
- She doesn't look like that type. - Because of your name?

505
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,860
- Because of your name? Is that why? - Yes. Sensitive Min.

506
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,459
What was your nickname, Hyun Woo?

507
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,999
- My nickname was PF. - What?

508
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,099
- Like Pressure Factor? Why PF? - It's a compound word...

509
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,269
my friend came up with.

510
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,439
- PF? - What does that mean?

511
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,539
- PF? - What does it mean?

512
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,039
It's short for Psycho Freak.

513
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,439
(Psycho Freak)

514
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,639
- PF as in Psycho Freak. - I see.

515
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,210
- It stands for Psycho Freak. - I see.

516
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,379
- PF. - Yes.

517
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,219
So you must have had a bold personality.

518
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,780
- Yes, indeed. - I see.

519
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,319
- What about you, Ha Neul? - It was always Ma Neul.

520
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,349
- My real name is Kim Ha Neul. - Yes.

521
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,859
- It's the pronunciation again. - Kim Ma Neul.

522
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,089
- When you say my name fast, - Kim Ma Neul.

523
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,329
You end up pronouncing it that way.

524
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,290
- Ki Ma Neul. - It was always Ma Neul.

525
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,059
So my friends still call me Ma Neul.

526
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,529
- Ma Neul. - Ma Neul.

527
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,500
- Ki Ma Neul. - Ki Ma Neul.

528
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,199
- So... - Yes.

529
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,870
- you know a lot about plants. - Right.

530
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,539
If you plant watermelon seeds,

531
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,039
- I'm curious about that. - will watermelons grow?

532
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,239
- Questions like this... - I'm curious.

533
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,609
And the same thing with Korean melons.

534
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,980
- I'm curious about that. - They must grow.

535
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,909
- We have a separate place... - I'm curious about that.

536
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,679
- where we use that method. - Okay.

537
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,909
- Will watermelons really grow? - So...

538
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,119
- they must grow. - I've never done it...

539
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,319
- Right. They are seeds. - with watermelons.

540
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,349
- Okay. - But Korean melons...

541
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,750
- Did it work with Korean melons? - Yes, it did.

542
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,690
- Speaking of Korean melons, - Okay.

543
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,290
I have a question about Korean melons.

544
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,959
When you cut open the Korean melons,

545
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,429
- there are seeds. - Yes.

546
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,699
- There are dozens of seeds. - Right.

547
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,629
- Should we plant the whole strip? - Right.

548
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,900
- I was curious about that. - That was it, right?

549
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,239
- Must we plant the soft thingy? - If we have to plant the stem too.

550
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,810
- Everything? Or pull out the seeds? - Or do we have to get the seeds?

551
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,770
- And plant them individually? - What should we do?

552
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,979
You have to wash, dry, and then plant them individually.

553
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,379
- Dry them first? - Yes.

554
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,879
It won't work if we plant wet ones.

555
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,120
If you do that, the seeds will rot.

556
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,149
- Really? They'll rot. - Yes, they'll rot.

557
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,019
- When you eat Korean melons, - Yes?

558
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,820
Do you remove the seeds or eat the melons with the seeds?

559
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,719
- Come on. - Well...

560
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,929
- Why not? - Are you investigating her?

561
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,529
- I'm seriously curious. - You know what?

562
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,629
- Come on. - People say you get diarrhea...

563
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,729
if you don't remove the seeds.

564
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,060
- Is that true or false? - Hey.

565
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,899
- Right? - Come on.

566
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,329
- You do get diarrhea. - Why would you ask that?

567
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,599
That's not true. I eat the seeds,

568
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,870
- but that doesn't happen. - How do you eat your melons?

569
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,199
- Well, I hear... - I eat everything.

570
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,769
- it happens to some people. - I eat everything.

571
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,369
- Really? - I eat everything too.

572
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,039
I eat everything. But sometimes, it does affect my bowel movements.

573
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,609
- Really? Maybe, you ate too much. - Yes.

574
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,680
My...

575
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,580
But the thing is...

576
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,480
Hold on.

577
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,620
Ha Neul. Don't you eat everything as a whole?

578
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,219
I do eat a lot of things as a whole.

579
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,190
- I eat tangerines as a whole too. - You do what?

580
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,630
- I noticed that he... - I eat them as a whole.

581
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,229
- How do you eat them as a whole? - Right. People usually peel them.

582
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,599
I do that with shrimps too.

583
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,969
- I eat the heads and tails too. - Even the shells?

584
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,199
- Right. - So there are no leftover parts...

585
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
from shrimps.

586
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
- Jun Ha does the same. - Do you...

587
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,909
I eat everything.

588
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,669
- We talked about fruits at a shoot. - Right.

589
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,839
I know what we discussed...

590
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,010
- at the shoot. - What was that?

591
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,249
- When you eat persimmons, - Persimmons?

592
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,449
You get the seeds. When you split them open,

593
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,649
- there's a spoon. You know? - Yes.

594
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,849
- Really? - Inside the seeds?

595
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,619
- There's a spoon in the seeds. - In the seeds?

596
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,649
- It's the shape. - I'm sure some people know.

597
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,119
- Do you know about this? - It's the shape.

598
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,959
- It looks like a spoon. - It looks like a spoon.

599
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,790
I always split open the seeds and eat them...

600
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,530
after eating the persimmons.

601
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,560
You all think I'm weird, right?

602
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,070
The viewers of the show will be surprised.

603
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,299
"How come you don't know that?"

604
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,400
- The professional term... - I'm sure some will say so.

605
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,839
(A fascinating preference of Ha Neul)

606
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,409
- That's fascinating. - You know what?

607
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,969
We never got the answer from Hye Min.

608
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,339
- Right. I'm sorry. - How do you eat your Korean melons?

609
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,579
I eat them as a whole with the seeds.

610
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,309
- Do you peel the skin too? - Yes.

611
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,850
- Without the skin. - You don't, right?

612
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,049
Even the Korean melons?

613
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,080
- I must peel the skin for it. - Really?

614
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,849
- Come on. - Hey.

615
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,620
- Hold on. - Why do you think...

616
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,890
- Would he eat the watermelon rind? - Seriously.

617
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,929
- He eats the peels too. - Wait. It's just tangerines.

618
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,529
He doesn't eat the peels of every fruit.

619
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,530
- Right. - It's just the tangerines.

620
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,269
Anyway, let's draw the bonus coupons with Hye Min.

621
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,470
- Right. - Let's begin now.

622
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,839
Who wants to go first? Do you want to try, Ha Neul?

623
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,169
- You're in the middle. - Give it a nice throw.

624
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,709
- Roll it from here. - Yes.

625
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,440
(Feeling a lot of pressure)

626
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,310
- My gosh. Let me roll it. - Okay.

627
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,280
- Please. - Let it be two!

628
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,820
Let it be two!

629
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,920
- Where did it go? - Where did it go?

630
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,919
- What is it? Is it? - Two!

631
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,690
- Okay. - It's two.

632
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,090
- We got 2 bonus coupons. - There's only 1 side with 2.

633
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,860
We got two bonus coupons.

634
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,329
Let's check the prize for Round One.

635
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,599
- Please break it. - What?

636
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,699
- Read it, please. - What is it?

637
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,199
"I want to work in style while staying away from the sun..."

638
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,029
"or walking in the mud."

639
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,200
"A Helen Kaminski hat and a pair of Hunter boots."

640
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,769
- A Helen Kaminski hat? - They're bringing it in right away?

641
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,710
- We get to see them right away? - Right away like this?

642
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,979
By the way, this goes perfectly with your outfit today.

643
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,550
- I really want it. - Pardon?

644
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,480
- This... - You really want this?

645
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,280
- Gosh, later... - They're so cute.

646
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,850
- They're cute. - They make the perfect outfit.

647
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,590
- They're perfect for her. - They are.

648
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,320
What's the game?

649
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,089
(Her greenhouse outfit is at stake on this mission.)

650
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,089
(Get the Water Bottle to Stand)

651
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,099
(Flip the water bottle on the ground.)

652
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
(Then make it land upright to complete the mission.)

653
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,569
(Round 1)

654
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,929
(1 out of the 4 must succeed.)

655
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,070
- What? - My gosh.

656
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,940
- I'm not good at this. - I'm bad at this.

657
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,739
- Hey, this is... - This game...

658
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,069
A lot of office workers play this game...

659
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,379
- to decide who pays for coffee. - Right.

660
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,740
- My gosh, this is... - Gosh, this game...

661
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,849
Let's practice.

662
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,409
- Wait. We can practice? - Yes, we can.

663
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,509
You can't squat down.

664
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,649
- What? - We must do it standing up?

665
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,779
- Do it standing up? - Yes.

666
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,079
- You can't bend forward. - Right, you can't bend forward.

667
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,589
- Can we bend forward? - Can I bend forward this much?

668
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,719
Yes, that much is allowed.

669
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,990
(Bending over slightly is allowed.)

670
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,459
How can I do this standing up?

671
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,490
(Feeling hopeless)

672
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,830
- Gosh, I could never do this. - Wait.

673
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,159
Gosh, this is so hard.

674
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,330
- We must flip it, right? - Yes.

675
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,399
It's impossible to do this standing up, isn't it?

676
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,969
(The water bottle hits the ground with a dull thump.)

677
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,300
- Hold on. - Is this allowed?

678
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,200
That's not allowed. Come on.

679
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,870
I can't do this?

680
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,279
- I have to flip it, right? - Gosh, it's pretty up high.

681
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,379
This? Okay.

682
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,579
We can't squat down?

683
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,709
- Gosh, we're in trouble. - It feels like...

684
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,810
- Everyone squats down for it. - But...

685
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,480
You're supposed to squat down to play this game.

686
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,979
- We must flip it, right? - Yes.

687
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,049
You have to flip it.

688
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,150
Hey, that's...

689
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,020
Okay.

690
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,060
(He landed it upright.)

691
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,460
(Surprised)

692
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,029
- I did it. - He got the hang of it.

693
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,830
- All right. Let's go. - Gosh, this is...

694
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,599
- Gosh, this isn't right. - Hey, let's go for it.

695
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
- Hold on. - Hey, I did it.

696
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
- It works if you do it right. - Okay.

697
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,310
If I throw it just a bit harder...

698
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,540
- My power... - My gosh. Hey.

699
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,779
Gosh, I'm sort of getting the hang of it.

700
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,879
All right. Let's begin with our first try.

701
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,049
- Let's do a group cheer. - Let's do a cheer.

702
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,079
All right.

703
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,320
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

704
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,090
This is for Round One.

705
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,150
- Can I go first? - Sure.

706
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,160
- You succeeded earlier. - Great.

707
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,089
- You... Yes. - I'll do it in a lunge pose.

708
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,260
They said this was allowed.

709
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,359
- You always... Right. - I could finish Round One now.

710
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,730
You're always good during practice.

711
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,600
I could finish Round One now.

712
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,640
(Jae Suk has a good feeling about this.)

713
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,750
(He fails.)

714
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,350
See? You're good only during practice.

715
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,190
(Screaming in frustration)

716
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,560
If we scream, will that scare the plants?

717
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,960
- It's fine. Yes. - It's fine?

718
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,360
- Okay. - I'll comfort them later.

719
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,900
Did you see the look on her face?

720
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,500
"Just do your job well."

721
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Okay.

722
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:18,639
- All right. - Please.

723
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,670
You got this.

724
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,069
Here I go.

725
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,539
(Try number one: Ha Neul)

726
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
You got it.

727
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,780
- I should've thrown it harder. - This is harder than it looks.

728
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,210
- I should've thrown it harder. - Gosh.

729
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,810
- This is harder than it looks. - I should've thrown it harder.

730
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,520
All right, Hyun Woo.

731
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,820
We just need one person to succeed.

732
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,789
It will happen when we don't expect it.

733
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,920
It will happen out of the blue.

734
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,260
- What? - Yes.

735
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,630
- What? - Yes.

736
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,159
(He succeeds unexpectedly.)

737
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,459
- That was insane. - Yes.

738
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,530
- What? - Yes.

739
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,870
- Yes. - That was insane.

740
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,840
- That was insane. - We did it.

741
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,170
- That was crazy. - All right.

742
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,109
- The staff members are flustered. - I bet you're shocked.

743
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,269
- I got it, right? - You're shocked, right?

744
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,470
Gosh, that was crazy.

745
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,279
- How did it do it on his first try? - This is crazy.

746
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,040
- Round One is complete. - It's complete.

747
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,479
- Okay. - We got the prize from Round One.

748
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,319
And Hye Min will take the prize.

749
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,520
(She obtains the hat and boots from Round 1.)

750
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,820
- We have... - Thank you.

751
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,520
Gosh, I feel so proud.

752
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,019
Have you always been good at this?

753
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,389
No. It was my first time trying this game.

754
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,160
- You're amazing. - You're a pro.

755
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,459
He's a pro.

756
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,900
It was easier when I lowered myself.

757
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,869
- And we have 11 tries left. - Really?

758
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,209
- This is amazing. - You must decide whether or not...

759
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,569
you want to keep going.

760
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,980
One, two, three.

761
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,539
- Go. - Go.

762
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,910
- We must keep going. - Okay.

763
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,009
All right. Round Two.

764
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,719
"I walk 10,000 steps every day. My body needs a good rest."

765
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,480
"A complete set of massage devices."

766
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,889
A complete set?

767
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,319
- I see. It's not just for calves? - Today's prizes are so good.

768
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,690
- For the full body? - Today...

769
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,490
For calves, shoulders,

770
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,289
- and thighs too. - There's one for thighs too.

771
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,359
(Devices for neck and shoulders, backs, calves, and thighs)

772
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,559
There's one for shoulders too.

773
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,629
For the shoulders.

774
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,870
This is crazy.

775
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,770
You know what? Today's presents are the best, hands down.

776
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,099
(Round 2)

777
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,710
(Make 1 water bottle land upright on top of a flowerpot.)

778
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,609
- Come on. - Hold on.

779
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,509
- Actually, I thought... - Hold on a second.

780
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,410
- the two of us had to succeed. - Two out of the four.

781
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,279
(They must make it land upright on this flowerpot.)

782
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,479
I didn't see this coming.

783
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,580
(They must make it land upright on this flowerpot.)

784
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,089
(They don't know how to react as this was unexpected.)

785
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,190
- Gosh. - Make it land on top of this?

786
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,390
Flip it and...

787
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,759
Then is this allowed?

788
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,730
What if the water bottle lands like this?

789
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,999
- That's... - Will this be allowed?

790
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,400
- Ma Neul. - No?

791
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,769
- This is... - My gosh.

792
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,900
This is hard too.

793
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,039
- My gosh. This... - Gosh, this is a tough one.

794
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,439
- Oh, my. This is hard. - I didn't see this coming.

795
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,540
Let's practice.

796
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,709
We might succeed.

797
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,279
- Gosh, trying to land it on top... - We can practice, right?

798
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,380
- Yes. - Yes.

799
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,979
- My gosh. - This is...

800
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,679
It's hard to make it land on top of the flowerpot.

801
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,520
I noticed that the flowerpot isn't flat.

802
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,790
- We should do it in the back. - We must step back a bit.

803
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,690
- Gosh. - This is...

804
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,389
- This is... - Gosh, this is so hard.

805
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,860
(Yeon Seok gets into the lunge position.)

806
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,559
Gosh, wait.

807
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,600
(It didn't even touch the flowerpot.)

808
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,699
(The inaccuracy is embarrassing.)

809
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,400
I need to at least make it land on top of it.

810
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,199
- This is... - Gosh, it's really hard.

811
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,610
- This is hard. - The height has changed now.

812
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,869
We're in trouble.

813
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,980
We have to make it stand upright.

814
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,779
We can't adjust the amount of the water, right?

815
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,109
- You can. - We can?

816
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,349
- Can we drink some of it? - Yes.

817
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,549
I need to fill it up with more water.

818
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,349
- It's better to have more. - Yes. I need a bit more water.

819
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,550
Excuse me, Hye Min.

820
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,620
- We'll get you those presents. - Okay.

821
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,890
(Ma Neul fills it up with water.)

822
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,460
It must stand upright.

823
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,960
Good, right? I'll make sure you get those presents.

824
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,490
We should be able to do it about now.

825
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,500
Hyun Woo.

826
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,640
Hyun Woo is good at this.

827
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,910
He's on fire.

828
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,079
- What... - You've got a talent for this.

829
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,239
Well, with this...

830
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,879
- Let's go for it now. - Let's try it.

831
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,009
- I think we can do this. - Yes.

832
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,719
- All right. - It will happen unexpectedly.

833
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,219
This is Round 2. In 1, 2, 3.

834
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,320
- Here we go. - Let's go.

835
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,249
I have a good feeling about this.

836
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,719
- You go first, Yeon Shik. - Me?

837
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,059
(Try number two: Yeon Seok)

838
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,760
- All right. - We could succeed out of the blue.

839
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,959
(He fails.)

840
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,929
- That was so close. - It hit the flowerpot, though.

841
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,060
It wasn't that bad.

842
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,969
- That was so close. - Ha Neul.

843
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,400
- It hit the flower pot, though. - That was so close.

844
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,499
It wasn't that bad.

845
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,640
(Try number two: Ha Neul)

846
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,109
- That was close. - I almost did it.

847
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,309
This isn't easy.

848
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,350
(Hyun Woo, the pro, adjusts his posture.)

849
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,179
You got this, Hyun Woo. You have a knack for this.

850
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,220
(Hyun Woo, who has a knack for this, is up next.)

851
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,190
(Sadly, he fails.)

852
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,060
All right.

853
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,289
(Jae Suk is the last to try.)

854
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,459
- I might suddenly succeed. - That's right.

855
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,100
(Try number two: Jae Suk)

856
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,469
(Their second attempt ends in failure.)

857
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,040
Frankly, I didn't expect him to do it.

858
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,609
- I see. - This isn't easy.

859
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,639
We have a free chance.

860
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,009
- Hye Min gets two chances. - Right.

861
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,209
- Right now? - Right away?

862
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,210
Shouldn't we use one of the coupons?
- On our next try. - Okay.

863
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,249
- One our next try. - Okay.

864
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,580
- Let's try one more time. - She can try next time.

865
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,389
(Practicing right away)

866
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,450
She's practicing hard.

867
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,720
(The Whenever Guest practices hard.)

868
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,729
It won't land upright easily.

869
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,699
(The four men in the greenhouse try to find a way to win.)

870
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,100
This is really difficult.

871
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,669
- It feels like I can do it. - Right?

872
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,370
It seems just out of reach.

873
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,269
- Let's try. - Should we?

874
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,470
Yes, our third try.

875
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,109
- Whatever. - This is the best one.

876
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,509
We still have several tries left.

877
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,209
- This is try number three. - We have several tries left.

878
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,449
- This is our third try. - Okay.

879
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,550
Try number three.

880
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,849
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

881
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,949
- Here we go. - Here we go.

882
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,989
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

883
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,149
- Ha Neul, would you like to try? - Yes.

884
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,150
All right.

885
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,489
It could suddenly land upright.

886
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,120
I might suddenly do it.

887
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,429
(Screaming)

888
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,599
- I almost got it. - Gosh.

889
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,700
(Ha Neul fails.)

890
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,100
I'll go next.

891
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,570
Yeon Shik.

892
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,040
(Yeon Seok gets in position.)

893
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,540
- It happens out of the blue. - It suddenly works.

894
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,210
- Yes! - That's insane.

895
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,980
(It landed upright!)

896
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,080
- Yes! - That's insane.

897
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,120
(Thrilling)

898
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,789
(Yoo One Shot is back today.)

899
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,320
- That was insane. - Good job, Yeon Seok.

900
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,689
- You did it. - Success.

901
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,060
- That was insane. - Let's go.

902
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,330
- We did it. - We cleared Round Two.

903
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,800
Gosh.

904
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,700
Calm down. As I told you earlier,

905
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,670
we sometimes clear the rounds quickly,

906
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,069
and it suddenly gets difficult in Round Three.

907
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,509
- So we fail in Round Three. - That's possible.

908
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,440
We don't know how difficult it'll get in Round Three.

909
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,149
They won't make us put it on top of another bottle, right?

910
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,549
- I don't think so. - That's humanly impossible.

911
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,980
- You think so? - You went too far.

912
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,849
- Hye Min. - Yes?

913
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,619
Please decide whether you'd like to go on to Round Three or not.

914
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,559
We have nine tries left.

915
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,620
- Nine tries? - Yes.

916
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,990
I say we go.

917
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,899
- Go? We have many tries left. - You're right.

918
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,499
- It seems too early to stop. - Right.

919
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,570
(The highly anticipated present for Round 3)

920
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,069
"I am with the plants even when I rest."

921
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,039
"I want to capture their beauty in photos."

922
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,539
"A Pentax film camera."

923
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,870
- Gosh. - Really?

924
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,710
- I love cameras. - Gosh.

925
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,179
- You do? - Yes.

926
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,550
- Really? - I recently bought film.

927
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,520
(Overexcited)

928
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,779
- It's so pretty. - You aren't interested, are you?

929
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,449
- Gosh. - It's pretty.

930
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,420
- This is amazing. - Look at the lens.

931
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,859
- It's turned on. - On.

932
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,230
Put it down. It isn't yours.

933
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,499
Okay.

934
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,670
(Flustered)

935
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,729
(The last mission to win 3 presents)

936
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,099
(Round 3)

937
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,510
(Make 2 water bottles land upright on top of a flowerpot.)

938
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,740
- See? - You were right.

939
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,539
(Half of them have to succeed.)

940
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,849
- I think this is possible. - We're good at this.

941
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,579
- Hyun Woo is good at it. - You're right.

942
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,549
- Let's give it a try. - Okay.

943
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,219
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

944
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,390
- Here we go. - Here we go.

945
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,849
- Let's do this. - I'll try first.

946
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,890
Okay.

947
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,089
(Jae Suk goes first instead of the ace.)

948
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,190
I think it'll work.

949
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
Toss it.

950
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,460
(He fails.)

951
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,069
(Try number four: Jae Suk)

952
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,870
(Up next is Ha Neul.)

953
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,869
- Please. - It's okay.

954
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,010
I had to throw it harder.

955
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,739
(The two aces are left.)

956
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,180
- It's okay if you two succeed. - I had to throw it harder.

957
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,980
- I'll... - That's right.

958
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,380
- I'll succeed. - Yes, okay.

959
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,250
(They automatically fail if Yeon Seok fails.)

960
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,090
I'll just do what I did earlier. Toss it, and it could suddenly work.

961
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Carelessly.

962
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,570
Carelessly.

963
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,239
(The final step...)

964
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,379
(is for Hyun Woo's water bottle to land upright.)

965
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,880
- Wait. - Wait a minute.

966
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,279
- Wait. I can't do this. - Come on.

967
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,679
- Hyun Woo. - I did it.

968
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,149
- I played my part. - Okay, Hyun Woo.

969
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,290
It's up to Hyun Woo.

970
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,449
- Hyun Woo, it's up to you. - I feel dizzy.

971
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,619
Then we'll have cleared Round Three.

972
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,059
- We'll have succeeded easily. - That's right.

973
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,190
(The opportunity to clear Round 3 comes faster than expected.)

974
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,330
I think he can do it.

975
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,440
That was insane.

976
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,840
(Hyun Woo, the pro, did it!)

977
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,149
- That was insane. - Hyun Woo.

978
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,380
(Screaming)

979
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,249
- That was insane. - Hyun Woo.

980
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,620
(Crying out in the greenhouse)

981
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,860
They are masters of this game.

982
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,190
- Wait a second. - What do you think?

983
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,060
What just happened?

984
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,059
That was truly amazing.

985
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,229
(Feeling bursts of dopamine)

986
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,369
I can't believe this.

987
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,269
- I feel dizzy. - All right.

988
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,839
- I did it. - I feel so dizzy.

989
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,009
With this, we cleared Round Three...

990
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,239
with Hye Min.

991
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,380
- Success. - Success.

992
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,010
- That was amazing. - Gosh.

993
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,249
- You're the best. - That was good.

994
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,149
- I'm drenched in sweat. - Gosh.

995
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,619
I was so nervous sitting here.

996
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,990
I'm drenched in sweat.

997
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,520
- Ma Neul. - This is sweat.

998
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,829
- This is sweat. - It's sweat?

999
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,060
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1000
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,099
- It worked. - I actually...

1001
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,230
- I was surprised. - You were really good at it.

1002
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,870
- You're a master of this game. - I didn't expect that.

1003
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,699
How did they both succeed?

1004
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,739
- Gosh. - Seriously, Hye Min.

1005
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,739
You can take all the presents for Rounds 1, 2, and 3,

1006
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,939
including the camera.

1007
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,069
(Hat and boots, massager, camera and films)

1008
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,170
(She wins all the presents.)

1009
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,009
This is perfect for you.

1010
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,610
- Does it fit? - It fits well.

1011
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,449
That looks great.

1012
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,080
- Do I look okay? - You look great.

1013
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,749
- You look great. - Thank you.

1014
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,920
Hyeminski.

1015
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,819
Hyeminski.

1016
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,159
(Hyeminski's 2025 SS Collection)

1017
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,190
- Thank you. - It fits you well.

1018
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,059
- Gosh. - We did it.

1019
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,399
It's cooler outside.

1020
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,630
That was rewarding.

1021
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,430
I'd feel bad if we went to Round Three...

1022
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,340
but had to take away all the presents.

1023
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,669
- That's right. - I'd suddenly feel bad.

1024
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,569
- But then... - You can barely eat at lunch.

1025
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,639
I bet.

1026
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,309
- Hyun Woo is a pro. - Seriously.

1027
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,579
He had a knack for it.

1028
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,350
I was surprised with Yeon Shik as well.

1029
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,709
(What?)

1030
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,919
I sometimes succeed in one shot.

1031
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,719
- He really does. - Yes, I do.

1032
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,190
- You were good today. - Gosh.

1033
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,359
- It feels good after succeeding. - It feels rewarding.

1034
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,259
- Let's have an early lunch. - Okay.

1035
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,320
What do you want to eat?

1036
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,229
- What do you like, Ha Neul? - Do we decide here?

1037
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,760
- Yes. - What do you feel like?

1038
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,200
I'm not sure. I'm okay with anything.

1039
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,200
I'm okay with anything.

1040
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,440
Should we ask her?

1041
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,999
- Yes. - Hye Min?

1042
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,470
- Should we ask Hye Min? - She must know.

1043
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,740
- Hye Min. - Any good restaurants?

1044
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,740
- Hye Min. - Yes?

1045
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,750
(She is filming a follow-up interview.)

1046
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,550
- Hye Min. - Yes?

1047
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,880
Can you recommend a restaurant for lunch?

1048
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,189
- I see. - Can you recommend anything?

1049
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,320
- Recommend a restaurant. - Is it possible?

1050
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,859
Do you like cold dishes?

1051
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,989
- Something cold sounds good. - Something cold...

1052
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,729
The naengmyeon at the dried pollack restaurant...

1053
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,029
is tasty.

1054
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,259
- Dried pollack restaurant? - Yes.

1055
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,699
- They sell naengmyeon? - Yes.

1056
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,770
- There's dried pollack naengmyeon. - It's raw pollack naengmyeon.

1057
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,229
- That sounds good. - It's delicious.

1058
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,840
- Sounds good. - Dried pollack restaurant.

1059
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,040
Can you recommend one more place just in case?

1060
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,510
(Thinking about it)

1061
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,209
One more place?

1062
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,039
- There mustn't be many restaurants. - Then let's go there.

1063
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,509
- Okay. - It's the best choice.

1064
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,949
- The best? - It's the best?

1065
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,049
- It's the best. - She says it's the best.

1066
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,479
- Have a good day. Thank you. - Bye.

1067
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,750
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1068
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,249
- This is the main branch. - Dried pollack sounds good.

1069
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,820
- Dried pollack sounds good. - Dried pollack.

1070
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,189
- I like dried pollack. - The naengmyeon sounds good.

1071
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,559
- You like noodles, right? - I love it.

1072
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,819
I do too.

1073
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,159
- Gosh. - Dried pollack sounds good.

1074
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,500
I was only thinking about hangover soup,

1075
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,429
but they have naengmyeon here.

1076
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,729
Bibim naengmyeon with dried pollack.

1077
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,870
I can't pronounce it.

1078
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,840
- Hyun Woo, what were you saying? - Bibim naengmyeon.

1079
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,369
- Come on. - Stop it.

1080
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,910
- What was it? - Bibim naengmyeon.

1081
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,839
It's a 12-minute walk.

1082
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,140
That's nice.

1083
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,380
Neither of you are related to Magok, are you?

1084
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,249
- No. - No.

1085
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,549
I was always worried when I was in this area.

1086
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,619
- Why? - Why?

1087
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,919
- That I might miss my flight. - That you might miss your flight?

1088
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,719
- Yes, I was always worried. - I see.

1089
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,929
Oh, this is near the airport.

1090
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,060
Yes, it is.

1091
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,230
How far is the restaurant?

1092
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,869
(It is currently 32°C.)

1093
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,739
- We haven't even started yet. - Really?

1094
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,069
We just left the botanical garden.

1095
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,169
- We haven't even gotten started? - No.

1096
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,839
Imagine we're walking down the street Hye Min did.

1097
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,439
She highly recommended this place.

1098
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,710
- Yes, she did. - It was her first choice.

1099
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,379
- She said nothing could beat it. - Right.

1100
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,319
- She said it was the best. - That means it's that good.

1101
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,390
- Right. - I'm curious.

1102
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,759
- Let's cross the street here. - The crosswalk?

1103
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,990
- Go straight? - Yes.

1104
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,189
We can cross whichever turns green first.

1105
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,259
- Okay. - Either one.

1106
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,559
We can cross whichever turns green first.

1107
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,659
Let's stay in the shade.

1108
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,960
(They can cross whichever turns green first.)

1109
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,670
Will this one turn green first?

1110
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,539
Normally, when it looks like this...

1111
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,939
- The next green light... - That one...

1112
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,739
- They just turned left. - Which one is it?

1113
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,340
Since they're crossing right now, I think this one will turn green.

1114
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,510
It's this one.

1115
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,310
(He is proved wrong within 1 second.)

1116
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,250
This one turned green. Okay.

1117
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,720
I see another naengmyeon restaurant.

1118
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,890
- Gosh. - Let's stick to our original plan.

1119
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,320
He wants to go wherever is close.

1120
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,130
I'm a type P.

1121
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,229
I go wherever I see first.

1122
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,030
- Me too. I totally do that. - You do?

1123
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,899
Even when I order food deliveries...

1124
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,970
This may sound funny,

1125
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,939
but I just order from the restaurant that shows up on the app first.

1126
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,099
Really?

1127
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,509
It seems like a hassle...

1128
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,109
- to look for good restaurants. - I know what you mean.

1129
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,210
So I just order from the first place I see.

1130
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,679
- Really? - From "today's recommendation."

1131
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,880
That's unbelievable.

1132
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,519
What about you, Hyun Woo?

1133
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,119
- I read all the reviews... - You're meticulous.

1134
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,219
And scroll through the photos.

1135
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,689
I sometimes zoom into the photos to see what kind of sauce it has.

1136
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,719
Really?

1137
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,859
You're right.

1138
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,329
The photos in the reviews are honest photos.

1139
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,630
- That's right. - Really?

1140
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,730
I'm looking forward to the food.

1141
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
This is what I think.

1142
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:48,169
It was tasty enough to confidently recommend to others.

1143
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,969
To think that Hye Min...

1144
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,110
walks all the way here to eat this...

1145
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,140
It makes me feel a bit sad.

1146
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,650
I think she'll drive here.

1147
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
(Crushing his empathy)

1148
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,879
- She could take a taxi. - I'm sure she'll drive here.

1149
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,090
- Or take a taxi. - Yes.

1150
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,950
- That must be it. - That's it.

1151
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,619
- What's this? - That's it.

1152
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,159
- Over there. - Dried Pollack World.

1153
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,860
(They arrive at the dried pollack restaurant.)

1154
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,560
They open at 6am.

1155
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,099
- They open very early. - This must be the dish.

1156
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,500
- They open at 6am? - Dried pollack bibim naengmyeon.

1157
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,000
(Hours: 6am to 9pm)

1158
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,439
Hello.

1159
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,969
Is it okay to film ourselves while eating?

1160
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,670
- Yes, of course. - Thank you.

1161
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,439
- It looks tasty. - It looks tasty.

1162
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,980
- It does look tasty. - They also have dried pollack soup.

1163
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,350
- I want the soup as well. - Right?

1164
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,979
They also have grilled dried pollack.

1165
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,150
We should try that.

1166
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,449
We'll have a grilled dried pollack set meal,

1167
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,420
a dried pollack and vegetable jeon,

1168
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,419
- a dried pollack... - Mul naengmyeon.

1169
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,689
- Mul naengmyeon... - Four of them.

1170
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,929
- I'll have mul naengmyeon. - Four of them.

1171
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,430
- Four of them. - Thank you.

1172
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,599
This is nice.

1173
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,459
- You ordered the jeon, right? - Yes.

1174
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,600
- It sounds tasty. - Dried pollack and vegetable jeon.

1175
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,240
I asked about it, and they have a water tank.

1176
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,910
The food is tasty here.

1177
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,510
You can tell by the kimchi.

1178
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:58,670
- The kimchi... - I see.

1179
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,409
- It must be tasty. - It's insanely good.

1180
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,080
- Then we know. - Try it. It's insanely good.

1181
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,849
- The seokbakji? - It's insanely good.

1182
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,180
The food must be tasty.

1183
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,580
Even the seokbakji is insanely good?

1184
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,020
It's tasty.

1185
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,850
This is tasty.

1186
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,359
- Honestly... - It's tasty.

1187
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,030
You can tell how good the food will be by tasting the side dishes.

1188
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,429
- Excuse me, this is so tasty. - Yes?

1189
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,500
Could we have some more?

1190
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,229
- Can we have the one here? - You have to get it yourself.

1191
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,629
- Do we get it ourselves? I'll go. - It's over there.

1192
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,469
- Is it self-service? - It's self-service.

1193
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,869
(He quickly goes to get more side dishes.)

1194
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,340
Thank you. It's so tasty.

1195
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,740
The dried radish strips are insane.

1196
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,250
It'll be tasty with the naengmyeon.

1197
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,580
(Gasping)

1198
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,009
(The dried pollack soup is served.)

1199
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,720
- Add an egg. - Okay.

1200
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,120
(Adding an egg)

1201
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,520
They also have dried radish strips.

1202
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,119
(Piled high)

1203
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,259
It'll be tasty with the naengmyeon.

1204
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,959
They even sell this here.

1205
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,499
- Really? - Yes, they sell it.

1206
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,499
- They sell it? - If they sell it...

1207
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,630
- That means it's really good. - It shows confidence.

1208
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,640
(Marveling)

1209
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,110
(They explain the taste silently.)

1210
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,740
It's really good. It's insane.

1211
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,649
Hye Min made a good recommendation.

1212
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,980
- The dried radish strips are tasty. - They're really good.

1213
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,119
- Right? - Yes, it's very tasty.

1214
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,349
(They share the dried pollack soup.)

1215
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,419
I'd order it often if I lived nearby.

1216
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Me too.

1217
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,790
Just give me a little.

1218
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,859
It's not too much.

1219
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,690
- Seriously. - Have all of it.

1220
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,160
I don't eat that much.

1221
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,000
Why don't you eat that much?

1222
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,769
My mouth looks big when I smile,

1223
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,800
but I don't eat that much.

1224
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,439
(Laughing)

1225
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,739
Was that supposed to be a joke?

1226
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,879
(His mouth gets bigger when he laughs in embarrassment.)

1227
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,880
I'm sorry.

1228
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,350
This is good for hangovers.

1229
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,420
Dried pollack is good for hangovers.

1230
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,189
- This is really good. - It's tasty.

1231
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,819
It tastes even better after succeeding in all three rounds.

1232
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,219
- I didn't expect that. - Ha Neul,

1233
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,560
let's try to succeed next time.

1234
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,930
I'm not good with my hands or feet.

1235
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,170
He's bad with his feet. FC Bad Feet.

1236
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,099
I'm a player with FC Bad Feet.

1237
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,269
I'm even bad with my hands.

1238
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,800
(I'm even bad with my hands.)

1239
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,309
- Here is your jeon. - Thank you.

1240
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,470
- Thank you. - Dried pollack and vegetable jeon.

1241
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,680
This is dried pollack on the outside.

1242
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,810
I've never seen it fried like this.

1243
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,879
- Really? - The outer layer is dried pollack.

1244
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,419
The dried pollack is like a topping.

1245
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,520
- Yes, it's a topping. - I see.

1246
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,720
(Marveling)

1247
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,990
This is tasty.

1248
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,730
(They get choked up by how tasty it is.)

1249
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,900
It's tasty.

1250
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,630
- No wonder the owner is confident. - This is tasty.

1251
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,439
It's crisp on the outside.

1252
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,099
- The crisp comes from the pollack. - Yes, the dried pollack.

1253
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,510
- It's very tasty. - Yes, it is.

1254
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,609
- The food is good here. - It's really good.

1255
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,339
(It also tastes amazing with peppers.)

1256
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,950
- That's right. - Thank you.

1257
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,679
(The dried pollack naengmyeon Hye Min recommended)

1258
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,749
- Thank you. - The dried pollack is amazing.

1259
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,389
(He tries the seasoned dried pollack first.)

1260
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,449
(Gasping)

1261
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,790
- It's nice and cool. - Yes, it is.

1262
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,959
(They eat the naengmyeon with seasoned dried pollack.)

1263
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,630
Can we order the seasoned dried pollack separately?

1264
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,459
(It's the perfect combination with seasoned dried pollack.)

1265
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,659
Try it with this.

1266
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,900
- Try it together. - Like this?

1267
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,640
There's a reason Hye Min recommended this place.

1268
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,210
I'm glad we asked her for a recommendation.

1269
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,710
Thank you, Hye Min.

1270
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,110
- It's very good. - Yes.

1271
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,980
(Ha Neul starts digging in.)

1272
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,680
The grilled dried pollack is tasty too.

1273
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
It goes well together.

1274
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,989
It's also good with seokbakji.

1275
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,089
(He eats silently and endlessly.)

1276
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,560
It's a novel dish.

1277
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,260
It's different.

1278
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:35,620
(He drinks straight from the bowl.)

1279
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,400
(Glancing at Ha Neul)

1280
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,569
You don't eat that little.

1281
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,570
I think you're right.

1282
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,200
You have a big appetite.

1283
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
You eat well without being picky.

1284
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:50,010
- You ate so much of this. - I'm going to buy this.

1285
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,810
I'm going to buy this for real.

1286
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,510
I'm going to buy the dried radish strips.

1287
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,410
- It's Refreshing. - Yes.

1288
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,609
It's refreshing with a capital "R."

1289
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,610
(It makes them emphasize the word.)

1290
00:42:58,611 --> 00:42:59,879
- It's Refreshing. - It's Refreshing.

1291
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,949
Yes, it is.

1292
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,319
People from Gyeongsang Province use tense consonants.

1293
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,350
That's right.

1294
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,860
Especially when you're overexcited.

1295
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,929
You use them?

1296
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,330
When I was in my early 20s,

1297
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,000
I was taking a bus to the theater.

1298
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,570
A rough old man got on the bus at Dongdaemun...

1299
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,969
and beat the driver.

1300
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,999
(He witnessed the bus driver getting beaten.)

1301
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,370
It was when many beatings happened.

1302
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,740
- Everyone stayed still. - Right.

1303
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,180
Without realizing it,

1304
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,610
I said, "It's not even the driver's fault."

1305
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,280
I said it without realizing it.

1306
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,379
- Good job. - It was out of the blue.

1307
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,250
You have a sense of justice.

1308
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,190
Is that why you're PJ?

1309
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,389
- PF. - Yes, PF.

1310
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,390
(PF can't stand injustice.)

1311
00:43:43,391 --> 00:43:45,189
I'm from Busan.

1312
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,229
- You are? - You're from Busan?

1313
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,899
- Yes, I'm from Busan. - You got rid of your accent.

1314
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,429
There is one thing I can't get rid of.

1315
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,770
- What is it? - The alphabet "E."

1316
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,769
I can't fix it.

1317
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,970
- "E?" - The alphabet "E?"

1318
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,009
- You just said "E." - Yes.

1319
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,110
To me, that is the number two.

1320
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,350
- "E" is the alphabet "E." - Okay.

1321
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,520
The square of two, the square of "e."

1322
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,119
- I hear the accent. - The square of "e."

1323
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,149
I hear it.

1324
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,189
The square of two.

1325
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,490
So I'm curious.

1326
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:16,689
People from Seoul pronounce the number two...

1327
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,989
- and the alphabet "E" the same. - That's right.

1328
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,860
Then isn't it hard to understand?

1329
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,329
Try saying "email."

1330
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,370
Email.

1331
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,570
It's email.

1332
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,040
Email.

1333
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,709
Your dialect pops out when you talk to your hometown friends, right?

1334
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,710
Yes, sometimes.

1335
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:36,850
It pops out right away.

1336
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,479
When you speak with a dialect...

1337
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,680
in Busan, you need to use interjections in between.

1338
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,589
- Only then does it sound right. - That's right.

1339
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,490
It's like, you know...

1340
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,660
They are necessary.

1341
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,989
- You know, right? - Yes, it's necessary.

1342
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,100
You know what?

1343
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,700
You seem to be excluding me by talking about the Busan dialect.

1344
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,399
- Wait. - Come on.

1345
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,009
- Why would I exclude you? - That's what you're doing.

1346
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,039
(The person from Suyu-ri is disappointed.)

1347
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,270
That's rude.

1348
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,640
We were talking about interjections.

1349
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,179
- That isn't true. - Come on.

1350
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,610
You were excluding me.

1351
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,980
Did you realize only the you three were laughing loudly?

1352
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,320
That isn't what we were doing.

1353
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,790
It's been a while since I felt excluded in Seoul.

1354
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,590
(The person from Seoul wanted to be included in the conversation.)

1355
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,360
Do you cook, Ha Neul?

1356
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,530
No.

1357
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,330
- Do you cook, Hyun Woo? - I can make...

1358
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,570
most Korean dishes.

1359
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,440
Really?

1360
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,009
- I lived alone. - For a long time?

1361
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,339
Yes, for a long time.

1362
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,310
I went from boarding homes...

1363
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,010
- to dorms since I was 20. - I see.

1364
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,079
What was your major in university?

1365
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,889
I started as an English literature major.

1366
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,149
- Really? - English literature?

1367
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:55,220
- Did you change majors? - I lasted a year before quitting.

1368
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,529
- Is that so? - Yes.

1369
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,230
Then did you study again to study theater and film?

1370
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,000
I didn't need CSAT scores for Korea National University of Arts.

1371
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,300
So I just quickly prepared for the performance exam.

1372
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,070
You're talented.

1373
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,740
- That's right. - I suddenly realized...

1374
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,469
- why he's wearing glasses. - That's right.

1375
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,110
- You look smart. - Hyun Woo is smart.

1376
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,079
It's different from your glasses.

1377
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,720
- Come on. - What are you saying?

1378
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,919
They're different.

1379
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,379
Are mine to protect my face?

1380
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,390
(Facial protection?)

1381
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,849
Are mine to protect my face?

1382
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,159
You can't take them off.

1383
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,320
So you're saying they're to protect my face?

1384
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,390
He's wearing them because he studied hard.

1385
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,229
- You look different. - He really does.

1386
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,300
(Feeling shy)

1387
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,030
Since we enjoyed our meal,

1388
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,239
- Of course. - let's see who'll pay.

1389
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,410
Did you bring your credit card?

1390
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,009
- This is my wallet. - I have my wallet with me.

1391
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,550
Why don't we play a simple game since there are cups here?

1392
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,749
We'll pour water in it, and whoever makes it overflow...

1393
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,150
pays for the meal.

1394
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,550
Sounds good.

1395
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:57,019
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Let's decide the order.

1396
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,020
- Okay. - All right.

1397
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:01,560
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1398
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,990
(Hyun Woo loses.)

1399
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:04,090
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1400
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,530
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1401
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,099
- I'll go first. - How should we do it?

1402
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,529
You lost, so we'll go this way.

1403
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,669
Sure.

1404
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,570
- Clockwise. - Good.

1405
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,400
- This is... - Great.

1406
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,710
(Modifying the paper cup)

1407
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:21,110
- You turned it into a kettle. - No.

1408
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,249
No, I didn't.

1409
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,349
That was sneaky.

1410
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,419
What? How is that sneaky?

1411
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,449
It is.

1412
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,689
How is that sneaky?

1413
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,789
We can fold our cups?

1414
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,190
- Okay, then. - I haven't heard that in so long.

1415
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,960
I should fold it too.

1416
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,190
- Do I start? - Yes.

1417
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,889
- Just pour a bunch. - It's the first turn, so...

1418
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,999
That was very sneaky.

1419
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,060
But...

1420
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,240
You need to go hard at first.

1421
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,600
- You should. - All right.

1422
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,040
(Jae Suk is second.)

1423
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,939
(He stops with only a bit of room left.)

1424
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,409
The game might end in one lap.

1425
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,609
Not at all.

1426
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,920
(Yeon Seok's turn)

1427
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,090
I can't let it come back to me.

1428
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,390
Jae Suk!

1429
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,689
- Jae Suk. Gosh. - Be careful.

1430
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,790
I was so startled.

1431
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,860
It's to the brim now.

1432
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,059
- Keep your hands off the table. - Keep your hands off the table.

1433
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,529
- It's going to end soon. - Careful, Hyun Woo.

1434
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,600
Okay.

1435
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,300
Pour the drops.

1436
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,370
He poured a lot.

1437
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,840
(It's about to brim over.)

1438
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,410
(Concentrating)

1439
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,250
(Scared to death)

1440
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,890
(Joy and sorrow)

1441
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,229
Oh, no.

1442
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,399
That's insane.

1443
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,060
- That's crazy. - There's no way.

1444
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,169
(It's still good to go.)

1445
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,199
- That's crazy. - There's no way.

1446
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,340
- Guys, it's rising. - Don't move.

1447
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,569
It's rising.

1448
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,339
Hang on. Don't move.

1449
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,839
- This is... - Don't kick.

1450
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,009
- I won't. - That's cheating.

1451
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,580
- This is a huge one. - It's cheating.

1452
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,050
- I won't. - Don't touch me.

1453
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,820
(Tense)

1454
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,820
- It'll brim over. - It's too high.

1455
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,190
No.

1456
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,430
This is...

1457
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,030
Don't tell me I have to do it again.

1458
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,769
- Hyun Woo will... - I think I'm done.

1459
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,239
(Nerve-racking)

1460
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,300
Please.

1461
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,110
He poured quite a lot.

1462
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,849
He poured quite a lot.

1463
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,720
- Why won't it brim over? - I didn't mean to.

1464
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,549
I failed to control it.

1465
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,850
- This will... - No way.

1466
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,630
This is unbelievable!

1467
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,369
- No way. - This is unbelievable!

1468
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,409
(The one who genuinely can't believe it)

1469
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,569
This is unbelievable!

1470
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,739
(The one who genuinely can't believe it)

1471
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,810
It's going to be one of you two.

1472
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,010
How did this happen?

1473
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,980
The volcanic eruption is close.

1474
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,350
- I know. - It's so close.

1475
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,360
Hang on.

1476
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,460
Come on!

1477
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,090
Hang on.

1478
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,090
Come on!

1479
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,159
(Jae Suk loses.)

1480
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,330
I should have left only one drop!

1481
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,830
Did you see that?

1482
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,100
It was supposed to be a single drop.

1483
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,109
- That was wild. - I failed to leave a drop.

1484
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,209
That was insane.

1485
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,780
It's so maddening.

1486
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,349
- How did we go that far? - I know, right?

1487
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,779
- It rose like this. - I know.

1488
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,210
It was almost a hill.

1489
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,019
Thanks for paying, Jae Suk.

1490
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,479
Sure.

1491
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,650
Thank you!

1492
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,950
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1493
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,490
Gosh. I could have gotten away with it.

1494
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,759
- Just one? - I'll buy some of these.

1495
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,959
You should get some kkakdugi.

1496
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,429
- I'm going to buy some. - Good.

1497
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,630
- One kkakdugi... - Kkakdugi, white kimchi,

1498
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,030
and dried radish strips.

1499
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,600
And sliced raw pollack salad.

1500
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,839
It's okay. I'm fine with these.

1501
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,439
- Take a sliced raw pollack salad. - It's fine.

1502
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,209
- Come on. - I'll need this more. It's okay.

1503
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,239
- I'm totally fine. - I'll take it, then.

1504
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,909
- Good. I'll pay for everything. - Okay.

1505
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,940
(Yeon Seok also gets a side dish.)

1506
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,309
- The big one? - Get the big one.

1507
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,549
(Buying more for Hyun Woo)

1508
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,720
- Thank you. - You should get the big one.

1509
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,289
The food was so good. Thank you.

1510
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,319
Here?

1511
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,450
That's okay.

1512
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,090
Thank you.

1513
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:28,689
I'm full.

1514
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,189
(Satisfied with the meal)

1515
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,259
Good.

1516
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,499
- Thank you, Jae Suk. - Don't mention it.

1517
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,659
Thank you for the side dishes.

1518
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,829
- These are... - These guys...

1519
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,669
- necessary for guys who live alone. - live alone.

1520
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,929
- Thank you. - Raw pollack salad.

1521
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,940
- I'll enjoy them. - The guys who live alone.

1522
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,410
- Yeon Shik seemed to like it. - It was delicious.

1523
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,580
Where's our bus stop?

1524
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,110
Across the street?

1525
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,379
I think so. Let me check.

1526
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,510
Man, I'm full.

1527
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,849
We ate so much, though.

1528
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,449
Wait. It arrives in a minute.

1529
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,649
Seriously? We need to hurry.

1530
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,019
- In a minute? - Really?

1531
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,990
- Where is it? - We turn right here.

1532
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,659
(They start running out of the blue.)

1533
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,890
- It's here. We take the right here? - Yes.

1534
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,389
Run.

1535
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,759
(They'll surely be late if they miss this bus.)

1536
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,929
We're almost there.

1537
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:09,970
(They'll surely be late if they miss this bus.)

1538
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,799
Is this it?

1539
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,470
- Yes, this is our bus stop. - That's the one.

1540
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,940
(Fortunately, they arrived soon as they ran.)

1541
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,640
It's Bus 6642.

1542
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,310
This is it, right?

1543
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,910
- We're here. - It's arriving soon.

1544
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,780
- Good. - That's the bus.

1545
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,079
It says it'll arrive in four minutes.

1546
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,180
It must have left already.

1547
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,220
- That can't be right. - No.

1548
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,290
- Number 66... - Take a seat.

1549
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:37,390
It meant that we would arrive at the bus stop in a minute.

1550
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,100
(It meant it would take 1 minute to the bus stop on foot.)

1551
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,430
Why did we run, then?

1552
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,069
Look.

1553
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,299
It said that the ETA was at 47.

1554
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,740
- So, I thought... - It was a minute away.

1555
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,869
- It meant that it'd take a minute. - For us to get here.

1556
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,380
(Plopping down)

1557
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,980
- Sorry. - It's all good.

1558
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,380
- It happens. - My bad, guys.

1559
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,519
It meant that it would take us a minute to get here.

1560
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,649
That's right.

1561
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:02,820
(Panting)

1562
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,250
Jae Suk, there's a video...

1563
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,219
- that I play when I'm depressed. - What is it?

1564
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,460
It's a video of you.

1565
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,029
Was it on "Infinite Challenge?"

1566
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,329
You got on a bus and interviewed people.

1567
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,100
- Do you mean Sabre? - Sabre.

1568
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,599
- What's Sabre? - Do you know about Sabre?

1569
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,869
- Sabre. - The cookie?

1570
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,100
No, it's...

1571
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,840
What was it?

1572
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,540
(During the Seoul special on "Infinite Challenge" in 2007)

1573
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,740
(What's your name?)

1574
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:27,939
(Stephanie)

1575
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,180
(Sabre?)

1576
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,550
(He misheard Stephanie as Sabre.)

1577
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,920
(Are you guys a couple?)

1578
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,290
(They were strangers.)

1579
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,960
(He makes things awkward and runs off.)

1580
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,560
(Stomping his feet)

1581
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,660
She said, "Stephanie," and I asked, "Sabre?"

1582
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,970
I've messed up a lot of interviews.

1583
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,200
I can't believe I'm getting on a bus with you.

1584
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,469
- That's our bus. - It's here.

1585
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,010
- That's the one. - Let's go.

1586
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,939
This is a nice bus.

1587
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,239
- It looks amazing. - It's a low-floor bus.

1588
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,679
(Getting on the bus with the legendary Sabre)

1589
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,910
Four adults, sir.

1590
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,680
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1591
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,019
- What? - Should we sit there?

1592
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,149
(They sit in the back.)

1593
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,990
This bus looks different.

1594
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,689
- It's a pretty big bus. - It is.

1595
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,760
Yes.

1596
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,030
It has three doors.

1597
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,500
- You're right. Three doors. - It's got three doors.

1598
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,199
- What? - What?

1599
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,299
Here, there...

1600
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,199
That's why this bus was so big.

1601
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,239
- I think it's a different type. - I've never been on this.

1602
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,340
- Me neither. - But...

1603
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,910
Ha Neul, do you often take the bus?

1604
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:37,150
Yes. But I'm very claustrophobic,

1605
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,810
so I can't get on a crowded bus.

1606
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,920
No crowded buses.

1607
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,489
I take the subway more often.

1608
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,949
When the subway is crowded, you need to...

1609
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,789
- If it's crowded, - squeeze yourself in.

1610
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,929
- I get off at the next station... - You get some rest.

1611
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,900
- and take a break. - And take deep breaths.

1612
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,900
Then, I take the next car and go a little further.

1613
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,429
That must be hard.

1614
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,269
Didn't you feel claustrophobic when you were performing?

1615
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,770
- When it's a full audience... - I'm not affected by that.

1616
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,610
Claustrophobia occurs when you're in confined spaces.

1617
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,239
It's gotten worse, so I find it difficult to act...

1618
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,380
on tow trucks.

1619
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,479
- Tow trucks? - Tow trucks.

1620
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,679
- You put a car on it. - Oh, because it's confined.

1621
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,049
You put a car on it, and you can't open the door...

1622
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:19,089
- Right. - because it perfectly fits.

1623
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,920
- Yes, it goes right on top. - So, I can't do that.

1624
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,459
Every time we stop, I roll down the window...

1625
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,530
- and get outside. - I see.

1626
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,660
When we resume, I go back inside and roll up the window.

1627
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,199
Are you afraid of heights?

1628
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,769
- No. - Really?

1629
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,939
- I'm not afraid of heights at all. - That's interesting.

1630
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,110
So, I've tried all the famous bungee-jumping spots in Korea.

1631
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,739
- Because I like bungee-jumping. - Is that right?

1632
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,640
- Oh, because it's in an open space. - It's open, so I feel comfortable.

1633
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,080
- You tried all the jump spots? - I did.

1634
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,480
That's impressive.

1635
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,249
We need to press the bell now.

1636
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,420
- Press it. - I'm jealous, Ha Neul.

1637
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,989
(Ringing)

1638
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,020
Gosh.

1639
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,859
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1640
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,860
(What is their second spare time spot?)

1641
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,099
- His name is Jo Geon Yeong. - Geon Yeong.

1642
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,559
"Charmed by the airport where airplanes come and go,"

1643
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,329
"I'm making my way from the Air Force..."

1644
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,169
- "to flight attendant, pilot," - What?

1645
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,739
"and now the headquarters of an airline."

1646
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,509
"I'm a late-blooming intern."

1647
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,569
He's an intern.

1648
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,180
"I'd love to spend some quality time with my superior,"

1649
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,980
"who's always been cheering me on, before this internship ends."

1650
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,520
"There's still a little distance between us,"

1651
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,880
"so please check in so that we can get closer."

1652
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,020
His superior.

1653
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,160
I think it's this building.

1654
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,660
Is this the one?

1655
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,289
It's this one.

1656
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,459
- What? - What?

1657
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,630
Eighth floor.

1658
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:33,999
- Eighth floor? - Eighth floor.

1659
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,529
I think this is it.

1660
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,099
- Is this the one? - I think so.

1661
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,369
- Ha Neul. - What?

1662
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,829
- Ha Neul. - Jae Seon? What?

1663
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,939
What are you doing here?

1664
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,270
I'm a first officer here.

1665
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,910
- What? - I was wondering why...

1666
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,810
- You really surprised me. - I couldn't call you.

1667
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,449
- Let's meet up next time. - I'd love that.

1668
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,019
- That sounds great. - Let's grab some coffee.

1669
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,219
- Go on. - Okay.

1670
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,319
- I'll text you. - Sure.

1671
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,790
(Ha Neul's pilot friend)

1672
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,289
- Ha Neul ran into a friend. - Seriously?

1673
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,820
I have a friend who's a pilot.

1674
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,860
He came here because he had to take a class.

1675
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,830
This must be a place for classes.

1676
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,329
- For pilots. - Maybe it's a place...

1677
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,730
- where they train pilots. - Yes.

1678
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,639
It must be a training institution.

1679
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,240
(Their second Whenever Guest works at an airline?)

1680
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,069
- It must be here. - Goodness.

1681
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,110
(They cautiously enter.)

1682
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,909
- Hello. - Hello.

1683
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,009
- Mr. Jo Geon Yeong? - Yes.

1684
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,339
- Here he is. - Nice to meet you.

1685
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,180
- Hi. - Hi.

1686
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:28,680
(Jo Geon Yeong, second Whenever Guest)

1687
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,119
- Hello. - Are you his superior?

1688
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,320
That's right.

1689
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,890
- She's his superior! - The intern and his superior.

1690
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,189
- Yes, that's right. - Is she your superior?

1691
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,360
Yes.

1692
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,659
What is this place?

1693
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,629
This is the FTD Room.

1694
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,229
It's where we have the replica of a cockpit for pilots.

1695
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,299
- It's for training. - Yes.

1696
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,239
- Oh, it is! - Yes.

1697
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,869
- I'll show you around. - May we come in?

1698
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,109
- Oh, there's an airplane model! - This way.

1699
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,970
The FTD Room?

1700
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,380
- What is it? Is it the Boeing 737? - Yes.

1701
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,879
The pilots come here and try it out...

1702
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,310
before they fly.

1703
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:59,810
(Where you can simulate flying an actual plane)

1704
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:03,120
I wasn't expecting to see this in a building.

1705
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,250
No way!

1706
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,490
(Pondering)

1707
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,289
Geon Yeong, you were in the Air Force, right?

1708
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,729
Yes, I was an enlisted soldier.

1709
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,860
- You were enlisted? - Yes.

1710
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Which class are you?

1711
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:16,870
I was Class 739.

1712
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,700
- Were you in the Air Force? - Yes.

1713
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,540
- Which class? - Class 630.

1714
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,300
- Oh, man. - Salute.

1715
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,940
We're...

1716
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,610
- Oh, man. - Salute.

1717
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,179
We're not the Marine Corps, but...

1718
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,349
- he just... - You guys actually do that?

1719
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:33,280
- It's not that. - You really do that?

1720
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:34,720
- When we were eating... - We're just glad to see each other.

1721
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,319
You're my senior.

1722
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,690
You used that as an excuse.

1723
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,219
He's from the Air Force.

1724
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,890
You've been pulling all your connections...

1725
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,989
from your school, the military, and regions since this morning.

1726
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,829
(Yeon Seok has a lot of connections.)

1727
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,559
Should we sit here and talk?

1728
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,830
- Okay. - In this room?

1729
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,929
What are your tasks exactly?

1730
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,399
Our team is called Airport Service.

1731
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,469
- Just like the name, - Service?

1732
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:59,909
We oversee all the tasks related to service at the airport.

1733
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,379
You normally see the ground crew...

1734
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,279
- at the airport, right? - Yes.

1735
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,810
We're in charge of those tasks in general.

1736
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,990
That must be why he used the term "check-in."

1737
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,789
Geon Yeong, what made you...

1738
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,590
join this company as an intern?

1739
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,230
I was interested in being a flight attendant and the airport.

1740
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,459
I was discharged from the Air Force,

1741
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,399
- and I became a flight attendant. - Oh, a flight attendant.

1742
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,769
- That was your previous job. - Yes.

1743
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,299
I was a flight attendant at a foreign airline.

1744
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,470
Then, I tried training to be a pilot.

1745
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,070
Now, I wanted to work at an airport-related company,

1746
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,209
so I applied for a program called...

1747
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:35,040
the Future Tomorrow Internship,

1748
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,539
organized by the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

1749
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,149
- And I ended up here. - I see.

1750
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,579
So, I'm currently working as an intern.

1751
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,520
I see.

1752
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,520
How long have you been working here?

1753
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,189
It's only been a month.

1754
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,249
- It was very recent. - Yes.

1755
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,390
I had just joined the company.

1756
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,760
How was working with this intern for a month?

1757
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,429
What was it like in the past month?

1758
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,459
- The way she laughed was... - She almost scoffed.

1759
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,729
- Like, "Don't get me started." - The way she laughed...

1760
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,839
- That's not it. - "It's only been a month."

1761
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,069
He's actually helping me out a lot.

1762
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,469
I can entrust him with pretty difficult tasks.

1763
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,479
I'm going to miss him so much when he's gone.

1764
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,310
- Really? - Yes.

1765
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,779
So, you've worked...

1766
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,579
in the flight industry the whole time.

1767
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,149
Yes, I'm very interested,

1768
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,489
- so I stayed. - When you were a child,

1769
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,419
did you only play with toy airplanes?

1770
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,689
Maybe he's an airplane lover.

1771
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,059
- An airplane lover? - Yes.

1772
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,589
- He might be! - The replicas.

1773
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,099
- There are airport lovers too. - Yes, airport lovers.

1774
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,159
- There are. - It makes sense.

1775
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,300
- I'd say I'm an airport lover. - I see.

1776
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,299
- An airport lover. - Not the airplane?

1777
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,870
- The airplane... - You love airports.

1778
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,739
- Yes, the airports. - Airports!

1779
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,340
What exactly is an airport lover?

1780
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,879
I couldn't call myself a lover,

1781
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,009
but I once slept in an airport.

1782
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,679
What? For no good reason?

1783
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,009
No good reason. I just slept there.

1784
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,819
- Because you love airports? - Yes, because I love them.

1785
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,220
- A friend of mine... - Yes.

1786
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,889
Just goes to the airport...

1787
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,189
on his day off, even though he's not traveling.

1788
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,819
He walks around,

1789
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,289
- He spends his time there. - hangs out there,

1790
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,489
and comes back home.

1791
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,929
- Right. - Airports are nice.

1792
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,559
- That's me. - He likes going to the airport.

1793
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,560
It's kind of like a staycation.

1794
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:04,200
- Exactly. - It's an airport-cation.

1795
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,699
- An airport-cation? - I get it, though.

1796
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,339
- Airports are nice and clean. - Yes.

1797
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,569
I found out that there were guys who liked airports.

1798
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,709
I go on an airport-cation and go airport-gazing.

1799
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,179
- Airport-gazing. - I gaze at airplanes.

1800
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,679
Is there such a word?

1801
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,180
I made it.

1802
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,619
- I hear that there's a place... - He made it up.

1803
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,149
- where you watch... - Yes.

1804
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,119
All the airplanes take off.

1805
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,489
- When you go to the top floor. - Yes.

1806
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,289
There's a pavilion.

1807
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:32,630
- Right. - It's a glass wall,

1808
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,100
so you can watch all the airplanes take off and land.

1809
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,329
(Biseonru Pavilion is a place with a great view, )

1810
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,030
(only known to a few people.)

1811
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,739
As he just said,

1812
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,099
you can watch the airplanes take off and land all day...

1813
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,409
with a cup of coffee or tea in your hand.

1814
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,479
When you pick your travel destination overseas,

1815
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,749
do you pick one based on its airport?

1816
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,379
The airport in Singapore is very famous.

1817
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,389
Yes. There's a waterfall inside the airport.

1818
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,219
That's right. There's a waterfall...

1819
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,920
and an overpass.

1820
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,259
Sometimes, I'd choose where to go based on that.

1821
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,489
Like, "I want to check out this airport."

1822
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,559
So, when you travel,

1823
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,260
do you stay inside the airport the whole time?

1824
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,069
I'm sure he also goes sightseeing.

1825
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,730
But he said, "Airport-cation."

1826
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,439
(Only he can come up with these questions.)

1827
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,709
I spent some time...

1828
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,970
at Vancouver International Airport in Canada,

1829
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,479
and I tried lying on the benches...

1830
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,440
to find out which one was more comfortable.

1831
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,249
- I would... - You're very unusual.

1832
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,919
Anyway,

1833
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,879
- there are such enthusiasts. - That's true.

1834
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,019
- In certain areas. - Yes.

1835
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,960
So Hyun's eyes are shaking as she listens to him.

1836
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,059
She's like, "What should I do with him?"

1837
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,829
Would you call yourself an enthusiast?

1838
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:42,359
I also like airports...

1839
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,169
because all my friends have worked at airports.

1840
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,199
And there's a saying that everyone who's worked...

1841
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,539
- at airports always come back. - Really?

1842
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,439
But I've never seen anyone go so far...

1843
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,740
as to sleep at airports.

1844
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,710
There must be a lot of funny incidents at airports.

1845
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,949
Yes, there are a lot.

1846
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,779
Is there a particularly funny one?

1847
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,019
(Laughing)

1848
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,220
A funny one?

1849
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,949
- You don't have to force yourself. - Quit flustering her.

1850
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,919
- You don't have to force yourself. - I mean...

1851
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,419
- I was just... - You didn't have to do that.

1852
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,329
Detective Yoo, you can stop interrogating her.

1853
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,429
She doesn't have to force it.

1854
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,559
Funny stories...

1855
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,799
We can move on to the next question if she doesn't have any.

1856
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,899
The person who asks...

1857
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,099
doesn't have a problem with it, but asking for a funny story...

1858
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,470
is the toughest request there is.

1859
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:26,339
But she spent a lot of time at airports.

1860
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,879
Even if she does have some,

1861
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,539
you can't come up with it on the spot.

1862
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,949
I have a question, though. Can I ask it?

1863
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,079
- Of course. - Yes, the curious one.

1864
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,619
- I have some questions. - Okay.

1865
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,689
Say your flight leaves soon.

1866
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,659
It's past the boarding time,

1867
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,119
- and they're calling my name. - Right.

1868
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,029
But there's a place where they search your body,

1869
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,899
- and there are so many people. - There usually are.

1870
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,729
- The line won't get any shorter. - Okay.

1871
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,329
And they're calling my name past security.

1872
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,629
From where the duty-free shops are.

1873
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,769
What must I do then? Is there a solution?

1874
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,870
Is getting there early the only way?

1875
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,770
That's always a dilemma for us.

1876
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,839
Other than asking them...

1877
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,079
to arrive and enter as early as possible...

1878
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,309
- There's no other way. - Yes.

1879
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,719
We normally send them text messages the day before...

1880
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,520
notifying them to arrive early.

1881
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,789
- As early as possible. - You didn't get the message?

1882
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,959
- That's not what I mean. - The day before?

1883
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,960
- I'm sorry. - Yes.

1884
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:16,959
We ask them to get to the airport early...

1885
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,629
- as it can get crowded. - They're expecting...

1886
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,429
- lots of travelers at the airport. - Yes.

1887
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:22,999
I always get there three hours before.

1888
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,169
- That's early. - You get there early.

1889
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,499
I get there and grab something to eat...

1890
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,799
or look around the shops.

1891
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,299
Are they even open if you get there three hours early?

1892
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,239
Doesn't the check-in counter...

1893
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,410
open two hours before the flight?

1894
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,679
- Or is it two and a half hours? - They usually open...

1895
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,709
- three hours before the flight. - Three hours? I see.

1896
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:36,810
(Realizing)

1897
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,050
That was very stern.

1898
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,049
She's realizing why you're late at the airport.

1899
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,390
Do you have any occupational habits?

1900
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:47,489
- I have one. - What is it?

1901
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,589
I've worked as a flight attendant, right?

1902
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,529
So, when I get on a flight as a passenger,

1903
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,329
- I normally sit in the back. - Okay.

1904
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:57,230
And when I get off, I close the overhead bins...

1905
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:59,430
- You close them. - on my way out.

1906
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,469
- But... - Don't you mean you open them?

1907
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:02,570
- Really? - You open them.

1908
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,609
Oh, right. I open them on my way out.

1909
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,910
Oh, you open them.

1910
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,739
- To see if anyone left their bags. - Yes.

1911
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,779
- She's so accurate. - She's a great superior.

1912
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,079
- She is. - She's very professional.

1913
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,709
- She can be pretty strict. - Yes.

1914
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,450
- "You open them." - "You open them."

1915
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,349
So Hyun, do you have any occupational habits?

1916
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:22,589
It bothers me when I see suitcases with baggage tags on them.

1917
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,929
- Why is that? - You need to take them off...

1918
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,959
for your suitcase to arrive at the place you want it to.

1919
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,229
I heard about that.

1920
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,469
Some people keep them on like decorations.

1921
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,169
Right. To show others that they've been to different places.

1922
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,439
But as she said, when you have too many tags,

1923
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,039
- an error may occur. - That's right.

1924
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,109
- You're supposed to take them off. - Right.

1925
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,179
You really should.

1926
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,110
Is this "Whatever Ask?"

1927
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,709
("Whatever Ask" has been running since 1983 to now.)

1928
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,180
"Whatever Ask" is such an old show.

1929
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,320
(You can guess his age from it.)

1930
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:56,090
Anyway, what made you apply for our show?

1931
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,729
I've known my superior for only a month,

1932
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,229
so I applied so that I could get to know her better.

1933
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,099
Are you still awkward?

1934
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,199
Yes. I come to work at 1pm,

1935
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,670
- but she works from 9 to 6. - I see.

1936
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,440
Although I'm next to her at work,

1937
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:14,310
but we can't exactly have lunch together.

1938
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,080
Why would you want to have lunch with your superior?

1939
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,550
- To get to know her. - Get to know her?

1940
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,380
You can come to work an hour early, then.

1941
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,620
An hour early?

1942
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,759
(The incisive question brings silence.)

1943
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,189
Come on.

1944
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,059
- That's not fair. - That was brutal.

1945
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,559
- It was the brutal truth. - That would make it weird!

1946
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,500
- But he wanted to... - That would look so weird.

1947
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,999
(I just want to get to know her better.)

1948
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,199
Anyway, we'll...

1949
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,239
- Hyun Woo, you can go. - Hyun Woo.

1950
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,009
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1951
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,469
- Before this... - Good luck.

1952
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,540
- It's like a bottle flip. - Let's go.

1953
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,880
Show us.

1954
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,979
- Here it comes! - Where is it?

1955
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,580
(The numbers are from 0 to 2.)

1956
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,749
- Oh, no. - Where is it?

1957
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,520
(They failed to win bonus coupons.)

1958
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,959
(Exclaiming)

1959
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,259
- Too bad. - Yes.

1960
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,660
- We can still make it. - Geon Yeong.

1961
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,360
- Pick one from here. - Okay.

1962
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,069
"I take the public transportation for four hours every day."

1963
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,529
"I want to use it without pressure."

1964
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,399
"Two T-money cards, a total of 400 dollars."

1965
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,700
(Transportation cards, a total of 400 dollars)

1966
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,639
- My goodness. - Four hundred dollars?

1967
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,870
He comes to work from Yongin.

1968
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,339
- You come from Yongin? - Yes, I do.

1969
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,009
Then the transportation fees must be a lot.

1970
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,810
Yes. It costs about 200 dollars a month.

1971
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,419
- Then you can use this for a month. - Right.

1972
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,420
(This is enough to use for a month.)
So Hyun, from where do you come to work?

1973
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:30,679
I come from Yeongjong Island.

1974
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,089
- Around the Incheon Airport. - From Yeongjong Island?

1975
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,489
- That's so far from here. - They live really far from here.

1976
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:37,660
But we can give them this only if we succeed in Round One.

1977
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,059
(This mission is to win the transportation cards.)

1978
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,429
So what's the mission for today?

1979
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,859
(Suitcase Curling)

1980
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,669
(Push the suitcase...)

1981
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:47,099
(and put it in the square.)

1982
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,100
(Round 1)

1983
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:50,470
(Put in 1 suitcase.)

1984
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,170
- See? It's curling. - It's curling.

1985
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:53,940
- We need to push the suitcase. - Suitcase curling.

1986
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,780
- I heard that you're bad at these. - We push it and...

1987
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,249
I'm so bad at doing things with my hands and feet.

1988
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,750
Gosh, this is quite difficult.

1989
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,049
- It's suitcase curling. - I knew it.

1990
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,050
With a suitcase?

1991
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,350
- In that square over there. - It sounds fun, though.

1992
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,290
It will be fun.

1993
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,160
This is brilliant.

1994
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,519
It looks so fun.

1995
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,460
- I think we'll be able to do this. - It looks so fun.

1996
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,890
- My goodness. - It will be fun.

1997
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,360
If we had picked the coupons, you could've joined us.

1998
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,969
I would love to join you.

1999
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,399
(But they can only cheer for them.)

2000
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,430
It looks so fun.

2001
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,839
Do we have to go right away?

2002
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,970
- No. - Okay.

2003
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,579
Maybe it's harder than it seems.

2004
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,809
- It's going well. - It might be too slippery.

2005
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,880
- Goodness. - I think they can do this.

2006
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,380
Gosh, it's out.

2007
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,910
- All 4 wheels must be in it. - All 4 wheels?

2008
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,980
- Is that so? - It won't go straight.

2009
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,350
Right.

2010
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,960
(Hyun Woo practices too.)

2011
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,089
- That's... Gosh. - My goodness.

2012
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,389
- That goes... - It's difficult.

2013
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,629
- Gosh, this isn't easy. - It's hard.

2014
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,659
It spins.

2015
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,230
- It's not easy. Try it. - Try it, Ha Neul.

2016
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,730
What if I spin it from the beginning?

2017
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,770
What if I spin it from the beginning?

2018
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,900
Ha Neul.

2019
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,299
(Curious Ma Neul)

2020
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,339
Yeon Shik's turn.

2021
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,080
You need to align the wheels first.

2022
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,580
After that...

2023
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,410
Push it smoothly.

2024
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:05,649
- You got it. You got this. - That was good.

2025
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:06,650
(It looks good.)

2026
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:07,879
- You got this. I worked. - That was good.

2027
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,920
You got it.

2028
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,649
- You got it. - Goodness.

2029
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:12,690
(It's in!)

2030
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:15,060
(Even though it was a practice, he succeeded.)

2031
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,659
(As expected from the genius of the upper body)

2032
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,789
- That was good. - Nice.

2033
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,190
Yeon Seok, you're on a roll today.

2034
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:21,629
He's really clumsy,

2035
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,999
- but his hand skills are... - I'm actually quite good at...

2036
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,369
doing things with my hands.

2037
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,370
- Even though he's clumsy. - Gosh.

2038
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:27,599
- So I should align the wheels. - Goodness.

2039
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,600
It was nice.

2040
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:29,969
I succeeded right away in the practice round.

2041
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,270
I got the hang of it.

2042
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,769
- Round One is... - It spins.

2043
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:33,870
Was that a practice?

2044
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,439
It was a practice.

2045
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,709
- Didn't you do it? - I didn't say I was going.

2046
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,180
- I thought we did it. - It was a practice.

2047
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,480
It works easily when we practice.

2048
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:42,950
I thought we succeeded.

2049
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,150
- Should I try it? - It's hard. Hold on.

2050
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:47,019
You'll push it from the side?

2051
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,219
- What if I do it like this? - Push the wider side?

2052
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,460
- What? The wider side? - Goodness.

2053
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,560
- What? The wider side? - Goodness.

2054
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,190
- Gosh. This could be safer. - Goodness.

2055
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,659
- We got this. - He did it.

2056
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,159
(We got this.)

2057
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,570
- We got this. - It always works when we practice.

2058
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,799
- Goodness. - Okay.

2059
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,669
When we practice, it seems we'll pass three rounds right away.

2060
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:02,470
I should change my name to Practice Yoo.

2061
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,109
All right. Let's go for it.

2062
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,110
Pushing the wider side.

2063
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:07,369
- Let's cheer up for once. - All right.

2064
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,779
- In 1, 2, 3. - I'll make sure you win it.

2065
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,780
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2066
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,079
- This is the first round. - Okay.

2067
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,710
- All right. - Who will go first?

2068
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:14,950
- Should I go first? - Okay.

2069
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:16,150
Since it seems like I'm the worst one here?

2070
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,719
It seems like I'm the worst one, so I'll go first.

2071
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,290
(First one to go is Ha Neul.)

2072
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:23,860
It makes me nervous.

2073
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,629
- The wider side. - Okay.

2074
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,160
(Just like Jae Suk did, he'll push the wider side.)

2075
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,429
My gosh. He did it.

2076
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:33,030
(My gosh. He did it.)

2077
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,669
It seemed like it would get past it.

2078
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,840
(It's out because it was too strong.)

2079
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,539
It was a bit strong.

2080
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,109
- Let's leave it here. - Should I leave it here?

2081
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:42,309
- It's Hyun Woo's turn. - I see.

2082
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,639
- It can hit that suitcase. - Can we hit that?

2083
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,909
- We can hit that. - It can go in after hitting it.

2084
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,610
- So it's curling. - Because it's curling?

2085
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,650
- Then... - I see.

2086
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:48,919
It's better to be weak...

2087
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,079
- than being too strong. - Right.

2088
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,249
- We can push it from the back. - That's good to hear.

2089
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,389
Because we can push it.

2090
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,450
(Second shooter is Hyun Woo.)

2091
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,460
- Yeong Mi. - Yeong Mi!

2092
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,230
My goodness.

2093
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,189
(He jokes whenever possible.)

2094
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,760
- Hyun Woo. - The players did that.

2095
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,799
- It's been a while. - Yes, it's been a while.

2096
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,099
- Hyun Woo, go. - You'll sweep it?

2097
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,700
Go. I'll sweep it for you.

2098
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:07,900
Don't you have a broom?

2099
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,270
Do you have a mop here?

2100
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:12,170
(2nd shooter, Hyun Woo)

2101
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:15,940
- Gosh. - My goodness. Hyun Woo.

2102
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,250
Hyun Woo. The direction is too...

2103
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,909
(Disappointed)

2104
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,420
So it shouldn't be like this.

2105
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
Right.

2106
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:25,690
But I have a good feeling about this today.

2107
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,919
- Right? - Jae Suk. Do as you practiced.

2108
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,260
- You did it when you practiced. - Okay. All right.

2109
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,690
This good feeling. I got the hang of it.

2110
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,969
He's amazing when he practices.

2111
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,199
This is so upsetting.

2112
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,269
(This is so upsetting, seriously.)

2113
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,439
- But I did it before. - Right.

2114
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,569
- You can do it. - Okay.

2115
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,979
- I'll align the wheels and... - Make a nice shot. Okay.

2116
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,410
(He invented the wheel alignment method.)

2117
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,650
(He will push it straight smoothly like he did earlier.)

2118
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,579
Just like I did earlier.

2119
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,320
I pushed it smoothly like this.

2120
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:00,290
(Laughing)

2121
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,460
Everything okay?

2122
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,530
Did you think that was annoying?

2123
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,090
It was because I got nervous too.

2124
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,360
You're nervous, right?

2125
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,530
This makes me nervous.

2126
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,899
Because the transportation cards are at stake.

2127
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,830
- It's 400 dollars. - It's a total of 400 dollars.

2128
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,270
Here I go.

2129
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,540
(Clasping their hands)

2130
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,240
(Flapping)

2131
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,580
This is... Gosh. That's...

2132
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,680
(It's off the course.)

2133
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,080
I have to say, Yeon Shik. This looked so annoying.

2134
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:34,520
I wasn't sure about how I could move my feet.

2135
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,859
What if I do it this way?

2136
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,119
- Standing like this. - I think that's a good idea.

2137
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,930
- I'll push it while standing. - Just like this.

2138
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,160
Right.

2139
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:41,600
(A new strategy after the "wide side shot")

2140
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,260
Gosh. This won't be stable.

2141
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,300
I'll try pushing it casually.

2142
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,740
(He pushes it in a chill manner.)

2143
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,539
- That was good. - It's...

2144
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,810
(They're coming up with all kinds of strategies.)

2145
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,679
- The No Look shot. Right. - Without looking at it?

2146
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,680
The No Look shot.

2147
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,050
- What? - In a casually manner.

2148
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,550
- That's crazy. - We got this.

2149
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:06,220
- That's crazy. - It's almost in.

2150
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,420
We did it.

2151
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,459
- We succeed if we push it. - We can just push it.

2152
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,129
- As if we're pushing it. - If so...

2153
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,390
(It will be a success with a light push.)

2154
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,560
How could you miss that?

2155
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:18,569
How could you miss that?

2156
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,769
(It's beyond our imaginations.)

2157
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,899
Goodness. We got it.

2158
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,969
- We can put it in by pushing it. - Then...

2159
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,169
- If we want to push it, - Push it, Ha Neul.

2160
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,370
It should be stronger than we think.

2161
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:25,769
- Stronger than I think? - Yes.

2162
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,270
- It should be strong. - That suitcase can be quite heavy.

2163
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,580
I won't get pushed easily.

2164
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:30,540
You did it.

2165
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,349
- He did it. - Goodness.

2166
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,450
I see. Okay.

2167
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:34,550
- We got this. - Okay.

2168
01:13:34,551 --> 01:13:36,049
- It's better to push it harder. - Okay.

2169
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,179
- When we push it... - This is how we do it.

2170
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,189
- The one behind will go in. - That's right.

2171
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,289
- We should try to... - Okay.

2172
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,389
- gather them together. - All right.

2173
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,889
- Let's try it this time. - We'll go for it.

2174
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:44,019
- Let's do it. - In 1, 2, 3.

2175
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,130
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2176
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,890
I'll go first.

2177
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,559
Because we don't have a bonus coupon,

2178
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,700
- Right. - we must do it.

2179
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,339
(It makes a sharp curve again.)

2180
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,210
- Goodness. - Why would it go that way?

2181
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,310
- That's hard to push in. - Gosh.

2182
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,340
Why would it go that way?

2183
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,379
- I'll go next. - Ha Neul's turn. Ma Neul's turn.

2184
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,749
You can think that it won't go far right when you do it.

2185
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,750
(It somehow became a barrier on the right side.)

2186
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,720
(Ha Neul gets ready carefully.)

2187
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:17,420
- Hey. My goodness. - It went past it.

2188
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,190
(He gets angry in 3 steps.)

2189
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,899
It went past it.

2190
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,299
- Gosh. Let me try it. - Okay.

2191
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,729
My goodness.

2192
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:28,200
I'll make a weak shot.

2193
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,070
- So I can push it later? - So you can push it.

2194
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:32,410
- To push it later. - A weak shot.

2195
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,309
A weak shot.

2196
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,740
(Today's ace members feel pressure again.)

2197
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,650
(Will there be another miracle?)

2198
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:45,549
- It's okay. - Hold on.

2199
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,989
- Hey. Hold on. - Come over here.

2200
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,119
- Come this way. - Here.

2201
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,289
- Come. - Hold on.

2202
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,959
- This is... - Make a strong shot there.

2203
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,989
- Hyun Woo. Push it hard. - Hold on.

2204
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,529
Try to hit it from this side.

2205
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,470
- That's right. There. - From this side.

2206
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,369
If it's too strong, it might spin.

2207
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,570
- That's right. - Hold on.

2208
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,440
I think it will spin this way.

2209
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:06,370
- Hold on. - Just make it go straight.

2210
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,079
(We need the gambling master's skills at this moment.)

2211
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,780
- It doesn't have to be too strong. - Right.

2212
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,580
- It doesn't have to be too strong. - Right.

2213
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,450
- Good. - We got it.

2214
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,450
We got it.

2215
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,790
- Good. - We got it.

2216
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,719
- We got it. It's in. - He did it. It's in.

2217
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,730
He did it.

2218
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,630
- My goodness. - I did it!

2219
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,499
- We got it. It's in. - He did it. It's in.

2220
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,330
(It's in.)

2221
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,999
I did it!

2222
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,040
- We did it! - We did it!

2223
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,639
(It's a festival full of dopamine.)

2224
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,109
We did it!

2225
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,839
(They're so happy.)

2226
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,709
- It was a perfect strategy. - That was amazing.

2227
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,749
(In a way, it was a result of their teamwork.)

2228
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,880
- It was amazing. - My gosh.

2229
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,980
- Round One, success! - All right. Success.

2230
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:52,690
(The suitcases on the right did their job.)

2231
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:54,759
- That was amazing. - We've done it with our teamwork.

2232
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,889
- My goodness. - We did it.

2233
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:57,890
That's so amazing.

2234
01:15:57,891 --> 01:15:59,929
We did it with our teamwork. It's amazing, right?

2235
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,199
- Yes. - Jae Suk, you putting it there...

2236
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,430
- wasn't a bad idea. - My goodness.

2237
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,799
- That was... - It was a strategic move.

2238
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,269
- I know. - It blocked the suitcase.

2239
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,470
So you've won the transportation cards.

2240
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,039
You should choose to go or stop.

2241
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,409
We have many tries left.

2242
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:13,470
We have eight tries left.

2243
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,410
Now, you should choose to go or stop. In 1, 2, 3.

2244
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,910
- Go. - Okay.

2245
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,550
- All right. - Hyun Woo is the ace today.

2246
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,279
- Gosh. You're amazing. - What did you pick?

2247
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,749
"The introverts are going home after work."

2248
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,349
"We need noise canceling."

2249
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:26,689
"Two Sony headsets."

2250
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:28,259
(High-end headsets)

2251
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,489
- They're bringing them in. - That is...

2252
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,529
(Their mouths have dropped open.)

2253
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,630
They got two colors.

2254
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,089
- But you know, - We need to succeed.

2255
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,159
We're doing really great today.

2256
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,160
- Right, we really are today. - Yes.

2257
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:38,499
- We're doing great today. - I feel good.

2258
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,770
Do we need to put in two suitcases this time?

2259
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:40,870
Today...

2260
01:16:40,871 --> 01:16:41,969
(Round 2)

2261
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:44,400
(Put in 2 suitcases.)

2262
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,309
(This time, 2 people must succeed.)

2263
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,369
But if this is how it goes...

2264
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,539
- I think we can do it. - We can do this.

2265
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,710
If we can work as a team like this, I think it's possible.

2266
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,380
Gosh, it's going to the right again.

2267
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,680
But it's the same situation as before.

2268
01:16:58,290 --> 01:16:59,819
Then we can feel a bit comfortable about sending it to the right.

2269
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,289
- You'll feel comfortable. - It makes you feel that way.

2270
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:02,520
It lessened the pressure of sending it to the right.

2271
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,990
(Ha Neul practices next.)

2272
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,030
Will it bounce back?

2273
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,499
(It hits the suitcase on the right.)

2274
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,300
I'll try pushing it from here then.

2275
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,929
- My goodness. - Why does it go that way?

2276
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,069
(All the suitcases go to the right side.)

2277
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:17,070
- Why do they all turn right? - I...

2278
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,210
Is the floor not even here?

2279
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,580
Gosh. I think that's the case. As I see the floor over there...

2280
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:24,240
- Is it slanted to the right? - The floor is slanted.

2281
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,050
They say the floor is slanted.

2282
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,450
Should I try pushing it to the left side?

2283
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,320
See? Look at that.

2284
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,860
- How did you do it? - I see.

2285
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:37,589
- How did you do it? - Jae Suk.

2286
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:38,960
I think the floor is slanted a little.

2287
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,729
- So if you push it to the left... - The floor is...

2288
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:41,799
- Is that so? - Yes.

2289
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,459
- Hold on. - What about...

2290
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,099
- Try it. - Okay.

2291
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,700
You make it go in a curve.

2292
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,900
- Right. - You aim it in the wrong direction?

2293
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:50,799
- It stopped right there. - That's right.

2294
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,940
- Right. - They'll make it this time.

2295
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:54,340
- That's a good strategy. - You understood, right?

2296
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,639
- Let's do this. - All right.

2297
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,879
- From here. - It's our third try.

2298
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,909
- From here to there. - It's the second round,

2299
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,910
and it's our third try.

2300
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,110
- In 1, 2, 3, here we go. - Here we go.

2301
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,479
- I'll go first. - Okay, Yeon Shik.

2302
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,920
Just like I did earlier.

2303
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,720
- I'll turn a little. - Yes.

2304
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,420
It can make a curve, so...

2305
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,660
(Yeon Seok, the first shooter, shoots the suitcase carefully.)

2306
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,829
- Goodness. - That looks good.

2307
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,370
(Did their strategy to aim at the wrong direction work?)

2308
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,870
That's so fast.

2309
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,970
(It got out at the last moment.)

2310
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:25,110
(Exclaiming)

2311
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:26,670
- I had a good feeling this time. - It was so close.

2312
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,209
- I thought we would make it. - That was so close.

2313
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,409
It wasn't bad this time.

2314
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,579
Now we have Yeon Shik on the right.

2315
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,179
- Don't worry about the right side. - Okay.

2316
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,519
I won't try to put it in there.

2317
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,620
I'll send it that way.

2318
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:40,290
(Ha Neul's target trajectory)

2319
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,059
That way.

2320
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,060
(The second shooter, Ha Neul)

2321
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,460
Gosh. It got in.

2322
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,160
- I think he pushed it too hard. - It's so fast.

2323
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,830
- He pushed it so hard. - Gosh. I pushed it too hard.

2324
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,730
Gosh. I pushed it too hard.

2325
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,669
- I almost got it in. - It was so close.

2326
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,870
- It was the right direction. - I know.

2327
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,999
I think it can block the suitcases from behind.

2328
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,799
(There are 2 remaining suitcases.)

2329
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,569
(They should put both suitcases in.)

2330
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:00,709
We're doing well.

2331
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:01,879
(There are 2 remaining suitcases. They should put both suitcases in.)

2332
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,010
We must get both of them in now.

2333
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,510
- I should start over here. - Right.

2334
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,580
(He'll misdirect it to the left.)

2335
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,749
It will make a curve right there.

2336
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,890
(I'm sure it'll turn right.)

2337
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,550
(Vroom)

2338
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,820
- What is that? - Gosh.

2339
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,490
Great.

2340
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,460
Great.

2341
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,359
It got in.

2342
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,959
(The suitcase makes a curve as expected.)

2343
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,600
It got in.

2344
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,600
This is going well.

2345
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,639
We made it.

2346
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,709
- We did it. - We made it.

2347
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,709
- We did it. - It got in.

2348
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,879
- We did it. - We made it.

2349
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,239
It got out.

2350
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,480
- It got out. - No, it didn't.

2351
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,849
(The position of a wheel is a little uncertain.)

2352
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:39,950
- We did it. - We made it.

2353
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,250
- We did it, right? - It got in.

2354
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,379
- It got in. - Hold on.

2355
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,249
- It got in. - What's wrong?

2356
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,489
- This is... - It's on the line.

2357
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,049
- It got in since it's on the line. - It got in.

2358
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,289
- It's in. It's on the line. - You have to admit it.

2359
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:49,389
- It's on the line. - That means it got in, right?

2360
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,529
- It's in when it's on the line. - It contacted this side.

2361
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,929
- Right. We agree. - They agreed.

2362
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,130
- They agreed. - Okay.

2363
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,469
In tennis, the ball is in if it touches the line.

2364
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:59,470
(If Jae Suk gets his suitcase in, it's a success.)

2365
01:19:59,471 --> 01:20:00,669
- Let's see. - All right, then.

2366
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:03,240
- What if he hits it? - What if it hits the suitcase?

2367
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:06,170
- No way. - It's already on the Marginot line.

2368
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,540
- No way. - You shouldn't hit it.

2369
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,939
(Just thinking about it scares them.)

2370
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,040
Wait. Like this?

2371
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:14,450
(It's the critical moment, and it's Jae Suk's turn.)

2372
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:19,390
(He must put in his suitcase without pushing out the one inside.)

2373
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:23,959
(They got their chance to win. What will happen to Practice Yoo?)

2374
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,230
Please, Jae Suk.

2375
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,360
- All right. - It looks good.

2376
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,300
- It looks good. - I think you got this.

2377
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,770
Gosh. It's going to hit that one.

2378
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,409
- All right. - It looks good.

2379
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:40,670
- I think you got this. - It's going to hit that one.

2380
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,379
Goodness.

2381
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,409
It's going to hit that one.

2382
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,410
(It pushed out the one inside so perfectly.)

2383
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:49,080
(Jae Suk made a big mistake.)

2384
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,980
- That was amazing. - This time...

2385
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:54,119
(Speechless)

2386
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,960
It's so amazing how he pushed that one out.

2387
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,130
- My goodness. - That's amazing.

2388
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:02,500
- It's really curling. - Right.

2389
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,399
- My goodness. - I don't think I can do that...

2390
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,599
even if I wanted to.

2391
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,769
- That was so close. - Goodness.

2392
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,669
- I think we can do it this time. - Jae Suk.

2393
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,769
- All right. - I think we can do it this time.

2394
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,009
Let's try it again right away.

2395
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,769
- Push it casually. - You're doing great, Hyun Woo.

2396
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:14,909
- Ha Neul. - I'll put it in right away.

2397
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,040
- All right. - This is our fourth try.

2398
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,310
Let's do it like how we just did it before.

2399
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:18,909
- Today, it's... - Push it smoothly.

2400
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:20,750
I'll push it smoothly like this.

2401
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,079
- Smoothly push it from here. - As if you're practicing.

2402
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,850
- From here, like I'm practicing. - Ma Neul, you can do this.

2403
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,090
Smoothly.

2404
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,950
- It's similar to the previous try. - That looks okay.

2405
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,190
What? Goodness.

2406
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,189
(It stops in front of the line.)

2407
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,789
- Goodness. - You can push that in.

2408
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:34,259
- You can push that in. - Okay.

2409
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,560
Okay. It's Hyun Woo's turn.

2410
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,100
Hyun Woo. You're doing great today.

2411
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,000
If he could hit it and put two suitcases in at once...

2412
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,570
- If I hit the corner of it... - Do it stronger than it seems.

2413
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,940
- Stronger than it seems? - Right.

2414
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,610
Goodness.

2415
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,650
Gosh. That's good.

2416
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,880
Gosh. That's good.

2417
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:55,480
- We got one. - Goodness.

2418
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,980
- He did it. - My gosh.

2419
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,389
(Exclaiming)

2420
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,690
- He got it. - We got this.

2421
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,489
- My goodness. - We got this now.

2422
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,990
- Hyun Woo, you're the master today. - Gosh. He's the master.

2423
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,789
(They win if they put one more suitcase in the square.)

2424
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:08,860
But you're next?

2425
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,899
- Or should I go first? - We can do this.

2426
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,230
- Okay. You go first. - You just...

2427
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,239
Okay.

2428
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,369
- It'd be okay if you could push it. - I feel...

2429
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,969
- Don't need to feel pressure. - Hold on.

2430
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:19,969
- He's right. - This looks okay.

2431
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,110
- It looks okay. - Yes.

2432
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,279
It will block it if this hits it.

2433
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
- That's right. - Yes.

2434
01:22:24,281 --> 01:22:25,679
- From here... - We can say...

2435
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,050
- it's a success no matter what. - Goodness.

2436
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,649
- From here... - It will be in no matter what.

2437
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,050
It's hard to fail this time.

2438
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,920
- He puts pressure on him. - You should go first, then.

2439
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:37,860
(What?)

2440
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,830
You should do it first.

2441
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,130
Yeon Seok.

2442
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,599
It's hard to fail this time.

2443
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,230
- My gosh. - All right.

2444
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,969
- I'll do it then. - Okay.

2445
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,569
- Goodness, that punk. - Show us.

2446
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,640
You can never fail this one.

2447
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,010
But he might do that, which is so hard to do.

2448
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,340
I shouldn't have said that earlier.

2449
01:22:58,810 --> 01:22:59,950
This is better, right?

2450
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,380
Go to the left a little bit.

2451
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,379
- I'll move a little bit. - Right.

2452
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,520
- This is good. - Okay.

2453
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:06,920
He feels nervous again.

2454
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,719
This is better.

2455
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,359
(They succeed if they can put one more suitcase in the square.)

2456
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,460
Here I go.

2457
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,830
- That looks good. - Did he get it?

2458
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,830
(It's a miss.)

2459
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:22,500
And he did it. He did what was so hard to do.

2460
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,109
I should've moved to the left a bit more.

2461
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:27,210
But seriously, you can never fail this time.

2462
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,709
The right side is blocked.

2463
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,179
You don't need to worry about the right side.

2464
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,649
You don't have to worry about the suitcase going to the right.

2465
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,810
This is... Right?

2466
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:37,350
Yeon Shik. You don't need to worry about the right side.

2467
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,690
You're so cheeky.

2468
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,759
Right. I don't need to feel pressure.

2469
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,059
- Yes. No pressure. - Push it smoothly.

2470
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,230
- Yes. - Right.

2471
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,630
It will go in after hitting them.

2472
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,629
- Just like how I did before. - Yes.

2473
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,859
I succeeded in my first try right away.

2474
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:51,930
- I know. - Smoothly like this.

2475
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,470
(Yeon Seok has the golden opportunity to win.)

2476
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,169
- I don't need to feel pressure. - Yes. No pressure.

2477
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,239
- Push it smoothly. - Yes.

2478
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,310
Right.

2479
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,840
- We got this. - Good.

2480
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,209
- We got this. - Good.

2481
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,750
- We got this. - We got it this time.

2482
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,250
- We got this. - Good.

2483
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,790
- We got this. - We got this.

2484
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,350
We got it. We got it this time.

2485
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,159
- We got this. - Good.

2486
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,020
- We got it this time. - We got it.

2487
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:20,160
- It will block it. We did it! - All right!

2488
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,860
- We got it. - We got it. It will block it.

2489
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:23,429
(It's in after hitting the barrier.)

2490
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,559
(These two suitcases are in.)

2491
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,600
We did it.

2492
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,830
(Spurting)

2493
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,570
We did it.

2494
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,070
- We did it! - All right!

2495
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,140
- We did it! - Goodness.

2496
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,340
- Good. - My gosh.

2497
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,539
We did it.

2498
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,949
(They succeeded with perfect teamwork.)

2499
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,210
All right. It was Round Two.

2500
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,649
(As expected, Yeon Seok made the winning shot.)

2501
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,750
- Okay. - Goodness.

2502
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,990
This was...

2503
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:51,090
So we won the second round and got the headsets.

2504
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,430
- It's a success. - Success.

2505
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:55,429
How many tries do we have left now?

2506
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:56,699
We have six more chances left.

2507
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,930
- We got 6 more tries? - We got 6 tries left.

2508
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:00,829
- But... - If they tell us to put in...

2509
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:02,570
three suitcases for the third round...

2510
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,599
Or it could be this.

2511
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,209
- The box might get smaller. - It might get smaller.

2512
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:07,539
(It could be putting in 3 suitcases or a smaller box.)

2513
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,380
So you two should...

2514
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,740
- Think about it. - You should discuss it.

2515
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,080
- Shall we go? - Go?

2516
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,850
- What? - Or stop here?

2517
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,919
- Okay. Did you decide? - Yes.

2518
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,490
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2519
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,020
Stop.

2520
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,360
- That's a good choice. - Goodness.

2521
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,359
But that's a good decision.

2522
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,030
I think that's a good decision.

2523
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,729
It will be harder.

2524
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:35,970
- Right. - Why did you choose to stop here?

2525
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,570
We discussed it, and we decided to stop here.

2526
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:41,810
But it was So Hyun's call, right?

2527
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:43,679
- Yes, it was. - My gosh.

2528
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,250
- No, it wasn't. - All right.

2529
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,819
Stopping here was a bit unexpected.

2530
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,820
(It was an unexpected choice.)

2531
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:50,880
- Right. - But it's good.

2532
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,820
We were doing great.

2533
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:54,649
We were on a roll. By the way,

2534
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,490
- Hyun Woo was amazing. - Right.

2535
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,160
Hyun Woo was so good. Gosh.

2536
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,859
Nice one.

2537
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:03,359
I first found out today that I had a talent for games.

2538
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,099
- He was a sharper. - Amazing. He was a sharper.

2539
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,869
I thought of wanting to apply to Whenever Possible myself...

2540
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,599
to be able to win presents.

2541
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,669
- Send in your letter. - Right.

2542
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:13,809
(Anyone can apply.)

2543
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:15,479
- Gosh. - Good one.

2544
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,579
It will be revealed...

2545
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,679
- on the streaming site this week. - Right.

2546
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,849
- It's "Wall to Wall." - Right. "Wall to Wall."

2547
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,449
Please make sure to check it out.

2548
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:22,749
Congratulations once again!

2549
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,719
- Congratulations, Geon Yeong! - Thank you.

2550
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,120
- Congrats, Geon Yeong and So Hyun! - Congratulations!

2551
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,190
(All right. Let's do this!)

2552
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,730
(The process of endless attempts and spirit of never giving up)

2553
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,400
(The Whenever Possible ace makes another "Try.")

2554
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,660
(Coach Yoon Kye Sang)

2555
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,460
(What is our problem, Coach?)

2556
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:40,430
(We have to set the right aim first.)

2557
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,830
(How are the skills of the coach?)

2558
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,099
(He cleanly shows off his skills.)

2559
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,100
(This is the ace and the captain!)

2560
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:46,410
(Ace Kim Yo Han)

2561
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:48,539
(Stable play from the ace)

2562
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,710
(You're doing great.)

2563
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,210
(This is my student.)

2564
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,610
(Darn it.)

2565
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:55,549
(I just tried doing that.)

2566
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,480
- I just tried doing that. - What are you doing?

2567
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,350
(I love you, g.o.d.)

2568
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,090
(Is this another side of the coach?)

2569
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,360
(Coach mode off)

2570
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:05,389
(Concentration off)

2571
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,590
(Coach!)

2572
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,430
(Patience off)

2573
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500
(What about Yo Han?)

2574
01:27:10,501 --> 01:27:12,399
(He keeps turning red because you put him on the spot.)

2575
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,500
(Shyness on)

2576
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,770
(Three!)

2577
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,240
(That's it.)

2578
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:18,400
(It's over!)

2579
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:19,570
(You guys are really...)

2580
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:22,339
(Quarreling on)

2581
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,740
(Spare time with the four men with certain on and off moments)

2582
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:27,950
(Whenever Possible)
