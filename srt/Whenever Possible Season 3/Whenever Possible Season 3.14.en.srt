00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:06,787
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:08,617
It's so hot today.

3
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:10,903
Did you finish filming your drama?

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,186
I have to film it until the end of October.

5
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:15,127
My gosh. You guys are filming in the hottest season.

6
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:16,757
They gave us some watermelon today.

7
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,327
Watermelon.

8
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,997
What's your take on seedless watermelons?

9
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,067
What?

10
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:23,788
- Let's say you're at a supermarket.
- Yes.

11
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,707
And there are seedless watermelons...

12
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:27,406
and watermelons with seeds.

13
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:28,927
- Okay.
- But the prices are the same.

14
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:31,977
(Shutting his eyes tightly)

15
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:34,777
Why are you draining my energy this morning?

16
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:37,446
- What do you mean?
- I'm already tired as it is.

17
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:39,223
- Why are you making me more tired?
- I mean...

18
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,716
watermelons with seeds and seedless watermelons...

19
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:42,956
- You're the intuitive type, right?
- My gosh.

20
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,557
- I bet this is what you do.
- Okay.

21
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:46,456
"But still. I must go with the original one."

22
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:47,756
- "I must buy the one with seeds."
- Yes.

23
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,226
- You might do that.
- I'm like that.

24
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:50,626
- Yes.
- That's how I am.

25
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,066
Seeds don't make a big difference.

26
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,396
I don't spit them out anyway. I just chew them.

27
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:55,436
(A manly guy)

28
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:58,007
- I'll probably get the regular one.
- I see.

29
00:00:58,207 --> 00:01:00,036
(While they have a conversation about watermelon seeds...)

30
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:01,737
By the way, I really want to do this.

31
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:03,746
- This show?
- Yes. I mean, succeed.

32
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:04,807
Succeed in the missions?

33
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,146
- I really want to succeed.
- Right. I heard that...

34
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:07,176
they have been performing poorly at schools.

35
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:08,853
They haven't succeeded in any missions at schools.

36
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,746
- Because there's a lot of pressure.
- Yes.

37
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,346
The mission was hard, to begin with.

38
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:14,157
- The ping pong mission.
- It's hard.

39
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,016
So I don't go out.

40
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,226
(They're still talking about watermelons.)

41
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,227
It's a hassle.

42
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:19,227
(The sound of the door opening)

43
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:21,057
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

44
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,427
Hey!

45
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:26,897
(Today's Whenever Friends: Ji Jin Hee and Jee Seok Jin)

46
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,597
Korea must always...

47
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:32,007
have pride.

48
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:35,177
(A veteran actor with 27 years of experience)

49
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:37,146
What a fool.

50
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,776
(The endless shifts in his roles draw in the viewers.)

51
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,847
(Ji Jin Hee, the viewer engager)

52
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:45,547
(And he's accompanied by Jae Suk's laugh generator.)

53
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:48,217
(He is more childish than ever.)

54
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:52,657
(And the kiss jelly made him the shiest of all.)

55
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,256
(He has returned as a younger look with his song, "Milkshake.")

56
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:57,297
(Jee Seok Jin, also known as Seok Sam)

57
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,903
- I didn't know you were joining us.
- Have you been well?

58
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:00,766
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

59
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,443
- They can see the back of my head.
- Ji Jin Hee.

60
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,766
- Take a seat.
- Where?

61
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,236
- Why are you wearing milkshakes?
- You should sit here.

62
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:07,407
- No.
- Come on.

63
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,606
My stylist picked out this shirt for today.

64
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,006
- Please sit down.
- Please sit.

65
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,147
- Should I sit here?
- Yes.

66
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:14,976
- Gosh. We...
- I knew he was coming...

67
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,276
because Seok Jin told me.

68
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:17,746
Did you give him a call?

69
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:18,986
He said, "I'll be there in two days."

70
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:19,987
So I said, "Where?"

71
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,887
He said, "Whenever Possible." I said, "Really?"

72
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:24,886
- "Is it just you?"
- "Just you?"

73
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:26,767
I said, "You're not popular enough to go solo."

74
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,527
(Laughing)

75
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,726
- "It won't be just me, of course."
- Listen.

76
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:33,566
- Hey. You come here.
- "Hey."

77
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,696
- Is this how you're going to start?
- What?

78
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,706
- Seriously. I've been saying...
- What?

79
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,466
I'll teach him a lesson for 25 years, but I haven't yet.

80
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,606
- When I said that...
- So you...

81
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,406
- brought someone from your clan.
- Yes.

82
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,177
- Jin Hee.
- Jin Hee. Yes.

83
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,446
- Actually, Jin Hee and Seok Jin...
- Yes?

84
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:48,716
- Okay.
- formed a club together.

85
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:51,087
- Right. Aren't you guys...
- We're close.

86
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,346
From the same clan...

87
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:53,386
- or something?
- Yes.

88
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,556
- What?
- The Chungju Ji clan.

89
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:55,616
- Yes.
- Right.

90
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:57,486
A long time ago, he told me that he was close to Jin Hee.

91
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,126
Right. We used to hang out a lot back in the day.

92
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,626
But both of us have been busy these days.

93
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,326
I agreed to be on the show right away...

94
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:04,726
when I heard I'd do it with Seok Jin.

95
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,766
- Really?
- Of course.

96
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:07,866
- Didn't the staff invite you first?
- No.

97
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,167
He was invited first.

98
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:10,406
- There's no way...
- He was probably invited first.

99
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,736
- He was probably invited first.
- There's no way...

100
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,876
When I heard I'd do it with him, I said yes.

101
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:15,936
I'm grateful to him.

102
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,406
Not a lot of celebrities have the same last name.

103
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,407
- Right?
- Yes.

104
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,646
- The Chungju Ji clan.
- Yes.

105
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,646
The youngest Ji in the industry is Ji Ye Eun.

106
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,116
- Yes, I know her.
- You know who she is, right?

107
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,986
- I know.
- I see.

108
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,827
I've been performing as a duo with her lately.

109
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:28,156
- Yes, I watch "Running Man."
- Yes.

110
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,586
- Yes, she's on "Running Man."
- Yes. Right.

111
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,256
And they also released a song together.

112
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,327
Really?

113
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:33,856
(He was clueless about what his clan elder was up to.)

114
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:35,096
- Don't tell him.
- He did?

115
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,896
It's called "Milkshake." That's why he's wearing that today.

116
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,867
- I see. The title is "Milkshake?"
- Yes.

117
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,767
- Gosh, that doesn't suit him.
- You didn't have to tell him.

118
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,336
Seriously. That doesn't suit him at all.

119
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,636
- Why did you name it "Milkshake?"
- Right.

120
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,576
Everyone says Solomon's seal tea suits me better.

121
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,736
Or "Samgyetang" would be great.

122
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:51,277
"Samgyetang." You know?

123
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,216
- How have you been, Jin Hee?
- It's been a while.

124
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,216
- It's always the same with me.
- I see.

125
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:57,387
I always...

126
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,687
drop off my kids and pick them up.

127
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:01,616
When I have work, I work.

128
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,886
I exercise diligently too.

129
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,226
- I prepare for my next project.
- He's...

130
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,526
- Yes.
- Do you drink?

131
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:06,986
I quit drinking six years ago.

132
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,556
- Really?
- I quit six years ago.

133
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:09,796
You haven't seen his body, right?

134
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,296
- I have.
- His muscles are so well-defined.

135
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:12,926
- Jin Hee.
- They're super toned.

136
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,666
You're wearing a tank top underneath.

137
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,506
- My gosh, look at him.
- I wear what my stylist gives me.

138
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,637
- Your stylist?
- This part is naked underneath.

139
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:22,736
Jin Hee. Why are you covering up?

140
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,657
- What are you doing?
- Yes, this part is naked.

141
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,306
Jin Hee, this part is naked.

142
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,416
(Shy)

143
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,976
- It could graze my skin.
- Right.

144
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,486
- Is that so?
- The shirt must keep him cool.

145
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,716
- Yes.
- It does.

146
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:33,646
We talked about you on our way here. He told me...

147
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,986
you guys didn't get to work together although you're both actors.

148
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,856
- We only met in passing.
- Right.

149
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,156
You've never worked on a project together?

150
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,157
- No.
- No, never.

151
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:41,596
- Gosh, that's rare.
- No.

152
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:43,256
But I watched a lot of his YouTube videos.

153
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:45,426
- I went through a camping phase.
- I see.

154
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,766
- He had this white car.
- From your YouTube channel.

155
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:47,936
- It was my favorite car model.
- Right.

156
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:50,137
- I talked about that.
- I see. Yes.

157
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:51,436
He stopped going camping.

158
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:52,437
- He did?
- I did.

159
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,637
I just talk in my videos now.

160
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:54,876
- Why?
- What?

161
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,506
- Why did you stop? Was it the cost?
- The cost...

162
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:57,706
It wasn't cost-efficient at all.

163
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,376
- Right.
- Considering the investment,

164
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:00,676
- the results weren't good.
- Right.

165
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,376
- Was it after watching "Pinggyego?"
- Yes.

166
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:05,546
That's why I started to focus on talking for my YouTube videos.

167
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,286
- I switched to talking.
- You're just a chatter now.

168
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,356
Yes. I film my videos with actors and actresses.

169
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:11,086
- We talk about our projects.
- He's a chatter now.

170
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,486
- Right.
- Then aren't you guys also...

171
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:13,897
from the same clan?

172
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,156
- Oh, my name...
- His real name is Ahn Yeon Seok.

173
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:17,296
- My last name is Ahn.
- I see.

174
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:18,466
- That's my name.
- Just stick to Yoo for today.

175
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,066
- Let's do Yoos versus Jis today.
- Yes.

176
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,096
We're really from the same clan.

177
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:23,097
We're not competing today. We're on the same team.

178
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:26,067
- Have you watched our show?
- We're not competing?

179
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:28,536
- You've been on our show before.
- Hey. I...

180
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,036
How can I remember everything?

181
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,076
- What...
- Back then...

182
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,076
- How can I remember everything?
- But you must remember that.

183
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,347
- What?
- The kiss jelly.

184
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:35,977
Gosh, I do.

185
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,086
Hey, have you tried the jelly lips?

186
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,116
- "Jelly lips?"
- No.

187
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,386
- You've never tried them?
- It's called kiss jelly.

188
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:43,386
- This jelly is quite shocking.
- Really?

189
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,786
When you eat it, your face will turn red.

190
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,056
(It left a strong impression on him.)

191
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:48,497
- It was interesting. It really was.
- It was interesting.

192
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,156
It's funny how we're filming in Ahyeon-dong.

193
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:52,096
- I heard you grew up here.
- Yes.

194
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,496
Right, I was born here.

195
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,936
- I lived here for 20 years.
- Did you live here for a long time?

196
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:58,166
I lived here until I began my acting career.

197
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,506
- I see. Right here.
- Yes.

198
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,176
- He started his career quite late.
- Around here.

199
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:04,406
- Yes, I did.
- He used to be a photographer.

200
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,646
- He was a photographer.
- Right.

201
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,106
- He used to be a photographer.
- Yes.

202
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,846
Actually, no. I was only an assistant.

203
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:11,016
- Yes.
- I was only an assistant.

204
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,346
- You worked as an assistant.
- Yes.

205
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,787
But because you were too handsome...

206
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:16,556
Back then, I was working as an assistant.

207
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,086
Come on. What was that?

208
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,727
- Sorry. That was a vulgar gesture.
- This is so beneath our show.

209
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:22,756
I mean, he's still handsome.

210
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,396
- I bet you were gorgeous back then.
- I used to drink a lot then.

211
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,236
Before we start taking pictures of models,

212
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:28,666
- we have to take test shots.
- Right, they do.

213
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,067
I used to stand in for the test shots.

214
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:35,006
- I once met Song Hye Kyo.
- Yes.

215
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,106
- She was in middle school.
- Okay.

216
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:37,506
- She came to our studio...
- She was in middle school?

217
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:39,277
To take pictures for the school uniform ad.

218
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:42,146
This tiny girl showed up. And she just looked so beautiful.

219
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:45,086
I thought to myself, "Not everyone can be a celebrity."

220
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,686
- I remember thinking that.
- Yes.

221
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,856
I met Jun Ji Hyun when she was a model.

222
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,057
- She came in for magazine photos.
- For the magazines.

223
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,756
"How can anyone look that stunning?" That's what I thought.

224
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,356
I've met so many gorgeous celebrities.

225
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,096
- We're also part of that industry.
- Yes.

226
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,097
Sometimes, we do meet...

227
00:06:58,098 --> 00:06:59,526
- people who look out of this world.
- Right.

228
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:01,136
They're our colleagues and all.

229
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,766
But we'd think to ourselves, "They were born to be celebrities."

230
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,666
Nowadays, Jang Won Young is the prime example.

231
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:06,766
- Right.
- Yes.

232
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,536
- And Cha Eun Woo.
- Cha Eun Woo.

233
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:10,376
- Right.
- He was born to be a celebrity.

234
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:11,446
(Staring)

235
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,047
But what about you? How did you end up becoming a celebrity?

236
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,916
- How? With your protruding mouth...
- What do you mean?

237
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,346
- What?
- You also have the same mouth.

238
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,316
- His mouth is protruding.
- Yours protrudes too.

239
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,286
- But mine...
- You also have the same mouth.

240
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,927
Well, mine isn't that bad.

241
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,197
- You...
- It suddenly got so quiet.

242
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,326
- It suddenly got so quiet.
- You...

243
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,566
- It got so quiet.
- Hey, express your opinion.

244
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,596
- But...
- His mouth...

245
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:35,596
Here's the thing about Jin Hee. He can be...

246
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:37,066
- I'm looking forward to it.
- a bit competitive.

247
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,706
- He's...
- You take games seriously.

248
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,676
- I'm very competitive.
- He takes games very seriously.

249
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,906
- It's in his nature.
- Yes.

250
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:43,206
Being competitive is one thing.

251
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,146
But he's a sporth lover.

252
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,247
Did you say, "Sporth?"

253
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,417
Did you not understand me?

254
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:51,786
- It's the way you said it.
- Did you not understand me?

255
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:53,116
Why did you say, "Sporth?"

256
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:54,487
- "Sporth."
- Right.

257
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:57,157
Isn't he annoying? Is something wrong with your hearing?

258
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,057
I had a question while I was watching your show.

259
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,396
- We get ten tries.
- Yes.

260
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,866
I noticed you didn't practice a lot or stay focused in the beginning.

261
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,296
You guys did a half-hearted job in the beginning.

262
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:08,766
Only when you had 2 or 3 tries left, you were super focused.

263
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,136
- I see.
- I see. Toward the end?

264
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,966
- Yes. When I was watching it, - But...

265
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,436
I thought that we should focus...

266
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:14,706
in the beginning.

267
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:16,537
- That's what I had in mind.
- Great.

268
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,006
- We must succeed no matter what.
- We'll count on you today.

269
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,076
- We'll look forward to our games.
- Right.

270
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:22,116
We ought to.

271
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,816
- All right. Let's get going...
- Yes.

272
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,716
With Seok Jin and Jin Hee.

273
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:27,116
- Where are we going today?
- My gosh. Let's see.

274
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,556
- It's so long now.
- Gosh, it's long.

275
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,317
Here are the first Whenever Guests.

276
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:32,586
- "Lee Da Sun and No Do Ryun."
- Okay.

277
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,256
- What? As in young master?
- Young Master?

278
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:35,526
No, their name just sounds like it.

279
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,096
- "We farm sweet potatoes..."
- Really?

280
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,466
"all year round."

281
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,066
"To have the best harvest of the year,"

282
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,366
"I've been training hard with pull-ups today as usual."

283
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,236
- They farm sweet potatoes?
- They farm...

284
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:45,436
- sweet potatoes.
- And they do pull-ups.

285
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,736
"Our harvest ranges from our precious mini sweet potatoes..."

286
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:49,406
"to huge muscular ones."

287
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,977
"I'd like to show off our cherished sweet potatoes to everyone."

288
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:55,716
What? There's a sweet potato farm around here?

289
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,516
- Is there a place for that?
- Do they have the farm here?

290
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:59,046
- Or is it like a home garden?
- There's a mountain around here.

291
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,216
- Really?
- But you can't farm there.

292
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,716
I see. It will take 15 minutes via bus.

293
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,426
- Shall we get going? Let's go.
- Let's go.

294
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:06,427
- Let's go.
- Okay.

295
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,856
My gosh, it is indeed hot today.

296
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,426
Hey, this neighborhood has a great vibe.

297
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,596
- This area has barely changed.
- It hasn't been developed yet.

298
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:13,597
Except for that part.

299
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:15,636
- Will it get developed someday?
- The thing is...

300
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,666
- Yes, it will.
- Will you check out some land here?

301
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,707
No. That's what comes to my mind now.

302
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:21,536
- This place...
- Wait.

303
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:22,706
Wait. Is the bus stop right there?

304
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:23,936
- Wait. What?
- Hold on. There it is.

305
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:25,106
- We must go to the crosswalk.
- It's right there.

306
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,277
We can take that one. Yes.

307
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,676
It's been a long time since I last took a bus.

308
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:29,677
(They get on the bus right away.)

309
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,416
We can get off at Nonghyup...

310
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,257
- in front of the university. Yes.
- Nonghyup.

311
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:36,057
Then we have a long way to go.

312
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:38,687
- It will take 15 minutes. Yes.
- It'll take 15 minutes?

313
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,026
- Jin Hee, do you still...
- Yes?

314
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:41,226
Do indoor climbing?

315
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,026
You mean, bouldering? I don't do that anymore.

316
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:44,066
You don't?

317
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,026
But it's always on my mind.

318
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,226
- And I stretch often.
- You used to do bouldering?

319
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:48,713
- Yes, when I was in my 40s.
- He used to do that a lot.

320
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:51,066
Of all the sports I've tried, bouldering is the best.

321
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,806
- Really?
- You have to use your brain a lot.

322
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,576
- It also helps you stay in shape.
- Climbing...

323
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,476
That's why he has such muscular arms.

324
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:57,976
- It builds good forearm muscles.
- They used to be huge back then.

325
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,846
- Look at that.
- They used to be this big.

326
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:00,917
They're ripped.

327
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,946
- I stopped bouldering on purpose.
- Gosh, look.

328
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:05,616
Gosh, he's jacked.

329
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:06,617
(The local bus sets off as they talk about his forearm muscles.)

330
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:08,516
- This area is very quiet.
- Yes.

331
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,856
- It has good energy too.
- You used to live here back then.

332
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,187
So coming here...

333
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,156
- must make you feel nostalgic.
- It makes me feel safe.

334
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,656
- Right. Coming to hometowns...
- The old neighborhoods...

335
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,956
- have that effect on people.
- makes you feel at ease.

336
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,917
Do you know what's great about this neighborhood?

337
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:21,336
Even when there was a flood, this area didn't get flooded.

338
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,236
- Because this area is elevated.
- This place is on higher ground.

339
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,597
- Right. Back in the day...
- Yes.

340
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,666
That's my friend's barbecue restaurant.

341
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,676
- This one?
- Yes.

342
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,036
- He still runs it?
- He's still running it.

343
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:31,446
His parents used to run it. My parents are friends with them.

344
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:32,946
He took it over and is running it now.

345
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:34,276
(Barbecue restaurant)

346
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:36,076
(Looking around again)

347
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,416
- This really is your turf.
- This is... Yes.

348
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,917
Look at Chugye University here.

349
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:43,156
Chugye University and Jungang Girls' High School are over there.

350
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:44,686
Jungang Girls' Middle School is there too.

351
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,357
Jungang Girls' High School's volleyball team is famous.

352
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:50,296
A train runs down there.

353
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:53,396
- You can see the tracks there.
- There's a train station here?

354
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:54,796
Hanseong High School.

355
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:56,196
Hanseong Middle and High Schools are here.

356
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,666
- Which school did you go to?
- Hanseong Middle School.

357
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,736
- Really?
- Here.

358
00:10:58,737 --> 00:10:59,906
(That's my alma mater.)

359
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,836
Jin Hee knows everything about this town.

360
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:03,976
I see the train tracks.

361
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,906
He grew up here. That's why he knows everything.

362
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:06,976
Right.

363
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,446
You know more than I thought you would.

364
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,276
How much more does he know than you expected?

365
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,316
He knows more than I expected.

366
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,916
I forgot a lot of things.

367
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:14,916
- We used to live in Suyu-ri.
- Right.

368
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,116
I forgot a lot of things.

369
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:18,197
How come you didn't join us for the Suyu-ri Special?

370
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,326
- You guys had that special?
- We had.

371
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,597
I have to be invited first.

372
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,057
I can't just show up here.

373
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,596
The staff didn't invite you...

374
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,726
- for the Suyu-ri Special.
- Right.

375
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,396
- I guess they didn't.
- You must not be that important.

376
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,566
- He's on the Ahyeon-dong Special.
- I'm on the Ahyeon-dong Special.

377
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,166
But you don't have any connections in Ahyeon-dong?

378
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,177
Not at all.

379
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,758
- Not yet, at least.
- Do you get who the episode is for?

380
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,047
- Be quiet.
- Jin Hee?

381
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:39,547
You...

382
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,816
Could you be quiet?

383
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,677
My fists are itching to throw a punch.

384
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:45,187
They're itching to throw a punch.

385
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:48,377
- You're sensitive about that.
- Even if you see me...

386
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,087
- If you hit him...
- punching my junior,

387
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,496
- keep it a secret.
- Sure.

388
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:55,726
- Keep it a secret.
- Okay.

389
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,447
By the way, Seok Jin is my junior comedian.

390
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,626
- He debuted two years after me.
- That's true.

391
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,336
- He has no choice then.
- Yes, he can't do anything.

392
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:02,366
In our neighborhood, he was my junior.

393
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,036
- I see. In your neighborhood.
- I would teach him a lesson...

394
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,597
as the older guy from his neighborhood.

395
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,137
If I do that, his lips might be swollen.

396
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,677
- If that happens to my lips, - Hey.

397
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:13,947
Your lips might be on the ground.

398
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,117
(A childish banter)

399
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,287
(Laughing quietly)

400
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,257
What do you think? Is it surreal to meet us in person?

401
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,086
- Are you filming Go Possible?
- Who...

402
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:24,356
- Yes. It's Whenever Possible.
- is the most surreal...

403
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,626
Oh, it's Whenever Possible. I'm sorry.

404
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,026
Go Possible is a mix of our show and your YouTube channel.

405
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,426
Where did Go Possible come from?

406
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:31,226
- "Pinggyego" and Whenever Possible.
- "Pinggyego."

407
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,297
Go Possible.

408
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:35,177
What is it like to meet us in person?

409
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,606
- Not bad, right?
- Right.

410
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:38,607
Right.

411
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,576
- By the way, - Your eyes darted just now.

412
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:42,976
- it might not feel that special.
- Right.

413
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:43,977
(Feeling embarrassed rather late)

414
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,446
- I'm sorry.
- Bye.

415
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:46,906
I'm sorry for forcing you to give me an answer.

416
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,317
- Bye.
- Bye.

417
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:50,176
Thank you.

418
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,446
(Their conversation in their spare time is over.)

419
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:53,517
That's funny.

420
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,756
- Are we getting off soon?
- Yes, in front of the university...

421
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:56,916
- This is Ewha Womans University.
- Yes.

422
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,086
- You can enter from there.
- Really?

423
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,203
- I used to come here a lot then.
- Ewha Womans University.

424
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,756
- We're at Ewha Womans University.
- Back in the day,

425
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:03,917
- Ewha Womans University?
- I was hoping to get lucky.

426
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,527
- So did you get lucky?
- No.

427
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,097
I was hoping I would. But come to think of it,

428
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,167
- I was pretty lame back then.
- That...

429
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,936
That did happen.

430
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,106
- What do you mean?
- Other people got lucky.

431
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:15,337
They took his money.

432
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:17,877
(Only other people got lucky.)

433
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,376
(That happened back in the day.)

434
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,377
We have to get off here.

435
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:21,946
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

436
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:22,947
(They get off in front of Ewha Womans University.)

437
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,017
My gosh.

438
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,447
Do they run a restaurant?

439
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:27,777
- Didn't it say they were farmers?
- Sweet potatoes...

440
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:29,717
How could there be a farm here?

441
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:32,727
- Here?
- What's on the fifth floor here?

442
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,496
- Fifth floor.
- On the fifth floor...

443
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:36,527
- What's there? What?
- A climbing club?

444
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:38,526
It's a climbing club.

445
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,466
(The first spare time spot is an indoor climbing gym?)

446
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:41,467
No way.

447
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,767
It's a climbing club?

448
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:47,706
- Yes, this is the place.
- It's open.

449
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,206
- It's an indoor climbing gym.
- Gosh.

450
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,146
- How are sweet potatoes relevant?
- Over there.

451
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,247
We must take off our shoes.

452
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,646
- Are you Da Sun and Do Ryun?
- The slippers are there.

453
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,786
- Hello.
- My gosh. Hello.

454
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,616
- Hello.
- This is a climbing club.

455
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:00,787
Hello.

456
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:02,856
- Do Ryun?
- My name is Lee Da Sun.

457
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,626
- Da Sun. My gosh.
- Nice to meet you.

458
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,386
- Is that your real name?
- Yes, it is.

459
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,396
- That's cool.
- Gosh, Do Ryun.

460
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,796
- That's not a common name.
- Right.

461
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:13,196
After the honorific suffix, "nim," was introduced to our culture,

462
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:14,366
I've been having a hard time.

463
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,536
- Your name becomes Young Master.
- Right.

464
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:17,596
- Young Master.
- People would use that suffix.

465
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,337
- Right.
- We thought that was your name.

466
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,306
But here, they address me as Ms. Do Ryun.

467
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:22,937
- Ms. Do Ryun.
- Ms. Do Ryun.

468
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:24,406
- As it so happens, - That's a relief.

469
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,646
Jin Hee used to do indoor climbing.

470
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,506
- Right. We talked about that.
- My gosh.

471
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:28,946
- Really?
- I used to do it a long time ago.

472
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,346
- I read the news article.
- When I was in my 40s.

473
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,016
- Right?
- Yes, I remember reading it.

474
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,546
- I was in my early 40s.
- No way.

475
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:35,516
- Where should we go to talk?
- Over there.

476
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:37,157
- Let's move inside.
- Inside? Okay.

477
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,156
- My gosh.
- It's been a while for you, right?

478
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,196
It's been so long. This is quite touching too.

479
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,257
(Amazed)

480
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:44,227
- By the way, the gym...
- I'm tearing up.

481
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,366
The gym is quite big.

482
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,496
(The spacious interior amazes them.)

483
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:50,566
I didn't know a huge climbing gym like this could be in a building.

484
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,806
- The ceiling is high too.
- It must have a high ceiling.

485
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,036
- Shall we sit down?
- Yes.

486
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,676
Then what do you usually do during this spare time?

487
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,946
The gym isn't open yet.

488
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:01,176
This is when we prepare to open the gym.

489
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,076
In the letter you wrote to our show,

490
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,586
- you said you farmed...
- Sweet potatoes.

491
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:07,186
Sweet potatoes, ranging from mini to large sizes.

492
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:09,286
You said you ran a farm.

493
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,486
We really thought that...

494
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,687
- you guys had a sweet potato farm.
- Yes.

495
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,626
All the climbers have thick forearm muscles.

496
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:17,126
- Right. Look at his muscles.
- Right. Mine too.

497
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:18,696
- Look at his muscles.
- Gosh, seriously.

498
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,126
- Look how defined his muscles are.
- They're huge.

499
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,166
- They look so muscular already.
- Our forearm muscles get big.

500
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,637
And among climbers, we call them sweet potatoes.

501
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:27,066
- Forearm muscles?
- You call this a sweet potato?

502
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,807
So we say, "Your sweet potatoes are solid."

503
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,777
- That's what they call these.
- The forearm muscles?

504
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:34,747
But your forearm muscles aren't that developed.

505
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,787
Compared to before, they're more developed now.

506
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,117
- They are?
- It's...

507
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:42,916
Then are both of you climbing instructors?

508
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,527
- No.
- No?

509
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:46,456
You can't be English instructors.

510
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:48,726
No. We're in charge of promoting the gym.

511
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,726
- You take care of PR.
- I see.

512
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,526
- No wonder.
- I just started climbing.

513
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,696
- I knew it. I was disappointed.
- I knew it. Your sweet potatoes...

514
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:55,897
- Right?
- Yes.

515
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,906
Then what about you? What do you here?

516
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:01,306
I'm an instructor.

517
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,577
- I see.
- I'm also the manager here.

518
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,176
How did you two end up working at this gym?

519
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:09,976
I learned to climb after I started working here.

520
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:13,017
- Is that so?
- Yes. I used to have an office job.

521
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,556
- I turned 30 last year.
- Yes.

522
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,256
Age 29 is known as the rough patch. But my rough patch hit late...

523
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:21,056
- as if my life were stuck loading.
- I see. It hit you.

524
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,596
Then I went to Jeju Island to escape the situation I was in.

525
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,166
I was working at a guesthouse back then.

526
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,666
The owner of the gym was staying at the guesthouse.

527
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,136
He could see that I was quite interested...

528
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:34,677
in making online content. That must've been why...

529
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,606
- he offered me a job here.
- My gosh.

530
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,146
In my opinion, Young Master here...

531
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,546
- Just call her by her name.
- Right.

532
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,246
- Call me Ms. Do Ryun.
- Or Ms. Do Ryun.

533
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:45,086
- Ms. Do Ryun...
- Yes.

534
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,917
- seems to work at trendy places.
- Right.

535
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:49,886
- She worked at a guesthouse too.
- Yes, it happened that way.

536
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:50,956
What about you?

537
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:54,596
I actually majored in classical piano.

538
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,626
- What?
- Classical piano?

539
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:59,096
After graduating from college,

540
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,937
I wanted to do things that would be rough on my hands.

541
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,666
It was a sense of rebellion, right?

542
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,066
That's the thing. Pianists treat their hands with utmost care.

543
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,106
- Right.
- That's right.

544
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:08,506
But when it comes to climbing,

545
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,476
- your fingers bleed and tear.
- Right.

546
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:11,846
So pianists wouldn't do this.

547
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,646
Right. After I quit playing the piano,

548
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,816
- I looked into extreme sports.
- She must've trained hard.

549
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,516
Then I saw indoor climbing.

550
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,116
That's how I started.

551
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,716
I've been climbing for seven years.

552
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:23,886
- Really?
- I've been teaching for two years.

553
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,256
- You've been teaching for 2 years?
- Gosh, 7 years.

554
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,463
- She can practically fly then.
- She must be really good.

555
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,896
- By the way...
- What makes indoor climbing fun?

556
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:33,327
My gosh, indoor climbing is amazing.

557
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,737
(Stealing her answer)

558
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,436
- I...
- Jin Hee is answering it.

559
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:39,667
(Why are you answering that?)

560
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:42,237
Here's how I started climbing.

561
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,206
I was in the same boat. But I was 39.

562
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,506
- When I was turning 40, - Yes.

563
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,846
I thought, "I'm 40 soon. What should I do?"

564
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,077
That crossed my mind.

565
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,286
- "Mission: Impossible" came out.
- Yes.

566
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,016
- Tom Cruise was climbing a wall.
- Yes.

567
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:56,057
In Dubai.

568
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:58,826
"That's what I'm going to do." Then I went to the gym right away.

569
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,926
Really?

570
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:00,957
Then I tried it.

571
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:02,257
And I loved it.

572
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:03,696
- My fingers tore up.
- Really?

573
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,297
- And it was physically tiring.
- Right.

574
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:06,866
But it was...

575
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,996
more than just training your muscles.

576
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,666
- You must know yourself first.
- Right.

577
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,236
- I...
- What?

578
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:13,506
(The Talking Train gets started.)

579
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:14,906
- He raised his voice.
- Seriously. It was...

580
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,236
- Jin Hee...
- I'm serious.

581
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:18,246
- He can be...
- There's excitement in his voice.

582
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,947
He's passionate about this. Go ahead and tell us.

583
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:22,676
You must know yourself first, right?

584
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:25,186
- Right.
- "Can I climb it or not?"

585
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,046
- Right.
- "Should I jump or rest?"

586
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,256
- Right.
- But there are different levels.

587
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,786
- It's no joke.
- Right.

588
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,327
It's so dense.

589
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:35,526
So you must think about what to do.

590
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:36,996
You must think about whether you can pull it off or not.

591
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,026
- Hey.
- First of all...

592
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,126
- We have one more instructor here.
- That?

593
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,866
- This is Mr. Jin Hee.
- He should work with us.

594
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,466
I want to promote this sport.

595
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,866
- This is an excellent sport.
- I see.

596
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,136
- All right, Jin Hee.
- It's like training your mind.

597
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:48,137
- I have a question.
- Sure.

598
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,876
- Let's say there are ten levels.
- Okay.

599
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:53,246
Then which level are you on?

600
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:56,417
- Now? I'm at Level Two.
- Yes.

601
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,046
- Yet, he talks like an expert.
- But...

602
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,946
- he's at Level 8 or 9 for passion.
- Right.

603
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,286
- Jin Hee...
- When I was training hard,

604
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,817
- I was at Level 4 or 5.
- Level 2?

605
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,426
I was at Level 4 or 5 when I was training hard.

606
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,086
I climbed Insu Peak twice.

607
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,196
- Really?
- Yes.

608
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,956
- My gosh, Insu Peak.
- You climbed Insu Peak?

609
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:12,037
- Insu Peak is the hardest one.
- Yes, that's right.

610
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:15,137
- Then I also climbed some cliff.
- I see.

611
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:16,796
Have you climbed Insu Peak?

612
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,436
- No, not yet.
- See?

613
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,117
She hasn't done it even after seven years.

614
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,876
- Right. It's a different beast.
- I've been there.

615
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:25,246
- It's no joke.
- He's an impressive guy.

616
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,746
- I have respect for him...
- I was pretty good.

617
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:27,846
After hearing that.

618
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,676
You've been respectful since the beginning.

619
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:31,047
Yes, I'm a respectful guy.

620
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:34,117
I have a question. When you do indoor climbing,

621
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,616
do your fingers tear and bleed for real?

622
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,386
- Here...
- This is such a cool sport.

623
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:39,686
Go ahead. I talked too much. I'm sorry.

624
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:40,756
- No. I was really curious.
- Okay.

625
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:43,896
Like how we call the forearm muscles sweet potatoes,

626
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:46,467
- when our finger skin gets thin, - Yes.

627
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,996
It looks like our fingers...

628
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,236
- are mottled with blood.
- Right.

629
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:51,937
- We call that strawberry jam.
- Oh, that?

630
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,166
- "You've got strawberry jam."
- They get mottled with blood.

631
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,606
- Like cauliflower ears?
- I see. This...

632
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:56,006
- Right. Just like that.
- When they are pulled a lot?

633
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,276
A proper workout should end with strawberry jam.

634
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:00,707
A proper workout should end with strawberry jam?

635
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:02,846
In the letter, you wrote...

636
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:05,986
that you've been practicing pull-ups.

637
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,116
Which one of you is training?

638
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:09,917
- Both of us are training.
- I see.

639
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:12,826
But Ms. Do Ryun started climbing...

640
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,386
- only recently.
- Right.

641
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:15,996
- So we're teaching her...
- Yes.

642
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,557
- little by little.
- Right.

643
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,226
- I mean...
- Pull-ups... Sorry.

644
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:20,896
(They talk over each other again.)

645
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:23,836
- I can't get a word in today.
- Be quiet.

646
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,106
- You were late.
- Yes, I was late.

647
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,006
I'm sorry. Since we're on the subject, let me say this.

648
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,837
- Climbers' pull-ups...
- How are they?

649
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:32,206
Are different from the typical ones you think of.

650
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,546
- Are they different?
- Here's how they do it.

651
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,346
- They don't do it like this.
- Then how do they do it?

652
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:36,846
- They do it with 1 finger.
- Really? With 1 finger?

653
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:37,976
- That's how they do it.
- Then...

654
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,886
- Don't they do that?
- No way. With just one finger?

655
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:41,186
- Don't they?
- Yes.

656
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:42,216
- Do they really?
- They do it...

657
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:43,286
- with only one hand.
- Can you show us?

658
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,357
- I can't do it.
- She can't do it.

659
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:48,256
I haven't done it yet. But professional athletes do.

660
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:51,126
- Kim Ja In is amazing.
- Right, Kim Ja In.

661
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:53,227
- Lee Do Hyun did well recently.
- Right.

662
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,636
- Here's how I know him.
- You know his name too?

663
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:57,096
His father taught me climbing.

664
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,366
- Really?
- Yes.

665
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,106
- Mr. Lee Chang Hyun.
- Right!

666
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,676
- I learned from Lee Chang Hyun.
- Look at this guy.

667
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:04,507
It's like there's a motor on his mouth.

668
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:07,423
- You picked a good teacher.
- We recently talked on the phone.

669
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,846
I heard about his competition. So I gave him some money for food.

670
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:10,876
- Really?
- Really?

671
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:12,086
- He's killing it now.
- Yes. I gave him a nice message...

672
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,816
He's the best right now.

673
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:16,316
Jin Hee, shouldn't you demonstrate instead of just talking?

674
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,226
- Shouldn't you try it?
- The athlete...

675
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,827
Not now. My fingers hurt a bit.

676
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:21,856
- Come on. Don't give us an excuse.
- But you talked as if...

677
00:21:21,857 --> 00:21:23,226
Why are you giving us an excuse?

678
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:25,296
Why don't you demonstrate for us just briefly?

679
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,527
- Me?
- You're wearing a tank top too.

680
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:28,736
- Right.
- Yes.

681
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,737
- You came prepared.
- This isn't why I wore this.

682
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,106
You're so passionate about it.

683
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,013
- Show us, Jin Hee.
- When will we have the chance...

684
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:35,676
- It's been so long since I climbed.
- I want to try it too.

685
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,317
- It will be tough.
- I've never done it.

686
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:40,176
- How about the green one?
- This one is hard.

687
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,177
- My gosh, this...
- What do you think?

688
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,576
How does it go? I should hold it with two hands.

689
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:43,676
- Right.
- Where next?

690
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,487
- I should go this way.
- At the top...

691
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:47,246
- It's over once I grab this?
- Yes.

692
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:49,186
- I can only grab the green ones.
- Yes.

693
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,256
(The starting point, The end point)

694
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:51,627
Shouldn't you warm up?

695
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:52,887
- Should I?
- It's fine.

696
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:54,727
- Stretch.
- Yes, that's it.

697
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,526
- Your forearm muscles look great.
- Check out his sweet potato!

698
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:59,366
- There's his sweet potato.
- He's got a sweet potato.

699
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,027
- It's nice and big.
- Nice and big.

700
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,766
- That's considered big, right?
- It's big, isn't it?

701
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:03,936
- It's very big.
- It's big.

702
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:05,636
(He's done stretching.)

703
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:06,867
Gosh, Jin Ji Hee.

704
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:10,106
- Jin Ji Hee?
- I mean, Ji Jin Hee.

705
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:12,906
Please call people by their correct names.

706
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,307
- "Jin Ji Hee?"
- Okay, Yeon Shik.

707
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:18,187
This might be advantageous for short people.

708
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:19,946
- But there are pros and cons...
- Right.

709
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,656
To both being short and tall.

710
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:22,716
- Is that so?
- For jumps,

711
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:23,786
being tall comes in handy.

712
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,386
- Right.
- This is easier on short people.

713
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,586
Here's why. This is what you have to do.

714
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:28,057
Jin Hee, can't you just show us?

715
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:30,137
- Jin Hee, can't you just show us?
- Okay.

716
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:32,067
Okay. Let me try it.

717
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:33,927
He...

718
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,596
This is my starting position. With my feet here.

719
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:37,736
- Nice.
- Right?

720
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:38,737
Yes, you got it.

721
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:40,258
- Gosh, that's how he starts?
- Great.

722
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:42,917
- Gosh, this is tough.
- Great.

723
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:45,407
- You must always stretch them.
- Great.

724
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:46,946
I'm not sure...

725
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:48,593
- who the instructor is here.
- The blood flows there.

726
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,817
This is how you do it.

727
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,586
(He calmly advances.)

728
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:53,787
The instructor is impressed.

729
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:55,786
- I have to keep changing my pose.
- Great.

730
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,756
- I must get ready to advance.
- Nice.

731
00:22:57,757 --> 00:22:59,626
Nice. This is great.

732
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:01,456
- That's really hard.
- That's hard.

733
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:02,626
- Here's why.
- You must've trained a lot.

734
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:03,696
- He's carrying himself...
- Great.

735
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:04,726
Upside down only with his fingers.

736
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:05,796
He's making it look so easy.

737
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:06,997
- One more.
- He's good.

738
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:08,366
- Nice.
- Gather your hands.

739
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,927
- Once I gather them, it's over.
- Yes.

740
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,637
- That's it?
- Yes.

741
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:13,737
Try it.

742
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:14,936
- How...
- We can't do it.

743
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,877
- Try it.
- It looks easy, but is hard, right?

744
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,807
- No, it's not easy.
- Like Tom in "Mission: Impossible."

745
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,217
- Hey, it looks easy. Doesn't it?
- I got this.

746
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,617
Try grabbing the bottom holds.

747
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,587
- Place your left foot on the left.
- Here?

748
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:29,257
Squat down slightly.

749
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:31,256
Place your left foot on the left. That's it.

750
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:33,157
Let's try to move your right hand.

751
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:35,427
This is it for him.

752
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:37,626
- You can't step on the blue one.
- Look up and loosen your grip.

753
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:39,073
- You can't grab the red one.
- Not the red one.

754
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:41,567
- You can't step on the black one.
- Why don't you come down?

755
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,437
- "Why don't you come down?"
- Hold on.

756
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,397
I thought I was going to die. Why can't I grab the red one?

757
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,377
- Then it's cheating.
- This is...

758
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:51,407
- You try it.
- I've never done it.

759
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,306
- But I always wanted to try it.
- Maybe, I can't use my muscles.

760
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,016
- So for a beginner...
- Grab it with both of your hands.

761
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,076
- Loosen my grip and squat down?
- Yes.

762
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:58,546
Raise your left hand from that position.

763
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:00,447
- Left hand?
- Yes. Great. And your right hand.

764
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:02,227
- Yes. Right hand.
- Great. One more time.

765
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:05,687
- Great. Put your right foot there.
- You weren't that thorough with me.

766
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,427
Do you think your left hand can follow?

767
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,556
- Okay. Great.
- This is the tough step.

768
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:12,266
From there, grab it with your left hand.

769
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:14,127
- Left hand. Shake it off.
- Great.

770
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:15,466
- Grab it with your right hand...
- He's doing it with one hand.

771
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:16,973
- Your forearm muscles look good.
- as you go up.

772
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,806
- Great. Use your right hand again.
- Nice.

773
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:19,906
- I think he's done this before.
- Like this?

774
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,706
- That's it. Gather your hands.
- You got it. Two hands.

775
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:22,907
- Come down.
- There you go.

776
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,607
He's good.

777
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:26,746
He's tall, so he could reach it right away.

778
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:27,806
This is fun.

779
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,023
- You're very good.
- I told you.

780
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,816
- Will you try it?
- He must work out a lot.

781
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,346
- His back muscles are no joke.
- He's really good.

782
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,316
- Your swing...
- I think I used unfamiliar muscles.

783
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:35,616
- Right.
- Muscles I haven't used before.

784
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:36,886
- Right.
- You must remember...

785
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:37,956
to form a triangle.

786
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:39,956
Your hand and two feet must form a triangle.

787
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,186
If you do this, you'll fall off.

788
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:43,197
When you move, you must always move your foot.

789
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:46,727
(It's easy, isn't it?)

790
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:48,696
It's really not easy.

791
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,366
- Seriously.
- Let's start with your left hand.

792
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,666
- Left hand?
- Yes, left hand.

793
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,306
- See?
- Then grab it with your right hand.

794
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:54,566
- Let's do it one more time.
- Gosh, you're good.

795
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,636
- Like this?
- Breathe and grab it. Great.

796
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:58,546
After this, shouldn't I move my left foot?

797
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,606
- You can do that.
- Shouldn't you grab this one?

798
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,216
- Grab it with your left hand.
- Left hand.

799
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,616
- Gosh, this is...
- Slowly. Then...

800
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:06,916
- Gosh, this is...
- Slowly. Then...

801
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,916
- You're good.
- Gather your hands now.

802
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,016
- He's good.
- Okay.

803
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:11,486
- Use your right hand again.
- Again?

804
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:12,726
- Grab it.
- Yes.

805
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:13,957
My gosh.

806
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:16,597
- Like this.
- Great.

807
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:18,727
Grasshopper is good.

808
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:21,696
- This isn't easy.
- My gosh. This is...

809
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:23,096
- You know, people might wonder...
- This...

810
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:24,296
why I can't do it.

811
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:26,336
- But this is normal, in my opinion.
- Right.

812
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:28,006
- You guys are just good.
- I agree, by the way.

813
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:29,106
- I agree. They're very good.
- Aren't I right?

814
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,406
- They're just good, aren't they?
- They're good.

815
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,276
Then could you show us a difficult route?

816
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,417
- Show us.
- We talked about using fingers.

817
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,376
- You use your fingers to grab this?
- Only 2 or 3 fingers can fit in.

818
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,546
- That's not possible.
- Try it.

819
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:39,646
- Right?
- Gosh, this...

820
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:41,787
- People grab it like that?
- Yes.

821
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,156
People use their fingers...

822
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,557
- to hold up their weight?
- Right.

823
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:46,526
Why torture themselves when there's an easy way?

824
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,156
- Let me explain it.
- My gosh.

825
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:49,956
- I'll show it to you.
- Okay.

826
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:51,026
- Show us.
- Yes.

827
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:52,266
You must step to the left side.

828
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,496
- Okay.
- The distance...

829
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:54,997
(She'll only use the orange holds.)

830
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:59,436
(Clearly, the course has gotten more challenging.)

831
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:01,806
- She's going that way.
- I see. She'll finish there.

832
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:02,877
Only the orange ones.

833
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:05,047
- I see. Okay.
- I'm using my fingers...

834
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,806
- to grab it.
- I...

835
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:08,006
I can see her sweet potatoes.

836
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,116
- Right.
- To the left.

837
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,216
- She makes it look easy.
- Great.

838
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:11,677
- This isn't easy.
- Right.

839
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,186
- I can't picture her...
- Right.

840
00:26:13,187 --> 00:26:14,586
- playing classical piano.
- That's it.

841
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:16,286
- Right. She's smooth.
- This is the hard part.

842
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:17,617
- This part...
- That's it.

843
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,857
(Jumping)

844
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:25,067
- That's so cool.
- That's really cool.

845
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:28,296
She's like Spider-Man.

846
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,897
I don't think we can do this.

847
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,267
There's no way we can do this.

848
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,036
That's impressive.

849
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,337
She must jump down.

850
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,837
- So...
- You try it.

851
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:39,807
- This one looks really hard.
- Did you see that?

852
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,177
That was so smooth.

853
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:43,777
- That was smooth.
- All right. Let's begin.

854
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:45,886
- All right. We're starting.
- Before our games...

855
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,486
- Two is the best, right?
- Right.

856
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:49,116
Jin Hee, why don't you throw it?

857
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,187
- Great.
- Two.

858
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:51,587
- Good luck.
- Two.

859
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:53,556
Two!

860
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,557
(Please let it be 2!)

861
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,797
- Two!
- It's two!

862
00:26:57,997 --> 00:26:59,667
- Two!
- My gosh.

863
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,387
- We're off to a great start.
- No way.

864
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,636
His passion for climbing...

865
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:04,136
- must've gotten us two coupons.
- Right.

866
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:07,366
Let's check the prize for Round One.

867
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,076
"We work and exercise together."

868
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:11,406
"We can be closer with a similar look."

869
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,347
"A T-shirt and shorts from Patagonia."

870
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:16,517
- It's an entire outfit.
- Patagonia is perfect here.

871
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:18,276
(Matching workout clothes are at stake for Round 1.)

872
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:19,486
How cute.

873
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:20,846
(The mission will develop their forearm muscles.)

874
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,856
(A game of ddakji)

875
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:23,886
(Round 1)

876
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,256
(They will take turns throwing the ddakji.)

877
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:27,057
(They must flip over 2 of the 4 ddakjis.)

878
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,226
- A game of ddakji?
- A game of ddakji?

879
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,987
- I'm good at that.
- It's a game of ddakji.

880
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,256
- You beat Ho Dong with this game.
- You know?

881
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:32,966
- This game is made for me.
- Remember what you did then?

882
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,887
(Jae Suk is brimming with confidence because...)

883
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,407
(He flipped it over whenever he played.)

884
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:45,847
(Yoo Jae Suk, the king of ddakji in the entertainment industry)

885
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,976
All right. Well, as for this game,

886
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:49,616
- We're good at that.
- we could do well.

887
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:51,616
- We have a good chance.
- This one will be easy.

888
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:53,546
- It's easy.
- Everyone, take one.

889
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,256
- It's easy.
- When you were growing up,

890
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,556
this was...

891
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:57,686
- the only game you could play.
- Right, this was it.

892
00:27:57,687 --> 00:27:59,426
- Right, we did this to have fun.
- This was the only game, right?

893
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,486
- Or alkkagi.
- We had fun with this game.

894
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,256
This is how I developed my forearm muscles.

895
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:04,297
- All right.
- They gave us the perfect game.

896
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:05,966
I'm not good at the game of ddakji.

897
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,096
Try it, Yeon Seok.

898
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:08,866
I'm not so good at the game of ddakji.

899
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,567
- This won't be easy.
- Really?

900
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,336
- Gosh, he's not good at this.
- I'm not good at this.

901
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:15,407
Yeon Seok.

902
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,906
- This isn't working.
- What's going on?

903
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:17,977
This isn't working.

904
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:20,376
- You must hit it accurately.
- This ddakji is a bit thin.

905
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:21,877
- Yes, it's thin.
- It's thin.

906
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:27,687
(He flips it over in one go.)

907
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:30,717
This is good.

908
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:34,727
My gosh.

909
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,026
- You two are good at this.
- Right.

910
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:38,703
They gave us a good one after a long time.

911
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:40,897
The games have gotten easier.

912
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,537
Hitting it accurately is important.

913
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:44,443
- Right here.
- You must hit the center of it.

914
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:45,937
- The center.
- Wait. Where...

915
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:47,467
I think...

916
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,153
- Yeon Shik, hit the center.
- We'll succeed at least once.

917
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:51,277
Hit the center.

918
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:53,977
This is how you do it. Perfect.

919
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,176
(It flipped over right away when he hit the center.)

920
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:57,846
- Okay.
- That's it.

921
00:28:57,847 --> 00:28:59,117
(Good job.)

922
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:00,923
- Why are you so bad?
- This works?

923
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,487
I'm bad at the ddakji game.

924
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:04,687
- Hit it.
- Hit it to the side.

925
00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:06,856
- There you go.
- Good.

926
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,527
- You have to hit it accurately.
- Yes.

927
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:10,826
(Success)

928
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:12,666
- You have to hit it exactly.
- You're doing great.

929
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,727
Nice.

930
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,136
All right. Let's try Round One right away.

931
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,266
- Yes.
- Let's do a cheer.

932
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,536
Let's do a cheer first.

933
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:19,836
In 1, 2, 3.

934
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:21,337
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

935
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,506
- Should we go in this order?
- Yeon Shik.

936
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,076
- Me first?
- Yes.

937
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:25,776
All right. This is Round One.

938
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:27,546
It'll be smooth sailing this time.

939
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:29,847
- I've got you guys.
- Yes.

940
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:32,057
- Hit the center, Yeon Shik.
- Okay.

941
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:35,716
- This is nice.
- I'm not so good at ddakji, though.

942
00:29:35,717 --> 00:29:36,917
You can flip this one.

943
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:39,487
(It flipped!)

944
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,757
(He succeeded right away.)

945
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:44,657
You're pretty good at the real thing!

946
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:47,666
I'm good at the real thing.

947
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,837
Great.

948
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,237
Finish it, Jin Hee.

949
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,758
- Here goes Jin Hee.
- I'll finish it.

950
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:00,477
We can't finish it too soon.

951
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:02,246
Did he tire himself out?

952
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:03,776
I think my shoulder is dislocated.

953
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:05,647
But he said he'd finish it early on.

954
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,037
I think I dislocated my shoulder.

955
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:08,657
Okay.

956
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,786
- This one looks thick.
- Okay.

957
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:12,456
It's over if I flip it, right?

958
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,457
That's right.

959
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,657
Round One will be a success.

960
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:18,727
- Yes!
- What?

961
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:21,027
Yes!

962
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:23,537
- You hit it too hard.
- It was too strong.

963
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,306
- It flipped twice.
- You hit it too hard.

964
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:26,606
I hit it too hard.

965
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,066
This is a lot of pressure.

966
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,876
I thought it'd be easy for you.

967
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:31,536
- Take it easy.
- I'll show you my skills.

968
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:33,746
- I only need to flip one.
- Just like you practiced.

969
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:34,876
We need to get to Round Three.

970
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,646
- We have to pass this round now...
- Yes.

971
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:38,323
- to go for Round 2 and Round 3.
- Let's make it.

972
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:42,657
(Jae Suk is good at the ddakji game, but he's bad at the real games.)

973
00:30:44,257 --> 00:30:46,427
- All right. We pass if I flip it.
- Let's make it.

974
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:49,257
Okay.

975
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:50,796
Let's make it.

976
00:30:50,797 --> 00:30:53,496
(He flipped it!)

977
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:55,027
- Great.
- That was incredible.

978
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:56,167
This was their first try.

979
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:57,437
All right.

980
00:30:57,637 --> 00:30:58,966
- Round One, success!
- Success!

981
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,466
All right. Good.

982
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,136
The production crew doesn't seem so happy.

983
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:03,536
- This is great.
- Are you happy?

984
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:05,036
That was easy.

985
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,306
- That was smooth.
- All right.

986
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:07,946
- He finally found the right game.
- So,

987
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:10,377
we passed Round 1 on our very 1st try.

988
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,516
You need to decide whether to go for Round Two...

989
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,646
- or not.
- Go for it.

990
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:15,186
And we have tons of tries left.

991
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,216
Make your decision.

992
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:18,116
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

993
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:19,527
- Go!
- All right.

994
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:20,757
Naturally.

995
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:21,857
It was obvious.

996
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:23,727
Gosh.

997
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:26,426
"To climb higher safely,"

998
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,426
"the right gear matters most."

999
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:31,336
"Two sets of Scarpa climbing shoes and Arc'teryx chalk bags."

1000
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:32,607
That's amazing.

1001
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:35,776
That's like Hermes in the climbing shoes industry.

1002
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:36,906
- It's the best brand.
- Is it?

1003
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:38,636
- It's the most expensive.
- Oh, Arc'teryx!

1004
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,646
Those are handmade.

1005
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:41,746
- Handmade?
- Yes.

1006
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,116
Those are quality shoes, right?

1007
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,716
- They're good, right?
- They're the best.

1008
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,317
They're different from rental shoes.

1009
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,416
- Those are handmade.
- Handmade?

1010
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:51,417
(Round 2)

1011
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:53,857
(Flip all 4 ddakjis.)

1012
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:55,227
- What?
- Four?

1013
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:57,057
- All of them?
- Right away?

1014
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:58,867
All four of them?

1015
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:01,626
It gets exponentially tougher in Round Two.

1016
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,397
- Should we start right away?
- Sure.

1017
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:04,696
You should go first.

1018
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:05,866
- Should I?
- Try number two.

1019
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,966
But it's a failure if the first guy fails.

1020
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,376
- It is.
- You're right.

1021
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,253
That's why I told you to go first. To put you under pressure.

1022
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,006
(Impressed by his honest strategy)

1023
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:14,606
- Round 2.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1024
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:15,746
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

1025
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:16,777
You're right.

1026
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:19,016
- This is far more difficult.
- Yes.

1027
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,616
(It's a failure once any of them fails.)

1028
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:22,256
This would be so much pressure.

1029
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:23,887
But I'm wearing slippers.

1030
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:26,857
Gosh.

1031
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:30,126
- Gosh.
- This is a lot of pressure.

1032
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,696
I've never seen him do so well under pressure.

1033
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,566
- This is my type of game.
- Jae Suk...

1034
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,896
- He's called Yoo Ddakji.
- Great.

1035
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:39,006
He's known for his ddakji skills in this industry.

1036
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:40,907
All right. I'll take it easy.

1037
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,047
- It's not so difficult.
- You need to succeed.

1038
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:44,577
It's just...

1039
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:47,547
Why are you wearing climbing shoes to play ddakji?

1040
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:50,377
In case I slip.

1041
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:52,217
Your life feels like climbing, doesn't it?

1042
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:53,486
It feels like climbing.

1043
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,186
I always do my best to climb up.

1044
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:56,787
No pressure.

1045
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:58,316
You're a ddakji.

1046
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,487
Who are you talking to?

1047
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:01,887
Yes!

1048
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:04,527
Yes!

1049
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:06,197
He's good.

1050
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,197
These two are very good.

1051
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:09,767
Yes!

1052
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,507
(Meanwhile)

1053
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:14,437
The pressure is on you now.

1054
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,906
- Good luck.
- You climbed up so well earlier.

1055
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,676
Are we going to succeed in one go?

1056
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:20,847
- It's so funny...
- Yes?

1057
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:23,076
Because part of me wanted you to succeed,

1058
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:25,347
but the other part of me wished...

1059
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,086
that you would fail.

1060
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:28,446
You don't want to be the one to fail.

1061
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:29,617
It's a lot of pressure.

1062
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,256
Stay balanced like you did earlier.

1063
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,886
(Second try, Jin Hee)

1064
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,226
I thought that we should focus...

1065
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:36,457
in the beginning.

1066
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:42,367
(It makes a full spin.)

1067
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:43,597
It was too centered.

1068
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:46,966
- It spun twice.
- No!

1069
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,687
- It took a full spin.
- It was too strong.

1070
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,676
- He hit it, though.
- What a shame.

1071
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,006
There's hope, though.

1072
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:54,307
- So close.
- You're getting to the center.

1073
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,446
If it flipped twice, it's good news.

1074
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,176
- Right.
- It means you were accurate.

1075
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:00,846
Let's go for try number three right away.

1076
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,386
- Should we go 1st?
- Round 2, try number 3.

1077
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:03,586
- How about in this order?
- Yes.

1078
00:34:03,587 --> 00:34:04,716
- In 1, 2, 3.
- We'll go for Round 3.

1079
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:05,727
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

1080
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,227
Me first?

1081
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:09,156
I need to start strong.

1082
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:11,057
It's a failure when one of us fails.

1083
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,227
It's...

1084
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:15,166
I only need to hit it accurately.

1085
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,443
It doesn't need to be that strong.

1086
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,697
Accurately.

1087
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:27,606
It was too weak.

1088
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,607
(Try number three is a failure.)

1089
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,316
Maybe it's because it flipped twice earlier.

1090
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:32,216
It doesn't work when you try to control it.

1091
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:33,786
- Just be confident.
- You overthink it.

1092
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:34,886
- Yes, be confident.
- Be confident.

1093
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:36,456
- This time...
- Why don't you go first, Jin Hee?

1094
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:37,886
- Me?
- Give it a shot.

1095
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:38,887
Jin Hee first.

1096
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:40,586
- Let's switch it up.
- Yes.

1097
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:42,086
- In this order?
- Yes.

1098
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:43,926
- Good. In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go!

1099
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:45,487
- Is it already try number five?
- Yes.

1100
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:46,967
Try number five? Already?

1101
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:51,737
Yes!

1102
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:53,506
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1103
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:54,537
Great.

1104
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:55,936
I like this one, Yeon Seok. Can I hit this?

1105
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:57,277
Sure. Choose whatever you want.

1106
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,507
Just make sure to flip it.

1107
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,177
- Good luck!
- This is no big deal.

1108
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,786
(Try number five is a failure.)

1109
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:13,687
You should have gone with yours.

1110
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:16,957
But this is...

1111
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,456
Sorry. I apologize.

1112
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,397
- No problem.
- It's just...

1113
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:22,843
The pressure is bigger because they're watching.

1114
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,736
The probability of all four of us...

1115
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:25,737
succeeding in a row is very low.

1116
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:27,166
- Right.
- It's pretty tough.

1117
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,336
The odds of us all succeeding...

1118
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:30,707
is so low.

1119
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:32,276
It is.

1120
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:34,006
- Let's use a coupon.
- Yes.

1121
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,007
All right.

1122
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:36,816
- Between...
- Which one?

1123
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:39,247
- Young Master, do you want to go?
- Young Master, join us.

1124
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,123
Have you played the ddakji game before?

1125
00:35:41,147 --> 00:35:42,856
- No, right?
- We have two coupons.

1126
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,716
But you have to replace one of us.

1127
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:46,886
If you could stare at the person...

1128
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:48,186
you want to replace...

1129
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,197
Who is it?

1130
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:51,496
- It's just one try.
- Yes.

1131
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:53,466
(Peeking)

1132
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,527
Me?

1133
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:56,896
(Yeon Seok is out, and Do Ryun is in.)

1134
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:58,337
Seriously?

1135
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:00,767
- I didn't play that well.
- Right.

1136
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:02,477
Give it a shot, Young Master.

1137
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:03,706
I'll cheer for you.

1138
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:05,646
- Practice.
- It's a practice round, right?

1139
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:06,647
- Yes, practice.
- Practice.

1140
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:08,476
Hit the center.

1141
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:10,557
You've never hit ddakji in your childhood, have you?

1142
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:12,216
She's not in the ddakji generation.

1143
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,446
- I'm not.
- That's true.

1144
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,287
- It's quite tricky.
- Try hitting the center.

1145
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:17,816
- Good.
- I have high hopes for you.

1146
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:18,956
- How are you so good?
- Let's go immediately.

1147
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:20,286
- Let's try it.
- Do Ryun.

1148
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:21,586
In 1, 2, 3.

1149
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:22,596
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

1150
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,357
- Here goes Do Ryun.
- Okay.

1151
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:26,666
She's good, though.

1152
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,767
- Yes!
- She did it!

1153
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,867
(A smooth start)

1154
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,176
- Oh, my gosh.
- You're seriously good.

1155
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,077
- That was awesome.
- You know...

1156
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:39,446
- Jin Hee. Go for it.
- Yes?

1157
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,806
- Good luck.
- Let's go for it.

1158
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,076
- Okay. Here I go.
- Go ahead.

1159
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,646
(Coupon Round, Jin Hee)

1160
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:44,877
Show us what you've got.

1161
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:46,747
All right.

1162
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,617
I hit it well.

1163
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:53,327
This is it.

1164
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:54,686
Can we just keep that part?

1165
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:55,967
Cut out the one where he failed.

1166
00:36:58,797 --> 00:36:59,797
It's pretty difficult.

1167
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:02,297
You said you'd finish fast.

1168
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,897
Do Ryun did so well, though.

1169
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,266
(They lost the bonus coupon.)

1170
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:09,337
I can't really say, "I'll go first."

1171
00:37:09,837 --> 00:37:12,276
- Try going first.
- But I'm scared.

1172
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:13,277
- You're...
- Okay, then.

1173
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:15,046
- You've never gone first, right?
- Fine.

1174
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:17,346
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Here we go.

1175
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:18,746
- Is it try number 6?
- Try number 6.

1176
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:20,317
It's about time we succeeded.

1177
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:22,317
(Blowing)

1178
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,157
In Round Two...

1179
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:29,856
(Shouting)

1180
00:37:29,857 --> 00:37:32,057
(Failure)

1181
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:35,467
Seok Jin.

1182
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:37,496
Why do you keep hitting like a cheapskate?

1183
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,836
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1184
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:40,537
You went like this. What was that?

1185
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,477
What was that?

1186
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:44,606
Yet he still flipped it.

1187
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,276
How are you so good at this?

1188
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:48,707
He flipped it.

1189
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,977
This is try number seven already.

1190
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:52,986
- We're in trouble.
- This is the moment.

1191
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,046
Jae Suk should go first.

1192
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:55,417
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

1193
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:57,316
- Start us off.
- Okay.

1194
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,416
Please.

1195
00:37:58,417 --> 00:37:59,456
- This feels good.
- Try number seven.

1196
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:00,886
- I feel good about this.
- We still have a coupon left.

1197
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,596
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

1198
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,926
- I feel good.
- Go, Jae Suk.

1199
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,727
- This is huge pressure, though.
- Let's win the presents.

1200
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,427
- Yes.
- Let's get them their presents.

1201
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:12,237
(We believe in you, king of ddakji.)

1202
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:20,007
(Even Jae Suk failed.)

1203
00:38:21,107 --> 00:38:23,847
(Shocked)

1204
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:26,247
This is tough.

1205
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:28,086
The first player always fails.

1206
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,557
It's so tough.

1207
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:31,486
Let's use a coupon.

1208
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,757
- We need to overcome this slump.
- Yes.

1209
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:35,356
Come on in.

1210
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,896
- Give it a shot.
- You have to...

1211
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,326
- Practice.
- I've never played this before.

1212
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:39,726
- You have to hit the center.
- Yes.

1213
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:41,767
- The center.
- Like Do Ryun did earlier.

1214
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:43,336
- Good.
- She's good.

1215
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:45,266
- She's better than us.
- She's so good at this.

1216
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:46,636
- Can we start right away?
- Sorry?

1217
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:47,836
- Let's go right away.
- Right away?

1218
00:38:47,837 --> 00:38:49,637
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

1219
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,477
Like you did just now.

1220
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:53,077
(Coupon Round, Da Sun)

1221
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:54,777
She did it!

1222
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,917
She did it!

1223
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:02,657
She did it!

1224
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:05,786
Why is this happening?

1225
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:06,826
(Failure)

1226
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:08,157
Why can't we even start?

1227
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:11,657
- This is crazy.
- We're probably jinxed.

1228
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:14,447
- It works during practice.
- Hold on.

1229
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,066
- Or...
- I got it.

1230
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,587
It's better to hit it while squatting.

1231
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:22,876
- It's better when squatting.
- Yes.

1232
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:24,236
- This is better.
- Okay.

1233
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,637
It's way better.

1234
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:28,347
How is this...

1235
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,647
Jin Hee is so good.

1236
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,446
- He's...
- You should go first.

1237
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:34,916
- Jin Hee, go first.
- Jin Hee.

1238
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,356
Let's just start.

1239
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,986
All right. We have two attempts left.

1240
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:40,756
- Let's put our hands together.
- Yes.

1241
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:42,656
- We have to do a cheer.
- All right.

1242
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:44,656
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1243
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:46,337
- Great. Good luck, guys.
- Let's make it.

1244
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:48,667
Okay.

1245
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,466
(They finally got past the first player!)

1246
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,497
- Seok Sam!
- My turn?

1247
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,866
- Just go.
- Take it easy.

1248
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,466
- Naturally.
- Yes!

1249
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:56,406
(Try number nine, Seok Jin)

1250
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:57,407
Okay.

1251
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:58,876
(They'll pass Round 2 if the other 2 flip them.)

1252
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:00,206
- We're on a roll.
- Is it my turn?

1253
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:02,007
- We're on a roll.
- Should I go?

1254
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,016
- Yes!
- Yes!

1255
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:07,687
- Yes!
- Yes!

1256
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:09,456
Yeon Shik.

1257
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:11,256
(Yeon Shik is last.)

1258
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:12,356
- Focus.
- Yeon Seok!

1259
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:15,326
- Go ahead. Hurry.
- Let's do this!

1260
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:16,756
- You've got this.
- Please!

1261
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:19,127
- I know how that feels.
- You can do it.

1262
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:21,066
- You've got this.
- Yeon Seok!

1263
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:22,736
- Please.
- I...

1264
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:24,936
I'm not so good at this game!

1265
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:27,507
Hit the center. Please.

1266
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:30,807
This is a tough mission.

1267
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:34,307
You've got this, Yoo One Shot.

1268
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,646
You've done this before. Just do it.

1269
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:38,247
Just like you've been doing.

1270
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:39,647
Have confidence.

1271
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:46,786
Just do it.

1272
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:49,157
Just like you've been doing. Have confidence.

1273
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,927
Oh, that was close.

1274
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:58,837
Oh, that was close.

1275
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:07,077
(They fail try number nine.)

1276
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:10,517
What do we do?

1277
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:12,246
It's our last chance.

1278
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:13,746
(They only have one try left.)

1279
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:14,817
This is so...

1280
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:18,956
- Hold up.
- It's pretty hard.

1281
00:41:18,957 --> 00:41:20,026
It's so tricky.

1282
00:41:20,027 --> 00:41:21,027
- I don't think...
- This is...

1283
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:23,296
- the ddakji game fits me.
- It's hard.

1284
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:25,696
- Don't beat yourself up.
- Even if you were doing well,

1285
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:27,166
- This is...
- you can fail.

1286
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,626
- I...
- It's nerve-racking.

1287
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:30,896
I don't think I should go last in a ddakji game.

1288
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:32,536
- Do you want to go first?
- I think you should go last.

1289
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,436
- All right.
- We should have changed it.

1290
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:35,837
- Okay.
- All right, then.

1291
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,076
Why don't we go from there?

1292
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,806
Unfortunately, this is our last shot.

1293
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:40,046
- The first one...
- Seriously.

1294
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:41,776
- Who should go first?
- I never thought we'd get here.

1295
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:42,876
Let's do a cheer.

1296
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,176
We always get stuck in Round Two.

1297
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:46,086
- Let's do a cheer.
- All right.

1298
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,846
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1299
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:49,757
Good luck, Jin Hee. Final attempt.

1300
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,427
(Success)

1301
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,127
- I did it.
- Good.

1302
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:00,867
Okay.

1303
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:03,766
He did it. Great.

1304
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:04,936
Why are you...

1305
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:07,866
so sad when Jin Hee succeeded?

1306
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,306
Yeon Seok, you can do it.

1307
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:10,536
- Your face...
- Just like you did before.

1308
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:12,406
I'm always confident in games,

1309
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,506
but I'm losing confidence in this one.

1310
00:42:14,507 --> 00:42:16,216
I never thought I'd flip it.

1311
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:17,476
- Yeon Seok.
- I did it.

1312
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:18,846
Yeon Seok, you can do it. Just like you did before.

1313
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:20,986
- Just hit the center.
- Just like I did before.

1314
00:42:20,987 --> 00:42:22,816
I can't be too cautious.

1315
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:24,686
- Just hit it naturally.
- Yes, naturally.

1316
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:25,687
He'll do it.

1317
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:27,928
- I shouldn't be too tense either.
- Just walk up to it.

1318
00:42:28,227 --> 00:42:29,427
Like I've been doing.

1319
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,067
- Yes!
- Yes!

1320
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:37,266
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

1321
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:40,467
- You did it.
- I did it.

1322
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:41,637
I did it!

1323
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,736
- Good luck!
- Yes!

1324
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:46,606
- I've played my part.
- Please.

1325
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,107
- Good luck.
- This is wild.

1326
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:49,647
I'm sweating.

1327
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:51,817
- It's so nerve-racking.
- That was...

1328
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:57,587
We need to make it.

1329
00:42:59,017 --> 00:43:00,526
- Be comfortable.
- Yes.

1330
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:01,557
I'm going to make it.

1331
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:02,956
- Let's make a dramatic comeback.
- Yes.

1332
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:03,957
Let's go!

1333
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,427
What did you hit?

1334
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,737
(Coughing)

1335
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:13,767
What did you hit?

1336
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:19,706
(What did you hit?)

1337
00:43:19,707 --> 00:43:21,077
(Getting a headache)

1338
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:24,516
I wasn't so confident this time.

1339
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:25,546
(They failed.)

1340
00:43:25,547 --> 00:43:27,186
Why did you hit the side?

1341
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,216
(Retrieving the presents)

1342
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:30,657
He took them away.

1343
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:32,257
Why would you...

1344
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:33,656
This is...

1345
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:35,157
Why would you hit the edge?

1346
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:36,296
Gosh.

1347
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:39,356
This was so easy.

1348
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:40,897
It's as easy as that.

1349
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:45,966
It flips once I hit the center.

1350
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:47,637
This is so easy.

1351
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:50,036
It was served on a silver platter.

1352
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:51,877
Look at how easy it is.

1353
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:53,506
Jae Suk.

1354
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,806
- That's enough.
- It's over now.

1355
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:56,876
- It's done.
- It's water under the bridge.

1356
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:57,877
What's this?

1357
00:43:57,878 --> 00:44:00,216
- Oh, the regular presents.
- That's...

1358
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:01,986
- We should at least give them this.
- Yes.

1359
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:02,987
Hand them over.

1360
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:05,316
We should have succeeded on try number nine.

1361
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:06,686
This is truly...

1362
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:07,687
(Depressed)

1363
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:09,127
We apologize.

1364
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:11,757
There's no need. Thank you for your effort.

1365
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:14,326
- We truly apologize.
- It's fine.

1366
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:16,366
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No. Thank you for this.

1367
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:17,967
They were so happy about those presents.

1368
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:19,836
- I'll remember your effort.
- It's cute.

1369
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:21,536
You guys have gone through this often, right?

1370
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:22,806
(The first spare time ends.)

1371
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:23,976
We're truly sorry.

1372
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:24,977
Sorry.

1373
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:27,706
I thought we'd have to climb, but it was ddakji.

1374
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,306
It was so tricky.

1375
00:44:29,307 --> 00:44:31,516
I was so confident in this game. I can't believe I lost.

1376
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:32,517
(He keeps apologizing.)

1377
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:34,947
- Also...
- Gosh, I'm sweating.

1378
00:44:35,517 --> 00:44:38,156
Let's get out of here now.

1379
00:44:38,157 --> 00:44:40,026
- Do you have any...
- Shouldn't we ask them?

1380
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:42,126
- Should we? Let's ask them.
- That's not a bad idea.

1381
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:43,797
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

1382
00:44:44,997 --> 00:44:47,227
Do you have any lunch recommendations?

1383
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:50,497
Lunch recommendations? Among the places nearby?

1384
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:52,137
- Yes, please.
- There's a place...

1385
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:55,036
that only sells yukhoe over rice and eggplant over rice.

1386
00:44:55,037 --> 00:44:56,976
- Eggplant over rice?
- That sounds good.

1387
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:58,013
- That sounds tasty.
- Yes.

1388
00:44:58,037 --> 00:44:59,606
- Eggplant over rice for lunch.
- I like that.

1389
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:01,046
- How does that sound?
- I like it.

1390
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,406
- Eggplant over rice. Let's go.
- Okay.

1391
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,776
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

1392
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:05,847
Goodbye.

1393
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:07,886
- Once again, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

1394
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:08,887
Truly.

1395
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:11,516
- I've never felt this bad before.
- I'll enjoy your song.

1396
00:45:11,517 --> 00:45:12,887
My song? Thank you.

1397
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:16,256
- We'll get going, then. Eggplants.
- Bye.

1398
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:18,127
- Bye!
- Enjoy your lunch!

1399
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:22,067
The memory lingers, doesn't it?

1400
00:45:22,697 --> 00:45:24,866
- I keep seeing the afterimage.
- That happens.

1401
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:26,766
Can you imagine how I feel?

1402
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:27,806
Right.

1403
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:29,506
You must be tormented.

1404
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:30,606
Imagine my afterimage.

1405
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:31,876
- It remains.
- It's horrible to imagine.

1406
00:45:31,877 --> 00:45:33,276
It's absolutely horrible.

1407
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,277
- The memory still lingers.
- It's so horrible.

1408
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:38,376
The last time I was here, I was able to enjoy the food...

1409
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:40,347
because it was after we succeeded in the mission.

1410
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:41,717
Okay.

1411
00:45:41,787 --> 00:45:43,286
It is that place.

1412
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,816
That's Sinchon Station down there.

1413
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:46,826
This is where the nightclub was back in the day.

1414
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,326
- That's right.
- Right here?

1415
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:49,357
This was it.

1416
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:50,526
That was here?

1417
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:51,527
(It turned out to be a nostalgic place?)

1418
00:45:51,528 --> 00:45:54,297
- I remember this place!
- There was a nightclub here.

1419
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,996
A nightclub was here by the subway station?

1420
00:45:56,997 --> 00:45:58,297
There were so many nightclubs.

1421
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:01,737
There was a club called Under the Umbrella there.

1422
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,707
- What?
- Under the Umbrella.

1423
00:46:03,877 --> 00:46:05,706
- That's the name of the club?
- Under the Umbrella.

1424
00:46:05,707 --> 00:46:07,046
Yes. A lot of college students went there.

1425
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:09,176
The name gives off such an 80s vibe.

1426
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:10,657
- It does.
- Yes. Under the Umbrella.

1427
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:13,547
I should forget.

1428
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:15,463
This is Sinchon Station. That's Ewha Womans University.

1429
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:18,457
This Sinchon area was so crowded back then.

1430
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:20,156
It was jam-packed with people.

1431
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:21,586
Everyone came to this area to buy clothes.

1432
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:22,857
This street was so crowded.

1433
00:46:23,457 --> 00:46:25,156
That's when they built all these buildings.

1434
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,226
Right.

1435
00:46:26,227 --> 00:46:28,466
- So, the whole area changed.
- These turned into housings.

1436
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:29,566
Mostly studio apartments.

1437
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,467
- Yes, studio apartments.
- This used to be...

1438
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:33,667
Wait. There was also a nightclub here.

1439
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:35,007
It was called Colosseum.

1440
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:36,476
Was going to nightclubs all you did?

1441
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:38,736
- He can't stop talking about it.
- I think this was...

1442
00:46:38,737 --> 00:46:40,577
- where Colosseum was.
- Turn left.

1443
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:44,347
I got my ear pierced in this area about 30 years ago.

1444
00:46:46,117 --> 00:46:47,916
- For five dollars. My left ear.
- Five dollars?

1445
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:50,457
- It's still pierced!
- Yes, the mark is still there.

1446
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:52,316
You have your ears covered nowadays.

1447
00:46:52,317 --> 00:46:53,356
Really?

1448
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:54,587
I cover my ears now.

1449
00:46:55,457 --> 00:46:57,756
My mom still lives in that apartment complex.

1450
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,927
- Really?
- Right now?

1451
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:01,566
The complex next to Ewha Womans University.

1452
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,266
That brings back such old memories.

1453
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:04,437
Yes, the nostalgic apartment.

1454
00:47:04,737 --> 00:47:06,406
- This is it.
- Here it is.

1455
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,866
- "Momiji."
- I see.

1456
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,807
It looks like a popular restaurant.

1457
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:11,676
- They open at 11am.
- Hello.

1458
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:13,776
- May we eat quietly here?
- Sure.

1459
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:15,107
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1460
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:18,017
- Eggplant over rice?
- Beef and eggplant over rice.

1461
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:19,377
I want that too.

1462
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:21,686
- That sounds delicious.
- Three bowls?

1463
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:23,516
I'll eat the yukhoe over rice, then.

1464
00:47:23,517 --> 00:47:24,717
- Yukhoe.
- Yukhoe.

1465
00:47:25,257 --> 00:47:26,856
- Beef brisket kalguksu.
- One of these?

1466
00:47:26,857 --> 00:47:29,357
- Yes.
- All right. That's perfect.

1467
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:30,527
All done.

1468
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:32,856
Before we pay for it,

1469
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:34,596
- we have to decide...
- Let's play a game.

1470
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,297
- with a simple game.
- How about a game?

1471
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,537
I'm fine with paying.

1472
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,136
- No.
- No.

1473
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:41,006
Just live with that guilt your entire life.

1474
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:42,037
Does it spin?

1475
00:47:42,837 --> 00:47:44,537
Isn't that too harsh?

1476
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,706
- Just live with the guilt.
- I do have a game in mind.

1477
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:48,707
- What is it?
- I've never played it, though.

1478
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:49,716
- Okay.
- What is it?

1479
00:47:49,717 --> 00:47:50,916
- Place a chopstick on your finger.
- Okay.

1480
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:52,397
It's like a one-legged chicken fight.

1481
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:54,046
- You bump them.
- Do we bump them?

1482
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:56,317
- You bump them.
- Two will play, and if it falls...

1483
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,486
- All right.
- Let's do a tournament.

1484
00:47:58,487 --> 00:47:59,926
- Okay.
- Let's pair up.

1485
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:01,026
- You 2 go 1st.
- They'll go 1st.

1486
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:02,256
It's me against Jin Hee.

1487
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:03,697
It could fall when you attack.

1488
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,197
(Jae Suk attacks first.)

1489
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,036
- What was that?
- What?

1490
00:48:11,037 --> 00:48:12,496
- He lost.
- Why make this so not fun?

1491
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:15,437
- What do you mean?
- You made this really boring.

1492
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:16,677
I won.

1493
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:19,137
- Unexpectedly...
- He's not good at games.

1494
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,147
Ready, go.

1495
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:23,277
He'll win easily.

1496
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:24,847
(1st attack)

1497
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:26,447
(2nd attack)

1498
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:28,647
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1499
00:48:29,817 --> 00:48:31,916
- Gosh, he's good.
- He's good.

1500
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:32,987
Gosh, Yeon Seok.

1501
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,827
- He's good.
- Is it better to hit it from below?

1502
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:37,667
(Yeon Seok attacks from below.)

1503
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:39,967
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

1504
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,266
- Okay.
- All right.

1505
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:42,466
- He's good.
- Why are you so good at this?

1506
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,097
(Excited)

1507
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:45,536
You two should go now.

1508
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:47,736
You two will play the final match. The loser will pay for lunch.

1509
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:49,007
- The loser pays.
- Okay.

1510
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:50,577
- Should I go?
- Ready, go.

1511
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:54,177
Didn't your finger touch it?

1512
00:48:54,277 --> 00:48:55,407
No, it didn't.

1513
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:03,147
They're checking on each other. They're doing it well.

1514
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:05,587
(Seok Jin attacks first.)

1515
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:10,157
(Shaking)

1516
00:49:16,027 --> 00:49:17,507
(It bumped into Jae Suk's chopstick.)

1517
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,267
Why were you there?

1518
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,747
- Why are you looking at him?
- I stayed still.

1519
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,037
- Why were you...
- My gosh.

1520
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:26,446
- It's like Jae Suk tripped his leg.
- Why were you there?

1521
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:28,946
- You were like this.
- You should pay it now.

1522
00:49:28,947 --> 00:49:30,016
- I'll pay for it.
- Three.

1523
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:31,077
That's more comfortable.

1524
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:33,217
Done?

1525
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:34,886
- Gosh. Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1526
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:36,616
- No, it's okay.
- Thank you for the food.

1527
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:38,056
- No, don't mention it.
- Thank you.

1528
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:39,557
- Gosh.
- All right.

1529
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,726
- I like this.
- Seriously.

1530
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:43,156
- Do you want an apron?
- It's because of that.

1531
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:44,396
- Aprons?
- Thank you.

1532
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:46,003
- Thank you.
- I'll regret it if I don't wear it.

1533
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:47,097
I should wear it.

1534
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:49,187
- It's here.
- You can put it in the middle.

1535
00:49:49,997 --> 00:49:51,897
- Gosh, this is nice.
- It looks so good.

1536
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,437
- My goodness.
- It looks so tasty.

1537
00:49:55,737 --> 00:49:57,037
- It's amazing.
- My gosh.

1538
00:49:57,307 --> 00:49:59,506
I see why the guest recommended this place.

1539
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:02,177
They cooked it directly. I can smell the smoke from it.

1540
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:04,247
It smells amazing.

1541
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:06,947
Gosh. Look at the beef on it.

1542
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:08,287
(Exclaiming)

1543
00:50:08,288 --> 00:50:09,347
Goodness.

1544
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:11,017
It's good, right?

1545
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,657
It's good. Isn't it good?

1546
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:17,357
It looks so good.

1547
00:50:18,027 --> 00:50:19,456
(Exclaiming)

1548
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:20,467
(Glancing)

1549
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,887
Gosh, this place is amazing.

1550
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:23,536
It's tasty.

1551
00:50:23,537 --> 00:50:25,067
Gosh. I love it.

1552
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:26,737
- What is that?
- Yeon Seok.

1553
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:28,136
- It's so good.
- Thank you, Yeon Seok.

1554
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:29,206
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

1555
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:30,376
You didn't have to bring them for us.

1556
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:32,376
If you weren't here, I would've had to do it. So do it for me.

1557
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:33,407
Thank you.

1558
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:35,376
- I...
- Seok Jin is the type...

1559
00:50:35,377 --> 00:50:36,617
not to do anything too.

1560
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:39,946
Gosh, it looks so tasty.

1561
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:41,386
(Yeon Seok's yukhoe over rice is ready.)

1562
00:50:41,387 --> 00:50:42,417
Yes.

1563
00:50:44,787 --> 00:50:45,857
It smells so good.

1564
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,127
(Exclaiming)

1565
00:50:48,857 --> 00:50:51,257
(Jae Suk slurps the kalguksu too.)

1566
00:50:52,797 --> 00:50:54,966
- This is a nice place.
- It's so tasty.

1567
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:55,996
It's so good.

1568
00:50:55,997 --> 00:50:57,596
I'm glad that we asked for a recommendation.

1569
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,037
I think I could come here every day.

1570
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:01,237
It's so good.

1571
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:04,337
This place is leading the trend in everything.

1572
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:07,077
There are so many tables for one person.

1573
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:09,917
You can pay it with your card without caring about others.

1574
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:11,776
- Right.
- It's comfortable to be here.

1575
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,687
You know what? Back in the day,

1576
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:16,117
in the 1990s and 2000s,

1577
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:17,556
eating alone was something...

1578
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:19,193
- we could never imagine.
- We couldn't even imagine it.

1579
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:20,226
Right.

1580
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:22,686
- People grill meat alone now.
- Yes.

1581
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:24,856
Actually, I used to go to a restaurant and have meat alone.

1582
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:25,896
- At a restaurant?
- Even in the past?

1583
00:51:25,897 --> 00:51:26,926
Yes. Because I really love meat.

1584
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:27,966
Even in the past?

1585
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:29,166
People gave me a weird look.

1586
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:30,967
Of course. Eating meat alone is...

1587
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,366
They have grills...

1588
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,636
- for each person now.
- That's right.

1589
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:34,806
There are places like that.

1590
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:37,088
- There are so many places.
- So it feels so comfortable.

1591
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:38,336
I like it now.

1592
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:41,246
Some people like to travel alone.

1593
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:43,006
Because if you go on a trip with others,

1594
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,917
- you need to care for them.
- Right.

1595
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:47,047
- Have you traveled by yourself?
- Yes.

1596
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:48,616
- I loved it on the first day.
- Really?

1597
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:49,957
I was free, and it was nice.

1598
00:51:50,957 --> 00:51:52,117
But I got bored.

1599
00:51:52,217 --> 00:51:53,986
Who you go on a trip with is important too.

1600
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,357
- I can't go by myself.
- So...

1601
00:51:55,957 --> 00:51:58,556
I came back earlier than planned.

1602
00:51:58,557 --> 00:51:59,557
I came back earlier.

1603
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:02,127
These days, people go alone,

1604
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:04,737
- stay at a guesthouse, - Right.

1605
00:52:05,637 --> 00:52:07,606
- and make friends there.
- They make friends.

1606
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:09,047
- That's what they do, right?
- Yes.

1607
00:52:09,537 --> 00:52:11,906
I used to travel abroad like that when I was in my 20s.

1608
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:13,276
- I stayed at guesthouses.
- You did?

1609
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:14,376
(He's amazing.)

1610
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:16,546
If you go abroad, you somehow do it in the end.

1611
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:18,267
- Even if you can't speak English.
- Right.

1612
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:21,616
Thirty years ago, I visited the wonders of the world.

1613
00:52:21,617 --> 00:52:22,686
- You did?
- Yes.

1614
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:23,887
- The seven wonders?
- Right.

1615
00:52:24,617 --> 00:52:26,987
It was in 1997 or 1995.

1616
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:28,386
- You did?
- Yes.

1617
00:52:28,387 --> 00:52:29,926
I was a designer, and I was the youngest at work.

1618
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:32,226
We were making a brochure. It was for the company.

1619
00:52:32,227 --> 00:52:34,366
It was the process of making a brochure.

1620
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,866
We took pictures.

1621
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:38,167
We were going there to take a picture of the pyramid.

1622
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:40,637
- For just one picture.
- A week for each country.

1623
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,866
You were taking pictures of the seven wonders.

1624
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,036
So we went to the pyramids.

1625
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,976
- Next, we went to Mexico.
- That's so nice.

1626
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:47,946
- To see the Mayan Civilization.
- You went to Mexico from there?

1627
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,746
- After that...
- The Mayan Civilization?

1628
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:51,517
We went to see Stonehenge in England.

1629
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:54,246
Next was Easter Island. We traveled like this.

1630
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:55,407
We went to Easter Island too.

1631
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:58,417
- The statue with the big head?
- Yes. That's the Moai statue.

1632
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:01,556
The most mysterious one was the pyramids.

1633
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:02,803
- The pyramids.
- I've seen them with my own eyes.

1634
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:04,456
How did they move the stones and build that?

1635
00:53:04,457 --> 00:53:06,056
Think of the pictures that people took in front of them.

1636
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,067
It's just unbelievable.

1637
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:09,327
"Let's go to the East Sea."

1638
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:11,543
I said, "The East Sea?" He said, "Yes. The East Sea."

1639
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,066
- The AI does it now.
- AI can do that?

1640
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:14,166
- AI does everything?
- The AI does it.

1641
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,836
- So it's the AI.
- These days,

1642
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:18,053
it's hard for the rookies to become known to the public.

1643
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:19,807
You know, the lovebugs are causing trouble.

1644
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:21,306
The TV ratings are really low these days.

1645
00:53:21,307 --> 00:53:22,623
- It's really low.
- Right. It's low.

1646
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,693
Like Yeon Seok said, they go beyond four times the speed.

1647
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,637
I guess people watch it at four times the speed.

1648
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,016
- That's what they do.
- That's so funny.

1649
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:31,186
- Shall we go to another place?
- Shall we?

1650
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:32,587
- Shall we go?
- We should leave.

1651
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:33,756
It's comfortable since...

1652
00:53:33,757 --> 00:53:35,237
- we've already paid for it.
- Right.

1653
00:53:35,357 --> 00:53:36,386
How can there be a cafe here,

1654
00:53:36,387 --> 00:53:38,226
- in the corner?
- This place is so nice.

1655
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:39,356
- I like it.
- Me too.

1656
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:40,626
So this is what's disappearing.

1657
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:42,696
There were so many nice places in the Ewha Womans University area.

1658
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:44,057
But there are not many places now.

1659
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:45,966
I did...

1660
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:48,013
For the first and the last time, I worked part-time here.

1661
00:53:48,037 --> 00:53:49,137
At a cafe as a server.

1662
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:51,007
- You did?
- You must've been so popular.

1663
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:52,707
No. I don't think so.

1664
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:55,346
You could've just said yes. Why would you correct it?

1665
00:53:55,347 --> 00:53:56,446
That is...

1666
00:53:56,447 --> 00:53:58,176
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1667
00:53:58,177 --> 00:53:59,846
- Thank you.
- This must be the Americano.

1668
00:53:59,847 --> 00:54:01,886
- Thank you, Jin Hee.
- This is nice.

1669
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:03,187
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1670
00:54:03,557 --> 00:54:05,416
Jin Hee, you like sweets too much.

1671
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:07,086
- You're amazing.
- Sweet is delicious. Isn't it?

1672
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:08,357
- It is.
- It's tasty.

1673
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:10,456
Gosh. It's tasty.

1674
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:12,226
(Savoring)

1675
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:13,326
Is the brownie tasty?

1676
00:54:13,327 --> 00:54:15,496
Jin Hee, did you quit smoking?

1677
00:54:15,497 --> 00:54:17,696
- No. I've never smoked.
- You never smoked?

1678
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:19,597
- You've never smoked?
- No.

1679
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:20,966
You shouldn't smoke...

1680
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:22,366
- in the first place.
- You shouldn't start.

1681
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:23,436
You shouldn't start from the beginning.

1682
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:26,036
But when we were young, when we were teens...

1683
00:54:26,037 --> 00:54:28,747
- There was Chow Yun Fat.
- He was amazing.

1684
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:30,446
- Many smoked because of him.
- People like him...

1685
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,117
- There was Andy Lau too.
- Right.

1686
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:34,947
Back then, we could smoke on an airplane too.

1687
00:54:35,587 --> 00:54:36,617
Right.

1688
00:54:37,117 --> 00:54:38,416
- On the bus too.
- Yes.

1689
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:41,126
- When I was in elementary school, - It was in the back.

1690
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:42,926
- people smoked on the bus.
- We could smoke in all the seats?

1691
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:44,056
That's right.

1692
00:54:44,057 --> 00:54:45,356
Even at theaters.

1693
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:47,466
When I was a high school student, people would smoke at theaters.

1694
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:49,066
If you think about it, that's just nonsense.

1695
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,067
In old planes,

1696
00:54:50,068 --> 00:54:51,637
- there are ashtrays.
- They had them.

1697
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:53,507
It was a barbaric period.

1698
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:55,306
If you think about it now, it was barbaric.

1699
00:54:55,307 --> 00:54:56,906
That's right. So barbaric.

1700
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:58,876
It was a barbaric period if we look back now.

1701
00:54:58,877 --> 00:55:01,676
In every alley, there were bullies robbing us.

1702
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:03,277
- Right.
- In every alley.

1703
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:05,346
- Goodness.
- You were never robbed, right?

1704
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:06,816
- Of course, I was.
- You were?

1705
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:08,747
They were alleys about this size.

1706
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,847
- Yes.
- Right.

1707
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,656
- It's an alley like this.
- "Hey. Come here."

1708
00:55:11,657 --> 00:55:13,056
- They were shortcuts.
- The bullies would hang out...

1709
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:14,286
at places like that.

1710
00:55:14,287 --> 00:55:16,256
- If we come from that way...
- They'd sit between the buildings.

1711
00:55:16,257 --> 00:55:17,756
They were hiding, and when we passed by,

1712
00:55:17,757 --> 00:55:19,056
they called us. "Hey, you."

1713
00:55:19,057 --> 00:55:20,827
- Then we startle like this.
- Right.

1714
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,697
This was the rule between my friends.

1715
00:55:23,197 --> 00:55:26,137
"When someone calls you,"

1716
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:28,157
- "run without looking back."
- "Run away."

1717
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:30,336
- Then they won't bother.
- "They won't bother following you."

1718
00:55:30,337 --> 00:55:31,657
- But that doesn't work.
- Right.

1719
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:34,676
In my case, I had Nike shoes that I really wanted.

1720
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:36,437
My mom got it for me, but I had that robbed.

1721
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:39,246
- I had PRO-SPECS shoes.
- My Nikes were robbed.

1722
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:40,727
- They took my socks too.
- It was...

1723
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:42,046
They gave me...

1724
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,516
- smelly shoes instead.
- The slippers.

1725
00:55:43,517 --> 00:55:44,686
All of us were robbed.

1726
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:45,916
It was a barbaric time.

1727
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,686
- They'd give you slippers.
- Right.

1728
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:48,927
This one time...

1729
00:55:49,427 --> 00:55:51,096
Were you ever taken by a motorcycle?

1730
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,327
I was once taken by it.

1731
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:55,426
- He told me to get on it.
- One with a high seat?

1732
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:56,666
Yes. He told me to hold on tight.

1733
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,066
Why would you hold on, even if he asked you to?

1734
00:55:58,067 --> 00:55:59,996
He told me to hold on because I might fall.

1735
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:01,066
He told me to hold him, and I asked where we were going.

1736
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,387
- He was so considerate.
- Right.

1737
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:05,237
- Wasn't he just someone nice?
- No, he wasn't.

1738
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,246
So you followed him and held him like this?

1739
00:56:09,247 --> 00:56:10,916
The bullies of our time...

1740
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:12,917
- It was a romantic period.
- They didn't harm us.

1741
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:16,217
If their goal was the money, they'd just take that only.

1742
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:18,567
They gave me the commuter ticket so I could go home.

1743
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:21,127
Seriously. "Where do you live?"

1744
00:56:21,387 --> 00:56:22,556
"I live in Suyu-ri."

1745
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:23,596
"Take this and take the bus."

1746
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:25,756
Should we say that he had a conscience or what?

1747
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,496
They weren't that bad back in the day.

1748
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:29,143
So Seok Jin, where did you go on the motorcycle?

1749
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,767
We went to one of the bullies' house.

1750
00:56:32,197 --> 00:56:34,166
We went to his home, and there were more people there.

1751
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:35,306
They said, "Hey, you're here. Who's that?"

1752
00:56:35,307 --> 00:56:36,983
- "I just brought him."
- "I just brought him?"

1753
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:38,407
- That's what he said.
- Goodness.

1754
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:39,876
When I think about it...

1755
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:41,753
- Why would you go there?
- When I think about it now,

1756
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:44,216
they were sophomores. I was in grade nine.

1757
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:45,246
They were 1 or 2 years older than me.

1758
00:56:45,247 --> 00:56:46,747
He said, "Stand here."

1759
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,316
Then he kicked me.

1760
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:50,146
(He practiced the back kick on Seok Jin.)

1761
00:56:50,147 --> 00:56:52,387
- Like a sandbag.
- He told me to stand next to him.

1762
00:56:52,657 --> 00:56:53,957
"No. I won't actually hit you."

1763
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:55,857
"Don't be scared. I won't hit you."

1764
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,526
Then he started to practice the back kick.

1765
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:00,567
His foot was going like this in front of my eyes.

1766
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:02,897
But he really didn't hit me.

1767
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:04,736
- He was just threatening you.
- Yes. That's right.

1768
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:06,837
- Why did he take you there?
- I don't know.

1769
00:57:07,637 --> 00:57:09,066
That's all I remember now.

1770
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:10,913
I couldn't say anything because I was too scared.

1771
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:12,606
And during that,

1772
00:57:12,607 --> 00:57:15,207
his mother gave us Korean melons to eat.

1773
00:57:15,577 --> 00:57:16,946
- Don't lie to us.
- No, I'm serious.

1774
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:18,517
- Stop lying.
- We were in the room.

1775
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:19,746
That's nonsense.

1776
00:57:19,747 --> 00:57:22,616
- Wasn't he your friend?
- No, he wasn't.

1777
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:24,516
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious.

1778
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:25,656
Why would I lie?

1779
00:57:25,657 --> 00:57:27,126
What kind of bully is that?

1780
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:28,586
- I mean...
- His mother...

1781
00:57:28,587 --> 00:57:30,026
- Why would she give you melons?
- Really.

1782
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:32,556
He practiced the back kick on me after that.

1783
00:57:32,557 --> 00:57:34,626
- I'd visit his place every day.
- Why was that?

1784
00:57:34,627 --> 00:57:35,796
The mother left,

1785
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:37,437
- and...
- Then he was a good guy.

1786
00:57:37,597 --> 00:57:39,997
Well, I think he wasn't that bad.

1787
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:41,906
So he practiced his kicks.

1788
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:43,837
He told me to eat the Korean melons, so I did.

1789
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:45,136
That doesn't seem bad.

1790
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:46,736
- He didn't take my money.
- He didn't hit you.

1791
00:57:46,737 --> 00:57:47,746
One thing was that...

1792
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,476
- he didn't take me home.
- Didn't he give you the bus fee?

1793
00:57:49,477 --> 00:57:51,317
Why would he take you home?

1794
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:52,746
- But we...
- Why would...

1795
00:57:52,747 --> 00:57:54,446
Why would the bully take you home?

1796
00:57:54,447 --> 00:57:55,846
It took about ten minutes by motorcycle.

1797
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,216
- He didn't take all your money.
- Why did you follow him?

1798
00:57:57,217 --> 00:57:58,217
He didn't take my money.

1799
00:57:58,218 --> 00:57:59,916
- Really?
- Then why did he take you there?

1800
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,257
- I don't know.
- Goodness.

1801
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:02,856
Maybe he was bored.

1802
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:04,326
- He told me to get on it.
- Why would you...

1803
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:05,856
- What do you mean, he was bored?
- He told me to get on it.

1804
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,943
I was scared. I didn't want to get in trouble, so I got on it.

1805
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:09,366
He told me to hold tight, so I did.

1806
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:11,866
When he was in the Navy Promotion Unit,

1807
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,266
his nickname was the Dancing Bear.

1808
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,507
- Dancing Bear?
- Dancing Bear.

1809
00:58:14,737 --> 00:58:16,266
- So...
- I'm an awful dancer.

1810
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:17,953
- But you had to dance?
- "Hey, Dancing Bear."

1811
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:22,006
Then I would go, "Yes, sir. Private Dancing Bear."

1812
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:23,047
(Dancing)

1813
00:58:23,477 --> 00:58:24,717
- I had to do this.
- Goodness.

1814
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:26,646
- Like dealing cards?
- So...

1815
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:29,447
- I said, "Private Dancing Bear."
- So his senior soldier would go,

1816
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:31,656
"Hey, Dancing Bear," whenever he was bored.

1817
00:58:31,657 --> 00:58:32,856
"Yes, sir. Private Dancing Bear."

1818
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:33,857
(Dancing)

1819
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:35,056
(Shaking his hips)

1820
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:36,586
I would do this all the time.

1821
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,097
Let's say I was wiping something.

1822
00:58:38,457 --> 00:58:40,496
- That's not a fancy dance, though.
- I really hated it.

1823
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:42,666
- No, it's not.
- But it hurt his pride.

1824
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,266
- He had to keep on doing this.
- I had to keep dancing.

1825
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:46,096
(The sad Dancing Bear kept on dancing until he was discharged.)

1826
00:58:46,097 --> 00:58:47,206
- Goodness.
- So I remember that.

1827
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:48,636
- By the way, - There were many things like that.

1828
00:58:48,637 --> 00:58:49,637
What's lucky for us is that...

1829
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:52,976
all of us were the ones who were robbed by the bullies.

1830
00:58:52,977 --> 00:58:53,977
That's why we are...

1831
00:58:53,978 --> 00:58:55,023
- still in this business.
- Of course.

1832
00:58:55,047 --> 00:58:57,076
- If we had taken from others...
- Get it?

1833
00:58:57,077 --> 00:58:58,776
- If we had taken from others, - You're right.

1834
00:58:58,777 --> 00:59:00,316
- we wouldn't be here.
- We can't be here.

1835
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:02,686
What a relief that all of us were the ones who were robbed.

1836
00:59:02,687 --> 00:59:04,617
- I was robbed a lot.
- That's a relief.

1837
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:06,186
- We should go now.
- Let's take the bus.

1838
00:59:06,187 --> 00:59:07,457
- Is it time to go?
- I see.

1839
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,156
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye.

1840
00:59:09,157 --> 00:59:11,196
Lunch and the cafe were both so nice.

1841
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:12,997
- That's right.
- Even the drinks were great.

1842
00:59:13,257 --> 00:59:14,726
You know what happens if you fail this time, right?

1843
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:16,227
- I know.
- Dancing Bear.

1844
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,637
Yes! Private Dancing Bear.

1845
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:22,337
I've been doing this all my life.

1846
00:59:23,237 --> 00:59:24,576
Let's go by bus.

1847
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:25,836
Let's take the bus.

1848
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:26,877
Which bus is it?

1849
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,346
It's from Kim Do Young and Kim Seo Yeon.

1850
00:59:29,347 --> 00:59:31,447
"Hola! Hello."

1851
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,093
- She said "Hola," so...
- Is the guest from France?

1852
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:35,487
- Jose.
- "Joe, Jose, and Kim Do Young."

1853
00:59:35,587 --> 00:59:38,116
"I have three names."

1854
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:41,656
"I got this special skill with my thick arms,"

1855
00:59:41,657 --> 00:59:45,057
"and I'm luring the customers at Ahyeon Market."

1856
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:49,626
"Please visit my place that shows my identity."

1857
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,666
He speaks in English...

1858
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,296
- and other languages.
- "Hola."

1859
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,597
"Hola. Hello."

1860
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:56,766
If we get off at Ahyeon Station, the market is just there.

1861
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,077
- Ahyeon Market?
- I see.

1862
00:59:58,537 --> 01:00:00,276
We're going back the route we took earlier but backwards.

1863
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:01,347
Yes.

1864
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:04,417
I used to take the bus a lot in the past.

1865
01:00:04,747 --> 01:00:05,776
It's Wedding Town.

1866
01:00:05,777 --> 01:00:07,587
You see those stairs over there?

1867
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:09,587
- Yes.
- Bullies were always sitting there.

1868
01:00:10,047 --> 01:00:12,116
- The third one from the top.
- There?

1869
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:13,356
That's a detailed explanation of this place.

1870
01:00:13,357 --> 01:00:14,926
That was the fastest route to go this way.

1871
01:00:14,927 --> 01:00:16,727
- If not, I had to take a detour.
- Right.

1872
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:18,826
- We need to get off here.
- Let's get off.

1873
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:19,927
Here.

1874
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:22,796
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1875
01:00:22,797 --> 01:00:24,237
(They get off around Ahyeon Market.)

1876
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,696
- Goodness.
- Gosh, this place changed a lot.

1877
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:28,337
So this is what Ahyeon Market looks like.

1878
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:30,306
This place is filled with apartment buildings now.

1879
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:31,606
- What was it in the past?
- What was it?

1880
01:00:31,607 --> 01:00:33,336
- Around here...
- Yes?

1881
01:00:33,337 --> 01:00:35,606
This place was filled with small houses.

1882
01:00:35,607 --> 01:00:36,706
But they all became apartment buildings.

1883
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:38,046
There were hills around here.

1884
01:00:38,047 --> 01:00:39,346
So this is Ahyeon Market.

1885
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:41,646
- There's the market.
- So this is Ahyeon Market.

1886
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:43,586
- It became so clean.
- Right.

1887
01:00:43,587 --> 01:00:45,516
In the past, the roof was made with plastic,

1888
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:46,656
and the center was open.

1889
01:00:46,657 --> 01:00:48,426
So on a rainy day, it rained in the middle.

1890
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:49,427
I see.

1891
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:50,896
So this market existed even when you were a kid?

1892
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,926
Of course.

1893
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:55,027
There was a famous pancake place that I really enjoyed.

1894
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:58,197
- He's the Son of Ahyeon.
- That's right.

1895
01:00:58,297 --> 01:01:00,297
- It's this building.
- He remembers it perfectly.

1896
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,066
- Hold on.
- Is it here?

1897
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:03,736
- What is it?
- Maybe it's here.

1898
01:01:03,737 --> 01:01:05,406
- Do Young and Seo Yeon?
- Look here.

1899
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,053
- I think this is the right place.
- Is that Do Young and Seo Yeon?

1900
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,106
It seems so.

1901
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:09,876
Excuse me, but are you Do Young and Seo Yeon?

1902
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:11,946
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

1903
01:01:11,947 --> 01:01:13,517
- Goodness.
- Hello.

1904
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,216
(Kim Do Young and Kim Seo Yeon, the second Whenever Guests)

1905
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,846
- Are you a couple?
- Hello.

1906
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:18,616
There's something that looks like a mill.

1907
01:01:18,617 --> 01:01:20,016
- Traditional drinks.
- What is it?

1908
01:01:20,017 --> 01:01:21,226
(In an alley in Ahyeon Market)

1909
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:23,126
It feels like I'm at a trendy place.

1910
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:24,726
- That's how it feels.
- Right.

1911
01:01:24,727 --> 01:01:27,626
This place feels like a cafe, but it is not a cafe.

1912
01:01:27,627 --> 01:01:29,296
- That's right.
- So what do you do here?

1913
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:30,736
This is a small brewery.

1914
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:32,396
- So you make drinks here?
- Yes.

1915
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,106
- People at the market enjoy it.
- That's amazing.

1916
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:37,476
When did the two of you start the business here?

1917
01:01:37,477 --> 01:01:39,306
It's been about two and a half years...

1918
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:40,976
- since we came here.
- I see.

1919
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:43,346
But it's been about 17 years since I started making...

1920
01:01:43,347 --> 01:01:44,946
traditional drinks as a hobby.

1921
01:01:44,947 --> 01:01:46,616
- And you're working with your wife?
- That's amazing.

1922
01:01:46,617 --> 01:01:50,186
No. She started helping out after we got married.

1923
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:51,586
I see. So she wasn't at first.

1924
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:53,686
I'm helping out a lot.

1925
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:55,026
(She's so reliable.)

1926
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:58,696
By the way, you said you had many names, Do Young.

1927
01:01:58,697 --> 01:02:01,397
Oh, right. I grew up in South America.

1928
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,026
I was an overseas Korean.

1929
01:02:03,027 --> 01:02:04,266
- That's why...
- So that's why your names were...

1930
01:02:04,267 --> 01:02:05,396
Yes. It's Jose.

1931
01:02:05,397 --> 01:02:06,696
Which country were you in?

1932
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:08,506
- I grew up in Ecuador.
- Ecuador?

1933
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:09,807
- Yes.
- Ecuador.

1934
01:02:09,837 --> 01:02:11,036
Were you born in Ecuador?

1935
01:02:11,037 --> 01:02:12,736
No. I was born in Korea.

1936
01:02:12,737 --> 01:02:15,346
My parents emigrated to Ecuador when I was one year old.

1937
01:02:15,347 --> 01:02:16,406
- To Ecuador?
- I see.

1938
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:19,376
I came to Korea for the 1st time when I was 25.

1939
01:02:19,377 --> 01:02:21,846
So you lived in Ecuador for 25 years?

1940
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:23,986
Yes. For about 18 years.

1941
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:26,067
- I lived in the US too.
- You speak Korean so well.

1942
01:02:26,387 --> 01:02:27,726
No. She's helping me a lot.

1943
01:02:27,727 --> 01:02:29,256
(His wife is a reliable Korean teacher.)

1944
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:31,197
- You speak Spanish fluently, right?
- Yes.

1945
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,296
- Yes.
- He said it in Spanish.

1946
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:35,697
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

1947
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:38,166
- Amigo.
- Yes, amigo.

1948
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,966
(They say everything they know in Spanish.)

1949
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:42,006
- I could...
- He has a different vibe.

1950
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:43,606
- He has that vibe.
- Right.

1951
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:45,076
(Extraordinary Latin vibes)

1952
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,476
- Then how did you...
- Traditional drinks...

1953
01:02:46,477 --> 01:02:47,776
How did you start making traditional drinks...

1954
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:49,246
- when you lived in Ecuador?
- Right. How did you start?

1955
01:02:49,247 --> 01:02:51,216
Well, when I came to Korea,

1956
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:53,846
I found the Korean traditional drinks so fun, and I liked them.

1957
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,446
When you make the drinks,

1958
01:02:55,447 --> 01:02:58,116
you make them using your hands. It was fascinating.

1959
01:02:58,117 --> 01:02:59,917
That's how I fell for the traditional drinks.

1960
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:03,056
I had a small class in the beginning.

1961
01:03:03,057 --> 01:03:05,726
Now, at this place, many foreigners come to learn...

1962
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,496
how to make Korean traditional drinks,

1963
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:09,367
- and I teach them.
- I see.

1964
01:03:09,397 --> 01:03:12,267
What made you open this place in Ahyeon Market?

1965
01:03:13,337 --> 01:03:15,807
My landlady is my mother-in-law.

1966
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:17,206
It's your mother-in-law?

1967
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:19,707
The owner of this building is my mother.

1968
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:22,846
- My goodness.
- That's good to hear.

1969
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:24,493
- No need to worry about the rent.
- So I'm helping him.

1970
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:26,916
- She said she was helping out.
- I see.

1971
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:28,816
- It meant this.
- That's why she said that.

1972
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:30,656
- My gosh.
- Then,

1973
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:33,586
did your mother-in-law run a business here?

1974
01:03:33,587 --> 01:03:35,086
- My grandmother did.
- Your grandmother?

1975
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:37,126
- You've been here for generations.
- That's right.

1976
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:38,773
- We're about to take root.
- Back then...

1977
01:03:38,797 --> 01:03:40,626
Back then, it wasn't a bar.

1978
01:03:40,627 --> 01:03:42,826
- Remember the donut place?
- Right?

1979
01:03:42,827 --> 01:03:44,236
- The old donuts?
- Yes.

1980
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,996
My grandfather used to run a donut place.

1981
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:48,006
- He used to run that.
- Yes.

1982
01:03:48,007 --> 01:03:49,606
How did you two meet?

1983
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:51,176
- I lived abroad as well.
- You lived abroad too?

1984
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:53,406
I came back to Korea in the COVID-19 period.

1985
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:55,746
I wanted to learn new languages,

1986
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:58,547
and I looked for a friend and met him.

1987
01:03:59,347 --> 01:04:00,376
(They met to study languages, and they got married after 4 years.)

1988
01:04:00,377 --> 01:04:02,246
- You two are adorable.
- So adorable.

1989
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:04,916
- Your husband is so cute.
- I know.

1990
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:06,157
(The Cute Couple)

1991
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:08,786
You like alcohol, right?

1992
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,656
Yes. I do like to drink.

1993
01:04:10,657 --> 01:04:11,926
- You like wine.
- How did you know?

1994
01:04:11,927 --> 01:04:13,226
- Yes. I like wine.
- The drinks...

1995
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:14,466
- Here...
- Wine...

1996
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:15,526
I should get you some drinks.

1997
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:16,826
Could we taste them a little?

1998
01:04:16,827 --> 01:04:18,496
- Of course.
- If that's possible.

1999
01:04:18,497 --> 01:04:19,736
- You made them here, right?
- Right.

2000
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:21,083
- He made them here.
- I made them here.

2001
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,036
- Yeon Shik likes to drink.
- Yes, I love it.

2002
01:04:23,037 --> 01:04:24,876
- You like to drink, right?
- Yes, I do.

2003
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:26,206
- So he made them here.
- Goodness.

2004
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:27,746
I really love makgeolli.

2005
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:29,307
- You like makgeolli?
- I love it.

2006
01:04:29,477 --> 01:04:30,546
Seriously.

2007
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:33,067
- Seok Jin and I don't drink a lot.
- We can't hold our liquor.

2008
01:04:33,147 --> 01:04:34,546
- You can just taste it.
- Okay.

2009
01:04:34,547 --> 01:04:35,716
- Thank you.
- What flavor is this?

2010
01:04:35,717 --> 01:04:37,146
- You don't have to give me much.
- What about this?

2011
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:39,186
People get closer after having drinks together.

2012
01:04:39,187 --> 01:04:41,187
I think we'll become close, Mr. Jose.

2013
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:43,057
Gosh, the smell of this makgeolli is good.

2014
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:45,196
I don't know much about drinks,

2015
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:46,273
- but the smell is...
- This is...

2016
01:04:46,297 --> 01:04:48,066
- so nice.
- Is this...

2017
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:50,196
This is thick. I like it.

2018
01:04:50,197 --> 01:04:51,773
- You must be so happy.
- You don't drink?

2019
01:04:51,797 --> 01:04:53,936
Your mother-in-law is the landlady.

2020
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:55,036
(For the mother-in-law)

2021
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:56,436
- Congratulations.
- Amigo.

2022
01:04:56,437 --> 01:04:57,576
- Amigo.
- Amigo.

2023
01:04:57,577 --> 01:04:59,776
- Gracias.
- Amigo.

2024
01:04:59,777 --> 01:05:01,546
- Salud.
- Salud.

2025
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:03,107
- Salud.
- Salud.

2026
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:04,516
It means that it's made with rice embryos.

2027
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:06,176
- With rice embryos?
- Because it's in it.

2028
01:05:06,177 --> 01:05:08,147
- With rice embryos?
- Because it's in it.

2029
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:10,386
This one is a bit...

2030
01:05:10,387 --> 01:05:13,016
- This is sour and sweet.
- It's sweet.

2031
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:15,086
I think that people who don't enjoy drinks that much like me...

2032
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:16,456
would also enjoy this because it's delicious.

2033
01:05:16,457 --> 01:05:17,626
I might get drunk.

2034
01:05:17,627 --> 01:05:19,396
- I'll get drunk right away.
- It's so tasty.

2035
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:21,096
- It's tasty.
- Tasty, right?

2036
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:22,797
Thank you. Come again later.

2037
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:25,207
- I really like this one.
- This is flavorful.

2038
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:27,166
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I like it.

2039
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:28,906
- Dancing Bear!
- Yes!

2040
01:05:28,907 --> 01:05:30,936
(Dancing Bear's performance to thank them.)

2041
01:05:30,937 --> 01:05:32,977
(Dancing)

2042
01:05:33,807 --> 01:05:36,246
- Gosh. I'm not even drunk.
- That was cool.

2043
01:05:36,247 --> 01:05:37,576
- But I feel so happy.
- Seok Jin.

2044
01:05:37,577 --> 01:05:38,716
(Laughing)

2045
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,646
- It's tasty.
- The important thing is this.

2046
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:42,886
We should stop drinking after a glass.

2047
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:44,116
- You can't stop drinking it.
- I know.

2048
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:45,187
Goodness. This is...

2049
01:05:45,657 --> 01:05:47,786
Gosh, you're really enjoying it.

2050
01:05:47,787 --> 01:05:49,226
- This one is so interesting.
- Yes.

2051
01:05:49,227 --> 01:05:51,196
By the way, you said you quit drinking.

2052
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,356
Since you're drinking after a while,

2053
01:05:52,357 --> 01:05:53,656
- you're enjoying it.
- Goodness.

2054
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:54,726
I'm not sure...

2055
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:56,487
- if I should say this, but...
- What is it?

2056
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,866
- I won't.
- No, say it.

2057
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,066
Don't make us curious.

2058
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:01,667
- I can't stand this.
- Say it, Jin Hee.

2059
01:06:02,137 --> 01:06:04,677
One of my favorite drinks is pear blossom wine.

2060
01:06:04,777 --> 01:06:06,106
- I see.
- Does it taste similar?

2061
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:08,076
It's high-proof,

2062
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,706
and it's like jelly.

2063
01:06:09,707 --> 01:06:11,316
- Like sherbet.
- It must be sweet too.

2064
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:13,046
Similar to yogurt.

2065
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:15,246
And this tastes like...

2066
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:16,446
pear blossom wine with more makgeolli.

2067
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,717
- I see.
- So that's what it tastes like.

2068
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:19,986
Can I buy some to take home?

2069
01:06:19,987 --> 01:06:21,156
- Yes.
- Of course.

2070
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:22,826
Didn't you say you quit drinking?

2071
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:25,133
- It's for other people.
- Are you drinking, starting today?

2072
01:06:25,157 --> 01:06:27,796
Didn't he say he quit drinking 6 years ago? Was it 7?

2073
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:30,097
I quit drinking, but I drink on shows.

2074
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:31,266
- I see.
- It's weird, right?

2075
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:33,066
- You should have some more.
- Have some more.

2076
01:06:33,067 --> 01:06:34,206
He should be careful.

2077
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,906
- We need to play the game.
- Have some more.

2078
01:06:35,907 --> 01:06:36,907
This much is okay.

2079
01:06:36,908 --> 01:06:38,937
You'll play the games better after drinking it.

2080
01:06:39,307 --> 01:06:41,276
He can justify this.

2081
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:42,876
- He has a reason to drink.
- That's right.

2082
01:06:42,877 --> 01:06:44,776
What kind of spare time is this?

2083
01:06:44,777 --> 01:06:47,047
It's when we do the dishes.

2084
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:48,847
The time when you do the dishes.

2085
01:06:48,987 --> 01:06:50,216
So you do the dishes in this spare time?

2086
01:06:50,217 --> 01:06:52,217
People book classes here.

2087
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,287
If there's a reservation,

2088
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:54,456
- the class is open.
- It's time for the class.

2089
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:56,526
Or we make our makgeolli...

2090
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:57,856
- and get ready.
- To produce them.

2091
01:06:57,857 --> 01:06:58,996
We do the dishes as well.

2092
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:00,326
- I see.
- Okay.

2093
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:02,496
This time, Seok Sam will throw the dice.

2094
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:04,266
- Please.
- We'll give you a chance...

2095
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:05,267
to make up.

2096
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:06,836
Seok Sam will throw it.

2097
01:07:06,837 --> 01:07:08,137
Let's go, Seok Sam!

2098
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,067
- Dancing Bear.
- Let's go.

2099
01:07:10,607 --> 01:07:11,806
- Dancing Bear.
- Let's go.

2100
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:13,007
- Please.
- Let's go.

2101
01:07:13,637 --> 01:07:15,306
(Please.)

2102
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:16,676
- Please.
- Let's go.

2103
01:07:16,677 --> 01:07:17,877
It's two.

2104
01:07:18,277 --> 01:07:20,776
(1 Bonus Coupon)

2105
01:07:20,777 --> 01:07:22,316
- It's 1.
- It's 1. That's not bad.

2106
01:07:22,317 --> 01:07:23,646
- We at least got 1.
- It's better than 0.

2107
01:07:23,647 --> 01:07:25,157
It's better than zero. Goodness.

2108
01:07:25,287 --> 01:07:26,786
Let's check the prize for the first round.

2109
01:07:26,787 --> 01:07:28,326
- He will check it.
- Okay.

2110
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:29,386
I really want to...

2111
01:07:29,387 --> 01:07:30,827
- give them the prize.
- It's in it.

2112
01:07:31,397 --> 01:07:32,896
"No more public bicycles."

2113
01:07:32,897 --> 01:07:35,366
"I want to ride bicycles with my wife at the Han River."

2114
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:37,267
"A hybrid bicycle."

2115
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:39,166
- "A hybrid bicycle?"
- For the first round?

2116
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:41,466
- Goodness.
- That's expensive.

2117
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:43,066
- Goodness.
- I really want to ride it.

2118
01:07:43,067 --> 01:07:45,506
- I can get you this no matter what.
- I really want to ride it.

2119
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:47,436
- I think we can win this.
- We must get them this.

2120
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:50,346
(Round 1 Prize: Hybrid Bicycle)

2121
01:07:50,347 --> 01:07:51,716
- Let's do well this time.
- Goodness.

2122
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:52,747
It's a nice prize.

2123
01:07:53,077 --> 01:07:55,116
- Let's do this.
- What must we do?

2124
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:57,556
(Makgeolli Blow)

2125
01:07:57,557 --> 01:08:01,086
(Blow the table tennis ball on top of the makgeolli bottles...)

2126
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:03,956
(and score it into the cup.)

2127
01:08:03,957 --> 01:08:05,856
(Round 1, 2 out of 4 successes)

2128
01:08:05,857 --> 01:08:08,096
(Time limit of 20 seconds)

2129
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:10,266
- Each person gets 20 seconds?
- Each person gets 20 seconds?

2130
01:08:10,267 --> 01:08:11,536
It's 20 seconds for all 4 of us?

2131
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:12,996
- It's for all four of us?
- Did you...

2132
01:08:12,997 --> 01:08:14,243
It has to be placed and done right away.

2133
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:15,766
- We blow the ball from here.
- How is it done?

2134
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:17,136
- From here.
- The ball is blown from there?

2135
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:19,377
It can just go across without being bounced.

2136
01:08:21,107 --> 01:08:22,206
- Gosh.
- That didn't work.

2137
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:23,647
It has to be blown harder than that.

2138
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,617
It doesn't look easy.

2139
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:26,946
(Jin Hee practices.)

2140
01:08:26,947 --> 01:08:28,587
- It has to be 2 people?
- In 20 seconds?

2141
01:08:29,547 --> 01:08:30,547
In 20 seconds?

2142
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:32,587
Why are you so good at this?

2143
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:33,617
What's up with me?

2144
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:35,226
- What's up with me?
- You...

2145
01:08:35,227 --> 01:08:36,457
You got it during practice.

2146
01:08:36,587 --> 01:08:37,756
It's Dancing Bear.

2147
01:08:37,757 --> 01:08:38,917
(Dancing Bear practices too.)

2148
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:41,126
(He makes it!)

2149
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:42,796
- Nice one.
- This hard mission...

2150
01:08:42,797 --> 01:08:43,866
was done that easily?

2151
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,413
- This shouldn't be that easy.
- Nice one.

2152
01:08:45,437 --> 01:08:46,767
We should cheer them on.

2153
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:48,537
(Let's go!)

2154
01:08:52,737 --> 01:08:53,936
(With their cheer, they make it 3 times in a row.)

2155
01:08:53,937 --> 01:08:55,076
Why are we so good at this?

2156
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:58,076
But this happened with the ddakji as well.

2157
01:08:58,077 --> 01:09:00,277
- Exactly.
- Round One was done easily.

2158
01:09:00,347 --> 01:09:01,816
- All right.
- Shall we go for it right away?

2159
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:02,886
- Let's do a chant together first.
- This is easier than I thought.

2160
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:04,216
Let's do a chant and give it a try.

2161
01:09:04,217 --> 01:09:05,386
- Gather up.
- Let's do a chant.

2162
01:09:05,387 --> 01:09:06,556
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2163
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:07,587
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2164
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:10,603
- Just 2 people have to make it.
- Just 2 people have to make it.

2165
01:09:10,627 --> 01:09:12,497
- Get ready.
- Get ready.

2166
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:16,127
(Just 2 people have to make it.)

2167
01:09:16,697 --> 01:09:17,767
Set.

2168
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:22,606
- It's the next person's turn.
- I'm done with my turn?

2169
01:09:22,607 --> 01:09:23,866
Leave it there.

2170
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:25,007
- Hey.
- You get one try.

2171
01:09:26,107 --> 01:09:27,847
- He did it!
- It bounced out.

2172
01:09:28,307 --> 01:09:30,006
(The ball bounced out.)

2173
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:31,046
- It bounced out.
- What was that?

2174
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:32,876
- What? Why did it bounce out?
- It bounced out.

2175
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:33,877
You have to make it.

2176
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,387
(First try, Seok Jin)

2177
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:38,016
- Fail.
- We failed?

2178
01:09:38,017 --> 01:09:40,156
- What?
- I thought we got 20 seconds.

2179
01:09:40,157 --> 01:09:41,527
We have to start again.

2180
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:44,796
We thought we could do it over and over within 20 seconds.

2181
01:09:44,797 --> 01:09:46,156
- Right.
- That wasn't it?

2182
01:09:46,157 --> 01:09:47,877
Why are you so bad during the actual round?

2183
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,027
All three of us failed. Why pick on just me?

2184
01:09:50,827 --> 01:09:51,896
- Hey.
- Come on, Seok Jin.

2185
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,657
All three of us failed. Why pick on just me?

2186
01:09:54,837 --> 01:09:56,437
Gosh, this isn't easy.

2187
01:09:56,767 --> 01:09:58,077
- I'll try practicing.
- Right.

2188
01:09:58,137 --> 01:10:00,076
It doesn't make sense if we don't pass Round One.

2189
01:10:00,077 --> 01:10:01,323
(He practices to get the right feel.)

2190
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:03,746
- It should be stronger.
- Blow from lower down.

2191
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:05,077
From lower down. Right.

2192
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:07,917
Right. It should go like that.

2193
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:09,586
- A little bit stronger?
- Right.

2194
01:10:09,587 --> 01:10:10,946
It should face upward.

2195
01:10:10,947 --> 01:10:12,157
- Right.
- Like this?

2196
01:10:12,317 --> 01:10:13,916
- But I think...
- It can't go too high up.

2197
01:10:13,917 --> 01:10:15,156
- Bring it down a little.
- Around that much.

2198
01:10:15,157 --> 01:10:16,157
Lift up your chin.

2199
01:10:17,557 --> 01:10:18,597
Lift up your chin.

2200
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:20,096
(The Kibitzing Train seems to feel urgent.)

2201
01:10:20,097 --> 01:10:21,097
We kept failing.

2202
01:10:21,098 --> 01:10:22,297
I'm sorry.

2203
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:25,437
- I just wanted us to make it.
- He feels sorry.

2204
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:28,836
- This is actually really hard.
- He did it.

2205
01:10:28,837 --> 01:10:30,136
- But...
- We're making it happen...

2206
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:31,476
- once every five tries.
- Right.

2207
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,477
(Blowing)

2208
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,598
We're practicing now, right?

2209
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:35,377
It has to be blown hard.

2210
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:37,776
The time limit makes it harder.

2211
01:10:37,777 --> 01:10:39,146
This is hard.

2212
01:10:39,147 --> 01:10:40,216
(It bounces out.)

2213
01:10:40,217 --> 01:10:42,897
- It's hard to put it into the cup.
- It's harder during the round.

2214
01:10:44,217 --> 01:10:46,057
- It can't be too weak.
- It has to be strong.

2215
01:10:46,857 --> 01:10:52,456
(Focusing on the table tennis ball research with great concentration)

2216
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:53,527
It has to be blown hard.

2217
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:56,327
I know how it's done! I got it!

2218
01:10:57,467 --> 01:10:59,296
(I know how it's done! I got it!)

2219
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,836
- I got it!
- You should go first.

2220
01:11:00,837 --> 01:11:01,837
I got it!

2221
01:11:01,838 --> 01:11:03,236
- I got it!
- You should go first.

2222
01:11:03,237 --> 01:11:04,836
- I got it!
- You should go first.

2223
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:06,053
- You should go first.
- Listen up.

2224
01:11:06,077 --> 01:11:07,907
- I'll tell you the principle.
- Go ahead.

2225
01:11:08,147 --> 01:11:10,376
- There are two points. Listen up.
- Right.

2226
01:11:10,377 --> 01:11:11,676
We have a lower chance when we blow...

2227
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:12,946
- from the top.
- What should we do then?

2228
01:11:12,947 --> 01:11:14,686
- Let me show you.
- Right.

2229
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,716
When we blow from the top, the wind goes like this.

2230
01:11:16,717 --> 01:11:18,786
But when we blow from underneath,

2231
01:11:18,787 --> 01:11:21,126
there's a bit of fluke that happens.

2232
01:11:21,127 --> 01:11:23,086
A fluke?

2233
01:11:23,087 --> 01:11:24,696
- A push.
- A push occurs.

2234
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,026
- A push.
- A push.

2235
01:11:26,027 --> 01:11:27,056
Check this out.

2236
01:11:27,057 --> 01:11:28,826
(Blowing from the top)

2237
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:30,626
(Blowing from underneath)

2238
01:11:30,627 --> 01:11:32,337
- The ball goes straight.
- I see.

2239
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:34,196
- It pushes forward.
- I get what you mean.

2240
01:11:34,197 --> 01:11:35,466
- Do you get what I'm saying?
- But it's strong.

2241
01:11:35,467 --> 01:11:36,836
- It's like a golf putt.
- Blow upward.

2242
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:38,206
- Right.
- Right.

2243
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:39,647
- But it does get stronger.
- Right.

2244
01:11:39,677 --> 01:11:40,906
- The spin makes it stronger.
- Blow gently.

2245
01:11:40,907 --> 01:11:42,787
Just imagine that you're blowing it up to here.

2246
01:11:43,177 --> 01:11:45,246
There you go! That was it.

2247
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:46,247
- That was it.
- Let's go for it.

2248
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:47,716
- You get it, right?
- Awesome.

2249
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:49,386
- We should... In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2250
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:50,816
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Here we go.

2251
01:11:50,817 --> 01:11:52,317
- Let's go!
- Get ready.

2252
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,026
(The Blow From Underneath strategy found by Jin Hee)

2253
01:11:56,027 --> 01:11:57,057
Set.

2254
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:01,126
(Second try, Jae Suk)

2255
01:12:01,127 --> 01:12:02,267
- Okay!
- Yes!

2256
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,066
(The strategy worked.)

2257
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:06,596
(The refill assistant)

2258
01:12:06,597 --> 01:12:08,006
- I did it.
- It's over if I make it.

2259
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:09,066
(It's over if one more person makes it.)

2260
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:11,576
(Second try, Seok Jin)

2261
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,976
- Hurry up.
- Go.

2262
01:12:12,977 --> 01:12:14,006
Blow upward.

2263
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:17,276
(Second try, Yeon Seok)

2264
01:12:17,277 --> 01:12:18,317
Jin Hee!

2265
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:20,046
All right.

2266
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:21,047
(Jin Hee is the only one left.)

2267
01:12:21,048 --> 01:12:22,147
- Jin Hee!
- All right.

2268
01:12:23,387 --> 01:12:24,907
- Jin Hee! Push it far away.
- Five...

2269
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:26,156
- Gosh!
- How could you start...

2270
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:27,933
counting down from five when I'm about to do it?

2271
01:12:27,957 --> 01:12:29,956
(Production crew)

2272
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:31,256
(How could you start counting down from 5?)

2273
01:12:31,257 --> 01:12:32,826
He started counting down from five when I was about to blow the ball!

2274
01:12:32,827 --> 01:12:35,627
- Gosh.
- What are you doing?

2275
01:12:35,797 --> 01:12:37,496
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on, Jin Hee!

2276
01:12:37,497 --> 01:12:38,777
(They fail on their second try.)

2277
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:43,206
(They couldn't use Jae Suk's success to their advantage.)

2278
01:12:43,207 --> 01:12:47,107
Why are you all being like this when I'm in good condition?

2279
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:49,777
Why give us such a hard one?

2280
01:12:50,547 --> 01:12:51,947
Or it should be blown hard instead.

2281
01:12:55,517 --> 01:12:57,317
- It will work if it's straight.
- Right.

2282
01:12:59,317 --> 01:13:00,416
He's good at this.

2283
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:01,486
- He's good at this.
- How is he good at this...

2284
01:13:01,487 --> 01:13:02,727
even when his mouth is crooked?

2285
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:05,026
(He does well with his crooked gun barrel.)

2286
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:07,226
- We can do this. We got this.
- Right.

2287
01:13:07,227 --> 01:13:08,897
It might be different for each person,

2288
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,727
but this much power seems to be needed.

2289
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:12,196
(Listening to what Jae Suk says)

2290
01:13:12,197 --> 01:13:13,267
You should...

2291
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:14,737
Shall we go for it?

2292
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:16,237
- Let's go!
- Let's give it a try.

2293
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,876
In 1, 2, 3.

2294
01:13:17,877 --> 01:13:19,383
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Let's give it a try.

2295
01:13:19,407 --> 01:13:20,877
Hold on. I haven't started yet.

2296
01:13:21,007 --> 01:13:22,207
I'll start after the call.

2297
01:13:27,317 --> 01:13:28,993
Weren't you the one who was going to make the call?

2298
01:13:29,017 --> 01:13:30,216
- You should make the call.
- Are you ready?

2299
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:31,977
- I'll start after the whistle.
- Get ready.

2300
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:35,457
Set.

2301
01:13:35,887 --> 01:13:37,226
(Fourth try, Seok Jin)

2302
01:13:37,227 --> 01:13:38,903
- It's out. Go right away.
- Go right away.

2303
01:13:38,927 --> 01:13:40,856
- Is it me?
- This is driving me crazy.

2304
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,426
(Fourth try, Jin Hee)

2305
01:13:42,427 --> 01:13:44,126
- He did it!
- Gosh.

2306
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:45,366
- You have to make it.
- You have to make it.

2307
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:48,037
(Fourth try, Jae Suk)

2308
01:13:50,907 --> 01:13:52,106
(Jae Suk makes it again)

2309
01:13:52,107 --> 01:13:54,107
- You have to make it, Yeon Shik.
- You can do it.

2310
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:56,506
(They will pass the round if Yeon Seok puts the ball in.)

2311
01:13:56,507 --> 01:13:58,316
- You have to make it, Yeon Shik.
- You can do it.

2312
01:13:58,317 --> 01:13:59,346
(Fourth try, Yeon Seok)

2313
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:00,817
Five, four...

2314
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:09,386
Four, three...

2315
01:14:09,387 --> 01:14:10,387
He did it!

2316
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,657
- Three.
- He did it!

2317
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,327
(They almost pass out.)

2318
01:14:16,197 --> 01:14:17,296
(Groaning)

2319
01:14:17,297 --> 01:14:18,337
It bounced out.

2320
01:14:19,097 --> 01:14:20,873
- The ball went in!
- How many tries did we use?

2321
01:14:20,897 --> 01:14:21,907
He did everything right.

2322
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:23,367
That was so close.

2323
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:24,706
(They fail again with Jae Suk being the only one to make it.)

2324
01:14:24,707 --> 01:14:25,876
The ball went in.

2325
01:14:25,877 --> 01:14:27,906
- You're good at this.
- We have a good chance.

2326
01:14:27,907 --> 01:14:28,946
We can surely make it.

2327
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:30,006
- Gosh.
- Well...

2328
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,416
I'm doing great today, but my teammates won't help out.

2329
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,447
I feel bad.

2330
01:14:34,147 --> 01:14:36,787
- Will you not come to your senses?
- We did well during practice.

2331
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,556
My pride is getting hurt a lot today.

2332
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,816
- Why are you so good at this?
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

2333
01:14:39,817 --> 01:14:41,016
You're doing well today.

2334
01:14:41,017 --> 01:14:43,386
- Gosh.
- Isn't he usually like this?

2335
01:14:43,387 --> 01:14:45,096
Usually, he does well during practice...

2336
01:14:45,097 --> 01:14:46,296
and does badly during the actual rounds.

2337
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:47,857
- But it's the opposite today.
- Right.

2338
01:14:49,127 --> 01:14:50,127
We should use our bonus coupon.

2339
01:14:50,128 --> 01:14:51,566
- Let's use the bonus coupon.
- Right.

2340
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:53,043
- Let's use the bonus coupon.
- The bonus coupon.

2341
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:55,137
We have to pass Round One at least.

2342
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:56,967
You should each give it a try.

2343
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:01,307
(One shot, one kill)

2344
01:15:02,577 --> 01:15:03,606
- It has to be blown...
- He did it.

2345
01:15:03,607 --> 01:15:05,646
- all the way through.
- Right.

2346
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:06,716
- Right.
- Right.

2347
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:08,246
- He's right.
- This is a different method.

2348
01:15:08,247 --> 01:15:09,247
(Jose's strategy: Blow all the way through with a gentle breath)

2349
01:15:09,248 --> 01:15:10,386
- This is a different method.
- Right.

2350
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:11,456
(All the way through)

2351
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:13,587
- Right.
- He did it.

2352
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,326
(Jose's strategy worked.)

2353
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,986
- That's the right method.
- Gracias!

2354
01:15:16,987 --> 01:15:18,256
- Gracias!
- Gracias!

2355
01:15:18,257 --> 01:15:20,926
- If Jose joins in, - We weren't aware of this method.

2356
01:15:20,927 --> 01:15:23,447
- One person must be taken out.
- one person must be taken out.

2357
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:25,596
One person has to be taken out if you join in.

2358
01:15:25,597 --> 01:15:26,597
(He feels bad to choose someone to be taken out.)

2359
01:15:26,598 --> 01:15:28,706
- Just stare at that person.
- Who will it be?

2360
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:29,767
Look at one person.

2361
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:33,107
(It's Seok Jin.)

2362
01:15:33,607 --> 01:15:35,576
(Seok Jin worked hard to practice just now, but he gets taken out.)

2363
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:36,807
- He is extraordinary.
- Okay.

2364
01:15:37,107 --> 01:15:38,746
- Let's go!
- Come this way.

2365
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:40,846
- Please!
- All right. In 1, 2, 3.

2366
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:42,217
- Let's go!
- Get ready.

2367
01:15:42,547 --> 01:15:43,816
Please!

2368
01:15:43,817 --> 01:15:44,817
Please.

2369
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:45,957
Set.

2370
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:47,557
I think we can do this.

2371
01:15:48,857 --> 01:15:51,496
(Coupon Round, Jose)

2372
01:15:51,497 --> 01:15:53,627
He did it!

2373
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,026
He's good at this.

2374
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:56,266
(Just one more person has to make it now!)

2375
01:15:56,267 --> 01:15:57,896
- He did it.
- He's good at this.

2376
01:15:57,897 --> 01:16:00,667
(Coupon Round, Jin Hee)

2377
01:16:02,537 --> 01:16:04,097
- That's a great method.
- That was it.

2378
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:05,847
We should've known this earlier.

2379
01:16:06,537 --> 01:16:10,876
(Coupon Round, Yeon Seok)

2380
01:16:10,877 --> 01:16:12,617
- No.
- He did it.

2381
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:14,377
- Move away.
- Gosh.

2382
01:16:14,747 --> 01:16:16,317
(This can't be happening.)

2383
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:18,687
(Ace Jae Suk is the only one left.)

2384
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:20,156
(Coupon Round, Jae Suk)

2385
01:16:20,157 --> 01:16:22,787
Three, two, one.

2386
01:16:24,897 --> 01:16:26,457
It has to be blown all the way through.

2387
01:16:26,657 --> 01:16:29,597
Three, two, one.

2388
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:31,897
(Failure)

2389
01:16:32,397 --> 01:16:33,436
One.

2390
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:34,497
(Groaning)

2391
01:16:35,407 --> 01:16:37,637
Hold on. Why didn't you start counting down from five?

2392
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:42,206
- Exactly. Gosh.
- That got him flustered.

2393
01:16:42,207 --> 01:16:43,306
You started counting down from five up until now.

2394
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,177
(He protects Jae Suk only during these times.)

2395
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:47,546
- But...
- Well,

2396
01:16:47,547 --> 01:16:50,086
- Jose's method is good though.
- I did well...

2397
01:16:50,087 --> 01:16:51,186
just now.

2398
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:52,987
- Jose's method works.
- Right.

2399
01:16:54,587 --> 01:16:55,786
- I did well just now.
- He did it.

2400
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:56,826
(The hidden skills of the bench member)

2401
01:16:56,827 --> 01:16:58,596
(He acknowledges him as the best pupil of his strategy.)

2402
01:16:58,597 --> 01:17:00,226
- You should go 1st.
- You should go 1st.

2403
01:17:00,227 --> 01:17:01,796
Seok Jin is good at blowing it out long and thin.

2404
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:03,126
- Right.
- Right.

2405
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:04,666
Nice. This is our sixth try.

2406
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:05,897
- Hold on.
- Get ready.

2407
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:08,766
Set.

2408
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:11,306
(Sixth try, Seok Jin)

2409
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:12,736
(Seok Jin makes it in a flash!)

2410
01:17:12,737 --> 01:17:14,877
- Okay!
- We got this.

2411
01:17:15,277 --> 01:17:16,306
(Sixth try, Jin Hee)

2412
01:17:16,307 --> 01:17:17,807
Just one more time.

2413
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:19,877
Gosh!

2414
01:17:20,277 --> 01:17:21,916
- Gosh.
- It needs to be fairly strong.

2415
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,916
(Sixth try, Yeon Seok)

2416
01:17:24,917 --> 01:17:27,016
- He did it!
- He did it!

2417
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,527
(It went in!)

2418
01:17:29,387 --> 01:17:30,756
- He did it!
- He did it!

2419
01:17:30,757 --> 01:17:31,896
(Yoo One Shot's clean finish)

2420
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,856
- He did it!
- Yes!

2421
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:35,067
- He did it!
- He did it!

2422
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:37,397
- He did it!
- Yes!

2423
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,597
(The atmosphere of a Southern American festival)

2424
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:43,336
Gosh, he has a shot within him.

2425
01:17:43,337 --> 01:17:44,976
- Nice!
- I do have a shot within me.

2426
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,657
- I do have a shot within me!
- We did it!

2427
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:49,747
(Jose's strategy worked out perfectly.)

2428
01:17:50,247 --> 01:17:51,946
(Jumping with joy)

2429
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:53,376
- All right.
- You did it.

2430
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,917
- For the bicycles. Success.
- Success.

2431
01:17:56,647 --> 01:17:58,616
(Dancing with joy)

2432
01:17:58,617 --> 01:18:00,117
(The Dancing Bear too)

2433
01:18:00,387 --> 01:18:01,387
You're back.

2434
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:03,057
Yoo One Shot is back.

2435
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:04,727
All right.

2436
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:07,526
- You always show up.
- Now, we have 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2437
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:08,926
- We have four tries left.
- It's time to make a choice.

2438
01:18:08,927 --> 01:18:09,996
That wasn't easy.

2439
01:18:09,997 --> 01:18:13,267
The prize becomes bigger in Round Two.

2440
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:15,366
- But we only have four tries left.
- That's right.

2441
01:18:15,367 --> 01:18:17,167
Round Two becomes harder.

2442
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:19,436
- So you have to make a choice.
- Whether you'll continue or not.

2443
01:18:19,437 --> 01:18:20,807
- Okay. In 1...
- Why don't you...

2444
01:18:20,977 --> 01:18:22,476
Why don't you discuss it first?

2445
01:18:22,477 --> 01:18:24,383
- They can't see the prize first?
- No, they can't.

2446
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:25,547
In 1, 2, 3.

2447
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:26,746
We choose to go.

2448
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:27,776
- Go.
- Let's go.

2449
01:18:27,777 --> 01:18:29,116
- What?
- Let's go.

2450
01:18:29,117 --> 01:18:30,597
- Go.
- Why are you doing this to us?

2451
01:18:30,987 --> 01:18:32,057
Go.

2452
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:33,986
- We can do this.
- They should continue.

2453
01:18:33,987 --> 01:18:35,157
- Yes.
- Here you go.

2454
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:37,926
"The prince's hands are suffering from hand dermatitis."

2455
01:18:37,927 --> 01:18:39,326
"We want to keep them nice and dry."

2456
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:40,696
- "A Samsung dishwasher."
- Gosh.

2457
01:18:40,697 --> 01:18:41,937
- A dishwasher?
- A dishwasher.

2458
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:44,866
- Here.
- We really need this.

2459
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:46,296
- I see.
- Here is the dishwasher.

2460
01:18:46,297 --> 01:18:47,536
- We really need it.
- Okay.

2461
01:18:47,537 --> 01:18:49,066
- This is a nice dishwasher.
- Gosh.

2462
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:50,966
- That's nice.
- This is ours.

2463
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:52,077
All right.

2464
01:18:52,537 --> 01:18:53,706
I feel so pressured.

2465
01:18:53,707 --> 01:18:55,106
- It's okay.
- I feel so pressured.

2466
01:18:55,107 --> 01:18:58,176
(Round 2: The number of bottles increases.)

2467
01:18:58,177 --> 01:18:59,346
They're adding three more bottles?

2468
01:18:59,347 --> 01:19:01,476
- Do all 4 have to succeed?
- Why do you have to add 3 more?

2469
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:02,646
- My gosh.
- Why did you add so many?

2470
01:19:02,647 --> 01:19:04,486
- You're adding this many?
- It's longer.

2471
01:19:04,487 --> 01:19:05,586
(The road to success just got much more challenging.)

2472
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:08,357
How do they expect us to clear such a difficult mission?

2473
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:09,826
This won't be easy.

2474
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:10,827
(Feeling frustrated)

2475
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:12,526
Let's practice.

2476
01:19:12,527 --> 01:19:14,696
You have to push it horizontally.

2477
01:19:14,697 --> 01:19:15,896
(The cup is farther away.)

2478
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:17,227
This isn't easy.

2479
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:19,197
Horizontally.

2480
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:21,136
That's right. Keep it even.

2481
01:19:21,137 --> 01:19:22,207
- Keep it even.
- Wait.

2482
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:24,036
He's having a mental breakdown.

2483
01:19:24,037 --> 01:19:26,517
(Those watching are about to have a mental breakdown as well.)

2484
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:29,646
- That's right. Push further.
- This is hard.

2485
01:19:29,647 --> 01:19:30,776
- It's too far.
- This is hard.

2486
01:19:30,777 --> 01:19:32,146
- It's hard.
- It's hard.

2487
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:33,147
Okay.

2488
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:34,846
(The star pupil of Jose's strategy enters.)

2489
01:19:34,847 --> 01:19:35,917
(Blowing)

2490
01:19:36,017 --> 01:19:37,787
- I did it.
- This is how you do it.

2491
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,586
(Their 1st time succeeding in Round 2)

2492
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:41,826
You have to push it further.

2493
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:43,987
(They have to push it harder and further than before.)

2494
01:19:44,187 --> 01:19:45,196
- I think it should feel like...
- You have to blow harder.

2495
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,026
- you're blowing too hard.
- At first,

2496
01:19:47,027 --> 01:19:48,466
you have to blow harder and continue pushing it.

2497
01:19:48,467 --> 01:19:49,897
- That's right. You did it.
- Yes.

2498
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:52,237
You did it. That's right.

2499
01:19:52,337 --> 01:19:54,037
- You did it. That's right.
- He's right.

2500
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:56,336
- That's right.
- All right. Got it.

2501
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:57,406
(They start gaining hope.)

2502
01:19:57,407 --> 01:19:59,636
- That's right.
- That's right.

2503
01:19:59,637 --> 01:20:02,507
- I have to blow this hard.
- Yes, and keep blowing.

2504
01:20:03,777 --> 01:20:05,146
(Laughing)

2505
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:06,247
What is it?

2506
01:20:06,647 --> 01:20:07,916
- What is it?
- What?

2507
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:09,797
- What is it?
- Do you have a license for this?

2508
01:20:10,187 --> 01:20:12,356
- I'm doing well at the moment.
- Yes, you are.

2509
01:20:12,357 --> 01:20:13,986
I believe I have a right to coach you.

2510
01:20:13,987 --> 01:20:14,987
Keep blowing.

2511
01:20:16,127 --> 01:20:17,256
- You did it.
- Nice.

2512
01:20:17,257 --> 01:20:19,273
- You have to blow hard.
- You have to blow quite hard.

2513
01:20:19,297 --> 01:20:20,457
Should we give it a try?

2514
01:20:20,797 --> 01:20:22,197
- Let's give it a try.
- Let's try.

2515
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:24,326
- Let's end it.
- I'll go second.

2516
01:20:24,327 --> 01:20:25,437
Go second.

2517
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:27,297
- I'll go second.
- Ready.

2518
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:31,367
Dishwasher.

2519
01:20:31,907 --> 01:20:33,037
Blow until it goes in.

2520
01:20:36,577 --> 01:20:37,577
(Seventh try, Jin Hee)

2521
01:20:37,578 --> 01:20:38,647
Should I go third?

2522
01:20:40,747 --> 01:20:41,816
(Seventh try, Jae Suk)

2523
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:43,246
You have to give it a long blow.

2524
01:20:43,247 --> 01:20:45,716
(Seventh try, Jae Suk)

2525
01:20:45,717 --> 01:20:46,757
I think it'll go in.

2526
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:49,257
I almost got it.

2527
01:20:50,187 --> 01:20:51,656
- I'm going to do this.
- You can do it.

2528
01:20:51,657 --> 01:20:52,657
You got it.

2529
01:20:52,658 --> 01:20:55,366
(Seventh try, Yeon Seok)

2530
01:20:55,367 --> 01:20:56,666
(With Yeon Seok's failure, )

2531
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,796
(try number 7 ends in failure.)

2532
01:20:58,797 --> 01:21:00,396
(Chuckling)

2533
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,467
Gosh.

2534
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:02,936
I have to blow longer.

2535
01:21:02,937 --> 01:21:04,867
- Try it. It's difficult.
- Seriously.

2536
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:06,677
This is definitely harder.

2537
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:09,576
It has to be just the right amount of pressure.

2538
01:21:09,577 --> 01:21:11,346
- It has to be just right.
- The pressure has to be just right.

2539
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:13,216
- But there's a low chance.
- It isn't easy.

2540
01:21:13,217 --> 01:21:14,417
There's only a low chance.

2541
01:21:14,977 --> 01:21:16,046
Focus.

2542
01:21:16,047 --> 01:21:17,986
- That's a good idea.
- What?

2543
01:21:17,987 --> 01:21:18,987
I like that.

2544
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,286
- That helps.
- It helps.

2545
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:24,486
- It helps.
- Try again.

2546
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:25,496
It helps.

2547
01:21:25,497 --> 01:21:26,856
- Try it.
- This helps.

2548
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:28,133
(Does this create a path for the wind?)

2549
01:21:28,157 --> 01:21:29,197
(Out of nowhere)

2550
01:21:33,297 --> 01:21:35,767
(Suddenly creating a bromance moment)

2551
01:21:36,737 --> 01:21:38,337
(Flustered)

2552
01:21:39,137 --> 01:21:41,177
(What are you two doing?)

2553
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:43,076
- Jin Hee.
- I'm sorry.

2554
01:21:43,077 --> 01:21:46,217
- You're a mess today.
- He was so sweet.

2555
01:21:46,747 --> 01:21:48,276
(Pulling himself together)

2556
01:21:48,277 --> 01:21:49,446
Jin Hee apologized.

2557
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,617
- It's because we want to succeed.
- You're right.

2558
01:21:52,487 --> 01:21:53,586
- You did it.
- You did it.

2559
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:54,857
We only have two tries left.

2560
01:21:55,087 --> 01:21:56,726
- Move over.
- I think this is a good idea.

2561
01:21:56,727 --> 01:21:57,787
It's a good idea.

2562
01:21:59,597 --> 01:22:00,697
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

2563
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:02,296
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

2564
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:04,126
- Does it help?
- Yes, it does.

2565
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:06,136
- It makes the ball go straight.
- It makes you feel stable.

2566
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:07,637
You have to let out a long breath.

2567
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,436
- Nice.
- Let out a long blow.

2568
01:22:10,437 --> 01:22:12,076
(He starts speeding up.)

2569
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:13,913
- We've gotten better.
- Let's try right away, Jin Hee.

2570
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:15,776
- Let's try right away, Jin Hee.
- Let's try right away.

2571
01:22:15,777 --> 01:22:17,376
Jin Hee, in 1, 2... This is try number 9.

2572
01:22:17,377 --> 01:22:18,777
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2573
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:20,117
This is try number nine.

2574
01:22:20,777 --> 01:22:23,447
(Creating a path for the wind!)

2575
01:22:24,747 --> 01:22:26,557
Please let this work.

2576
01:22:27,857 --> 01:22:30,126
(Ninth try, Jin Hee)

2577
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:31,256
- He did it!
- You did it.

2578
01:22:31,257 --> 01:22:33,126
(It went in!)

2579
01:22:33,127 --> 01:22:35,126
(He created a path for the wind.)

2580
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:36,166
(Only 1 more person has to succeed.)

2581
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:37,466
- We got this.
- Let's end it now.

2582
01:22:37,467 --> 01:22:38,536
- We got this.
- Let's end it.

2583
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,967
(Ninth try, Yeon Seok)

2584
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,766
(Ninth try, Yeon Seok)

2585
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:45,877
You did it.

2586
01:22:46,437 --> 01:22:47,907
- Next.
- Go.

2587
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:49,276
Go.

2588
01:22:49,277 --> 01:22:53,416
(Ninth try, Seok Jin)

2589
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,147
- Jae Suk.
- You're our only hope, Jae Suk.

2590
01:22:55,587 --> 01:22:56,646
You're our only hope.

2591
01:22:56,647 --> 01:22:59,886
(Ninth try, Jae Suk)

2592
01:22:59,887 --> 01:23:01,156
(Today, he's been doing well during the actual game.)

2593
01:23:01,157 --> 01:23:02,427
You're our only hope, Jae Suk.

2594
01:23:06,597 --> 01:23:09,767
(If Ace Jae Suk succeeds, they clear Round 2.)

2595
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:13,837
Gosh.

2596
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:17,137
(Try number nine ends in failure.)

2597
01:23:20,137 --> 01:23:22,177
That was our chance to succeed.

2598
01:23:22,477 --> 01:23:23,607
The countdown.

2599
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,346
(They all grip the Wailing Wall and groan.)

2600
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:27,477
The countdown.

2601
01:23:27,577 --> 01:23:29,687
- Could you not do that?
- Could you not do that?

2602
01:23:30,087 --> 01:23:31,967
Why do you keep counting the last five seconds?

2603
01:23:32,357 --> 01:23:34,486
We know it's going to end.

2604
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:37,527
The countdown gets on our nerves.

2605
01:23:39,657 --> 01:23:41,297
- This is our last try.
- Our last try.

2606
01:23:41,757 --> 01:23:43,097
What do we do?

2607
01:23:43,897 --> 01:23:45,096
- It's our last try.
- Yes, it's our last try.

2608
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:46,996
- If we fail...
- Yes?

2609
01:23:46,997 --> 01:23:48,667
(Jin Hee looks determined.)

2610
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:51,437
(I really hope we succeed this time.)

2611
01:23:52,077 --> 01:23:56,077
(The Chungju Ji clan felt weight on their shoulders all day.)

2612
01:23:57,677 --> 01:23:59,877
(We have to succeed with our second guest.)

2613
01:24:00,677 --> 01:24:02,623
(I definitely feel the pressure with our second guest.)

2614
01:24:02,647 --> 01:24:06,457
(They feel pressured not to fail twice in a row.)

2615
01:24:06,957 --> 01:24:08,386
Let's bring our hands together for our last try.

2616
01:24:08,387 --> 01:24:10,456
- I hope we do well.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2617
01:24:10,457 --> 01:24:11,757
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2618
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:14,956
- It's okay as long as we succeed.
- I'm sorry.

2619
01:24:14,957 --> 01:24:16,066
- It's okay.
- All right.

2620
01:24:16,067 --> 01:24:17,867
- Let's do this.
- Let's start our final try.

2621
01:24:18,197 --> 01:24:20,037
- We can do this.
- We can't fail twice today.

2622
01:24:20,697 --> 01:24:22,537
- We can do this.
- We can't fail twice today.

2623
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:24,336
- We can't fail twice.
- No.

2624
01:24:24,337 --> 01:24:26,376
- Ready.
- I can't watch this.

2625
01:24:26,377 --> 01:24:27,507
- We can't fail twice.
- No.

2626
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:28,837
- Let's go.
- We can do this.

2627
01:24:28,907 --> 01:24:29,947
Set.

2628
01:24:31,277 --> 01:24:35,116
(Last try, Jin Hee)

2629
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:37,046
(Last try, Seok Jin)

2630
01:24:37,047 --> 01:24:38,586
Let's do this. It's driving me crazy.

2631
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:42,126
(Last try, Seok Jin)

2632
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:43,257
You did it!

2633
01:24:43,587 --> 01:24:44,687
You did it!

2634
01:24:45,157 --> 01:24:46,257
Go ahead.

2635
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:48,426
Go ahead. You can do it.

2636
01:24:48,427 --> 01:24:52,596
(Last try, Jae Suk)

2637
01:24:52,597 --> 01:24:54,067
- Gosh.
- You're the last one up.

2638
01:24:54,937 --> 01:24:57,207
You can do it, Yeon Seok. You did it earlier.

2639
01:24:57,507 --> 01:24:58,577
Five...

2640
01:25:01,037 --> 01:25:03,207
Show us what you've got.

2641
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:11,817
Five, four...

2642
01:25:13,187 --> 01:25:14,216
It went in.

2643
01:25:14,217 --> 01:25:16,287
(They end up failing.)

2644
01:25:18,157 --> 01:25:19,196
It went in.

2645
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,357
(Sighing)

2646
01:25:22,997 --> 01:25:24,317
We have one last try left, right?

2647
01:25:24,997 --> 01:25:25,997
Don't we?

2648
01:25:26,297 --> 01:25:27,967
We did a good job. It was difficult.

2649
01:25:28,137 --> 01:25:30,367
It's difficult for 2 out of 4 people to succeed.

2650
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,136
(They quickly take the presents away.)

2651
01:25:34,137 --> 01:25:35,877
- Don't we have one try left?
- Excuse me.

2652
01:25:36,907 --> 01:25:38,747
So long. Farewell.

2653
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:40,277
Goodbye.

2654
01:25:41,477 --> 01:25:44,046
Can we try one more time?

2655
01:25:44,047 --> 01:25:45,386
(A useless plea)

2656
01:25:45,387 --> 01:25:46,667
If we could try one more time...

2657
01:25:46,787 --> 01:25:48,787
(He can't let go of it.)

2658
01:25:49,287 --> 01:25:51,887
- This is really hard.
- Still, one of us did it.

2659
01:25:52,097 --> 01:25:53,156
You're right.

2660
01:25:53,157 --> 01:25:54,957
We should've stopped with the bicycle.

2661
01:25:55,297 --> 01:25:57,226
- We were too greedy.
- We were greedy.

2662
01:25:57,227 --> 01:26:00,137
- But it was worth a try.
- Yes, it was worth a try.

2663
01:26:00,437 --> 01:26:01,567
After making us drink.

2664
01:26:02,837 --> 01:26:05,206
(The locomotive abstaining from alcohol finally sobers up.)

2665
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:06,737
You had a plan.

2666
01:26:07,137 --> 01:26:08,747
In an hour when I'm sober,

2667
01:26:08,847 --> 01:26:10,676
- That's right.
- we'll try again.

2668
01:26:10,677 --> 01:26:11,807
Seriously.

2669
01:26:12,077 --> 01:26:13,776
I think he had a plan.

2670
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:16,517
I'm so disappointed.

2671
01:26:18,017 --> 01:26:19,086
I'm sorry.

2672
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:20,786
- This is a clock.
- Thank you.

2673
01:26:20,787 --> 01:26:22,727
- Thank you.
- I'd like to turn back time.

2674
01:26:23,557 --> 01:26:25,257
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2675
01:26:25,497 --> 01:26:26,696
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

2676
01:26:26,697 --> 01:26:27,796
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

2677
01:26:27,797 --> 01:26:29,626
- Thank you.
- We keep apologizing.

2678
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:31,566
We had a good time.

2679
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:32,796
The game was difficult.

2680
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:34,397
- It was very difficult.
- Yes.

2681
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,906
(A Whenever Friend that lies down as soon as he arrives?)

2682
01:26:37,907 --> 01:26:39,536
(Cha Tae Hyun, Third time on the show)

2683
01:26:39,537 --> 01:26:41,036
(Why did you come before we did?)

2684
01:26:41,037 --> 01:26:42,206
(Why are you two chatting?)

2685
01:26:42,207 --> 01:26:43,547
(Guaranteed viewer ratings)

2686
01:26:43,977 --> 01:26:44,977
(Is that Hyuk today?)

2687
01:26:44,978 --> 01:26:46,553
(Jang Hyuk, Friend that was born in the year of the dragon)

2688
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:48,216
(I'm good at Monopoly.)

2689
01:26:48,217 --> 01:26:49,587
(We don't play games like that.)

2690
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:53,486
(Then martial arts)

2691
01:26:53,487 --> 01:26:54,686
(When you were in "The Slave Hunters,")

2692
01:26:54,687 --> 01:26:55,927
(you wanted to exclaim, right?)

2693
01:26:56,157 --> 01:26:57,656
(Anger management technique)

2694
01:26:57,657 --> 01:26:59,826
(He continued shadow boxing.)

2695
01:26:59,827 --> 01:27:01,256
(Isn't he going to look at his opponent?)

2696
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:02,766
(That wasn't it, you punk.)

2697
01:27:02,767 --> 01:27:04,326
(Anger reflux technique)

01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:06,137
(Hey, you jerk.)

2699
01:27:06,797 --> 01:27:08,496
(As we grow older, he just...)

2700
01:27:08,497 --> 01:27:09,937
(He drives you crazy, doesn't he?)

2701
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:12,176
(Tae Hyun has no intention of listening.)

2702
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:14,036
(Listen to him, Tae Hyun.)

2703
01:27:14,037 --> 01:27:15,176

(The amazing finale of the season)

2708
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:23,463
(If we have to throw ourselves to the ground...)

2709
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:25,457
(We'll succeed no matter what today.)

2710
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,916
(He's sharpened his blade and is ready to attack...)

2711
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:30,027
