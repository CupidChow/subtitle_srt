1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,863
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:09,768
(Away from Seoul, )

3
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:12,363
(we've arrived here early in the morning.)

4
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:13,862
(Humming)

5
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,863
This is good.

6
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,302
It's good. It's sweet.

7
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:17,572
(The 2 MCs are getting their sugar fix at a cool cafe.)

8
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:19,102
The chocolate brownie is tasty too.

9
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,003
The cheesecake is tasty too.

10
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,273
(Munching)

11
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:25,742
It's been a while since we traveled outside of Seoul.

12
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:26,773
We're in Daegu today.

13
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:28,613
I haven't been here in a while.

14
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,013
There are many cool spots to explore...

15
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,382
here in Daegu.

16
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,852
- You know this place? Suseong Lake.
- Suseong Lake.

17
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:35,382
- So you know. Yes.
- This is a famous lake.

18
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,153
This is a great place for walks.

19
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:39,393
- Yes.
- People walk here barefoot too.

20
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:41,493
There's also Kansong Art Museum.

21
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,732
And there's the famous downtown area.

22
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:45,733
- Like what?
- Dongseong-ro.

23
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,063
- Right.
- Dongseong-ro, Daegu.

24
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,673
(Gyesanyega, the cradle of modern culture and art in Daegu)

25
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:53,103
It took three hours to get here from my place.

26
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:54,502
There was no traffic.

27
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:56,319
- Three hours without traffic.
- We got here quickly.

28
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:58,173
What time did you go to sleep last night?

29
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:00,143
At 9:30pm.

30
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,183
- How can you fall asleep at 9:30pm?
- So...

31
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:05,453
I woke up at around 4:40am.

32
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,782
- At 9:30pm...
- Isn't that...

33
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:07,983
the sleep cycle for newborns?

34
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,523
You can totally fall asleep at 9:30pm.

35
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:12,323
Everyone. If you just try...

36
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:14,122
At 9:30pm...

37
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:16,823
Getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep hits the sweet spot for me.

38
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,533
That's perfect for me.

39
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:22,103
Sit up straight when talking.

40
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,373
You go up first.

41
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:27,603
(The Whenever Friends are coming up carefully.)

42
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:30,273
So... What?

43
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:31,473
My gosh!

44
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:32,942
- Bong Sik!
- What?

45
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:34,083
- Hello.
- Bong Sik.

46
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,183
(Smiling brightly)

47
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,582
(Today's Whenever Friend, Hyun Bong Sik)

48
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,753
- Hello.
- Bong Sik.

49
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:39,583
- Gosh, Sung Kyun.
- Hello.

50
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:40,823
- What?
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

51
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:44,952
(Genre has no hold on this versatile actor.)

52
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,353
- Get out, Nam Gil.
- Gosh.

53
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,539
(The last time he was on the show, he showed us slapstick comedy.)

54
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:51,562
(For the first time in the history of the show, )

55
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,662
(they completed all 3 rounds for both Whenever Guests.)

56
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,503
(The Victory Fairy, Kim Sung Kyun)

57
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:59,302
(Hyun Bong Sik, )

58
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:01,043
(you've got a talent.)

59
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:04,372
(He's crushing it in movies, dramas, and variety shows.)

60
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:07,283
(He exudes an unparalleled presence in all of his works.)

61
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:09,883
(He's also the same age as Yeon Seok.)

62
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,152
(The actor on the rise, Hyun Bong Sik)

63
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,553
- Gosh, Sung Kyun.
- My gosh.

64
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:15,753
- My gosh. Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, my.

65
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,292
Bong Sik.

66
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,152
- We...
- I finally get to see him.

67
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:21,033
- Is this your first meeting?
- He's my junior.

68
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,963
- Yes. He's my junior.
- Yes.

69
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,592
Bong Sik and Sung Kyun are joining us today.

70
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:26,809
Is this your first time meeting him?

71
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,202
I ran into him at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

72
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:30,732
- That's when you met?
- Yes, we did.

73
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,232
- Then we hoped to meet again.
- Yes.

74
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,372
- He wanted to meet me, - I see.

75
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,749
- But he never got a chance.
- Right.

76
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,213
Bong Sik was so friendly.

77
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:38,873
- I see.
- "My gosh, Jae Suk."

78
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:41,113
"Can we take a selfie together?"

79
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:43,143
- We took a selfie together.
- Yes.

80
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,429
- Actually, - It's our first show together.

81
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:48,422
It's not easy to drop the honorifics to Bong Sik...

82
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:50,183
- during the first meeting.
- Right.

83
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:51,322
(Chuckling)

84
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:52,352
Not a lot of people...

85
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:53,552
- can call him by his name.
- It's not easy to do that.

86
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:54,722
- Is that so?
- Yes.

87
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:56,323
- Really?
- It's not easy.

88
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:58,332
We met in "Narco-Saints."

89
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,732
- That's when we first met.
- I see.

90
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,533
I heard that we were the same age.

91
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,602
But when I saw him walking toward me,

92
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,073
I got up right away.

93
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,573
- I couldn't help but bow to him.
- I knew it.

94
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,742
He knew we were the same age,

95
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:12,223
but he kept speaking with honorifics.

96
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,742
He couldn't help but speak with honorifics.

97
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:16,512
So Bong Sik and Yeon Shik were born in 1984?

98
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:17,753
- We were born in 1984.
- Yes.

99
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,213
- Yeon Shik?
- Yeon Shik.

100
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:20,982
That became my name on this show.

101
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,723
Bong Sik and Yeon Shik. This is perfect.

102
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,052
- But Bong Sik is his name.
- Yes.

103
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,392
My name is Yeon Seok.

104
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,493
Bong Sik and Yeon Shik.

105
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:29,403
It's okay. Having a lot of names is good.

106
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,093
When we filmed with Jung Seok, he called him Jung Shik.

107
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:36,009
If he were here today, it would've been the Shik Trio.

108
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,802
Sung Kyun. You were on our show during the second season.

109
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,172
- Yes.
- Right. He joined us...

110
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:42,642
- with Kim Nam Gil.
- Yes. With Lee Ha Nee.

111
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,242
- With Ha Nee.
- You were on our show as a team.

112
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,642
- Right.
- We got lucky that day.

113
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,682
We made it to the last round.

114
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:49,342
- We passed Round Three both times.
- Both times.

115
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:50,552
- Right.
- Yes.

116
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,582
Wait. Is your hometown Daegu?

117
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,852
- I'm from Daegu.
- I see.

118
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,782
- That's why. You're from Daegu too?
- No, I'm from Busan.

119
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,352
- You're from Busan.
- I see.

120
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,022
- Busan and Daegu.
- Sung Kyun is from Daegu.

121
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,792
Up to what age did you live here?

122
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:03,092
I lived here...

123
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:05,292
even after I had graduated from high school.

124
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:06,862
I lived here until I got discharged...

125
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:08,232
- from the military.
- Really?

126
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,672
Daegu has a lot of tasty dishes.

127
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:12,232
Like spicy ribs.

128
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,372
- Gosh, yes.
- Yes.

129
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:16,072
- You must know all the good spots.
- You can introduce...

130
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:17,612
Daegu is famous for tripe.

131
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:19,072
- Right.
- Daegu is famous for tripe.

132
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,482
- It's also famous for spicy ribs.
- The spicy ribs.

133
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,482
We have mungtigi, the raw beef slices.

134
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:25,012
- Gosh, mungtigi.
- Yes.

135
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,052
That's also famous.

136
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,853
I can see a tripe restaurant right there.

137
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,352
- Gosh.
- Why is tripe so famous here?

138
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,023
Oh, no. I spilled it.

139
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,363
(Handing over the napkin)

140
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:35,793
Oh, no. I spilled it.

141
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,893
(Polite)

142
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:39,693
Bong Sik.

143
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,863
You're used to waiting on people.

144
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:43,333
I can tell by his behavior.

145
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:45,332
(Unusually good manners)

146
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,443
You've been around a lot of older guys, right?

147
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,302
- He's used to taking care of them.
- He's good. Yes.

148
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,842
I can tell that he's good at that.

149
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,243
- He's...
- Check out his attitude.

150
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,912
- He's sweet.
- Yes.

151
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,312
- I'm always the youngest one.
- Right.

152
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,182
"You're always the youngest one?"

153
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:03,323
It's clear that Bong Sik has a polite attitude.

154
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,052
- Bo Ram.
- Yes.

155
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,393
- He's Bo Ram.
- Bo Ram.

156
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,223
- What?
- His real name is Bo Ram.

157
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:09,793
Really?

158
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:11,162
It's Bo Ram.

159
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,663
Bo Ram sounds better.

160
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,602
Why did you change it to Bong Sik?

161
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:17,032
- As for my name, Bo Ram, - Yes?

162
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,772
My grandfather gave me that name when I was born.

163
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:20,103
It's a Korean-character name.

164
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,242
- I was Bo Ram until six years old.
- Okay.

165
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:24,513
But my friends made fun of my name, so I changed it.

166
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,342
- It sounded like a girl's name.
- Really?

167
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:28,383
I changed it to Jae Young.

168
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:31,712
That's how I changed my name. Then I started to work as an actor.

169
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,412
I started to use Hyun Bong Sik as my stage name.

170
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:34,622
- I didn't know...
- Your stage name...

171
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,652
that was his stage name.

172
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,082
- Right.
- It's perfect for him.

173
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,352
People feel betrayed when I tell them it's my stage name.

174
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:40,523
Yes. Right.

175
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,023
I didn't know. So you're not a real Bong Sik.

176
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:46,333
There's one more thing about him that makes people feel betrayed.

177
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:47,902
He can't drink.

178
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,762
- Right. He can't drink.
- Yes. I knew that.

179
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:50,802
- I heard about that.
- But...

180
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,072
you also don't drink.

181
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:53,073
- I don't.
- Right.

182
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,673
Bong Sik. What do you like then?

183
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:56,372
I like food.

184
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,912
- You like food?
- Yes, I like delicious food.

185
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:58,942
You like delicious food.

186
00:05:58,943 --> 00:05:59,943
Right. And he knows...

187
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,619
- a lot of good restaurants.
- He likes going out to eat.

188
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:02,842
- Dig in.
- So...

189
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:04,883
- you guys...
- Sure.

190
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,729
- met at the awards ceremony.
- You wanted to have some too.

191
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:11,092
Bo Ram would be a fitting name if his preferences are considered.

192
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:12,693
Bo Ram likes fresh juice.

193
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,662
Bo Ram ordered the chocolate cake.

194
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,593
He kept glancing at the food.

195
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:17,763
(A clean bite)

196
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,293
(Humming)

197
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,062
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

198
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,203
- Let's check where we have to go.
- Should we?

199
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,032
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

200
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,643
- There are so many cards now.
- Oh, my.

201
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,372
- There are so many cards.
- They're full.

202
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:31,443
Yes.

203
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:32,912
"Choi Su Bin."

204
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:33,942
- Su Bin.
- Yes.

205
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,442
"After work, all I want to do is escape my parents..."

206
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:38,553
"who are like jjamjjamyeon."

207
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,152
"And I'm their eldest daughter whom they nag with love..."

208
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:42,852
"like the rice in the fried rice."

209
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:45,152
"We've been handing out hot dishes for 40 years..."

210
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,293
"even in this hot summer."

211
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:48,092
"My parents have dedicated their youth..."

212
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,892
"to their regular customers from the neighborhood."

213
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:51,932
"So I want to give them a fun day like the fun dish,"

214
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,393
"jjamppong."

215
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,743
- It's a Chinese restaurant.
- A Chinese restaurant.

216
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:58,832
- Jjamjjamyeon, jjamppong, - Gosh, I bet the food tastes good.

217
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,902
And fried rice. All the dishes are mentioned.

218
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,942
I always say this. Whenever I'm traveling,

219
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,212
I always visit the local Chinese restaurant.

220
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:05,242
- Yes.
- I see.

221
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:07,142
- Each region has different flavors.
- It's natural...

222
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,442
- Right.
- Yes.

223
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,643
What time must we be there by?

224
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,352
By 10am.

225
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:12,413
We must get going then.

226
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,553
- Let's go.
- Yes. Shall we go?

227
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:15,682
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

228
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:17,353
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

229
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,653
My gosh. Hey.

230
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:21,723
- Yes.
- It's hot.

231
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,373
All right. Let's get in the car.

232
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,232
(They'll be driving today.)

233
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,953
- You're going to drive? Okay.
- Of course.

234
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:28,203
Really?

235
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,972
- Will you two sit in the back?
- Yes.

236
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:32,332
- What?
- We can film it with that.

237
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,102
- It's an honor to be driven by you.
- My gosh.

238
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,343
- Sung Kyun.
- Yes?

239
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,012
(Navi Yoo is checking the GPS.)

240
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:40,243
Can it recognize voice? Wait, it can.

241
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,413
Songna-ro 12-gil.

242
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:46,952
(It fails to recognize the address.)

243
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,352
- What?
- Your pronunciation must be clear.

244
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,322
- Right. Your pronunciation is bad.
- You try it then.

245
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:51,352
(Laughing)

246
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,152
- Bong Sik. You try it.
- You try it. Hold on.

247
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,073
(All of a sudden, they do a pronunciation test.)

248
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,592
Songna-ro 12-gil.

249
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:58,593
(Shaking his head)

250
00:07:58,594 --> 00:07:59,892
(The address is recognized.)

251
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:00,962
- Is that it?
- Gosh.

252
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,733
- Hey. My gosh.
- Good pronunciation.

253
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,032
- Your pronunciation is good.
- Gosh.

254
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,903
Even with your crooked teeth...

255
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,202
- Hold on. I mean...
- Come on, Yeon Shik.

256
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,272
(Getting worked up at the mention of the crooked teeth)

257
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,672
His teeth are crooked as much as mine.

258
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:15,142
- Your pronunciation is good.
- Of course.

259
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,882
- There are times I can surprise...
- Yes.

260
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:17,883
People with my skills.

261
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,582
You did something Yeon Shik couldn't do.

262
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,223
(They set off with the GPS activated.)

263
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:22,953
Gosh, I haven't been here in a while.

264
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,822
Suseong Lake looks beautiful.

265
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,903
- Suseong Lake is great.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?

266
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,863
I came to Suseong Lake to film "The Match."

267
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,462
Come to think of it, I watched all of your movies.

268
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:34,763
I watched "The Match" too.

269
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:35,963
(Gosh, Jae Suk.)

270
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:39,572
- Bong Sik is in so many projects.
- You have a lot of work now, right?

271
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:42,103
I've hit over 100 projects so far.

272
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:45,742
Bong Sik was in so many projects.

273
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,783
- He's in everything now.
- Yes. My gosh.

274
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:51,652
Yeon Seok and I almost worked together on a project.

275
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,252
- Right.
- We almost worked together.

276
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:55,823
I was going to play Yeon Seok's brother-in-law.

277
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,792
We almost got a chance to work together.

278
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,162
But he was busy.

279
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,333
- It overlapped with something else.
- Right.

280
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,692
Sung Kyun. Are you filming anything these days?

281
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,232
I'm taking a break.

282
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:09,832
- Isn't this your first break...
- Sung Kyun was...

283
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,232
- since your debut?
- in a lot of projects too.

284
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,872
- He was in many projects too.
- It's my first long break.

285
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,173
Right. It's your first one.

286
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,512
Then what are you up to these days?

287
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,442
You must be spending your time with your kids in Yangpyeong.

288
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:22,313
I've been mowing my lawn in Yangpyeong.

289
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,112
(The father of three living in Yangpyeong)

290
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,082
I mean, I mowed my lawn pretty recently too.

291
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,252
But it grew so fast.

292
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,582
He might be busier now...

293
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,152
- than when he was working.
- Right.

294
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,369
- Staying home can do that to you.
- Yes.

295
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:32,952
I hear grass grows so much...

296
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:34,092
- even overnight.
- Right.

297
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:35,822
I was mowing the left side. When I turned around, the grass...

298
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,362
- on the right side was growing.
- Right.

299
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:38,692
When I started to mow the right side,

300
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,253
the grass on the left side was growing.

301
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,102
Imagine mowing the lawn with the sun beating down on you.

302
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:44,532
- Right.
- You can't work outdoors...

303
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,932
- in the afternoon.
- Right.

304
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,302
Do you go to sleep early?

305
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:50,203
I'm a night owl. So I rarely sleep at night.

306
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,572
Do you go to sleep early, Bong Sik?

307
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,673
I'm an early riser.

308
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:54,782
I go to sleep at 10pm...

309
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,012
and then wake up at 5:30am at the latest.

310
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,682
Gosh, see? He and I have a similar routine.

311
00:09:57,683 --> 00:09:59,883
- At 5:30am?
- Bong Sik and I are similar.

312
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:01,452
- He doesn't drink either.
- What...

313
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,452
- That's a newborn's routine.
- Right.

314
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:04,522
- That's when I get sleepy.
- Once it hits 10pm,

315
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:05,552
I can't keep my eyes open.

316
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:07,269
- Right. I get sleepy too.
- You can't keep your eyes open?

317
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,062
Newborns aren't the only ones with that sleeping routine.

318
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,663
- Elders have the same routine.
- Right.

319
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,492
There was a reason...

320
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:13,792
- I changed my routine.
- What was it?

321
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,363
My first role...

322
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,902
- was in "Ode to My Father."
- Yes.

323
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:20,072
My scene was with none other than Hwang Jung Min.

324
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,203
I also had lines when it was my first role.

325
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,913
(A scene from "Ode to My Father")

326
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:27,483
(Bong Sik's first line ever)

327
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:29,183
(His co-star, Hwang Jung Min)

328
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:32,252
(You're holding out here and causing problems for everyone.)

329
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:36,052
(For his role, he had to argue with a great senior actor.)

330
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,083
Come on. Move them now.

331
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:41,662
I spent six months diligently memorizing just a few lines.

332
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:44,763
I was nervous. And my daily routine was just awful then.

333
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:48,203
Back then, I was rooming with hip-hop musicians.

334
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,733
- Hip-hop musicians?
- They had to make music at night.

335
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:53,503
- They had to make music?
- Really?

336
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:55,872
- Yes.
- You lived with hip-hop musicians?

337
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,842
Yes. I couldn't sleep at night, so I slept during the day.

338
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:01,082
I was already nervous.

339
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,182
And they changed the lines once we started filming.

340
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:04,482
(To make it worse, the lines were changed.)

341
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,152
- I messed up three takes.
- Okay.

342
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:08,382
The real-life merchant at the market said,

343
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,853
"He's an actor. Why can't he memorize the lines?"

344
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,262
- The merchant at the market?
- Yes.

345
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:16,023
"I'd do better than you."

346
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,773
I beat myself up for two weeks after that.

347
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,232
- Right.
- That's so funny.

348
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,802
After that, I realized this wasn't working.

349
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,633
I decided to adjust my daily routine to the filming schedule.

350
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,342
Now, he's known as the actor...

351
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:29,802
who doesn't mess up lines at the shoot.

352
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,313
- Really?
- Yes.

353
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:33,613
He's never taken any acting classes.

354
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,582
- Really?
- But...

355
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,212
So you never studied acting in school, right?

356
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,312
No. I started this career at the age of 30.

357
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,982
Then what did you do before this?

358
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,922
- I delivered packages.
- Packages?

359
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:43,982
Really?

360
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:47,153
I also drove cargo trucks. I once delivered rice.

361
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,122
Then how did you get into acting?

362
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,563
It's a long story.

363
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,932
I was going through the training...

364
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,813
to become an installation engineer for Samsung.

365
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,572
- We had to do a skit.
- What?

366
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:00,632
- A skit.
- To interact with customers?

367
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,942
- For customer interaction.
- I see.

368
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,702
- It was for customer service.
- I see.

369
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,142
- For customer service education.
- For example,

370
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,572
"What would you do in this situation?"

371
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:08,912
- I was the unreasonable customer.
- The unreasonable customer.

372
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,112
(Bong Sik played the role of an unreasonable customer.)

373
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,352
- When we did that... Yes.
- Your acting was too believable.

374
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,282
People who were watching me had fun.

375
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,323
- I had fun doing that too.
- People laughed a lot.

376
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:19,592
When I had to step down after that skit, I was a bit sad.

377
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:23,523
So I thought, "This is how actors make a living."

378
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,462
"They must be so happy." That was it back then.

379
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:27,562
That motivated you...

380
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,433
- to follow your passion.
- I wanted to follow my passion.

381
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,372
My gosh, Bong Sik.

382
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:34,772
- He has a fun debut story.
- Yes.

383
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:35,842
It's interesting.

384
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:37,972
- I should get his life story later.
- Yes.

385
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,372
(As they listen to Bong Sik's stories...)

386
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,413
This is the place.

387
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,682
- This is it.
- Okay.

388
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:42,763
- This is the place.
- Yes.

389
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:45,312
I see. The Chinese restaurant.

390
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,189
(They arrive at a Chinese restaurant as expected.)

391
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,283
Look. Who's that?

392
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:50,553
It's YoungTak.

393
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:52,423
YoungTak is standing there.

394
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,222
Did YoungTak eat at the restaurant?

395
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,504
(Why is there a life-sized cardboard cutout of YoungTak?)

396
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:57,932
- Gosh, this is the place.
- It's hot.

397
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:58,993
(The heatwave is intense.)

398
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,733
A lot of people are already here.

399
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,702
(They enter, receiving a warm welcome from the people.)

400
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:07,132
- Her name is Choi Su Bin.
- Hello.

401
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,142
- Hello.
- Hello.

402
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:10,042
My gosh. Are you Su Bin?

403
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,142
- Yes.
- Thank you.

404
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:12,972
- Gosh, hello.
- Hello.

405
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:14,142
Hello.

406
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,143
(Choi Su Bin, the first Whenever Guest)

407
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,312
(Choi Chun Nyeo, the mother, and Choi Bong Jun, the father)

408
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,912
- Your daughter wrote to our show.
- Yes.

409
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:19,952
The restaurant has been running...

410
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:20,953
- for 40 years?
- Yes.

411
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:22,153
- Really?
- My gosh.

412
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:23,982
(They have been serving...)

413
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,593
(consistent meals to their customers for 40 years.)

414
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,062
Hold on. Where should we sit down to talk?

415
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:32,192
- You can sit right here.
- Here?

416
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:33,592
Gosh, it's a hot day today.

417
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:34,762
- By the way...
- It's hot, isn't it?

418
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:35,832
- It's very hot.
- Yes.

419
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,862
How did this happen?

420
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,972
They knew we were coming. So many people came to see us.

421
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,872
- Yes. Word got around suddenly.
- They already...

422
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:42,402
- Really?
- Yes.

423
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,312
I guess word spread somehow.

424
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:46,973
My mother was the source. She told people at the supermarket.

425
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:51,152
- She's the town broadcaster.
- I see.

426
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:54,112
I only told my friend about the show.

427
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:57,322
- Then my friend told other friends.
- She must've told other people.

428
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,452
So the news kept spreading.

429
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,292
- You said only two people heard.
- Yes.

430
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:01,592
But I saw about 40 people out there.

431
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:04,122
I bet this is what she told her friend.

432
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,162
- "Don't tell anyone."
- Right.

433
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,202
I bet that was the first thing she said.

434
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:09,702
- So she told everyone.
- Yes.

435
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:10,863
Hold on. Your jjajangmyeon...

436
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,832
- costs only four dollars?
- Yes.

437
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,903
- What?
- What?

438
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,102
- It's only four dollars?
- Yes.

439
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,749
(A bowl of jjajangmyeon only costs 4 dollars?)

440
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,173
What? This is crazy.

441
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:20,742
- That's the real price.
- That was the price...

442
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:21,783
when I was in high school.

443
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:24,713
With that price, do you make any profits?

444
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:26,712
- Yes, it's a family-run restaurant.
- We make some profits.

445
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:27,922
Not a lot, though.

446
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:30,283
People in Daegu would say this. "You make money with that?"

447
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,823
- "You make money with that?"
- This is crazy.

448
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:35,322
Keeping the prices low makes it easier on the customers.

449
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,123
- Right.
- Cheap food must taste better.

450
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,492
- Right.
- That way, when they taste it,

451
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,702
they'll say our food is much better than expensive food.

452
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,432
- Right.
- It will give us a good reputation.

453
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,032
That's how we can keep the restaurant going.

454
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,472
What's a popular dish at your restaurant?

455
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:51,043
Fried rice and tangsuyuk. They are the popular dishes.

456
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:52,712
- Our tangsuyuk is famous.
- Tangsuyuk.

457
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,242
- That's our signature dish.
- I see.

458
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,542
- Really?
- It's tasty.

459
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,642
It's the traditional tangsuyuk. Ketchup goes into it.

460
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:58,652
(The traditional tangsuyuk with the ketchup base)

461
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:00,382
- That's the traditional recipe.
- Yes.

462
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,682
Su Bin, you wrote in your letter...

463
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,152
- that you work with your parents.
- Yes.

464
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,622
- You spend a lot of time together.
- Right.

465
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:07,022
So you work here, right?

466
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:09,093
- My father is the chef.
- I see.

467
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,362
(In charge of cooking)

468
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:12,532
- My mother is the assistant.
- She's the assistant.

469
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,533
(In charge of assisting)

470
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:14,902
I run the front-of-the-house service.

471
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:16,362
- I serve food, ring up customers, - You serve food.

472
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:17,462
And clear the tables. I do everything.

473
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,232
- My gosh.
- We've been...

474
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,732
- We've been working...
- She can handle everything alone.

475
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,802
As a team for a long time.

476
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,542
We don't have to talk to each other to get things done.

477
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:25,742
- You have good teamwork.
- Yes, we developed good teamwork.

478
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,612
- But here's the thing.
- Okay.

479
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:29,383
When you work with your family members,

480
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,282
- you have good teamwork, but...
- Yes. Right.

481
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:32,782
- But we also argue a lot.
- Right?

482
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,053
We fight every day.

483
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:37,892
- The station is nearby.
- Right.

484
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:41,293
- Both of us are Chois.
- I see.

485
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:43,362
- Chois are known to be stubborn.
- Stubborn Chois.

486
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,962
- They're both Chois.
- We should be patient.

487
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:46,162
But we're both Chois.

488
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,803
So we don't want to lose the argument.

489
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:50,632
You might be arguing, but when customers walk in...

490
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,772
- Right.
- "It's your fault."

491
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:52,902
- "Welcome."
- Yes.

492
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,942
- Right. That's it.
- We have a dual personality.

493
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:55,973
A dual personality.

494
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,172
You call that a dual personality?

495
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,112
He's the best at greeting our customers.

496
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:02,593
So my mom and I say this. "He should be nice to us like that."

497
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:05,052
- So...
- You know what I noticed?

498
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,352
The three of you work together.

499
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,353
But it's 2 against 1.

500
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,292
- Customers are king.
- You must be lonely.

501
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,552
- Customers are king.
- Yes.

502
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:15,073
- He's not listening to my comment.
- When customers come in...

503
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,422
No wonder.

504
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,962
I wouldn't gain anything...

505
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:21,033
if they didn't order from us.

506
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:23,203
He's a stubborn talker too.

507
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,672
- He just goes at it.
- Yes. He's a stubborn talker.

508
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:27,032
(He's unstoppable.)

509
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,042
I'd like to ask you something.

510
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:31,272
It crossed my mind that...

511
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,443
you might be lonely working at the restaurant.

512
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:36,142
There's a solution for that. I have a younger sister.

513
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,712
- You do?
- I see.

514
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,012
- My sister comes in, and...
- She sides with him?

515
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,053
Yes.

516
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,853
That daughter is on his side.

517
00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:46,922
So their dynamic is balanced.

518
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,393
- Yes.
- Right.

519
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:50,223
Why did you call her "that daughter?"

520
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,932
- "That daughter..."
- She sounded a bit bitter.

521
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,732
- Right.
- As if she weren't her daughter.

522
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:55,832
- Right.
- You know?

523
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,533
Seriously. She is on his side.

524
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:01,542
She always sides with him. And he always calls her...

525
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:02,872
- Princess.
- "Princess."

526
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:03,942
- He still calls her that...
- She's the youngest, right?

527
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,023
When she's a mother of two.

528
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:07,772
Why do you only call your youngest daughter Princess?

529
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:09,183
That's the thing with her.

530
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:13,013
My youngest daughter will always be young to me.

531
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,453
Well, of course.

532
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:18,492
She must be. She is the youngest daughter.

533
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:21,123
- She's the youngest daughter.
- Bong Sik.

534
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:23,862
- Bong Sik laughed pretty hard.
- Because we...

535
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:26,293
- We live together.
- Because we live together,

536
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:28,733
I see that she takes care of everything.

537
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,562
So I call her by her name.

538
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:34,072
Family and business matters should be separated, though.

539
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,172
- Right.
- But being together...

540
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:36,643
- all the time...
- Yes...

541
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,812
- I mean, it must be good too.
- That's why...

542
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:39,872
we're on our own during weekends.

543
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,413
For those two days, he goes hiking.

544
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:44,312
She goes out with her friends.

545
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,212
Can I ask you what your hobby is?

546
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:48,783
We saw the life-sized cardboard cutout of YoungTak.

547
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:51,393
- I'm his fan.
- She likes YoungTak.

548
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:53,292
I saw his merchandise inside too.

549
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,062
- There was one at the door too.
- My gosh. He's...

550
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:57,892
- He's all over the restaurant.
- Right here too.

551
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,493
- You're his fan.
- Yes.

552
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,733
She went to his concert too.

553
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:03,903
If there's one in Seoul, she goes to that one too.

554
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,503
- I get the ticket for her.
- You get it for her.

555
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:08,902
If YoungTak comes by the restaurant...

556
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,542
- after a concert in Daegu, - You...

557
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,872
- you'd so thrilled.
- That would be lovely.

558
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:15,813
If he were to come here, jjajangmyeon...

559
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,013
Gosh, she'll give it to him for free.

560
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,422
I must cook him something better than that.

561
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:22,852
- Really?
- Yes.

562
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,123
Do you follow any celebrity, sir?

563
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,693
Kim Yong Im.

564
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,323
Kim Yong Im.

565
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:32,932
- Kim Yong Im.
- Tighten it hard

566
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,563
- With the rope - Right.

567
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:38,032
- I see. You like Kim Yong Im.
- Her songs are powerful.

568
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,732
He was waiting for it. Kim Yong Im.

569
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,442
- He's a huge fan of Kim Yong Im's.
- Kim Yong Im?

570
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:45,843
- He went to her concert too.
- Really?

571
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,643
There's something about her that draws me in.

572
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,482
If she grabs my hand...

573
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:53,512
He's truly happy.

574
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:55,652
- He really likes her.
- Yes, he does.

575
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:58,422
His posture changed when we started to talk about her.

576
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:00,322
(He's more involved now with his new posture.)

577
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:01,323
(Embarrassed)

578
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,463
My gosh.

579
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,963
If you don't mind me asking, what was it like when you two dated?

580
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:07,692
Did your husband...

581
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,402
- I pursued her.
- Really?

582
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:11,972
You pursued her?

583
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:14,942
He was learning how to cook Chinese food in Seoul...

584
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,502
- when he was a bachelor.
- I see. So...

585
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:17,672
- you learned it in Seoul?
- That's when I learned it.

586
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,042
- When he was learning how to cook?
- Yes.

587
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,483
He pursued me relentlessly when I wasn't interested.

588
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:23,513
He did?

589
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,329
What did you tell her when you confessed your feelings?

590
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,273
- There was no romantic confession.
- He just...

591
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,182
- I just followed her around.
- He told me...

592
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:31,492
- to come with him.
- I asked her to live with me.

593
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:32,553
"Live with me?"

594
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:34,692
He followed her around.

595
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:35,962
- And he asked her to live with him.
- "Live with me."

596
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,792
- But these days...
- That's how it was back then.

597
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,462
- Sir, I'm from Daegu.
- It's not like that now.

598
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,863
- My wife is also from Daegu.
- Yes.

599
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,533
She's the quiet one.

600
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,472
- Really?
- I'm the one who acts cute.

601
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:47,002
(Sung Kyun is the feminine type.)

602
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:50,342
Su Bin, what made you write to our show?

603
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:52,472
I've been watching the show from the first episode.

604
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,012
- Really?
- Is that so?

605
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:55,812
- I'm a huge fan.
- I see.

606
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,813
I wanted my parents to have fun and laugh...

607
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,713
during their spare time.

608
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:02,682
I have my daughter to thank...

609
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:04,483
- for this honor to meet you all.
- My mom...

610
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,922
Anyway, now that we're here,

611
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:09,622
- we...
- I hope we can give many presents.

612
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,122
- For this to end on a happy note, - Yes.

613
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,432
- it's important to win presents.
- Right.

614
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:13,893
Bong Sik and Sung Kyun...

615
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,202
- We...
- Excuse me.

616
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:16,363
Why is Lee Kwang Soo calling?

617
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,032
Lee Kwang Soo?

618
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,502
- Why is he suddenly calling us?
- Lee Kwang Soo?

619
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,802
(Handing over the cell phone)

620
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,703
- Hello?
- You...

621
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:23,973
Hello.

622
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,372
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

623
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:28,443
What? Jae Suk!

624
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,383
Kwang Soo.

625
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,953
- Jae Suk.
- Why did you call me?

626
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,682
(This is Bong Sik's phone.)

627
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:37,723
What?

628
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,952
(Kwang Soo is confused.)

629
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:42,223
Kwang Soo, I'm filming a show. Why did you call me?

630
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:44,162
- It's mine.
- Oh, it's yours.

631
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:46,763
Wait. No. This isn't your phone number.

632
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,632
You called me.

633
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,102
I'll call you later.

634
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:52,549
I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of my shoot.

635
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:53,603
What?

636
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,843
- All right.
- Can you just hang up like that?

637
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,173
Excuse me.

638
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:00,013
I got a call in the middle of our shoot.

639
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,143
So where were we?

640
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,012
We have bonus coupons.

641
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:07,759
We're going to roll it to win the bonus coupons.

642
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,122
Bong Sik, it's your first time here.

643
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:10,403
- Bong Sik, you do it.
- Try it.

644
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:11,622
- Here.
- Okay.

645
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:12,823
Throw it here.

646
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:14,352
- It can fall on the floor.
- Yes.

647
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,362
- Okay.
- No pressure.

648
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:16,603
- No, you can't spin it.
- Hey.

649
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:18,562
Gosh, that was so interesting.

650
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,562
- Well, that's not so bad.
- What...

651
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:22,663
- That's an interesting method.
- Well...

652
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,303
(He tries it properly this time.)

653
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,473
What is it?

654
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,273
- What is it?
- My gosh.

655
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,412
(They fail to obtain any coupons.)

656
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:34,573
Zero.

657
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:37,183
It's okay.

658
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:38,552
- It's okay.
- No, it's okay.

659
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:40,282
- We can do it in 10 tries.
- We can do it in 10 tries.

660
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,353
Only 2 sides have 0 on them. But that's what I got?

661
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,793
All right. Let's begin with Round One.

662
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:50,463
"We're always on our feet in the hall and kitchen."

663
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,832
"We need to take care of our legs after work."

664
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,992
"Leg massager."

665
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,433
(Prize for Round 1, leg massager)

666
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,102
- My gosh. Here.
- I bet the massages feel great.

667
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:00,543
I've never seen a massager this big.

668
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:02,972
I see. You can also massage your calves with this.

669
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,972
- The calves too.
- The calf massager.

670
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:06,012
The calf massager.

671
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:07,912
(Restaurant Table Ping Pong)

672
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:09,312
(They will split into 2 teams of 2 and stand in front of the table.)

673
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:13,782
(They will use pots to play table tennis.)

674
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:15,452
(Round 1)

675
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,723
(Complete a 10-shot rally.)

676
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,023
- We must rally?
- A rally?

677
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:22,292
- But with the pots?
- Yes.

678
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:24,932
- Then the teams...
- We just have to rally ten times?

679
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,509
(The utensil boxes will serve as the net.)

680
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,832
We might be able to succeed.

681
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,473
Everyone must hit the ball at least once.

682
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:32,202
I'm good at table tennis.

683
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:35,943
(What does table tennis mean to them?)

684
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:39,073
We did it!

685
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,524
(The success rate for table tennis missions, 100 percent)

686
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:45,523
(They created countless miracles with table tennis.)

687
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:48,603
(Table tennis is a sure way to complete the mission.)

688
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:52,753
(The two of them are invincible when it comes to table tennis.)

689
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:54,822
We might be able to succeed.

690
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,022
You must rally at least ten times.

691
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:58,333
(Jae Suk and Yeon Seok seem confident.)

692
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,162
- But you never played it with pots.
- No, not with pots.

693
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,709
- Hold on. This is...
- Can you play table tennis?

694
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,263
A bit. I mean, I can play...

695
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:05,823
- Bong Sik, are you good?
- We...

696
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,473
Then Bong Sik and I will team up.

697
00:23:09,003 --> 00:23:10,242
- You...
- It's 2 on 2?

698
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:11,272
Yes, it's 2 on 2.

699
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:13,842
- Come here, Sung Kyun.
- Bong Sik and I will team up.

700
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:15,342
But you don't need to alternate with your partner.

701
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,642
We just have to make sure...

702
00:23:16,643 --> 00:23:18,003
- we all hit the ball once.
- Yes.

703
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:19,682
(They start practicing.)

704
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,713
My gosh.

705
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,082
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

706
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,253
- We have 10 tries, right?
- We have 10 tries.

707
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:26,253
- We have to engage in a rally.
- A rally?

708
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:27,852
- It went that way.
- Yes, go.

709
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:29,662
(Practicing)

710
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:30,793
Try to...

711
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:34,363
Bong Sik.

712
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:35,779
- You're not good with your hands.
- No.

713
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:37,302
I'm not good with ball sports.

714
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:39,803
- You know, he did judo.
- Hey.

715
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:42,242
- He's good at pulling.
- You did judo?

716
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:44,072
- Yes.
- He mostly pulls.

717
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:45,212
(Bong Sik used to be a judo athlete in school.)

718
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:46,672
- Then hit it...
- Just tap it gently.

719
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:48,342
- only when you feel confident.
- Okay.

720
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,343
You don't have to keep hitting.

721
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,582
- We just need ten exchanges.
- Okay.

722
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,783
- Let's try again.
- But you must hit it at least once.

723
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:57,183
It keeps going out whenever you hit it.

724
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,852
(The ball goes out of bounds whenever Bong Sik hits it.)

725
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:00,992
- All right.
- Bong Sik.

726
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:02,462
I want to sharpen the pot this much.

727
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:04,293
Then let him serve.

728
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:05,562
- Let me.
- Yes.

729
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:07,533
Bong Sik can serve.

730
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,303
Okay. Good. My gosh.

731
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,763
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

732
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:12,803
Okay. Good. My gosh.

733
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,273
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

734
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:16,103
I'm good.

735
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,872
If we were playing against them, this would've been good.

736
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:20,042
But we need to keep the rally going.

737
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,923
- It must go back and forth.
- This is so hard.

738
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:24,243
(Meanwhile, Sung Kyun on the other side...)

739
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,883
I can't control my power.

740
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:27,682
- Two.
- That's it.

741
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:28,683
Three.

742
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:30,433
- I missed it.
- It's this hard?

743
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,693
I'm hitting it too hard.

744
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,152
Why can't we go up to ten times?

745
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:35,492
- So, 10 times?
- Yes, 10 times.

746
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,892
- This isn't hard.
- We need to...

747
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,432
- This isn't hard.
- We need to rally...

748
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,333
- at least 7 or 8 times.
- Right.

749
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:43,762
(Practicing)

750
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:44,972
My gosh.

751
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:46,272
(Smashing)

752
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,102
Sung Kyun, don't try to win the rally.

753
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,243
(It's not a real match.)

754
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:52,389
- Just get it over to their side.
- I couldn't help it.

755
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:54,142
- So you wanted to score a point?
- It just happened.

756
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,412
- Just get it over to that side.
- I couldn't help it. I forgot.

757
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,982
We can't beat our opponents.

758
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,053
Why can't we do it?

759
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:01,413
I really hope we can give them the present.

760
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:05,423
We don't have to alternate with our partner like the real game.

761
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:07,792
- Keep the rally going. Hit it once.
- Bong Sik.

762
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:08,862
Bong Sik should serve.

763
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:10,892
- You can hit it back then.
- I'll hit it back.

764
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,392
- Then you two can finish.
- We'll keep the rally going.

765
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:13,563
So that's our strategy.

766
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,703
Good luck!

767
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,173
Let's try that.

768
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,003
- Two. That's it.
- That's it.

769
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:26,772
- I think we can do this.
- Okay. This is our strategy.

770
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:28,442
- Yeon Shik. Don't smash it.
- Okay.

771
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,512
(Be careful with the smash shots.)

772
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:31,312
- No smashing or playing offense.
- So...

773
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:32,752
This is a good strategy.

774
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,652
We're getting the hang of it.

775
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:35,952
- All right.
- We can give it a try.

776
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,982
- Let's do it.
- Stick to this strategy.

777
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,192
- Are we going to do it?
- All right.

778
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:41,433
- A group cheer for Round One.
- Let's do a group cheer.

779
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:43,169
- All right. A group cheer.
- Good luck.

780
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,263
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.

781
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:47,492
- All right.
- It's try number one.

782
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:48,662
We might have a shot at this.

783
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,202
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

784
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:51,562
- We might have a shot at this.
- Here we go.

785
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:52,633
Ready.

786
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:56,703
Two.

787
00:25:58,443 --> 00:25:59,513
It's over.

788
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,693
(The ball couldn't go over the boxes.)

789
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,542
- It's over.
- That shot was short.

790
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:05,253
- I hit it too hard.
- I'm sorry. I...

791
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:07,212
- I hit it too hard.
- I'm sorry. I...

792
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:08,283
I hit it too hard.

793
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:10,383
Try to hit it higher.

794
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:11,892
My gosh.

795
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,392
- It should fly up.
- It should go up higher.

796
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:14,523
Yes, it should.

797
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:16,792
- It should go up higher.
- All right. Hit it higher. Hold on.

798
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,362
- All right. It's try number 2.
- Try number 2.

799
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:19,632
We can do this. In 1, 2, 3.

800
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:20,862
- Let's go.
- Ready.

801
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:24,362
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

802
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,373
Set.

803
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:27,773
- What?
- Hold on.

804
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:30,672
(Bouncing)

805
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,773
- What?
- Hold on.

806
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:33,812
- It hit my hand.
- It's over.

807
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:34,972
- This...
- Come on.

808
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,113
- Your service...
- Bong Sik, don't be nervous.

809
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:38,712
- Bong Sik.
- You...

810
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:40,713
- You get nervous in real matches.
- Bong Sik.

811
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:42,882
Bong Sik. You did judo.

812
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:44,483
- You competed in matches before.
- Yes.

813
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:45,903
- Don't be nervous.
- Okay.

814
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:47,222
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

815
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:48,722
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

816
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:50,622
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.

817
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:51,832
It's already try number three?

818
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,362
- Try number three. Ready. Set.
- Be confident.

819
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,323
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

820
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,033
Two.

821
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:00,103
Two.

822
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,373
Three. We got it.

823
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:03,373
Four, five, six...

824
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:07,373
Six, seven, eight...

825
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:10,383
- Seven, eight, nine, - Eight...

826
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:15,053
- Ten.
- We did it!

827
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:17,852
(They clear Round 1!)

828
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,092
(They did it!)

829
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:20,253
- We did it!
- We did it!

830
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:23,662
(Amazing!)

831
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:25,093
- Yes!
- Yes!

832
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,532
Great strategy.

833
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,003
Let's go!

834
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,032
- Let's go.
- Yes.

835
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,572
- Great.
- Round One,

836
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,633
- success!
- Success!

837
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,672
- Amazing.
- So,

838
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:38,343
they've now secured the leg massager.

839
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,673
Now, you need to decide...

840
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:42,582
on whether to go for Round Two...

841
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,082
or stop.

842
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,083
- We did great.
- Yes.

843
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:48,282
We do have a lot of tries left.

844
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,522
- About seven tries?
- Yes.

845
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,523
Yes, seven tries.

846
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:53,293
I'm in great condition in Daegu today.

847
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:56,063
- Great.
- You two had great teamwork.

848
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,892
- Do you want to go or stop?
- In 1, 2, 3.

849
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,033
- Go.
- Go.

850
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:01,463
It was obvious.

851
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,063
Sir, why don't you try picking one?

852
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,572
You can read the content.

853
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:06,732
Can you read it?

854
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:07,873
Please read it.

855
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:11,642
"You must stay fit by going on walks every day."

856
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:13,113
"Three pairs of walking shoes."

857
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,842
(Three pairs of walking shoes to help them stay fit)

858
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,512
You must enjoy hiking.

859
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:19,983
- My dad does.
- I see.

860
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:22,053
Walking shoes!

861
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:23,782
Great.

862
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:24,982
(Delivering the presents for Round 2)

863
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,522
We need to succeed in Round Two.

864
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:28,963
Even the colors are...

865
00:28:29,723 --> 00:28:30,922
(He loves it.)

866
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:31,992
It's cute.

867
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:34,162
We need to finish Round Two.

868
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:35,803
Bong Sik is in great condition right now.

869
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:39,773
(Practicing in the meantime)

870
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,172
You're good, Bong Sik!

871
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:44,502
This is good. You're doing great.

872
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:46,573
(The rally doesn't stop.)

873
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:48,513
What?

874
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:50,912
Great. Bong Sik is looking good.

875
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:53,253
Bong Sik, are you using both hands?

876
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:55,483
No, I was just holding yours.

877
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:57,822
So, what's Round Two?

878
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,192
(Round 2)

879
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:01,723
(The pots are now ladles.)

880
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,963
- What?
- Ladles?

881
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:05,292
But we just got used to it.

882
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,969
- We just got used to it!
- We just got used to it.

883
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:09,233
- That's so harsh.
- They'll give you spoons next.

884
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:12,502
The target is way smaller.

885
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,803
What will we do if we make it to Round Three?

886
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:16,343
We just got used to it, though.

887
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,543
Bong Sik tried so hard...

888
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:20,843
He practiced so hard!

889
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:23,582
(Flustered)

890
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:24,783
This is really...

891
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:26,913
It's way too hard!

892
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,323
It absorbs the hit.

893
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:31,493
Where have you been keeping this? It's so hot.

894
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:32,922
It doesn't work.

895
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:34,399
(It's been heated under the sun in Daegu.)

896
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:35,523
This is...

897
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:38,492
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

898
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:40,093
It feels different.

899
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,233
It feels totally different.

900
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:43,802
What strategy should we use?

901
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,162
It should be a short grip.

902
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,903
(Looking stable)

903
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:49,542
When it hits the edge...

904
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:50,543
You're doing great.

905
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:52,973
(Bong Sik got the hang of it.)

906
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:54,612
Bong Sik's got the hang of it.

907
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:56,313
Keep going, Bong Sik.

908
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:57,713
Okay.

909
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:59,512
I'm the worst player.

910
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:01,212
Bong Sik holds it with a short grip.

911
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:02,922
Oh, we should use a shortened grip.

912
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:04,123
(Short grip)

913
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:08,322
I'm the worst one.

914
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,663
I don't think I'm the worst one anymore.

915
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:11,793
(Self-conscious)

916
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:13,892
- Hey, Sung Kyun.
- I'm the worst one.

917
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,332
I should...

918
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,162
I'll hit it once and get out of your way.

919
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:18,902
Don't stay completely away. Stay next to him...

920
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,709
- I still need your help.
- and cover for him.

921
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:21,773
Again.

922
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:24,143
- Don't step away, Bong Sik.
- There you go.

923
00:30:24,743 --> 00:30:27,873
- When that happens...
- Stop smashing the ball.

924
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:31,043
- Stop attacking.
- Why do you keep attacking?

925
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:33,583
- Receive it when that happens.
- Okay.

926
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:34,813
Why would you...

927
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:40,252
(Practicing)

928
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:42,163
I think we figured it out.

929
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:45,592
- Now...
- Should we give it a try?

930
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,992
- I feel good.
- Let's try it.

931
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:48,162
- Let's do it.
- I'm feeling it.

932
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:49,163
Round Two.

933
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,132
It's try number four.

934
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,432
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Let's go!

935
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,673
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

936
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,302
- Ready.
- Try number four.

937
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:56,343
Don't we get ten tries?

938
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:58,443
- Did we use 4 tries?
- Yes, this is your 4th one.

939
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:00,213
- We used 4 tries.
- No, we used 3 tries.

940
00:31:00,243 --> 00:31:01,612
- Then...
- It doesn't reset.

941
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:02,643
- Really?
- Yes.

942
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:04,242
But you've been on this show.

943
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,383
(On Whenever Possible)

944
00:31:06,453 --> 00:31:07,783
This is my first time.

945
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:12,023
- We have seven tries left.
- Ready.

946
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:13,393
Set.

947
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,393
That's good.

948
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:23,303
Keep going.

949
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,233
No!

950
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:26,803
It hit the net.

951
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:28,303
Keep going.

952
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:30,143
(Screaming)

953
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:31,743
It hit the net.

954
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:34,443
No!

955
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:35,982
It hit the net.

956
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:38,142
(Failure)

957
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:39,213
It was a bit short.

958
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:41,083
It looked pretty good just now.

959
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,652
It was a bit short.

960
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:43,682
(Too bad)

961
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:45,692
- Gosh.
- I think we can make it...

962
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:46,822
as long as we play just like this.

963
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,493
- All right, then.
- Okay.

964
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:50,492
- We're doing fine now.
- Let's do a cheer.

965
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,663
- All right.
- Okay.

966
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:54,262
- Let's make it.
- In 1, 2, 3.

967
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:55,263
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

968
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:58,132
- Ready.
- This is try number five.

969
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,172
Set.

970
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:01,133
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

971
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:08,613
Good!

972
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:11,743
Good!

973
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:13,153
(Failure)

974
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:14,352
I lightly smashed it.

975
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:15,722
When it goes that way,

976
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:17,023
we need to scoop it up.

977
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:19,223
I hit it too low.

978
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:20,822
(Getting worried)

979
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:22,262
The surface is...

980
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,593
We're already on try number six.

981
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,862
- Gosh, I'm about to sweat.
- This is bad.

982
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,143
We're already on try number six.

983
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,572
- We can do this.
- In 1, 2, 3.

984
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:33,932
- Here we go.
- Get ready.

985
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:37,842
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

986
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:38,843
Set.

987
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:40,773
Mine.

988
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:42,713
Good.

989
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:47,353
Keep going.

990
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,182
Six, seven,

991
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,123
- eight, nine...
- Eight, nine...

992
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:53,653
One more!

993
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:56,423
One more!

994
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,263
(One more!)

995
00:32:59,763 --> 00:33:01,133
- Nine.
- One more!

996
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,233
Ten.

997
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:09,003
(They passed Round 2!)

998
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:14,313
(We did it!)

999
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:19,152
(Touched)

1000
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:22,113
(Cheering)

1001
00:33:25,823 --> 00:33:28,493
(Thrilled)

1002
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:31,293
- Well done.
- Good job.

1003
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:33,893
- That was tricky.
- I was so nervous.

1004
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:36,733
Sung Kyun and Bong Sik got the hang of it now.

1005
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:40,633
That's the thing about desperation.

1006
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,042
That was amazing.

1007
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:44,743
You get better every time.

1008
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:47,442
So, they've secured...

1009
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,512
- the walking shoes.
- Yes!

1010
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:50,312
(They got the leg massager and three pairs of shoes.)

1011
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,352
It's a tough decision now.

1012
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:54,112
- We have...
- Right.

1013
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:55,212
Four attempts left.

1014
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,783
- Four attempts.
- Four tries.

1015
00:33:57,783 --> 00:33:59,252
- Think hard.
- Yes.

1016
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,652
I don't think he'll be too greedy...

1017
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:03,092
as you can tell from the price.

1018
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:04,722
It must be a lot of pressure.

1019
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,733
- But as you can see, - But who knows?

1020
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:09,003
- we've gotten a lot better.
- That's true.

1021
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:11,702
- What do you think?
- Will you go for it or stop?

1022
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:13,032
- The three of you...
- Now,

1023
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,593
- can discuss it.
- you can discuss it.

1024
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:16,242
Go or stop?

1025
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:17,842
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1026
00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:18,873
Stop.

1027
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:23,142
- Great.
- But we were...

1028
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:25,652
- We got a lot better, though.
- We did.

1029
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:28,282
But the next racket will be far smaller.

1030
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:31,653
- We will give them...
- The presents.

1031
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:35,393
The presents from Rounds 1 and 2.

1032
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:37,822
Here. These are souvenirs.

1033
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:39,362
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1034
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:40,933
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

1035
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:43,002
- I'm so relieved.
- Yes.

1036
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:44,332
Gosh.

1037
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,902
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1038
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:47,972
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for your work.

1039
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,449
(Wrapping it up on a satisfying note)

1040
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:52,612
By the way, do you have a reservation for lunch anywhere?

1041
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,042
Let me make you some tangsuyuk.

1042
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:55,472
- You should have some.
- We have 15 minutes left.

1043
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,942
- Should we?
- We'll taste it.

1044
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,312
- Sure.
- Yes, just a little.

1045
00:34:58,313 --> 00:34:59,653
I'll make you a plate.

1046
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:01,653
Isn't it too much work, though?

1047
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,422
No, he's been wanting to cook for you.

1048
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:06,452
- It won't take long.
- Okay.

1049
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:09,092
The tangsuyuk...

1050
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:10,593
that he recommended earlier.

1051
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:13,763
- Right.
- So, we should give it a taste.

1052
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,843
- But the weather is so hot.
- I was so worried about failing.

1053
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:19,533
I'll cook a bunch,

1054
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,403
so everyone should try it.

1055
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:26,143
(He deep-fries the meat...)

1056
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,673
(and stir-fries the sweet sauce.)

1057
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,813
(The color of tangsuyuk made by a chef with 40 years of experience)

1058
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:35,553
Gosh, I'm sweating.

1059
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:38,183
- We succeeded.
- Yes, I'm so glad.

1060
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,293
- It's such a relief.
- I was genuinely worried.

1061
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:42,092
- Right.
- I was so happy...

1062
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,223
when he stopped.

1063
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,862
Imagine failing after coming all the way to Daegu.

1064
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:47,962
It broke my heart to see you fail.

1065
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,033
Exactly.

1066
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:50,962
- At the elementary school.
- Yes.

1067
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:52,202
Here it is. Thank you.

1068
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:53,533
Here's your food.

1069
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:56,202
Bong Sik, you're the youngest, so pour some soy sauce.

1070
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:57,243
Yes, boss.

1071
00:35:57,703 --> 00:35:59,173
I'll pour the soy sauce.

1072
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:00,812
Bong Sik knows how to treat his boss well.

1073
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,272
- Come on, Bong Sik.
- Gosh.

1074
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:03,813
- He spilled some.
- I was rushing.

1075
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:05,213
And then...

1076
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:07,113
(He spilled more.)

1077
00:36:07,953 --> 00:36:10,483
(Laughing)

1078
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:12,952
But we said...

1079
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,593
Here's our food.

1080
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:17,962
- It looks...
- It's...

1081
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:19,463
made with ketchup, isn't it?

1082
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,963
He stir-fried it with the sauce.

1083
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:23,503
Yes, he mixes it first.

1084
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:26,003
- So that the sauce soaks in?
- Yes.

1085
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:28,033
Bong Sik is such a Gen MZ.

1086
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:29,542
He is delicate.

1087
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:31,543
He's a Gen MZ, but he squints like this.

1088
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,942
(Holding it up)

1089
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,812
You look so weird!

1090
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,533
Apparently, that's how Gen MZ takes photos.

1091
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,452
That's just a photo of the tops of our heads.

1092
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:41,512
It is.

1093
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:42,652
Enjoy the food.

1094
00:36:42,653 --> 00:36:44,552
- Thank you for the food!
- My dad...

1095
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,922
actually collected these mushrooms.

1096
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:47,923
Really?

1097
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:49,592
- The wood ear mushrooms?
- Yes.

1098
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:50,939
You can find them in the mountains.

1099
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,122
- This is so rare.
- Yes.

1100
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:54,793
- They're natural wood ears.
- They're very soft.

1101
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:56,963
- Thanks for the food.
- It already looks...

1102
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:59,273
- Enjoy the food.
- Yes, thank you.

1103
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,443
(Jae Suk tries the meat first.)

1104
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:05,543
- It's good.
- It's tasty.

1105
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:07,743
It's soft, isn't it?

1106
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,083
They're usually tough, but these ones are soft.

1107
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:11,812
- It's delicious.
- Do you like it?

1108
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,813
Yes.

1109
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:15,952
It's the type of tangsuyuk from the old days.

1110
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,023
Yes.

1111
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,193
It's very soft.

1112
00:37:21,353 --> 00:37:22,353
It's good.

1113
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:23,993
It's hot.

1114
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:26,343
No wonder he's been running this place for 40 years.

1115
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:29,123
- You know, - It's sweet and sour.

1116
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:30,883
- It's so tasty.
- although it's good,

1117
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,493
but everyone, including him, is watching us as we eat.

1118
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,042
(Tending them from a close distance)

1119
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,643
That's autumn squash.

1120
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:42,173
- Autumn squash?
- Yes.

1121
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:44,413
It's so healthy.

1122
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:49,482
(It's a burdensome meal.)

1123
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:50,623
This is so...

1124
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:51,953
It's scrumptious.

1125
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,553
(Proud)

1126
00:37:54,753 --> 00:37:55,762
Visit us again when you're free.

1127
00:37:55,763 --> 00:37:57,692
Yes, I'll come by when I come back to Daegu.

1128
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:58,792
- So will I.
- Yes.

1129
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,953
I'll make you delicious food.

1130
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:02,502
- Thank you for the food.
- I want to try the udon next.

1131
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:03,532
Right.

1132
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,562
Thank you for the food, sir.

1133
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:06,723
- I really enjoyed it.
- I'll come back for your udon.

1134
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:08,032
Stay healthy.

1135
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:09,142
(Singing out of nowhere)

1136
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:10,373
(Jjiniya)

1137
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:14,312
(He returns the favor with a performance.)

1138
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:15,412
I hope to see you again.

1139
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:17,242
(Jae Suk is excited.)

1140
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:18,243
(The audience is pleased.)

1141
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:19,653
- Let's go.
- Bye.

1142
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:20,983
Thank you.

1143
00:38:22,153 --> 00:38:23,783
It's hot outside. Go back in.

1144
00:38:24,623 --> 00:38:26,693
(He gets in the car in a good mood.)

1145
00:38:26,993 --> 00:38:28,022
I can't believe...

1146
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:29,692
(It's currently 11:03am.)

1147
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:31,792
We should get the address from Sung Kyun.

1148
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:32,793
Yes.

1149
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:36,702
It's 1891, Daemyeong-dong, Nam-gu, Daegu.

1150
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:37,703
(Where are they headed?)

1151
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:38,903
You wanted to go somewhere.

1152
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,573
- In Daegu, - Yes.

1153
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:43,442
- a friend of mine...
- Does your friend run a place?

1154
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:44,573
Runs a ramen place.

1155
00:38:45,343 --> 00:38:46,542
- A ramen place?
- Yes.

1156
00:38:46,543 --> 00:38:47,772
(He cautiously recommends his friend's ramen.)

1157
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:48,773
But...

1158
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,783
do we have to eat ramen in Daegu?

1159
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,412
Well, we can eat something else.

1160
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:55,582
I'm fine with eating ramen.

1161
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,053
I'm also fine, but...

1162
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:58,252
(The noodle lovers like the idea.)

1163
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,293
It's very tasty.

1164
00:38:59,393 --> 00:39:02,153
I'm sure I'll like it when I'm actually there.

1165
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:05,022
So, he's your hometown friend...

1166
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,592
- in Daegu, right?
- Yes.

1167
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:08,232
It's like reuniting...

1168
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:09,262
with a friend.

1169
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,133
- Exactly. We just go.
- It's a reunion.

1170
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,972
I also want to eat various dishes...

1171
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:16,572
when I go to my hometown,

1172
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,442
but I end up going to my friend's place.

1173
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:19,443
- That's true.
- Yes.

1174
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,113
Most of my friends are in Daegu,

1175
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,843
and they gather once in a while.

1176
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:28,953
I see a group photo of them when they do,

1177
00:39:29,113 --> 00:39:30,152
and I get so jealous.

1178
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:33,192
Right. I should reunite with some of my friends...

1179
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:34,793
from high school.

1180
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:38,292
Every time we set a date, something comes up,

1181
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,592
so I can never see all of them.

1182
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:41,192
- I feel so bad.
- Right.

1183
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:42,863
- It's not that easy.
- It isn't.

1184
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:46,232
I have friends who are like brothers.

1185
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:49,543
When I can't visit my mom on holidays because of a shoot,

1186
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,272
my friends visit her instead.

1187
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:52,402
- Really?
- Really?

1188
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:53,572
- In Busan?
- Yes.

1189
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:56,513
- They really are like family.
- That's...

1190
00:39:56,713 --> 00:39:57,983
pure devotion.

1191
00:39:58,213 --> 00:40:00,983
And I have about ten of those friends.

1192
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:04,682
I was wondering when Chuseok would be,

1193
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:06,822
and it's just around the corner.

1194
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,522
Then the cold wind blows, and it's winter in no time.

1195
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:10,223
Yes, then it's the end of the year.

1196
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:12,223
Another year added to my age.

1197
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,033
I'm aging too fast.

1198
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,263
That's enough, life. I've aged enough.

1199
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,873
I've aged enough.

1200
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,502
Ever since I turned 40, I've been wanting...

1201
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:25,843
- to grow older slowly.
- Right?

1202
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:27,573
Time flies.

1203
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:29,513
I can't exactly feel it.

1204
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:31,643
- Why not?
- What?

1205
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,613
- Why not?
- I've always looked old.

1206
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:35,482
You've always looked like you were in your 40s?

1207
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:36,983
You aged a lot within a short time,

1208
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:38,422
and you're aging slowly now.

1209
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:39,452
- Right.
- Bong Sik is...

1210
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:42,253
Bong Sik can only get younger now.

1211
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:44,692
He finally looks his age.

1212
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,463
- Exactly.
- He finally does.

1213
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:48,933
Is this it?

1214
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:50,733
I think we're here.

1215
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,732
We can ask them to move the cone.

1216
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,773
- I'll move the cone.
- When he comes...

1217
00:40:56,973 --> 00:40:58,373
Bong Sik is moving them.

1218
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:01,442
It's very modern.

1219
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:02,543
(Just standing there)

1220
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:04,682
It looks nice.

1221
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:05,713
Oh, are you the owner?

1222
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:08,053
Welcome.

1223
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,923
I've been waiting.

1224
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:12,693
- Hello.
- Mr. Yang.

1225
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:14,753
- Hey.
- Hello.

1226
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:16,922
- We have a reunion.
- My friend.

1227
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:18,222
- It's nice to see you again.
- Yes.

1228
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,433
I should make a deep bow.

1229
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,093
May we come in?

1230
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,762
Thank you. It's a big restaurant.

1231
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:24,832
Let's eat here.

1232
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,633
- Bong Sik.
- Yes.

1233
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:27,933
But...

1234
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,643
You know,

1235
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:32,713
Sung Kyun was telling us how good your food was.

1236
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:35,123
We heard that you've been friends since high school.

1237
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,283
Yes.

1238
00:41:36,883 --> 00:41:39,113
- Unfortunately.
- Did you say, "Unfortunately?"

1239
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:41,053
Gosh.

1240
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:44,553
What?

1241
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,152
I'm nervous.

1242
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:47,193
You're nervous?

1243
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:48,593
(Not used to seeing his friend like this)

1244
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:51,323
- Don't be too nervous.
- We'll let you cook.

1245
00:41:51,723 --> 00:41:53,592
I see Sung Kyun's autograph.

1246
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:54,863
I've been here before.

1247
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:57,503
I came here last time,

1248
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:59,333
and there were lots of customers.

1249
00:41:59,503 --> 00:42:01,183
It was my friend's place, so I meant to...

1250
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,702
tell the customers that he was my friend...

1251
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:05,302
and take photos with them.

1252
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:07,372
- So, you came here.
- Yes, and I was sitting there.

1253
00:42:07,373 --> 00:42:09,173
- I see.
- I looked at the person next to me.

1254
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:11,112
(Smiling)

1255
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,282
- Deliberately?
- "Hello." Yes.

1256
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:13,813
I said, "Hello," and he was like...

1257
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,552
(The customer was startled.)

1258
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:17,752
He didn't recognize you?

1259
00:42:17,753 --> 00:42:19,282
I thought he recognized me.

1260
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:20,452
(He was convinced that he was recognized.)

1261
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:22,093
So, I said, "You know who I am, right?"

1262
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:23,662
And he said, "Sorry. I don't."

1263
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:25,162
(He was very flustered.)

1264
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,392
I said, "Haven't you seen 'Nameless Gangster?'"

1265
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:27,463
and he said, "No."

1266
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:29,663
"What about 'Reply 1988?'" He said, "No."

1267
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,432
"Or 'D.P.?'" "No."

1268
00:42:31,433 --> 00:42:33,133
He hadn't seen any of them!

1269
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:34,672
None at all.

1270
00:42:34,673 --> 00:42:37,049
- So, you were a complete stranger.
- There are such people.

1271
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:39,342
Sung Kyun, you're pretty impressive too.

1272
00:42:39,343 --> 00:42:41,342
- I never thought you could do that.
- I normally don't, but...

1273
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:43,242
- You thought it'd help your friend.
- Yes. That's why I did it,

1274
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:44,243
(Unfortunately, his courage was in vain.)

1275
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:45,812
- but he did not know me at all.
- I see.

1276
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,333
I should have been there to tape that.

1277
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:49,383
Where in Daegu are we?

1278
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:50,752
This is Daemyeong-dong.

1279
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:52,399
- It's Daemyeong-dong, right?
- Oh, I see.

1280
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:54,352
A friend of mine also runs a restaurant nearby.

1281
00:42:54,353 --> 00:42:55,792
- Really?
- Yes. It's around here.

1282
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:56,862
What kind?

1283
00:42:56,863 --> 00:42:58,092
- A bar.
- A bar?

1284
00:42:58,093 --> 00:42:59,163
- Yes.
- I see.

1285
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:01,483
We were teammates back when we played judo.

1286
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,102
He runs a bar, and his ears are all swollen.

1287
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:06,143
- Cauliflower ears?
- Yes.

1288
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:08,109
I bet he won't have any rude customers.

1289
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:09,372
But your ears aren't like that.

1290
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:11,102
No. I have flexible ears,

1291
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:12,449
so you can fold them however you like.

1292
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:14,342
- Oh, they're very flexible.
- As an actor...

1293
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,743
Mine would be cauliflower ears if I had done that sport.

1294
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,442
Yes, they would stick when they folded.

1295
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:19,513
Right.

1296
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,212
When you fold your ears...

1297
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:22,983
- Your ears won't swell.
- Really?

1298
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:25,022
- His ears are even softer.
- Really?

1299
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:26,323
Let him touch your ears.

1300
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:27,593
- Okay.
- Let me feel it.

1301
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:30,293
Sung Kyun, your ears are...

1302
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,573
Now, that's a wood ear mushroom.

1303
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:36,703
- Wood ear mushroom.
- A natural one.

1304
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:40,472
(Taking Jae Suk's drink)

1305
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:43,103
(Wiping)

1306
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,243
Formalities are a part of your everyday life.

1307
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:48,942
He's wiping the cans?

1308
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:50,342
(Bo Ram is a sweet and courteous youngest)

1309
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:52,443
- He's wiping all of them.
- He's good.

1310
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:54,682
- There are aprons by the gate.
- Okay.

1311
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,012
(They both jump up.)

1312
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:57,022
Thank you.

1313
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:59,492
(The youngest members are quick.)

1314
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:01,092
I already brought them.

1315
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,822
- I gave you the order.
- I got it.

1316
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,222
We'll just...

1317
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,392
You brought it?

1318
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,632
You can put it back.

1319
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:07,873
(Bong Sik even puts it on him.)

1320
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:09,462
Here's your abura soba.

1321
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:10,562
- That's me.
- What was it?

1322
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:11,603
Great.

1323
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:13,833
That looks scrumptious.

1324
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:15,672
You know you're supposed to flatter the boss...

1325
00:44:15,673 --> 00:44:17,572
before eating abura soba, right?

1326
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:20,172
(Forced laughter)

1327
00:44:20,173 --> 00:44:21,373
That's why your friends...

1328
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,412
- say that about you.
- Bong Sik...

1329
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,283
even mocks people.

1330
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:28,652
"How hilarious!"

1331
00:44:28,653 --> 00:44:29,882
I thought a reaction was needed.

1332
00:44:29,883 --> 00:44:31,383
That was great.

1333
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:33,893
Thanks.

1334
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:35,592
Thank you.

1335
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:37,093
(The other dishes are also served.)

1336
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,223
It looks delicious.

1337
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:41,232
- Paitan ramen?
- Paitan ramen is...

1338
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,793
a richer version of tonkotsu ramen.

1339
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,603
- This one is karai.
- Karai ramen.

1340
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:47,233
It's the type of ramen that I had in Japan.

1341
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:48,933
It looks tasty.

1342
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:51,503
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1343
00:44:51,843 --> 00:44:53,513
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

1344
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:57,383
(Satisfied)

1345
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,423
This is good.

1346
00:45:09,323 --> 00:45:10,522
- Do you like it?
- It tastes great.

1347
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:11,563
It's so good.

1348
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:13,763
That's a relief.

1349
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:17,133
(Bong Sik tries the soup first.)

1350
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:21,733
(He puts some noodles on his spoon...)

1351
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:23,873
(and slurps.)

1352
00:45:24,673 --> 00:45:25,673
Enjoy the food, Bo Ram.

1353
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:27,343
Thank you.

1354
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,213
Eat up.

1355
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:34,082
(He also takes Sung Kyun's ramen...)

1356
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,683
(and slurps.)

1357
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:37,683
- Can I taste it?
- Sure.

1358
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:40,053
I ate all the noodles. Try the meat.

1359
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:42,993
(Slurping Jae Suk's ramen as well)

1360
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:44,363
Is it salty?

1361
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:48,833
(It's been a while since Sung Kyun last tried his friend's food.)

1362
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:51,343
Your cooking has gotten better.

1363
00:45:51,663 --> 00:45:53,172
(The biggest compliment you'll get from a Gyeongsang Province man)

1364
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:54,173
You've gotten better.

1365
00:45:54,174 --> 00:45:56,073
That's something only best friends can say.

1366
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:00,642
You must still be happy to see Sung Kyun.

1367
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:01,742
(Nodding)

1368
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:02,773
Yes, I'm happy.

1369
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,643
(He answers and quickly turns around.)

1370
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:08,452
Friends from Gyeongsang Province are like him.

1371
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:09,929
My friends from my hometown are like him too.

1372
00:46:09,953 --> 00:46:12,122
When his movie is released, even when he has seen it,

1373
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:14,253
- Of course.
- he asks me to go watch it.

1374
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:15,722
- I see.
- Gosh.

1375
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:17,662
Right. That's how it is.

1376
00:46:17,663 --> 00:46:20,193
My hometown friends say, "Gosh, I can't watch it."

1377
00:46:20,393 --> 00:46:22,833
"I can't watch it because it's so cringy."

1378
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:26,103
- But they watch it.
- But they promote the movie.

1379
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,272
They're the ones who promote it the most.

1380
00:46:28,273 --> 00:46:30,543
Of course. It's cringy, but they help you out.

1381
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:31,902
Thank you, sir.

1382
00:46:31,903 --> 00:46:33,319
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1383
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:34,472
- Hope your business does well.
- Thank you.

1384
00:46:34,473 --> 00:46:36,512
- You've done well in this weather.
- Thank you.

1385
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:37,712
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1386
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:39,543
It's on me today. Let me pay for this place.

1387
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:41,882
Gosh, if you say so...

1388
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,123
Thank you for visiting us.

1389
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:45,559
- My brothers, let's go.
- Gosh. I really enjoyed it.

1390
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:46,652
Let's get going.

1391
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:48,099
I see. So Yeon Seok will drive from now.

1392
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:50,463
By the way, the sky is so clear today.

1393
00:46:50,693 --> 00:46:51,922
Gosh. Look at the clouds.

1394
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:53,163
(The clear sky of Daegu)

1395
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:54,462
(Glancing)

1396
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,233
Guys. The subway here is a bit strange.

1397
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:57,963
- It's a monorail.
- Right?

1398
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:00,272
- We saw it earlier.
- It's a monorail, right?

1399
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:01,472
- Yes.
- It has changed a lot...

1400
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,473
since I was young.

1401
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:03,502
- Right?
- Yes.

1402
00:47:03,503 --> 00:47:05,943
- It has changed a lot. Right.
- It has changed so much.

1403
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:10,383
You know what? Samsung Lions is doing well these days.

1404
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:14,783
LG and Hanwha are doing great.

1405
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:17,483
The baseball league is so...

1406
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:21,643
I guess you guys don't watch baseball.

1407
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:23,992
- I don't know it well.
- Someone should come forward.

1408
00:47:23,993 --> 00:47:26,262
- I'm not a baseball fan.
- We don't have any baseball fans.

1409
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:28,663
- Not that much.
- I'm the only baseball fan?

1410
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:30,863
I don't know baseball well.

1411
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,572
But I once came to Daegu to throw the first pitch.

1412
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:34,672
- Really?
- Yes.

1413
00:47:34,673 --> 00:47:36,303
I went home after a wild pitch.

1414
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:39,712
Actually, throwing a ball...

1415
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:41,412
- isn't easy.
- It isn't.

1416
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:43,483
- When you do it...
- It makes you nervous.

1417
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:44,982
There's a crowd.

1418
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:47,313
When a batter is in the batter's box,

1419
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:49,922
I'll be in trouble if I throw the ball at him by mistake.

1420
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:51,382
They need to play the game.

1421
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:52,882
Gosh. It made me so nervous.

1422
00:47:52,883 --> 00:47:56,492
You know, the batters are professionals.

1423
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:58,192
- They won't get hit by it?
- Our balls won't be...

1424
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:00,192
I think they might see it as if it were a soccer ball.

1425
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:01,553
- That's possible.
- You're right.

1426
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:04,333
And your ball won't be that threatening to them.

1427
00:48:04,803 --> 00:48:07,172
- Gosh. But I have experience.
- Is that so?

1428
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:08,802
- You did it in the drama.
- I was Chil Bong in it.

1429
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,072
Right. You were Chil Bong.

1430
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:12,442
- I know I'm not a match, but...
- You threw the ball well in it.

1431
00:48:12,443 --> 00:48:15,413
- Just in case I somehow hit them.
- As Chil Bong.

1432
00:48:15,673 --> 00:48:17,742
- But...
- Chil Bong.

1433
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:19,789
- You should've turned left.
- I should've turned left.

1434
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,752
There's a reason I don't let you drive.

1435
00:48:22,753 --> 00:48:25,382
I'm a good driver, but I forget to look at the GPS.

1436
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:26,652
I told him, but he didn't listen.

1437
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,852
(Left turn.)

1438
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:29,422
I told him it was a left turn, but he didn't listen to me.

1439
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:31,123
Gosh, Chil Bong.

1440
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:35,293
- I was talking about Chil Bong.
- But in Daegu,

1441
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,102
you always get to the destination somehow in the end.

1442
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:40,503
- Go and make a U-turn.
- I'll make a U-turn and turn right.

1443
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:45,573
- So this place is the herb alley.
- It's Yakryeong Market.

1444
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:47,773
- So this place is Yakryeong Market.
- I see.

1445
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,483
It's from Lee Kyung Ah and Jung Ji Yeon.

1446
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:53,783
"One who is wearing flower shoes..."

1447
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:56,493
"as her bias was discharged from the military recently."

1448
00:48:56,623 --> 00:48:59,622
"The other one who will put on rubber shoes..."

1449
00:48:59,623 --> 00:49:01,303
"as her bias will join the military soon."

1450
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:05,193
"We met like fate at this company full of medicinal herbal scent."

1451
00:49:05,363 --> 00:49:08,133
"Our positions, ages, and biases are different."

1452
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,862
"But we've become one as we both have the fangirl DNA."

1453
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:14,173
"Will you join us and have a very nice spare time?"

1454
00:49:14,373 --> 00:49:17,002
She said fangirl, so she must be someone's fan.

1455
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:18,142
Is that what this is about?

1456
00:49:18,143 --> 00:49:20,463
A member of BTS was recently discharged from the military.

1457
00:49:20,873 --> 00:49:22,013
You're right.

1458
00:49:22,243 --> 00:49:23,782
"Very nice."

1459
00:49:23,783 --> 00:49:25,782
- Very nice - Isn't this SEVENTEEN?

1460
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:28,553
- Right. It's SEVENTEEN.
- She must be SEVENTEEN's fan.

1461
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:32,223
So here. Yangnyeongsi...

1462
00:49:32,353 --> 00:49:34,123
It says Oriental Medicine Museum.

1463
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:36,123
- What?
- Shall we go in?

1464
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,423
- It says the 2nd floor.
- It's the 2nd floor?

1465
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:42,392
- Gosh. The herbal scent is amazing.
- It smells a lot.

1466
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:43,433
Goodness. It smells a lot.

1467
00:49:43,903 --> 00:49:46,223
I don't know why, but just smelling the herbal medicine...

1468
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,432
makes me feel like I've gotten healthier.

1469
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:48,593
That you've gotten healthier?

1470
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:50,872
- The scent is so nice.
- Goodness.

1471
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:51,973
Gosh, this place is...

1472
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:54,743
I think they'll give us some herbal tea.

1473
00:49:55,443 --> 00:49:57,543
- Gosh, the smell of herbs.
- It smells a lot.

1474
00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:00,013
It says Oriental Herbs Experience Center.

1475
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:03,082
(Where is the Whenever Guest?)

1476
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,482
- Where should we go?
- Hold on.

1477
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:05,853
It says workshop over there.

1478
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:07,293
There's an office too.

1479
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:09,422
Hello.

1480
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,822
- Hello.
- Hello.

1481
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:13,362
- Hello. Yes.
- Hi. Did you...

1482
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:14,962
- I am the one who... Right.
- So you're Ji Yeon?

1483
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:16,603
- She's Ji Yeon?
- Nice to meet you.

1484
00:50:16,963 --> 00:50:18,203
- I'll sit at the end.
- Okay.

1485
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,833
- The two should sit here.
- Hello.

1486
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:24,173
So here at Daegu, what kind of work do you do?

1487
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:27,272
I'm a curator here.

1488
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:30,012
A curator is someone who plans exhibitions...

1489
00:50:30,013 --> 00:50:32,743
or educational programs and runs them.

1490
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:35,183
I gather the collections that can be exhibited here...

1491
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:38,282
and manage the relics. That's the thing I do here.

1492
00:50:38,283 --> 00:50:41,093
- What about you?
- I'm an administrator here.

1493
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:43,492
- That's what I do here.
- I see.

1494
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:46,423
So from the letter... Who is the one with the rubber shoes?

1495
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:48,132
The one who will put on the rubber shoes.

1496
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,492
- Is it...
- Isn't it SEVENTEEN?

1497
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:50,633
- Yes, it is.
- I see.

1498
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,203
- You're right.
- We got it right.

1499
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,073
- And you're a BTS fan?
- That's right.

1500
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,672
All members of BTS are back, right?

1501
00:50:57,673 --> 00:50:59,872
- Yes. I love it.
- You're wearing the flower shoes.

1502
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:00,942
- Yes.
- Right.

1503
00:51:00,943 --> 00:51:01,943
And in your case,

1504
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:03,412
- you'll put on rubber shoes soon.
- It will start for me.

1505
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:07,612
By the way, people we've met in Daegu are someone's fan.

1506
00:51:07,613 --> 00:51:09,773
The person we met earlier said she was YoungTak's fan.

1507
00:51:10,753 --> 00:51:11,852
- Yes.
- Right.

1508
00:51:11,853 --> 00:51:14,652
You two must've talked about...

1509
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,352
what it'd be like to wait for their star.

1510
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:17,562
- Yes.
- Yes, that's right.

1511
00:51:17,563 --> 00:51:20,293
When I was sending away my singer, I said to her,

1512
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:22,363
"Gosh, I'm about to cry now."

1513
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:25,632
I couldn't understand her back then.

1514
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:27,472
But since it's my turn to send my star to the military,

1515
00:51:27,473 --> 00:51:28,702
- You can feel...
- it's so sad.

1516
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:29,942
Right. Of course.

1517
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:33,612
I heard that HOSHI will be the first one to join the military.

1518
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:35,112
Did you watch the episode...

1519
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:36,642
- with HOSHI?
- Yes. I'm HOSHI's fan.

1520
00:51:36,643 --> 00:51:37,942
- I see.
- So she's HOSHI's fan.

1521
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:39,242
(Traces that show that she's HOSHI's fan)

1522
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:42,282
In that episode, we made him a nametag...

1523
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:44,282
- We engraved it.
- Right, we engraved it.

1524
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:47,392
In that episode, Jae Suk said the fans would cry.

1525
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:49,023
- And we all did.
- Really?

1526
00:51:49,493 --> 00:51:50,663
See? What did I say?

1527
00:51:51,163 --> 00:51:52,462
- You said that precisely.
- Yes.

1528
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:53,532
- I was precise, right?
- Yes.

1529
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:54,932
- The fans would cry.
- Yes.

1530
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:58,633
HOSHI said that he could feel that he was really joining the military.

1531
00:51:58,933 --> 00:52:02,202
Today, HOSHI won't be able to join us.

1532
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,703
- But we have Bong Sik...
- Yes.

1533
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:05,403
And Sung Kyun.

1534
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:08,443
- I feel sorry for no reason.
- I apologize.

1535
00:52:08,613 --> 00:52:10,313
- No.
- No, it's okay.

1536
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:13,553
- We're wearing pink today.
- Yes.

1537
00:52:13,953 --> 00:52:17,123
We tried to give the vibe of a team.

1538
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:22,223
By the way, to Ji Yeon who is HOSHI's fan,

1539
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:23,662
what kind of advice will you give?

1540
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:24,922
How can she wait for him?

1541
00:52:24,923 --> 00:52:27,493
These days, we can see their daily menu.

1542
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:29,553
- Daily menu?
- So you can see what he's having?

1543
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:31,602
We can see the photo of it, so we can see and imagine...

1544
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:33,843
- what they'd have each day.
- "So they had this today."

1545
00:52:33,873 --> 00:52:35,902
You eat something similar later.

1546
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,072
- Gosh. You can see the menu too?
- Yes, you can.

1547
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:39,872
So someone uploads "Today's menu."

1548
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:40,873
That's right.

1549
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:45,082
But these days, the agencies release different contents for the fans...

1550
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,112
- so they won't feel the gap.
- Oh, right.

1551
00:52:47,113 --> 00:52:48,912
- They shoot a lot before they go.
- They shoot them in advance?

1552
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:51,153
- I see.
- So...

1553
00:52:51,523 --> 00:52:54,052
you might not notice if he has actually left or not.

1554
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:55,852
So there are many contents of them.

1555
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:58,293
Since all the members are back, you sound relaxed.

1556
00:52:59,223 --> 00:53:00,892
- I feel at ease inside.
- You can't tell...

1557
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:02,332
if they have left or not.

1558
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,403
- Yes.
- I see.

1559
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:07,672
What kind of happiness does fangirling...

1560
00:53:07,673 --> 00:53:09,303
give you?

1561
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,642
When the work is tiring, I say this to myself.

1562
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:13,572
- "Even they are working so hard."
- Right.

1563
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:15,142
- Is that so?
- "My boys are working so hard."

1564
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:16,472
Many people are like her.

1565
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:18,182
I make up my mind to work harder.

1566
00:53:18,183 --> 00:53:19,542
When they feel tired,

1567
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:21,353
they watch videos of their stars and think,

1568
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,682
"My boys are working so hard. I should work hard too."

1569
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:24,952
- That's right.
- Is there a video...

1570
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:26,553
that you watch often at times like that?

1571
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:30,793
- SEVENTEEN has their own content.
- Their own content.

1572
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:34,162
They're as funny as variety shows.

1573
00:53:34,163 --> 00:53:35,363
So I watch them often.

1574
00:53:36,163 --> 00:53:38,103
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- You said variety shows...

1575
00:53:38,363 --> 00:53:40,103
- while looking at me.
- No.

1576
00:53:42,273 --> 00:53:44,273
By the way, since Bong Sik and Sung Kyun are here.

1577
00:53:44,503 --> 00:53:46,623
- The sons of Daegu.
- Have you watched their videos?

1578
00:53:46,843 --> 00:53:48,483
Have you ever watched Sung Kyun's videos?

1579
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:49,613
Well...

1580
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:51,623
They suddenly became speechless.

1581
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:53,613
Well...

1582
00:53:53,883 --> 00:53:56,683
- Why did it become so silent?
- My goodness.

1583
00:53:57,323 --> 00:53:58,522
(It's so funny.)

1584
00:53:58,523 --> 00:54:01,153
Bong Sik has been working a lot these days.

1585
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:04,563
- I saw him in "Three Sisters."
- So you've seen his movie.

1586
00:54:04,723 --> 00:54:06,623
Gosh, you watched that movie.

1587
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:08,793
My fans also asked me...

1588
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:10,933
- if I were joining the military.
- Why?

1589
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:12,443
Because I work a lot these days.

1590
00:54:14,533 --> 00:54:16,273
I didn't know what it meant.

1591
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:18,643
Because you appear in so many works.

1592
00:54:18,843 --> 00:54:20,972
You were stacking up contents.

1593
00:54:20,973 --> 00:54:22,519
As if you were working hard before joining the military.

1594
00:54:22,543 --> 00:54:25,782
It's been so long. I'm done with my reserve too.

1595
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:27,382
- But they asked me that.
- That's so funny.

1596
00:54:27,383 --> 00:54:30,352
- Like someone who will leave soon?
- Because he appeared so much,

1597
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:31,833
they asked if he was going somewhere.

1598
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:33,823
Gosh. Bong Sik is so funny.

1599
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:37,523
By the way, what made you write to us?

1600
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:40,292
There are many programs at the museum.

1601
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:43,662
From 1 to 2pm, we prepare for the programs.

1602
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:46,003
- I see.
- That's the spare time we have.

1603
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:48,932
I thought it would be nice if you could visit us.

1604
00:54:48,933 --> 00:54:53,002
By the way, Daegu is known for its hot weather.

1605
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,672
It seems like people in Daegu think it's just natural.

1606
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:57,842
- It goes up to 40°C, right?
- It seemed so.

1607
00:54:57,843 --> 00:54:59,813
Yes, in mid-summer.

1608
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:01,482
You say, "It's warm."

1609
00:55:01,483 --> 00:55:03,252
Yes. We just say, "It's hot."

1610
00:55:03,253 --> 00:55:05,222
- They don't mind.
- You just say it's warm?

1611
00:55:05,223 --> 00:55:06,822
- Yes.
- Yes. We...

1612
00:55:06,823 --> 00:55:08,153
"It's a little hot today."

1613
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:13,462
Then, do you have a special way...

1614
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:14,893
to get over the hot summer?

1615
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,632
Air conditioning?

1616
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:18,963
(Air conditioning.)

1617
00:55:20,203 --> 00:55:22,232
- Of course.
- Yes. It's cool.

1618
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:23,772
- Air conditioner is the best.
- That's right.

1619
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:26,402
She gave a wise answer to a foolish question.

1620
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:28,813
By the way, at our museum,

1621
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:30,842
we offer a drink that helps you...

1622
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:32,713
- overcome the hot weather.
- What is it?

1623
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,282
- It's ssanghwa tea.
- I see.

1624
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:36,853
- Can we have some?
- Yes.

1625
00:55:37,223 --> 00:55:38,923
- We'll get it for you.
- Thank you.

1626
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:41,834
- Cool ssanghwa tea?
- They've prepared something for us.

1627
00:55:42,053 --> 00:55:45,262
So people in Daegu say it's warm in summer.

1628
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:47,592
When I ask, "Mom, isn't it hot?"

1629
00:55:47,593 --> 00:55:48,963
she says, "It's warm."

1630
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:53,902
- Because Daegu is a basin.
- Right. Like this.

1631
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:56,003
It's not windy in Daegu, right?

1632
00:55:56,173 --> 00:55:58,342
I don't remember windy weather in Daegu.

1633
00:55:58,343 --> 00:56:00,542
But it was windy when a typhoon came by.

1634
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:02,272
Of course, it would be windy...

1635
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:04,113
- if a typhoon were here.
- Sung Kyun.

1636
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,082
It's windy when there's a typhoon.

1637
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,852
- This is ssanghwa tea.
- Thank you.

1638
00:56:07,853 --> 00:56:09,952
It's a bit warm.

1639
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:11,082
- It's a bit warm?
- Yes.

1640
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,953
- This is a bit warm.
- Right.

1641
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:15,192
- This is so nice.
- Yes.

1642
00:56:15,193 --> 00:56:17,262
- We boil it down here.
- I see.

1643
00:56:17,263 --> 00:56:18,962
So when there are visitors,

1644
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:21,333
they can taste this for free.

1645
00:56:21,893 --> 00:56:23,062
Gosh, it's bitter.

1646
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:24,609
- It's just right for me.
- "Gosh, it's bitter."

1647
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:26,102
He said it was bitter.

1648
00:56:26,103 --> 00:56:27,132
It's not bitter.

1649
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,202
- I think this is just right.
- I think so too.

1650
00:56:29,203 --> 00:56:30,243
Not that sweet.

1651
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,372
Are there any medicines that help slow aging?

1652
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:34,372
(That's the question Bong Sik wanted to ask.)

1653
00:56:34,373 --> 00:56:37,142
You seem to be interested in slow aging a lot.

1654
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,212
You should give him something strong.

1655
00:56:39,213 --> 00:56:40,352
(For slow aging...)

1656
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:42,682
Since we met the two here in Daegu,

1657
00:56:42,683 --> 00:56:44,482
let's win all three rounds today.

1658
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:46,422
- Let's do that.
- Let's go for it.

1659
00:56:46,423 --> 00:56:47,893
Shall we draw a coupon then?

1660
00:56:47,923 --> 00:56:49,993
(Sung Kyun will throw for the coupon.)

1661
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:54,392
(They got 1 coupon.)

1662
00:56:54,393 --> 00:56:56,032
- One coupon is enough.
- That's good.

1663
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:59,503
This is the prize for the first round.

1664
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:02,802
"I watch my favorite idols in videos every day."

1665
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:05,042
"I'm waiting for the day to see them in person."

1666
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:07,442
"Four hundred dollars to buy tickets for the concerts."

1667
00:57:07,443 --> 00:57:09,072
- Goodness.
- That's a lot.

1668
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:10,343
- My goodness.
- In cash?

1669
00:57:11,543 --> 00:57:12,983
Gosh, it's a lot from the beginning.

1670
00:57:13,613 --> 00:57:15,612
So it's 200 dollars each.

1671
00:57:15,613 --> 00:57:17,352
(400 dollars to buy concert tickets)

1672
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:20,623
By the way, are you guys good at ticketing?

1673
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:21,953
- Yes.
- Yes.

1674
00:57:22,493 --> 00:57:23,862
- They're confident.
- Yes, we're good.

1675
00:57:23,863 --> 00:57:25,662
- You've never failed?
- No. I...

1676
00:57:25,663 --> 00:57:28,192
I've been to all the recent SEVENTEEN concerts...

1677
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:29,333
and the fanmeets.

1678
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:31,402
I never failed to reserve tickets for the ones I wanted to go.

1679
00:57:31,403 --> 00:57:33,932
- To BTS concerts too?
- Yes, I've been to them.

1680
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:35,402
(They're masters of ticketing.)

1681
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:37,842
You should give a lecture on that someday.

1682
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:39,442
(Top instructor in ticketing)

1683
00:57:39,443 --> 00:57:42,042
My daughter is a fan of G-DRAGON.

1684
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,612
- Is that so?
- Yes. So I...

1685
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:44,859
tried to get a ticket to his concert.

1686
00:57:44,883 --> 00:57:46,443
But I failed instantly.

1687
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:47,783
- You failed?
- Yes.

1688
00:57:47,784 --> 00:57:49,782
G-DRAGON's concert was so hard.

1689
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:51,252
I just couldn't get a ticket for it.

1690
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:53,082
- Even you couldn't do it?
- No.

1691
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,393
I felt so sorry for her.

1692
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:58,292
- "Trust your mom."
- "Mom will do it for you."

1693
00:57:58,293 --> 00:58:00,022
- "Just hold on."
- I told her I'd do it for her,

1694
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:01,663
but I just couldn't do it.

1695
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:04,202
- "Only you go to the concerts."
- "Only you go to the concerts."

1696
00:58:04,203 --> 00:58:05,602
Right. I went to the concerts by myself.

1697
00:58:05,603 --> 00:58:07,233
My goodness.

1698
00:58:07,803 --> 00:58:09,502
I was invited to G-DRAGON's concert.

1699
00:58:09,503 --> 00:58:11,672
- Yes. I saw the video.
- Did you watch it?

1700
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:13,743
Yes. I watched the short videos.

1701
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:15,443
Are you trying to tease her?

1702
00:58:16,713 --> 00:58:17,882
- I mean...
- You were bragging about it.

1703
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:19,682
- "I've been to it."
- That's not true.

1704
00:58:19,683 --> 00:58:20,812
Are you teasing her?

1705
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:22,853
It's not easy to go to his concert,

1706
00:58:22,983 --> 00:58:24,783
so I wanted to say thank you to G-DRAGON.

1707
00:58:25,123 --> 00:58:26,323
Thanks, G-DRAGON.

1708
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,599
I forgot to say thank you even when I was the older one.

1709
00:58:28,623 --> 00:58:30,462
I wanted to thank him.

1710

(Oriental Medicine Shootout)

00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:33,932
(Slide the plate...)

1712
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:37,802
(and put the gongjindan on the plate.)

1713
00:58:37,803 --> 00:58:40,703
(Round 1, It's a success if 2 out of 4 score.)

1714
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:43,372
Hit the cup with the plate and leave gongjindan on the plate?

1715
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,242
- We adjust the power?
- I see.

1716
00:58:45,243 --> 00:58:46,972
- How can you do that?
- My goodness.

1717
00:58:46,973 --> 00:58:48,512
What's this? It's so difficult.

1718
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:49,973
Gosh, this is so hard.

1719
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:52,843
- Does this work?
- They must be studying hard.

1720
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:59,453
But the plate needs to stop.

1721
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,423
- Right. This should be...
- Hold on.

1722
00:59:01,553 --> 00:59:03,313
If it's this difficult from the beginning...

1723
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,962
(He succeeded on his first try.)

1724
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,269
- You can do it.
- The plate should be lengthwise.

1725
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,602
- Gosh.
- Lengthwise.

1726
00:59:11,603 --> 00:59:14,173
- Try it, Bong Sik.
- We just need two to succeed.

1727
00:59:15,203 --> 00:59:16,603
- It worked.
- I know.

1728
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,773
- Gosh.
- That was too weak.

1729
00:59:20,173 --> 00:59:21,342
But this is...

1730
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:23,513
Gosh. Why are you so weak?

1731
00:59:25,713 --> 00:59:26,883
- You got it.
- Great.

1732
00:59:28,183 --> 00:59:29,952
- So it's possible.
- The plate should be lengthwise.

1733
00:59:29,953 --> 00:59:31,622
- In that position...
- It should be vertical.

1734
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:32,782
- They can do it.
- Yes.

1735
00:59:32,783 --> 00:59:35,223
- Now... Let's do that.
- Let's cheer before we go.

1736
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,222
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Let's go!

1737
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:38,462
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

1738
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:40,162
- Who will go 1st?
- Shall I go 1st?

1739
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,432
- Okay. You start.
- First...

1740
00:59:41,433 --> 00:59:42,562
- Let's succeed 1st.
- Let's do that 1st.

1741
00:59:42,563 --> 00:59:44,603
- Right. Let's do this.
- Let's get one right away.

1742
00:59:45,203 --> 00:59:46,203
Let's go for it.

1743
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:47,503
Let's see how it goes.

1744
00:59:48,073 --> 00:59:49,302
Let's do this.

1745
00:59:49,303 --> 00:59:51,002
Gosh. We've done this so many times.

1746
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:52,373
It's warm.

1747
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,112
(He overuses the dialect.)

1748
00:59:54,113 --> 00:59:55,712
You've done it once. Just like how it felt before.

1749
00:59:55,713 --> 00:59:57,143
- Slide it smoothly.
- Yes.

1750
00:59:57,213 --> 00:59:58,412
Just don't make the plate fall.

1751
00:59:58,413 --> 00:59:59,982
(First try, Yeon Seok)

1752
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:01,053
Like this.

1753
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:05,452
(First try, Yeon Seok)

1754
01:00:05,453 --> 01:00:07,253
- That was close.
- You were scared.

1755
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:10,923
- Bong Sik, let's go.
- Me?

1756
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:15,192
Bong Sik. Please succeed.

1757
01:00:15,193 --> 01:00:17,632
(First try, Bong Sik)

1758
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:19,903
- There's a bump there.
- Should I let it go here?

1759
01:00:20,873 --> 01:00:21,873
He got it.

1760
01:00:23,843 --> 01:00:24,843
He got it.

1761
01:00:24,844 --> 01:00:26,102
(Bong Sik succeeded.)

1762
01:00:26,103 --> 01:00:28,012
- We got it.
- We got it.

1763
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:29,013
(Bong Sik, you got it!)

1764
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:30,843
- We got it.
- We got it.

1765
01:00:31,813 --> 01:00:33,682
Bong Sik, you got this.

1766
01:00:33,683 --> 01:00:35,553
- I won't go last.
- It's Sung Kyun's turn.

1767
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:37,963
Sung Kyun. Just like what you did earlier.

1768
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:40,222
Let's go.

1769
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:44,762
(First try, Sung Kyun)

1770
01:00:44,763 --> 01:00:48,092
(First try, Sung Kyun)

1771
01:00:48,093 --> 01:00:49,293
- Gosh.
- He did it.

1772
01:00:50,863 --> 01:00:51,902
- Gosh.
- He did it.

1773
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:54,002
(They succeeded in Round 1 on their 1st try.)

1774
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:55,233
- What happened?
- We did it.

1775
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:57,702
(These two are good at the actual missions.)

1776
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:58,773
- Gosh.
- He did it.

1777
01:00:59,143 --> 01:01:01,543
(Bong Sik and Sung Kyun made this win together.)

1778
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:04,613
We got this.

1779
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:06,782
They succeeded.

1780
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:07,912
(What just happened?)

1781
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:09,382
- We did it.
- They're surprised.

1782
01:01:09,383 --> 01:01:10,482
That surprised you, right?

1783
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:12,483
- Round One, success!
- Success!

1784
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:15,453
The staff members are surprised.

1785
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:17,363
We got you, right?

1786
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:18,892
Gosh, we did it.

1787
01:01:18,893 --> 01:01:20,322
- You didn't even have to do it.
- We are...

1788
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:22,193
We are on a roll today.

1789
01:01:22,663 --> 01:01:24,262
It's because of the ssanghwa tea we had.

1790
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,902
- The medicine must've helped.
- It must be from it.

1791
01:01:25,903 --> 01:01:27,132
- You're the best.
- The medicine helped.

1792
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:30,232
Now, you need to decide whether you will go or stop here.

1793
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,472
We have so many chances left.

1794
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:32,902
We have nine chances,

1795
01:01:32,903 --> 01:01:34,412
and there's a bonus coupon.

1796
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:35,812
- So we have ten chances.
- Oh, right. We did it right away.

1797
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:36,872
Right.

1798
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:38,482
- Go.
- Of course, we should go.

1799
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:40,582
- It's a go no matter what.
- Now, Round Two.

1800
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,682
"This place is filled with the scent of medicine."

1801
01:01:42,683 --> 01:01:45,783
"I want to drink coffee, not ssanghwatang in the office."

1802
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:48,692
"Nespresso coffee machine and 200 capsules."

1803
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:50,562
(Nespresso coffee machine and 200 capsules)

1804
01:01:50,563 --> 01:01:51,963
Two hundred capsules?

1805
01:01:52,263 --> 01:01:53,292
(Surprised)

1806
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:54,469
- What's this?
- This is amazing

1807
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:55,973
They give you the coffee machine too?

1808
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:57,662
- And there are 200 capsules?
- Yes.

1809
01:01:57,663 --> 01:01:58,862
(We love ssanghwatang, but we need coffee too.)

1810
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,732
- Your co-workers will love this.
- Yes.

1811
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:01,772
- Right?
- Yes.

1812
01:02:01,773 --> 01:02:02,972
(Round 2)

1813
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:07,713
(It's farther.)

1814
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:10,613
- It's too far.
- What? Like this?

1815
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:11,983
That's too far.

1816
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,282
- Gosh.
- This is too far.

1817
01:02:14,283 --> 01:02:15,382
(It's become a lot farther.)

1818
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:17,503
- Will it be okay with that bump?
- Right. That bump.

1819
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:19,722
- It has to go over that bump.
- This is...

1820
01:02:19,723 --> 01:02:21,053
(There's a bump in the middle.)

1821
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:23,092
But don't you need to do something with this bump here?

1822
01:02:23,093 --> 01:02:25,653
- That's not intended by you, right?
- We need a plane for this.

1823
01:02:25,863 --> 01:02:27,292
- Let's try it.
- We can adjust the tables.

1824
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:28,832
Can we put something under it?

1825
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,863
- Shall we support it?
- Can we support it?

1826
01:02:31,233 --> 01:02:32,963
Put the paper under it. Right.

1827
01:02:33,563 --> 01:02:35,702
- Okay.
- You support the table with it.

1828
01:02:35,703 --> 01:02:38,043
- It worked.
- Let me try it.

1829
01:02:38,843 --> 01:02:41,212
- It's ready.
- Goodness.

1830
01:02:41,213 --> 01:02:42,872
- I need to push it quite far.
- Right.

1831
01:02:42,873 --> 01:02:43,912
We got this.

1832
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:45,313
Sung Kyun, do it behind the line.

1833
01:02:45,983 --> 01:02:47,783
His eyes are so scary.

1834
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:51,623
Sung Kyun. That was too weak.

1835
01:02:51,983 --> 01:02:54,122
Sung Kyun. You're really timid.

1836
01:02:54,123 --> 01:02:55,353
It's warm.

1837
01:02:56,053 --> 01:02:57,469
The medicine is not helping him this time.

1838
01:02:57,493 --> 01:02:58,723
It's warm.

1839
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:00,292
How did you do it?

1840
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:01,763
Push it harder.

1841
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:05,932
It's going in the wrong direction.

1842
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:08,033
- He's ruining it.
- This is weak.

1843
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:09,902
You're weak.

1844
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:11,873
- Gosh, we're in trouble.
- Why am I so weak?

1845
01:03:12,443 --> 01:03:13,643
- Gosh, he did it.
- Goodness.

1846
01:03:14,413 --> 01:03:16,013
About this much. I got it.

1847
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:17,412
- This is...
- I got the hang of it.

1848
01:03:17,413 --> 01:03:19,243
You and Bong Sik should do it.

1849
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:21,483
- He got it.
- It works.

1850
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:23,533
- Gosh, Bong Sik.
- Bo Ram is...

1851
01:03:23,913 --> 01:03:25,122
Bo Ram is...

1852
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:27,053
Bo Ram is amazing.

1853
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:28,892
It's nice that you came here with us.

1854
01:03:28,893 --> 01:03:29,893
Let's do this.

1855
01:03:29,894 --> 01:03:31,092
It's Round Two.

1856
01:03:31,093 --> 01:03:33,623
- Now, let's...
- Let's do a cheer together.

1857
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,892
(Breaking)

1858
01:03:35,893 --> 01:03:37,902
- Do it when it's your turn.
- He's just throwing it away.

1859
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:39,079
(The son of Daegu is ruining the game.)

1860
01:03:39,103 --> 01:03:40,872
Sung Kyun, you shouldn't do it right away like that, okay?

1861
01:03:40,873 --> 01:03:41,932
I wanted to be good at it.

1862
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:44,102
- In 1, 2, 3, let's go!
- Let's go!

1863
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:45,743
Who will go first for this round?

1864
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:47,672
- I'll go first.
- Yeon Seok, let's do this safely.

1865
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:49,673
- Two people must succeed, right?
- Right.

1866
01:03:51,283 --> 01:03:52,683
Do it. Just do it already.

1867
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:54,013
All right.

1868
01:03:54,014 --> 01:03:59,522
(Second try, Yeon Seok)

1869
01:03:59,523 --> 01:04:01,692
(It fell with the gongjindan on it.)

1870
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:02,693
I'll do it.

1871
01:04:02,694 --> 01:04:04,992
- Bong Sik will go second.
- Yes. I'll do it.

1872
01:04:04,993 --> 01:04:06,662
(Second try, Bong Sik)

1873
01:04:06,663 --> 01:04:07,833
(Bumping)

1874
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:10,032
- That was... What?
- It bumped.

1875
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:12,102
It bumped and stopped the plate.

1876
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:13,983
- It should slide.
- You should've done better.

1877
01:04:14,803 --> 01:04:16,502
(He said the right thing.)

1878
01:04:16,503 --> 01:04:18,623
- Are you a Type T, Jae Suk?
- We got the bump again.

1879
01:04:18,843 --> 01:04:20,003
Should I fold it once more?

1880
01:04:20,403 --> 01:04:21,512
Did it go down?

1881
01:04:21,513 --> 01:04:23,813
(They're fixing the tables again.)

1882
01:04:24,713 --> 01:04:25,882
(They are serious about making the tables flat.)

1883
01:04:25,883 --> 01:04:27,653
But it didn't go that far, right?

1884
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:30,453
It didn't go that far earlier.

1885
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:31,783
- Right.
- Okay.

1886
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:33,252
Sir, I think we're ready.

1887
01:04:33,253 --> 01:04:34,652
- Okay. It won't bump.
- Okay.

1888
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:36,192
- All right. Done.
- Gosh, thank you.

1889
01:04:36,193 --> 01:04:37,522
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1890
01:04:37,523 --> 01:04:39,492
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

1891
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:40,792
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

1892
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,832
- Call me if it doesn't work, okay?
- Okay.

1893
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:46,762
(Second try, Jae Suk)

1894
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:48,273
I should push it hard from the back.

1895
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:50,003
You did it.

1896
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:52,543
You did it.

1897
01:04:52,773 --> 01:04:54,273
(Jae Suk failed as well.)

1898
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:56,043
You did it.

1899
01:04:57,113 --> 01:04:58,942
(Jae Suk failed. The second try is over.)

1900
01:04:58,943 --> 01:05:00,212
- You failed.
- We failed.

1901
01:05:00,213 --> 01:05:02,383
This is... Well...

1902
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,753
We have so many chances left.

1903
01:05:06,923 --> 01:05:08,153
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1904
01:05:08,623 --> 01:05:09,793
This was too strong.

1905
01:05:12,623 --> 01:05:14,193
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

1906
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:18,103
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1907
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:21,472
(The customer is fully satisfied.)

1908
01:05:21,473 --> 01:05:22,632
Gosh, it's not working.

1909
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:24,102
(Engineer Hyun Bo Ram starts to work hard.)

1910
01:05:24,103 --> 01:05:25,472
That's a good try.

1911
01:05:25,473 --> 01:05:26,543
Right?

1912
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:28,613
(He's fast.)

1913
01:05:30,813 --> 01:05:33,382
(No one asked him to do this.)

1914
01:05:33,383 --> 01:05:36,783
(He does the work of the staff too.)

1915
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:40,893
(He works hard until the end.)

1916
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:43,273
- Is everything okay, sir?
- Yes. It's flattened now.

1917
01:05:44,923 --> 01:05:46,523
(Satisfied)

1918
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:48,893
It should be like this.

1919
01:05:51,003 --> 01:05:52,202
It should be like this.

1920
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:54,803
(A clean shot after the flattening process)

1921
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,972
- It should be like that.
- I got the hang of it.

1922
01:05:56,973 --> 01:05:59,203
- You should go first then.
- It should be like this.

1923
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:00,742
The fourth try.

1924
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:02,572
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

1925
01:06:02,573 --> 01:06:04,582
- If we fail, let's use the coupon.
- It should be like this.

1926
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,643
- I'll show you what it means.
- All right.

1927
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:07,913
All right.

1928
01:06:07,914 --> 01:06:09,252
(Focusing)

1929
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:10,973
It would be great if you could get it done.

1930
01:06:12,853 --> 01:06:14,493
It's around this much! Yes!

1931
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:16,053
I got the hang of it!

1932
01:06:17,523 --> 01:06:19,122
It's around this much! Yes!

1933
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:20,193
(He gets it done neatly!)

1934
01:06:20,593 --> 01:06:22,132
(High-five!)

1935
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:23,262
(Fourth try, Yeon Seok)

1936
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:24,663
(That hurt.)

1937
01:06:25,763 --> 01:06:27,732
- Do it comfortably.
- Right.

1938
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,533
Just 1 person has to make it out of the 3.

1939
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:31,872
I did my part.

1940
01:06:31,873 --> 01:06:33,302
- Let's go!
- All right.

1941
01:06:33,303 --> 01:06:34,312
(Fourth try, Bong Sik)

1942
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:35,343
- He did it!
- He did it!

1943
01:06:36,843 --> 01:06:38,212
- Sung Kyun.
- Right.

1944
01:06:38,213 --> 01:06:39,382
(Fourth try, Sung Kyun)

1945
01:06:39,383 --> 01:06:40,713
Thank you, sir.

1946
01:06:44,623 --> 01:06:46,253
(Meticulous)

1947
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:49,553
The son of Daegu.

1948
01:06:50,153 --> 01:06:51,793
- Show us as the son of Daegu.
- Show us.

1949
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:56,433
- Come on, son of Daegu.
- Gosh.

1950
01:06:56,663 --> 01:06:57,902
He can't do anything.

1951
01:06:57,903 --> 01:06:59,732
- Gosh.
- Hold on.

1952
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:00,733
(Did he hurt his shoulder?)

1953
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,803
The son of Daegu.

1954
01:07:02,073 --> 01:07:03,332
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

1955
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,842
What's wrong with your shoulder now?

1956
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:05,972
- Are you serious?
- Gosh.

1957
01:07:05,973 --> 01:07:07,742
Why would your shoulder hurt from doing this?

1958
01:07:07,743 --> 01:07:10,089
It wasn't even a ceremonial pitch. Why would your shoulder hurt?

1959
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,912
That was disappointing from the son of Daegu.

1960
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:13,443
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

1961
01:07:14,683 --> 01:07:16,953
You have to go for it, Jae Suk.

1962
01:07:17,383 --> 01:07:18,652
We have to make it to Round Two from here.

1963
01:07:18,653 --> 01:07:19,653
(Jae Suk is the only one left.)

1964
01:07:19,654 --> 01:07:20,683
All right, Jae Suk.

1965
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:23,192
(It's all up to Jae Suk now.)

1966
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:24,223
Jae Suk.

1967
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:26,593
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

1968
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:29,832
- Let's go, Almighty Yoo.
- Let's do this.

1969
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,362
(Let's go, Almighty Yoo!)

1970
01:07:31,363 --> 01:07:34,063
(Fourth try, Jae Suk)

1971
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:40,873
(Fourth try, Jae Suk)

1972
01:07:44,983 --> 01:07:46,783
(Failure)

1973
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,352
That was so close!

1974
01:07:48,353 --> 01:07:50,283
Gosh, that was so close!

1975
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:52,483
That was so close!

1976
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:57,453
- Should we use the coupon?
- Sure.

1977
01:07:57,623 --> 01:07:59,262
We have to...

1978
01:07:59,263 --> 01:08:02,163
- turn things around.
- We have to change the atmosphere.

1979
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:05,413
- But that was so close.
- We'll use the coupon.

1980
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,632
One person must be subbed off.

1981
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:11,472
If you look intently at the person you wish to sub off,

1982
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:12,602
the substitution will be made.

1983
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:14,342
(Understanding)

1984
01:08:14,343 --> 01:08:16,742
She looked at him even before I finished speaking.

1985
01:08:16,743 --> 01:08:18,083
- The son of Daegu?
- I see.

1986
01:08:18,143 --> 01:08:19,143
All right.

1987
01:08:19,183 --> 01:08:20,583
- Let's go for it.
- Right.

1988
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:23,652
We used the bonus coupon.

1989
01:08:23,653 --> 01:08:24,653
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

1990
01:08:24,654 --> 01:08:25,722
- Bong Sik will go first.
- Right.

1991
01:08:25,723 --> 01:08:28,493
(Bonus Coupon Round)

1992
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:29,852
Let's go!

1993
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,222
(Coupon Round, Bong Sik)

1994
01:08:32,223 --> 01:08:34,362
(Bong Sik fails.)

1995
01:08:34,363 --> 01:08:35,533
(Coupon Round, Kyung Ah)

1996
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:41,532
Oh, no!

1997
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:42,533
(Kyung Ah fails too.)

1998
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:45,203
(There are two people left.)

1999
01:08:45,543 --> 01:08:47,102
- Will you go?
- You should go.

2000
01:08:47,103 --> 01:08:48,612
- Me?
- No. I'll go.

2001
01:08:48,613 --> 01:08:50,312
(Coupon Round, Jae Suk)

2002
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:51,342
Do it for us.

2003
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:54,783
(Jae Suk and Yeon Seok must all make it.)

2004
01:08:56,653 --> 01:08:57,783
Please.

2005
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:00,423
You have to do it.

2006
01:09:05,593 --> 01:09:06,893
- He did it!
- Nice!

2007
01:09:08,563 --> 01:09:09,833
- He did it!
- Nice!

2008
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,902
(Jae Suk makes it!)

2009
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:15,902
(Coupon Round, Jae Suk)

2010
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,342
(It's just Yeon Seok left.)

2011
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:19,373
Great.

2012
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:20,843
Let's do this, Yeon Seok.

2013
01:09:21,443 --> 01:09:23,143
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

2014
01:09:23,313 --> 01:09:25,542
- I didn't expect him to make it.
- All right.

2015
01:09:25,543 --> 01:09:26,863
(I didn't expect him to make it.)

2016
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,313
Let's go to Round Two.

2017
01:09:29,513 --> 01:09:31,623
Gosh, it was done really smoothly.

2018
01:09:32,783 --> 01:09:34,792
- You did it earlier, Yeon Seok.
- Right.

2019
01:09:34,793 --> 01:09:35,852
Just do the same thing.

2020
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:37,322
Just think that you're the first one up.

2021
01:09:37,323 --> 01:09:38,462
Just do what you did earlier.

2022
01:09:38,463 --> 01:09:39,562
(Coupon Round, Yeon Seok)

2023
01:09:39,563 --> 01:09:40,593
This much power.

2024
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:42,263
Let's make it happen!

2025
01:09:42,264 --> 01:09:44,763
You felt it just now, Yeon Seok.

2026
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:47,633
Go with the same feel.

2027
01:09:50,203 --> 01:09:51,273
This was it!

2028
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:55,273
This was it!

2029
01:09:57,213 --> 01:09:59,383
(Failure)

2030
01:09:59,813 --> 01:10:04,213
(He fails by just an inch.)

2031
01:10:06,823 --> 01:10:08,892
Gosh, I thought I had it.

2032
01:10:08,893 --> 01:10:09,993
That was so close.

2033
01:10:10,723 --> 01:10:12,993
Once you get stuck in Round Two...

2034
01:10:13,893 --> 01:10:14,993
I'm just practicing.

2035
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:18,033
A bit more distance than what I did just now.

2036
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:21,573
That's good.

2037
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:24,333
You're that good.

2038
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:28,573
- Sung Kyun.
- Right.

2039
01:10:28,574 --> 01:10:29,612
- Give it a try.
- Let's do this.

2040
01:10:29,613 --> 01:10:30,943
Practice is the only way for us.

2041
01:10:33,143 --> 01:10:34,342
(It's short again.)

2042
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:37,082
Can you try to make it fall off the table once?

2043
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,523
Use more power, Sung Kyun.

2044
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:40,482
- Gosh.
- I'll make it go this far.

2045
01:10:40,483 --> 01:10:42,723
- Okay. A bit more power.
- Right. Use a bit more power.

2046
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,422
(Being weak again)

2047
01:10:45,423 --> 01:10:47,933
What's the problem with him?

2048
01:10:48,363 --> 01:10:50,003
Do you not have any antler medicine here?

2049
01:10:50,633 --> 01:10:52,953
Wasn't that too short compared to how much he reached out?

2050
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:54,973
I knew it.

2051
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:57,273
We should get him some red ginseng at least.

2052
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:00,083
- Push it out a bit more.
- Push it out a bit more.

2053
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:02,942
- That was good.
- Just get the right direction.

2054
01:11:02,943 --> 01:11:04,013
Okay.

2055
01:11:04,213 --> 01:11:05,842
Do you want to go first?

2056
01:11:05,843 --> 01:11:07,512
- Okay.
- It's the sixth try.

2057
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,182
- Will you go for it?
- I will.

2058
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,982
- In, 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

2059
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:12,782
(Sixth try, Sung Kyun)

2060
01:11:12,783 --> 01:11:14,283
- He did it.
- Nice!

2061
01:11:16,793 --> 01:11:18,223
- He did it.
- Nice!

2062
01:11:18,823 --> 01:11:19,862
(The son of Daegu has done it!)

2063
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,632
(Grunting)

2064
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:24,462
(Sixth try, Sung Kyun)

2065
01:11:24,463 --> 01:11:25,803
(Touched)

2066
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:28,703
(Amazed)

2067
01:11:30,803 --> 01:11:31,873
Yes!

2068
01:11:32,573 --> 01:11:33,703
Nice one!

2069
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:35,143
The son of Daegu.

2070
01:11:35,843 --> 01:11:37,812
The son of Daegu has finally done it.

2071
01:11:37,813 --> 01:11:40,242
(Son of Daegu)

2072
01:11:40,243 --> 01:11:42,412
All right, Bong Sik. You got this.

2073
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:44,152
(Just one person needs to make it for them to pass the round.)

2074
01:11:44,153 --> 01:11:45,283
Let's go!

2075
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:47,683
- He did it!
- He did it!

2076
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:50,623
(Bong Sik fails.)

2077
01:11:51,393 --> 01:11:52,462
Who should go first?

2078
01:11:52,463 --> 01:11:53,792
(Sixth try, Bong Sik)

2079
01:11:53,793 --> 01:11:56,533
- You should go. Do it for us.
- Me?

2080
01:11:57,763 --> 01:12:00,603
(Engineer Hyun Bo Ram gets to work.)

2081
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,872
We still have you even if I am to fail.

2082
01:12:02,873 --> 01:12:04,273
I'll do it just like I did earlier.

2083
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:05,803
- Is everything okay, sir?
- Yes.

2084
01:12:08,413 --> 01:12:09,413
You did it earlier.

2085
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:10,942
Right. I felt what it was like.

2086
01:12:10,943 --> 01:12:12,042
(They pass Round 2 if Yeon Seok makes it.)

2087
01:12:12,043 --> 01:12:13,842
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2088
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:15,882
(Sixth try, Yeon Seok)

2089
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:16,953
I felt what it was like.

2090
01:12:17,283 --> 01:12:18,353
I think he'll make it.

2091
01:12:19,983 --> 01:12:21,023
Please.

2092
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:24,223
I see it coming.

2093
01:12:28,663 --> 01:12:29,793
It was around this much.

2094
01:12:32,203 --> 01:12:33,203
He did it!

2095
01:12:37,303 --> 01:12:38,543
It was around this much.

2096
01:12:41,773 --> 01:12:43,912
(Yeon Seok did it!)

2097
01:12:43,913 --> 01:12:46,683
(Sung Kyun and Yeon Seok did it!)

2098
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:48,283
It was around this much.

2099
01:12:48,453 --> 01:12:52,153
(A thrilling moment of success)

2100
01:12:56,993 --> 01:12:59,392
(The Pink Boys are delighted.)

2101
01:12:59,393 --> 01:13:00,393
- All right.
- You're the best!

2102
01:13:00,394 --> 01:13:02,592
We pass Round Two!

2103
01:13:02,593 --> 01:13:03,992
My gosh.

2104
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:05,003
(They pass Round 2.)

2105
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:07,332
- You have to decide now.
- All right.

2106
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:09,202
- Seven, eight, nine, and ten.
- There are four tries left.

2107
01:13:09,203 --> 01:13:10,572
- There are four tries left.
- Right.

2108
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:12,902
- Take some time to think.
- Take some time to think.

2109
01:13:12,903 --> 01:13:14,442
(It's time for them to decide to go or stop for Round 3.)

2110
01:13:14,443 --> 01:13:15,842
I'll say it won't be easy.

2111
01:13:15,843 --> 01:13:18,182
It won't be easy, but we're doing pretty well.

2112
01:13:18,183 --> 01:13:19,382
- We're doing well.
- Right.

2113
01:13:19,383 --> 01:13:21,863
- Right. You can stop if you wish.
- You can stop if you wish.

2114
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:24,412
- Have you decided?
- In 1, 2, 3.

2115
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:25,553
- Go!
- Go!

2116
01:13:26,723 --> 01:13:27,753
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2117
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:30,263
I shouldn't have said we were doing well.

2118
01:13:30,523 --> 01:13:31,993
- Gosh.
- Good luck!

2119
01:13:32,693 --> 01:13:34,333
- You can do it!
- You just saw us do it.

2120
01:13:34,963 --> 01:13:37,132
- All right. Draw the prize.
- This time,

2121
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,702
- will it be Kyung Ah?
- Sure.

2122
01:13:38,703 --> 01:13:40,143
I really hope we can make it happen.

2123
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,472
A trip to Seoul to see your favorite artists...

2124
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:44,272
"and enjoy your hobbies."

2125
01:13:44,273 --> 01:13:45,742
"A day's trip won't be enough."

2126
01:13:45,743 --> 01:13:48,942
"Two suite room tickets to Grand Walkerhill Seoul."

2127
01:13:48,943 --> 01:13:50,072
(2 suite room tickets to the hotel in Gwangjin-gu!)

2128
01:13:50,073 --> 01:13:51,213
Two tickets?

2129
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:53,543
These are the tickets?

2130
01:13:53,813 --> 01:13:54,912
For 3 days and 2 nights?

2131
01:13:54,913 --> 01:13:56,713
(They are worth over 1,500 dollars.)

2132
01:13:57,453 --> 01:13:59,452
Let's go!

2133
01:13:59,453 --> 01:14:01,852
That hotel is close to Jamsil.

2134
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:03,653
- One ticket is for one room, right?
- Right.

2135
01:14:03,693 --> 01:14:05,922
I hope our way back home...

2136
01:14:05,923 --> 01:14:07,063
will be...

2137
01:14:07,763 --> 01:14:09,562
proud and peaceful.

2138
01:14:09,563 --> 01:14:10,692
(Round 3)

2139
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:12,933
(The number of gongjindans will be increased.)

2140
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:15,673
So two must be placed on top?

2141
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:18,403
Why move them away?

2142
01:14:18,643 --> 01:14:19,643
(Two people must make it again.)

2143
01:14:19,644 --> 01:14:20,872
Aren't they too far apart from each other?

2144
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,143
So... What?

2145
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:25,312
We must make it twice with two gongjindans?

2146
01:14:25,313 --> 01:14:26,643
(Are you serious?)

2147
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,213
Will you move away, Yeon Seok?

2148
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:31,853
- Yeon Seok! Move away.
- But...

2149
01:14:32,423 --> 01:14:33,823
(He practices right away.)

2150
01:14:35,453 --> 01:14:36,553
This is too hard.

2151
01:14:38,993 --> 01:14:42,592
(He makes it right away?)

2152
01:14:42,593 --> 01:14:43,663
Sir.

2153
01:14:43,863 --> 01:14:45,602
- Jae Suk.
- I'm amazing during practice.

2154
01:14:45,603 --> 01:14:46,603
Right.

2155
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:50,032
What does that make me?

2156
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:52,473
- I'm like Messi during practice.
- You really are.

2157
01:14:52,803 --> 01:14:54,043
You're amazing during practice.

2158
01:14:54,973 --> 01:14:56,113
Right.

2159
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:59,843
- You're amazing during practice.
- I'm amazing during practice.

2160
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,813
Sir, that was touching.

2161
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:06,003
- It's all thanks to you.
- Thank you.

2162
01:15:09,223 --> 01:15:11,493
(He makes it again!)

2163
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:15,392
(He's a deity during practice.)

2164
01:15:15,393 --> 01:15:16,832
We should just go for it.

2165
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:18,002
- Gosh.
- Just go for it now.

2166
01:15:18,003 --> 01:15:19,762
- You have to go now.
- Gosh.

2167
01:15:19,763 --> 01:15:22,333
- I got surprised by that too.
- Hurry! Do it now!

2168
01:15:22,433 --> 01:15:23,433
Gosh.

2169
01:15:23,434 --> 01:15:25,372
- I got surprised by that too.
- Hurry! Do it now!

2170
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:27,602
- I got surprised too.
- It's our seventh try. Here we go!

2171
01:15:27,603 --> 01:15:29,142
- Do it now.
- Hold on.

2172
01:15:29,143 --> 01:15:30,512
Just as you did during practice.

2173
01:15:30,513 --> 01:15:31,982
- Hey, I got surprised too.
- Just do exactly the same.

2174
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:33,582
- Hey, I got surprised too.
- Just do exactly the same.

2175
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,413
- I got surprised too.
- Just go.

2176
01:15:35,853 --> 01:15:37,012
Just as you did during practice.

2177
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:39,883
(He will make it if he does exactly the same as during practice.)

2178
01:15:46,693 --> 01:15:48,933
(He fails.)

2179
01:15:49,863 --> 01:15:51,863
I knew it.

2180
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:53,932
(The practice genius lives up to his name.)

2181
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:55,933
- Gosh.
- I should've used less power.

2182
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:58,102
You use more strength during the actual attempt.

2183
01:15:58,103 --> 01:15:59,423
- You use more strength.
- Right.

2184
01:15:59,943 --> 01:16:01,203
You use more strength.

2185
01:16:01,273 --> 01:16:03,073
It's just the same as earlier.

2186
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:05,842
- This is a try.
- Bong Sik.

2187
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:07,212
(Seventh try, Bong Sik)

2188
01:16:07,213 --> 01:16:08,752
- This is a try.
- Bong Sik.

2189
01:16:08,753 --> 01:16:11,012
- We aren't practicing.
- It's a try.

2190
01:16:11,013 --> 01:16:12,052
(Seventh try, Bong Sik)

2191
01:16:12,053 --> 01:16:13,483
I was trying, but it didn't work.

2192
01:16:14,323 --> 01:16:16,123
- You knew it was a try?
- Yes.

2193
01:16:17,393 --> 01:16:18,463
What?

2194
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:19,893
He knew it was a try.

2195
01:16:20,693 --> 01:16:21,933
- Wait a second.
- All right.

2196
01:16:22,763 --> 01:16:23,993
- Sung Kyun.
- You go first.

2197
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:26,402
- You can do it like earlier.
- Right.

2198
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:27,902
(Sung Kyun and Yeon Seok both have to succeed.)

2199
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:29,633
It's actually the same as earlier.

2200
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:32,902
(Revving)

2201
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:34,642
- That's good.
- Son of Daegu.

2202
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:35,672
(Okay, son of Daegu.)

2203
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:37,912
(Sung Kyun succeeded in both Rounds 1 and 2.)

2204
01:16:37,913 --> 01:16:41,552
(Seventh try, Sung Kyun)

2205
01:16:41,553 --> 01:16:43,083
(It was too short.)

2206
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,253
You failed.

2207
01:16:46,553 --> 01:16:49,053
(Their seventh try ends in failure.)

2208
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:50,923
- Let's practice.
- Okay.

2209
01:16:51,093 --> 01:16:52,463
Don't do anything unplanned.

2210
01:16:52,693 --> 01:16:54,022
I had a good feeling.

2211
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:56,232
If only you'd succeeded,

2212
01:16:56,233 --> 01:16:57,933
I could've finished it.

2213
01:16:58,333 --> 01:16:59,862
The son of Daegu needs some practice.

2214
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:01,023
(The son of Daegu practices.)

2215
01:17:06,673 --> 01:17:08,572
(A change in perspective)

2216
01:17:08,573 --> 01:17:09,672
(Slapping)

2217
01:17:09,673 --> 01:17:10,849
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

2218
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:12,683
- I felt frustrated.
- Okay, give it a try.

2219
01:17:13,783 --> 01:17:14,952
One is Bong Sik's.

2220
01:17:14,953 --> 01:17:16,953
(They try all kinds of things out of frustration.)

2221
01:17:17,913 --> 01:17:19,253
Push it harder.

2222
01:17:20,183 --> 01:17:21,793
Is something wrong with this?

2223
01:17:22,623 --> 01:17:23,722
(Something is wrong with the friction.)

2224
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:24,723
No.

2225
01:17:25,123 --> 01:17:26,663
(Stepping forward)

2226
01:17:31,533 --> 01:17:33,203
(Rubbing the table)

2227
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,632
(Planing the table)

2228
01:17:35,633 --> 01:17:36,803
Let's create a path.

2229
01:17:38,003 --> 01:17:39,903
What are you doing, Bong Sik? Come and help me.

2230
01:17:41,773 --> 01:17:43,743
(The engineer joins in.)

2231
01:17:47,113 --> 01:17:50,413
(They all smooth it out together.)

2232
01:17:52,053 --> 01:17:53,823
(Employee of the day)

2233
01:17:56,053 --> 01:17:57,322
Thank you.

2234
01:17:57,323 --> 01:17:58,823
- Thank you.
- Of course.

2235
01:18:01,863 --> 01:18:03,433
(Equipment inspection)

2236
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:06,563
- That's right.
- Gosh.

2237
01:18:06,564 --> 01:18:07,863
(Perfect!)

2238
01:18:08,933 --> 01:18:10,633
- Let's try it.
- Let's try it.

2239
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:14,043
- Let's give it a try.
- We have two tries left.

2240
01:18:14,803 --> 01:18:15,912
Okay, let's go.

2241
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:16,913
(It is now try number nine.)

2242
01:18:16,914 --> 01:18:18,282
Please let it work.

2243
01:18:18,283 --> 01:18:19,413
- Bong Sik.
- Yes.

2244
01:18:20,043 --> 01:18:21,323
- Let's huddle together.
- Okay.

2245
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:22,812
Let's go. Come on.

2246
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:23,982
In 1, 2, 3.

2247
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:25,052
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2248
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:27,453
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2249
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:29,193
- Bong Sik.
- You go ahead.

2250
01:18:29,593 --> 01:18:31,452
You just have to do what you did earlier, Bong Sik.

2251
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:32,522
Okay.

2252
01:18:32,523 --> 01:18:35,462
(Ninth try, Bong Sik)

2253
01:18:35,463 --> 01:18:37,032
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2254
01:18:37,033 --> 01:18:39,902
(Ninth try, Bong Sik)

2255
01:18:39,903 --> 01:18:40,903
He's going to make it.

2256
01:18:40,904 --> 01:18:44,872
(Ninth try, Bong Sik)

2257
01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:45,943
He did it!

2258
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:48,613
They went, "He did it!"

2259
01:18:49,873 --> 01:18:51,013
You did it.

2260
01:18:52,043 --> 01:18:53,712
- Unbelievable.
- Wait a minute.

2261
01:18:53,713 --> 01:18:54,742
- Bong Sik.
- Wait a minute.

2262
01:18:54,743 --> 01:18:55,952
(Bong Sik did it.)

2263
01:18:55,953 --> 01:18:57,113
Bong Sik.

2264
01:18:58,053 --> 01:18:59,282
- Would you like to try?
- I'll go next.

2265
01:18:59,283 --> 01:19:01,183
- Will you?
- I have the lowest possibility.

2266
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:03,253
- Give it a try.
- I don't think I can.

2267
01:19:03,653 --> 01:19:05,653
- I think you can do it.
- I think you'll succeed.

2268
01:19:05,763 --> 01:19:06,892
- I think it'll work.
- Me too.

2269
01:19:06,893 --> 01:19:07,993
That was cool.

2270
01:19:08,093 --> 01:19:10,033
- Sung Kyun.
- Don't feel pressured, Sung Kyun.

2271
01:19:10,463 --> 01:19:12,302
- Son of Daegu.
- Son of Daegu!

2272
01:19:12,303 --> 01:19:13,303
(The look of a Victory Fairy)

2273
01:19:13,304 --> 01:19:17,932
(Ninth try, Sung Kyun)

2274
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,073
It's going to work.

2275
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:21,042
It's going to work.

2276
01:19:21,043 --> 01:19:22,612
(Ninth try, Sung Kyun)

2277
01:19:22,613 --> 01:19:23,673
That was so close.

2278
01:19:24,273 --> 01:19:25,512
- Well done.
- That was really close.

2279
01:19:25,513 --> 01:19:26,513
(It was a narrow miss.)

2280
01:19:26,743 --> 01:19:27,843
That was good, Sung Kyun.

2281
01:19:28,413 --> 01:19:29,682
(Ninth try, Jae Suk)

2282
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:32,523
(Jae Suk, who is outstanding during practice)

2283
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,823
Yeon Seok can go after me.

2284
01:19:36,953 --> 01:19:39,693
Please just succeed, Jae Suk.

2285
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:50,432
(Even Jae Suk fails.)

2286
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,873
I should've given it a lighter push.

2287
01:19:52,503 --> 01:19:54,042
It should've been lighter.

2288
01:19:54,043 --> 01:19:55,612
(Ninth try, Yeon Seok)

2289
01:19:55,613 --> 01:19:57,673
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2290
01:19:58,013 --> 01:19:59,143
People make mistakes.

2291
01:20:00,013 --> 01:20:03,753
(Now, it is up to Yeon Seok.)

2292
01:20:04,283 --> 01:20:06,883
This is what you're best at, Yeon Seok.

2293
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,622
(Yeon Seok is best at finishing a game in one shot.)

2294
01:20:09,623 --> 01:20:12,393
Go for it. You've been succeeding often lately.

2295
01:20:12,923 --> 01:20:14,863
- You have it in you.
- I succeeded earlier.

2296
01:20:15,163 --> 01:20:16,932
Let's go back to Seoul...

2297
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:18,832
- with a light heart.
- Let's go happily.

2298
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,263
- Here I go.
- Let's go!

2299
01:20:20,533 --> 01:20:21,872
- Let's go!
- I did it earlier.

2300
01:20:21,873 --> 01:20:22,972
Let's go.

2301
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:26,742
(Ninth try, Yeon Seok)

2302
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:27,823
- You did it.
- You did it.

2303
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:30,543
- Gosh.
- You did it.

2304
01:20:31,413 --> 01:20:32,643
- My gosh.
- No.

2305
01:20:34,013 --> 01:20:35,113
That was close.

2306
01:20:35,813 --> 01:20:37,012
(Try number nine ends in failure.)

2307
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:39,083
- No!
- He was good earlier.

2308
01:20:39,683 --> 01:20:41,523
- I had a good feeling.
- Me too.

2309
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:44,152
- I'm sorry.
- That was close.

2310
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:46,263
(That was close.)

2311
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:49,233
Bong Sik started off amazingly.

2312
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,463
- Bong Sik did an amazing job.
- Right.

2313
01:20:53,663 --> 01:20:54,733
All right.

2314
01:20:58,743 --> 01:21:00,403
(Chuckling)

2315
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:03,673
I'm such an idiot.

2316
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:07,312
(The cry of Jae Suk, who is only good during practice)

2317
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:09,283
I'm sorry. I was saying it to myself.

2318
01:21:10,053 --> 01:21:13,022
- When you're practicing...
- I'm so good.

2319
01:21:13,023 --> 01:21:14,183
He's like Messi.

2320
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:18,252
Since it's our last try, decide the order we should go in.

2321
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:20,063
- This is our last try.
- It's our last try.

2322
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:23,263
- The order?
- Yes, we'll go in that order.

2323
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:25,763
Let's see.

2324
01:21:26,033 --> 01:21:27,632
- Jae Suk, you go 1st.
- I go 1st?

2325
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,173
- Yes, then you go 2nd.
- I'm 2nd.

2326
01:21:29,273 --> 01:21:30,802
- Then 3rd and 4th.
- He's 4th.

2327
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,163
(The order is Jae Suk, Sung Kyun, Bong Sik, and Yeon Seok.)

2328
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:34,643
Got it.

2329
01:21:35,543 --> 01:21:37,112
- This is the last try.
- It's our last try.

2330
01:21:37,113 --> 01:21:38,513
Let's make sure we have no regrets.

2331
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,442
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

2332
01:21:40,443 --> 01:21:41,752
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their last try.)

2333
01:21:41,753 --> 01:21:43,813
Number one, Yoo Jae Suk.

2334
01:21:44,753 --> 01:21:46,422
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2335
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:48,282
(Last try, Jae Suk)

2336
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,793
- The Messi of practice games.
- He...

2337
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:55,692
(Please let it go like practice.)

2338
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:59,162
(Last try, Jae Suk)

2339
01:21:59,163 --> 01:22:00,302
No, that wasn't...

2340
01:22:00,303 --> 01:22:01,563
(Gosh)

2341
01:22:03,933 --> 01:22:06,243
(What was that?)

2342
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:09,113
He's so good during practice.

2343
01:22:09,473 --> 01:22:10,873
- Seriously.
- I know.

2344
01:22:11,573 --> 01:22:13,183
- We're in trouble.
- Good luck.

2345
01:22:13,413 --> 01:22:15,012
- Let's go.
- It's not over yet.

2346
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:16,952
(Sung Kyun is the opposite and is good during the real game.)

2347
01:22:16,953 --> 01:22:18,013
What's wrong?

2348
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:19,122
(Last try, Sung Kyun)

2349
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:20,953
You might succeed suddenly.

2350
01:22:21,523 --> 01:22:23,392
You might succeed suddenly.

2351
01:22:23,393 --> 01:22:27,822
(Last try, Sung Kyun)

2352
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:28,932
You did it.

2353
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:30,063
He did it.

2354
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:32,602
You did it.

2355
01:22:32,603 --> 01:22:33,703
He did it.

2356
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:35,972
He did it.

2357
01:22:35,973 --> 01:22:37,972
(Last try, Sung Kyun)

2358
01:22:37,973 --> 01:22:40,802
(He missed by a fraction.)

2359
01:22:40,803 --> 01:22:41,972
It was on the plate.

2360
01:22:41,973 --> 01:22:43,273
Why did it bounce off?

2361
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,743
That was...

2362
01:22:48,013 --> 01:22:50,312
Are you sure you placed it properly?

2363
01:22:50,313 --> 01:22:52,583
(The engineer steps forward.)

2364
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,152
(Properly)

2365
01:22:56,153 --> 01:22:57,293
What was that?

2366
01:22:57,523 --> 01:22:59,043
"Are you sure you placed it properly?"

2367
01:23:00,963 --> 01:23:02,263
- Look.
- You still have it.

2368
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:04,332
- Wait.
- You still have it.

2369
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:05,432
Did you place it properly?

2370
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:06,832
Why did it bounce off?

2371
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:09,103
"Are you sure you placed it properly?"

2372
01:23:09,403 --> 01:23:11,073
It's never bounced off like that.

2373
01:23:11,473 --> 01:23:12,642
Please, Bong Sik.

2374
01:23:12,643 --> 01:23:14,042
(Last try, Bong Sik)

2375
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:15,542
Let's go, Bong Sik.

2376
01:23:15,543 --> 01:23:17,372
If Bong Sik fails, it's over.

2377
01:23:17,373 --> 01:23:18,642
(If Bong Sik fails, it's over.)

2378
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:19,942
If Bong Sik fails, it's over.

2379
01:23:19,943 --> 01:23:21,043
Please succeed.

2380
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:24,152
(Please.)

2381
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:25,623
I should've succeeded.

2382
01:23:27,123 --> 01:23:29,952
(Their fate is in the hands of Bong Sik.)

2383
01:23:29,953 --> 01:23:35,123
(Last try, Bong Sik)

2384
01:23:37,663 --> 01:23:38,663
Gosh.

2385
01:23:38,664 --> 01:23:40,202
(Bong Sik did it.)

2386
01:23:40,203 --> 01:23:41,363
That was amazing.

2387
01:23:41,703 --> 01:23:43,302
- Unbelievable.
- Hey, that was great.

2388
01:23:43,303 --> 01:23:44,603
You did it.

2389
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:46,003
Gosh.

2390
01:23:47,303 --> 01:23:48,642
It isn't over yet.

2391
01:23:48,643 --> 01:23:50,372
- All right.
- Bong Sik.

2392
01:23:50,373 --> 01:23:52,383
- It isn't over until it's over.
- We can do this.

2393
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:55,042
- Go, Yeon Shik.
- It isn't over until it's over.

2394
01:23:55,043 --> 01:23:57,252
- It's time, Yeon Shik.
- You're right.

2395
01:23:57,253 --> 01:24:00,153
- It's time!
- How did you do that?

2396
01:24:00,253 --> 01:24:01,382
How did you do it?

2397
01:24:01,383 --> 01:24:02,822
- Wait a minute.
- How did you do it?

2398
01:24:02,823 --> 01:24:04,153
Make sure it's placed properly.

2399
01:24:06,763 --> 01:24:08,093
That's right.

2400
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:09,692
Gosh, Bong Sik.

2401
01:24:09,693 --> 01:24:11,493
- That's right.
- Is that okay?

2402
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:12,962
The last player.

2403
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:14,132
(The finale in Daegu)

2404
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,873
- The last one.
- Come on.

2405
01:24:16,273 --> 01:24:17,932
- Gosh.
- I don't know.

2406
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:19,072
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

2407
01:24:19,073 --> 01:24:20,203
Let's do it.

2408
01:24:20,243 --> 01:24:22,312
- First of all...
- You did so well up until now.

2409
01:24:22,313 --> 01:24:24,713
Yeon Seok, impress me.

2410
01:24:25,413 --> 01:24:28,582
(Yoo One Shot, who always delivers at the end)

2411
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:30,983
This is our last try out of ten total tries.

2412
01:24:31,253 --> 01:24:32,652
If we succeed, we clear Round Three.

2413
01:24:32,653 --> 01:24:34,252
(This is their last chance to win the guests their presents.)

2414
01:24:34,253 --> 01:24:35,393
You can do it.

2415
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:37,122
He delivers.

2416
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:42,592
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

2417
01:24:42,593 --> 01:24:43,663
You did it.

2418
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:45,933
You did it.

2419
01:24:50,003 --> 01:24:51,033
You did it.

2420
01:24:57,443 --> 01:25:04,413
(They are all in shock.)

2421
01:25:05,483 --> 01:25:09,153
(They end up failing.)

2422
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:11,392
That was so close, right?

2423
01:25:11,393 --> 01:25:12,923
- Wait.
- Wait a second.

2424
01:25:13,523 --> 01:25:14,893
Did you see that?

2425
01:25:15,763 --> 01:25:17,093
- It was so close.
- It's okay.

2426
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:18,463
Look at that.

2427
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:20,132
(Sadly, one gongjindan rolled off.)

2428
01:25:20,133 --> 01:25:21,902
- That was so close.
- Maybe it wasn't placed properly.

2429
01:25:21,903 --> 01:25:24,073
Wasn't that a success?

2430
01:25:25,003 --> 01:25:26,203
Seriously.

2431
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:28,443
It went on the plate.

2432
01:25:29,173 --> 01:25:30,243
Wait a second.

2433
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:32,213
No.

2434
01:25:32,783 --> 01:25:34,542
- No.
- Wait a second.

2435
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:35,882
(Staring)

2436
01:25:35,883 --> 01:25:37,483
Can we have half the presents?

2437
01:25:45,363 --> 01:25:46,522
We succeeded in half of the mission.

2438
01:25:46,523 --> 01:25:50,192
(We got half of it on the plate.)

2439
01:25:50,193 --> 01:25:52,702
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

2440
01:25:52,703 --> 01:25:54,002
Thank you.

2441
01:25:54,003 --> 01:25:55,302
(They give the guests souvenirs instead of the lavish presents.)

2442
01:25:55,303 --> 01:25:56,473
I feel so bad.

2443
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:03,472
We were hoping to go home...

2444
01:26:03,473 --> 01:26:05,743
with a light heart.

2445
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:07,713
I'm very sad.

2446
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:10,413
This was my second time on the show,

2447
01:26:10,753 --> 01:26:11,912
but we didn't fail last time.

2448
01:26:11,913 --> 01:26:13,252
- This is your 1st time, right?
- It's his 1st time.

2449
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:15,553
- This is how it feels.
- This is how you feel.

2450
01:26:16,493 --> 01:26:18,662
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2451
01:26:18,663 --> 01:26:19,893
- It's okay.
- We're fine.

2452
01:26:20,423 --> 01:26:21,822
- It's really okay.
- It's okay.

2453
01:26:21,823 --> 01:26:22,892
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2454
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:24,293
We're going home heavy-hearted.

2455
01:26:24,933 --> 01:26:26,332
(I have a question.)

2456
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:27,832
You seem to play half-heartedly...

2457
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:30,632
until the end, and then focus.

2458
01:26:30,633 --> 01:26:31,772
- I see.
- At the end?

2459
01:26:31,773 --> 01:26:35,072
I came here determined to stay focused from the start.

2460
01:26:35,073 --> 01:26:36,543
- Ji Jin Hee.
- I'll end it.

2461
01:26:40,743 --> 01:26:42,212
You don't want it to end too soon.

2462
01:26:42,213 --> 01:26:44,182
- Five, four...
- Come on.

2463
01:26:44,183 --> 01:26:45,452
Why did you start counting when I was blowing on it?

2464
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,052
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

2465
01:26:47,053 --> 01:26:48,952
(He forgot about focusing from the start.)

2466
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:50,652
(What is the charm of climbing?)

2467
01:26:50,653 --> 01:26:52,762
(Hijacking the conversation)

2468
01:26:52,763 --> 01:26:54,763
(Focusing on nothing but the conversation)

2469
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,832
(Explaining the principle of climbing)

2470
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,333
- Can you just show us?
- Okay.

2471
01:26:58,733 --> 01:26:59,763
Here I go.

2472
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:02,703
(A family member Jin Hee relies on)

2473
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,603
(Jee Seok Jin)

2474
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,442
(He was the oldest performer at the Waterbomb festival.)

2475
01:27:06,443 --> 01:27:07,943
(Get over here.)

2476
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,413
(The Waterbomb star gets upset.)

2477
01:27:09,443 --> 01:27:10,642
(Hey, Dancing Bear.)

2478
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:12,012
(Yes, Private Dancing Bear.)

2479
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:13,137
(Singing)

2480
01:27:14,036 --> 01:27:15,957
(They enjoy the big brother's cute performance.)

2481
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:17,982
(Even if big brother is devastated, )

2482
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,823
(it's okay as long as it isn't me.)

2483
01:27:20,223 --> 01:27:21,752
(Chungju Jee clan loses face.)

2484
01:27:21,753 --> 01:27:23,513
(You're bad when it comes to the real game.)

2485
01:27:23,593 --> 01:27:25,292
(The oldest brother cries.)

2486
01:27:25,293 --> 01:27:27,493
(The little older brother goes crazy.)

2487
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:29,563
(Overly immersed)

2488
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:32,043
(The day of the Jee family from Chungju...)

2489
01:27:32,067 --> 01:27:35,066
(goes smoothly.)

2490
01:27:35,067 --> 01:27:37,237
(Whenever Possible)

2491
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:45,426
(Whenever Possible)
