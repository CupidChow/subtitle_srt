1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,780
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,620
Oh, my.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,150
Spring is in full swing now.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,519
Gosh, yes. It is.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,320
(The spare time between winter and summer...)

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,459
- Oh, my. Look at this.
- Goodness.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,919
- Trees are budding.
- This is nice.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,590
- They're so verdant now.
- My gosh.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,889
I didn't know there was a park like this here.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,100
- We're at Cheongdam Park.
- I see.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,570
I've never entered the park from this side...

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,370
although I graduated...

13
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,399
- from a nearby high school.
- Wait.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,910
You did? Which high school?

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,410
Kyunggi High School.

16
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,079
- You graduated from Kyunggi High?
- Yes.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,920
Why did you go to school in this neighborhood?

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,410
What would be wrong with that?

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,279
- I mean...
- Why would you ask that?

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,420
Because you didn't grow up around this neighborhood.

21
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,779
I still went to Kyunggi High School...

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,290
- when I was little. Yes.
- Really?

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,750
I didn't know there was a spot like this at Cheongdam Park.

24
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,119
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Hello.

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,260
My goodness.

26
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,940
The thing is, we're filming our first episode today.

27
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,000
But we already filmed an episode last week.

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,929
Why would you mention that?

29
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,839
Well, how could I not?

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,176
There were news articles and so on.

31
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,810
There were pictures of us on the street.

32
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,140
- We can't lie to the viewers.
- I see.

33
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,209
But there's an important update.

34
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,779
Our show aired after 10pm in the previous seasons.

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,756
- It got pushed up to 9pm.
- It got pushed up to 9pm.

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,119
So you're watching the 1st episode of our 3rd season.

37
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,549
- Hello.
- Hello.

38
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,189
(There was some spare time, so we're back.)

39
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,559
- Well, some viewers waited...
- Yes.

40
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,460
For a new season for a long time.

41
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
But some viewers are clueless about our show.

42
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,059
- We can't...
- "Why are you they back?"

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,899
- They might wonder that.
- assume that everyone...

44
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,430
- Right.
- watched our show.

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,599
At this rate, the viewers might think...

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,269
we want to film the show only when the weather is good.

47
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,569
(Will the new season begin only when the weather is good?)

48
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,046
It's hard to film the show when the weather is too hot or cold.

49
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,479
- This is a great season...
- Yes.

50
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,939
- for walking around.
- Right.

51
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,849
- So we're back with a new season.
- Yes.

52
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,149
- The weather is amazing today.
- Yes, it's amazing.

53
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,319
Seeing how we're meeting...

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,879
- our guests at Cheongdam Park...
- I'm curious about them.

55
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,380
Do they live around here?

56
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,420
That's my guess.

57
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,219
- I also live around here.
- Yes.

58
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,389
- It's near Apgujeong and Nonhyeon.
- It's not far from here. Right.

59
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,830
This park isn't far from my house.

60
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,330
(Whenever Friend 1: Humming)

61
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,030
- My gosh, it smells great here.
- What? Yes.

62
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,440
This park is excellent for walks.

63
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,140
How long have you been living in Cheongdam?

64
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,909
I think it's been about 30 years.

65
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,110
I've lived here a long time.

66
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,950
(He lived in Cheongdam-dong for over 30 years?)

67
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,726
- When you're rushing.
- Yes. Then it's obvious.

68
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,719
- Right.
- Yes. By the way...

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,390
(Chuckling)

70
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,259
(Upon hearing a familiar voice, )

71
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,330
(he responds right away.)

72
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,260
(A familiar laugh resonates in Cheongdam-dong.)

73
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,969
- It's my friend. I knew it.
- Seung Won.

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,939
No wonder we're starting at Cheongdam Park.

75
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,200
Wait, isn't that Gong Myoung?

76
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,539
(Today's Whenever Friends: Gong Myoung and Cha Seung Won)

77
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,770
My throat hurts.

78
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,609
My throat hurts.

79
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,940
"My gosh. Whenever Possible..."

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,609
(Responding with his signature laugh)

81
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,150
- My gosh.
- Whenever Possible...

82
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,120
(Already feeling delighted)

83
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,849
- Seung Won.
- Whenever...

84
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,649
No wonder we're filming at Cheongdam Park.

85
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,650
(The two of them are thrilled to see each other.)

86
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,559
- Yes.
- It's been a while, Gong Myoung.

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
(Gong Myoung and Yeon Seok hug each other right away.)

88
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,229
- Do you know him?
- Of course, I do.

89
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,229
- Have you seen him on TV?
- We last met on "Running Man."

90
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,359
- That's right.
- I see.

91
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,359
Did you seriously ask me if I saw him on TV?

92
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,630
- Yeon Seok...
- Yes?

93
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,550
- Let's go to the bench first.
- Let's go.

94
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,799
- Let's go.
- What about Yeon Seok?

95
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,240
- What about me?
- Yeon Seok...

96
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,069
and I are starring in a movie together.

97
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,509
- It's a recent movie.
- Yes, it is.

98
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,840
- It's a recent movie?
- Yes.

99
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,979
- Did you film a movie together?
- The shoot went well.

100
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,026
- But we never met at the shoot.
- We didn't work together.

101
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,950
- How?
- That happens.

102
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,819
- We didn't have any scenes...
- When you film movies,

103
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,889
- you don't get to meet...
- By the way,

104
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,850
why are you looking down on me on the hill?

105
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,359
- The three of you...
- We picked the wrong spot to stand.

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,289
- Hey, you're younger than me.
- Come on.

107
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,059
- Even so, do I have to look up...
- My gosh.

108
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,200
Like this just to see you?

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,970
(Making up in 0.1 seconds)

110
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,599
- Well, Seung Won is...
- It's been so long, Gong Myoung.

111
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,470
- practically my older brother.
- Hey!

112
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,170
- Yes. It's been a while.
- Okay.

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,270
- Hold on.
- Whom are you greeting?

114
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,609
Hey.

115
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,586
- The sound director.
- He greeted the sound director.

116
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,149
- Seung Won, take a seat.
- We're like a family.

117
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,679
What do you mean you're like a family?

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,949
- He's not...
- You haven't met him in a while.

119
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,880
- my real family. Let's sit down.
- Okay. Right.

120
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,689
- I knew it.
- Yes.

121
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,949
I had a hunch.

122
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,360
The fact that we were starting at Cheongdam Park...

123
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,090
- made me think he'd be a resident.
- Right.

124
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,699
- My gosh.
- You didn't know we were coming?

125
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,276
- They don't tell us.
- They don't tell us.

126
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,030
- Why not?
- "Why not?"

127
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,876
That's just how it is. They don't tell us in advance.

128
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,339
Seriously? Why does the show have to be so secretive?

129
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,339
- I doubt that was their intention.
- Okay.

130
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,409
You're the first guests...

131
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,650
- of our third season.
- Right.

132
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,209
- It's to pique your curiosity.
- Seung Won...

133
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,649
and Gong Myoung are joining us today.

134
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,949
That's not important. So...

135
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,219
this is the third season of the show.

136
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,726
- Yes, it's our third season.
- Right.

137
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,270
Does your show need this many seasons?

138
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,419
- I mean...
- Seung Won.

139
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,549
Have you ever watched our show?

140
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,889
- No. Me?
- Well...

141
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,059
- I have.
- You have?

142
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,729
- Here's what he said earlier.
- I watched the one with Kwang Soo.

143
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,730
What did he say?

144
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,360
"Yeon Seok is the MC?"

145
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,169
(It's a loaded question.)

146
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,929
- Here's what I said.
- Then he never watched our show.

147
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,369
"Yeon Seok is the MC?"

148
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,070
"Hold on. I'm sure Jae Suk can host the show alone."

149
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,409
(Laughing hard)

150
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,179
I'm supporting him as his assistant.

151
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,679
- He's doing a good job.
- Yes.

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,979
- I bet he's doing a good job.
- He is.

153
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,149
- So this is my love language.
- Yes.

154
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,019
- Right. I know that.
- I say the opposite of what I mean.

155
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,759
If I'm teasing him like this,

156
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,289
- it means I really like him.
- Yes.

157
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,230
If I compliment someone, it means I hate them.

158
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,029
- Or people you're not close to.
- Right.

159
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,569
- That's so true.
- Exactly. Right.

160
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,099
It's lovely to see Seung Won.

161
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,839
- But I haven't seen you in a while.
- Yes.

162
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,869
(Suddenly acting politely)

163
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,869
The last time we met was on "Running Man."

164
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,909
Has it been five years?

165
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,070
It's been six years.

166
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,139
I filmed "Extreme Job" in 2019.

167
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,410
- Right.
- I see.

168
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,309
- He and I...
- Yes?

169
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,319
Worked together in a music video.

170
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,519
- They worked together before.
- Which music video?

171
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,119
- It was Yu Hui Yeol's music video.
- Yes.

172
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,219
- Right?
- Yes. "Three of Us."

173
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,420
It was for "Three of Us."

174
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,019
- Yes.
- Really?

175
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,489
Back then,

176
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,989
- he had just made his debut.
- Yes.

177
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,429
- I was really young back then.
- Yes.

178
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,959
- In the beginning of your career?
- Yes.

179
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,399
- That was ten years ago, right?
- Right.

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,470
Right.

181
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,769
When we filmed the music video together,

182
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,669
I knew he would make it in our industry.

183
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,169
Gong Myoung does give off that vibe.

184
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,440
We filmed the music video on Jeju Island.

185
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,179
I still remember it.

186
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,849
He bought me seaweed soup with brown turban shell.

187
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,679
- Right.
- So...

188
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,419
it was the first time my senior...

189
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,289
took care of me and bought me a meal.

190
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,949
I was so grateful and enjoyed the soup.

191
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,420
I knew he'd be successful.

192
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,290
So it was an early investment.

193
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,529
Of course.

194
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,329
You know what? I noticed this...

195
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,159
about Gong Myoung. A lot of ladies like him.

196
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,899
- Why?
- They love him.

197
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,229
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

198
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,230
- More than me?
- Yes.

199
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,440
- My gosh.
- "My gosh."

200
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,239
- Why you?
- No.

201
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,839
- "Why you?"
- That's...

202
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,170
- You all saw the reaction earlier.
- Everyone...

203
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,639
- They were crazy about me.
- It's not about that.

204
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,850
People who were going to work were in a frenzy after seeing me.

205
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,620
- Why?
- They were so thrilled to see me.

206
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,019
- Hey. My gosh.
- I doubt they were that thrilled.

207
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,049
I have witnesses. Why aren't you saying anything?

208
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,119
(Looking for witnesses)

209
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,460
Gosh, this is crazy.

210
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,559
You don't know how popular Seung Won used to be, right?

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,889
I don't know much about your career when you were young.

212
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,300
No way. My gosh, he was so famous.

213
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,800
He ruled the modeling scene before his acting career.

214
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,870
- Right.
- Gosh.

215
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,206
He completely dominated the industry.

216
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,969
After that, he started filming dramas and movies.

217
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,110
- I took the industry by storm.
- Well, so...

218
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,269
Seung Won, I'm bringing that up...

219
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,039
- Okay.
- because they don't seem to know.

220
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,880
- Will a mere explanation suffice?
- No.

221
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,109
- You were a sensation.
- Hey.

222
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,349
His face was basically everywhere.

223
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,219
- You know?
- They need to see the past records.

224
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,720
Seriously. Not a lot of great actors these days...

225
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,260
mingle with others by making himself approachable.

226
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,859
(Wiping his nose)

227
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,500
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

228
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,789
I'm saying this because I know about your career.

229
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,099
Are you being nice to me because it's been a while since we met?

230
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,130
You bet.

231
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,499
Seriously. My gosh.

232
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
He'll text me later.

233
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,640
- "Thanks, Jae Suk."
- Right.

234
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,240
- "Thank you so much."
- "Thank you."

235
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,909
When did your laughter become your thing?

236
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,909
- Seung Won...
- It wasn't my thing before.

237
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,880
It's all because of Jae Suk.

238
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,219
- Before I meet him, - Yes?

239
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,650
I tell myself that I'm not going to laugh like this.

240
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,036
But whenever we meet, he does this.

241
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,619
(Whenever they meet, he can't help but laugh.)

242
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,560
- Then it begins.
- Yes.

243
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,860
- You've been playing along lately.
- Yes.

244
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,130
(He's given up now.)

245
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,140
By the way, what's the connection between you two to being our guests?

246
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,580
- Did you film something together?
- You tell them.

247
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,979
We filmed "Mercy for None" together.

248
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,079
- It's called "Mercy for None."
- "Mercy for None."

249
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
- It's based on a webtoon.
- Yes.

250
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,879
The genre is noir, through and through.

251
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,179
- To be honest...
- Yes?

252
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,820
(Pausing)

253
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,019
The name of your character was Geum Son, right?

254
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,490
- No.
- What was it then?

255
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,889
Don't say anything. Seung Won, stay out of this.

256
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,629
- You should at least know his role.
- Don't say anything, Seung Won.

257
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,070
- Listen.
- Don't promote the drama.

258
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,529
- I...
- Stop it.

259
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm only interested in my character.

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,570
Anyway, I'm Mr. Kim in the drama.

261
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,539
My character is Mr. Kim. What's yours?

262
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,840
- My character is Gu Joon Mo.
- Right. Gu Joon Mo.

263
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,679
Have you done noir before?

264
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I haven't.

265
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,339
- Isn't this your 1st one?
- Yes, it's my 1st one.

266
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,150
- We had only 1 scene together.
- Just 1 scene.

267
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,350
His character is really rude.

268
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,949
- His character is rude.
- He's so rude.

269
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,389
- That's his character, not him.
- My gosh.

270
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,519
It's just his character.

271
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,490
Well, he must be somewhat rude to be able to play a rude character.

272
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,710
- Isn't that true?
- I see.

273
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,030
He's able to pull it off because he has a rude side.

274
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,969
- All right. Let's get going now.
- We... Yes.

275
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,799
- Go where?
- This is our first episode.

276
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,869
- Yes.
- Okay.

277
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,139
- Let's do this.
- Here are the Whenever Guests...

278
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,209
of our first episode.

279
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,270
What's that? My gosh.

280
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,640
What's that? My gosh.

281
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,109
The list is short...

282
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,779
- since it's our 1st episode.
- We're meeting 2 people.

283
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,809
Lee Soo Ji.

284
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,980
- Soo Ji?
- Yes.

285
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,020
"I'm in the never-ending cycle of interviews and deadlines."

286
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,980
- A reporter?
- Is she a reporter?

287
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,690
"When I need a pick-me-up, I go for bread."

288
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,060
"I relieve stress by indulging in sweet, fast-aging diets."

289
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,400
"Fast-aging diets."

290
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,700
"Would you like to share a sweet bite with us?"

291
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,870
"P.S. We've got tasty desserts covered. Just bring coffee."

292
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,870
- Are they reporters? Deadlines?
- Or...

293
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,580
do they work in a bakery or something?

294
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,579
- But they have deadlines.
- Wait.

295
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,880
Or a magazine company?

296
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,049
- Is it a magazine company?
- A magazine company.

297
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,290
- Let me look up the address.
- Okay. Go ahead.

298
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,490
They told us to bring coffee, right?

299
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,390
It's near Gangnam-gu Office Station. I see.

300
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,059
We can go down this way and get on a bus for a few stops.

301
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,829
No, we're nearby. We can go down this way and be there.

302
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,299
- Really?
- We can go down...

303
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,669
- this way.
- Then let's walk there. Let's go.

304
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,829
It will take 20 minutes if we walk there.

305
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,670
- It's not a walkable distance.
- But...

306
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,340
Then what do you want to do?

307
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,570
You said we could go that way.

308
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,811
- Listen. Hear me out.
- You said it wouldn't take long.

309
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,320
- It wouldn't take that long.
- Okay.

310
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,849
- But it's not a walkable distance.
- It's not walkable.

311
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,490
- That's what I meant. Yes.
- Is that so?

312
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,749
- Let's go, Seung Won.
- Okay. The bus...

313
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,479
- Is it that you don't want to walk?
- No.

314
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,489
- Should we take separate cars?
- I enjoy walking.

315
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,750
(Laughing)

316
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,659
I enjoy walking.

317
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,120
(Current time, 9:31am)

318
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,590
- Did you work out today?
- Yes, I did.

319
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Seung Won worked out before meeting us.

320
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,699
- Unbelievable.
- What time did you wake up?

321
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,300
I got up around 5:30am.

322
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,799
- Impressive.
- I try to sleep early...

323
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,809
- the day before shoots.
- That's a good habit.

324
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,109
Do you sleep around 10pm?

325
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,570
- Yes, I do.
- I see.

326
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,079
- I have to.
- I'm like that too.

327
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,140
Right?

328
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,610
At least...

329
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,410
What are you two doing?

330
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,879
- It's so nice to see him.
- These two are funny.

331
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,790
They keep patting each other on the back.

332
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,550
- We can do it too.
- We can do it too.

333
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,790
(Laughing)

334
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,319
- That seems awkward.
- Why?

335
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,859
- We look young and fresh.
- Seung Won and I are close.

336
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,760
We're extremely close.

337
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,500
We've known each other for quite a long time.

338
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,470
(Glancing)

339
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:40,599
Gong Myoung seems to go for a sexy look today.

340
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,810
His T-shirt has a deep neckline.

341
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,809
- I tried to look nice.
- I can see that.

342
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,309
It's been a while since I was on a TV show.

343
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,879
Really? Are you two matching?

344
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,349
Seung Won and I...

345
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,510
are wearing matching outfits.

346
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,820
- We all match with someone.
- It wasn't planned, but...

347
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,390
Those two...

348
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,719
- look like sea bream.
- Okay.

349
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,029
- Sea bream?
- Are you calling us fish?

350
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,589
Come on. Look at them.

351
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,499
- You're right. Striped seabream.
- Yes, they're striped seabream.

352
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,569
- We don't have any stripes.
- That's right.

353
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,530
What would you say you two are?

354
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,139
- We are...
- Halibut?

355
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,099
- We are royalty of the sea.
- Come on.

356
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,110
- Royalty?
- We're tuna.

357
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,339
What?

358
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,110
Aren't we squid?

359
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,010
Aren't we squid?

360
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,809
I'm cuttlefish, Seung Won.

361
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,080
This is hilarious.

362
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,119
Do we just continue...

363
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,449
- Of course.
- walking straight?

364
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,349
- Just walk straight.
- Yes, for a while.

365
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,359
- This is nice.
- I'm grateful to Seung Won.

366
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,930
In the early days of "Infinite Challenge,"

367
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,530
Seung Won and I had to do several tough things.

368
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,999
We even went into a coal mine.

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
- I remember that.
- Seung Won always...

370
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,300
- I was grateful for that.
- I remember it.

371
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,269
Seung Won said to me,

372
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,670
"It's always tiring when I have a shoot with you."

373
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,239
This is nothing compared to that.

374
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,920
- Of course not. This is nothing.
- I see.

375
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,979
- When we meet the guest, - Yes?

376
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,249
We have to clear missions.

377
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,880
- If we fail, there is no prize.
- We can't give them the prize.

378
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,449
You feel sad when you fail.

379
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,589
- You feel bad...
- You know what?

380
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,560
- about not giving them anything.
- I don't feel guilty about that.

381
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,129
- I don't feel bad.
- You don't?

382
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,399
- No, I don't.
- However,

383
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,870
people who say that...

384
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,829
- try their best when playing games.
- Wait and see.

385
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,300
Wait and see, Seung Won.

386
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,899
Do the people who say that...

387
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,910
- play passionately?
- Of course.

388
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,010
Even when I watched this show on TV,

389
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,510
I could see how winning a game released dopamine.

390
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,879
- It's impressive.
- It's amazing.

391
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,019
It's crazy.

392
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,920
- Yes, when we succeed.
- And you feel very happy.

393
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,349
- Do we take a bus from here?
- Yes, let's take it from here.

394
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,520
We're taking Bus 3426.

395
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,420
It's Bus 3426?

396
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,029
Hi.

397
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,660
(They wave to the people who say hello.)

398
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,500
- This is impressive.
- What?

399
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,869
- What is?
- Since I'm with you two...

400
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,870
- What?
- What?

401
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,900
- I've never seen this happen.
- See what happen?

402
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,710
I roam the streets freely.

403
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,009
- You do?
- Really?

404
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,409
Don't many people recognize you?

405
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,079
- No.
- I don't believe that.

406
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,880
I often take the bus and subway.

407
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,479
- Without a mask?
- Really?

408
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,719
- Yes.
- Really?

409
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,020
- Without a mask?
- Yes.

410
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,020
Maybe people consider it unrealistic.

411
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,319
That can't be true.

412
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,459
I'm sure people recognize Gong Myoung right away.

413
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,989
People rarely recognize me.

414
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,130
Come on.

415
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,400
- He's just saying that.
- I'm serious.

416
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,629
(Totally frustrated)

417
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,599
I heard he covers his face up to his eyes.

418
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,740
- That isn't true.
- Isn't it?

419
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,769
Are you going to keep lying?

420
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,369
- It's true.
- He covers his eyes...

421
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,279
- and wears a turban.
- Right?

422
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,809
- If you're sitting somewhere...
- Come on.

423
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,180
That can't be true.

424
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,780
- You'd stand out.
- It can't be possible.

425
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,749
This is our bus.

426
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,250
- Is it here?
- Yes, it's Bus 3426.

427
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,789
- I see empty seats.
- There are several empty seats.

428
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,259
There are several empty seats.

429
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,989
- This is nice.
- You can get on.

430
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,119
Hello.

431
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,429
- Hello.
- Hello.

432
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,459
- Hello.
- Hello.

433
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,529
Hello.

434
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,359
- Hello.
- Hello.

435
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,569
- Four adults.
- Hello.

436
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,529
This is the perfect seat.

437
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,969
(They take a seat after being warmly greeted by the driver.)

438
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,540
Do you sometimes take the bus?

439
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,539
- You rarely do, right?
- I never take the bus.

440
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,620
Why would I take the bus when I have my own vehicle?

441
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,240
- "Vehicle."
- "Vehicle."

442
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,050
I haven't heard that word for a long time.

443
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,219
- That's right.
- "Vehicle."

444
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,289
Vehicle.

445
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,419
Everyone called it a vehicle when we were young.

446
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,790
It isn't wrong.

447
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,620
Sedans were popular back then.

448
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,920
- Sedans?
- Yes.

449
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,130
Gong Myoung, do you own a vehicle as well?

450
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,129
- Yes, I do.
- You do?

451
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,559
Is it a sedan or something else?

452
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,829
- I drive an SUV.
- An SUV?

453
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,110
I thought he might drive an SUV.

454
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,739
It's because I like going camping.

455
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,910
- You do?
- You do?

456
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeon Seok likes camping too.

457
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,309
I have the recent Defender model.

458
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,410
You do?

459
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,950
We have that in common.

460
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,019
- You also ride motorcycles, right?
- Yes.

461
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,089
- I do too.
- I see.

462
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,889
They can't seem to live without each other.

463
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,689
They haven't been in touch for too long to say that.

464
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,489
- I know.
- But they're friendly.

465
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,629
When was the last time you two spoke to each other?

466
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,460
- We talk often.
- We talk all the time.

467
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,030
- You do?
- More often than with Yoo Hai Jin.

468
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,930
(Solid confirmation)

469
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,499
That's right.

470
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,070
It's strange...

471
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,639
going down a road...

472
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,239
- I often take.
- I bet, Seung Won.

473
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,950
- You know what?
- What?

474
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,479
I don't like filming in my neighborhood.

475
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,480
- I know. It feels strange.
- I feel anxious for some reason.

476
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,890
I also know many people in my neighborhood.

477
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,589
So I find myself looking around.

478
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,489
- Just in case you run into someone?
- That's right.

479
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,529
Of course.

480
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,559
It feels like you're getting caught working...

481
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,430
- by a friend.
- Yes, that's right.

482
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,300
You said it perfectly.

483
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,000
It feels like I'm showing them a side of me I want to keep hidden.

484
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,080
- I know the feeling.
- Yes, that's right.

485
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,669
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

486
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,740
Gosh.

487
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,080
- Where are we headed?
- What is around here?

488
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,249
I don't think there are any press companies nearby.

489
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,480
I don't think it's a press company.

490
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,120
- You said she interviews people?
- Yes.

491
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,590
She mentioned interviews and deadlines.

492
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,920
- Interviews and deadlines?
- Yes.

493
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,889
We're supposed to take coffee.

494
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,989
("P.S. We've got tasty desserts covered. Just bring coffee.")

495
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,529
- Should we buy it here?
- Let's buy it here.

496
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,560
- Here?
- Yes.

497
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,799
Have a nice day.

498
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

499
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,300
Wait a minute.

500
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,000
I think it's this building.

501
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,409
I think it's on the third floor of this building.

502
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,510
"Cosmetics?"

503
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,179
Over there.

504
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,649
(There are no signs at the given address.)

505
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,780
Cheongdam-ro...

506
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,920
- What's going on?
- Third floor.

507
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,579
- Is it here?
- Yes.

508
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,849
I think so.

509
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,919
(Navi Yoo is uncertain.)

510
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,089
- Isn't this right?
- Is it?

511
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,520
Isn't it? Did I get lost?

512
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,989
Wait a minute.

513
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,189
Why am I going alone?

514
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,100
- Wait a minute.
- Give him a minute.

515
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,520
- Is this not the place?
- Yeon Seok is checking.

516
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,499
Third floor. This is right.

517
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,060
Why do you sound so unsure of yourself?

518
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,869
It didn't look like the right place.

519
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,670
I'm disappointed that no one came in with me.

520
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,179
It's on the third floor.

521
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,716
(They all go together so no one gets disappointed.)

522
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,749
(Is this the right location for the first spare time spot?)

523
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,879
- Soo Ji?
- Yes, Lee Soo Ji.

524
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,179
I wonder...

525
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,900
- I know.
- what could be in this building.

526
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,449
- Go in.
- What is this?

527
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,689
"Patissier..."

528
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,760
Oh, a patissier.

529
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,330
- You're right.
- That means...

530
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,260
- Right?
- you were right.

531
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,200
- It's related to desserts.
- Yes.

532
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,499
- Hello.
- Hello.

533
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,830
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,330
- Come on in.
- Hello.

535
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,599
Hello.

536
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,239
Are you Soo Ji by any chance?

537
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,710
- That's me.
- I see.

538
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,439
Hello.

539
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,739
- Can we go in?
- Yes, come on in.

540
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,979
- Okay, we found Soo Ji.
- Let's take our shoes off.

541
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,180
Yes, take your shoes off.

542
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,980
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

543
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,390
You even bought new slippers.

544
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,919
(First Whenever Guest, Lee Soo Ji)

545
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,360
- They aren't new.
- They aren't?

546
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,260
They look totally new.

547
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,189
- Hello.
- Hello.

548
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,829
- Is this a magazine company?
- Hello.

549
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

550
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,300
We're here with Gong Myoung and Cha Seung Won.

551
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

552
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,300
It's a magazine company.

553
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,939
What magazine is it?

554
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,639
- She's holding it up.
- It's a pastry and baking magazine.

555
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,109
- I see.
- No wonder.

556
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,190
That's why you always have interviews and deadlines.

557
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,900
When was the magazine first published?

558
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,409
- It was in 1988.
- In 1988.

559
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,856
- That was a long time ago.
- It's been around for a long time.

560
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,200
Put these slippers on, Seung Won.

561
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,920
- His socks...
- Your socks are flashy.

562
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,560
The slippers are too small.

563
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,590
- Which way should we go?
- This way.

564
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,000
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

565
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,370
- There are several rooms.
- Yes, there are.

566
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,630
It was originally a home on the third floor.

567
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,440
How many people work here?

568
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,000
We have around 15 employees.

569
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,140
That is the editing department, and this is publishing.

570
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,539
This room is for the sales team.

571
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,809
- The sales team?
- Yes.

572
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,439
It really looks like a home.

573
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,480
Yes, it does.

574
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,610
(Marveling)

575
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,450
They have melon bread.

576
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,290
- You know it?
- Of course.

577
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,619
Look at that.

578
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,259
("P.S. We've got tasty desserts covered. Just bring coffee.")

579
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,590
- That's why we had to bring coffee.
- Yes, that's right.

580
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,929
- Who is Soo Ji?
- Me.

581
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,259
- What's your name?
- I'm Son Eun Ae.

582
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,429
- Eun Ae?
- Yes.

583
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,570
(The first Whenever Guests, Lee Soo Ji, Son Eun Ae)

584
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,340
Did Eun Ae start working first?

585
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,940
I only started a month or two earlier.

586
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,839
- Then...
- You could say we started together.

587
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,939
How long have you been working here?

588
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,739
I started in 2021, so this is my 5th year.

589
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,550
- It's already your fifth year.
- Yes.

590
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,050
Look at that.

591
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,619
- Here.
- We were curious.

592
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,419
We pick a theme every month...

593
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,089
and ask chefs for permission...

594
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,560
to photograph the food and share recipes.

595
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,190
That's why we have these desserts.

596
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,059
Since you have to eat the dessert...

597
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,659
- before writing articles, - Yes.

598
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,329
You must've tried all kinds of desserts.

599
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,999
- Yes, we tried everything in Seoul.
- We tried everything.

600
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,040
I see.

601
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,709
I learned today that there is a magazine for desserts.

602
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,010
And it was around since the 1980s.

603
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,110
We bring the desserts, lay them out,

604
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,750
and take photos of them.

605
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,319
We only eat desserts...

606
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,149
from the places that were good...

607
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,396
- These are the ones you chose?
- after writing articles.

608
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,289
(Desserts carefully selected by specialized journalists)

609
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,159
- Look at that.
- This looks delicious.

610
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,229
- Can I try it?
- Yes, try whatever you want.

611
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,029
We only chose the tastiest desserts.

612
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,729
- What are these? They look amazing.
- Those are chocolate bonbons.

613
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,130
It's a chocolate shell filled with ganache or cream.

614
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,870
(Chocolates with a little bit of alcohol)

615
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,339
Don't they have alcohol in it?

616
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,109
- Yes. How did you know?
- Right? I knew it.

617
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,239
This one has strawberry tequila.

618
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,709
- It has tequila in it?
- Yes.

619
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,550
This one has vanilla-flavored liqueur in it.

620
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,980
Try it and get drunk.

621
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,619
- Why?
- I shouldn't have it.

622
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,150
It'll be nice if you're tipsy.

623
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,759
It's Director Ma.

624
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
(The sweet and scary Director Ma surfaces.)

625
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:26,859
What's this?

626
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,530
It's a nut stick.

627
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,330
(Long and thin bread sticks with various nuts)

628
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,129
I eat it as a snack...

629
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,829
while working to meet a deadline.

630
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,830
- Nut sticks?
- Yes.

631
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:38,369
- I'll try one of these.
- Go ahead.

632
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,639
Let's see how nut sticks taste.

633
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,900
It's savory.

634
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,069
Chewing on it also keeps you awake.

635
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,469
Let me cut it for you.

636
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,880
Chewing on it also keeps you awake.

637
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,979
What's this?

638
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,779
It's choux a la creme.

639
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,650
You can think of it as choux puffs.

640
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,350
- The nut sticks are so good.
- It's tasty, isn't it?

641
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,689
(She succeeds in finding a dessert that hits the spot.)

642
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,920
This is amazing.

643
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,619
It's really tasty.

644
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,190
- Here you go.
- It really is.

645
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,560
Where can I buy this?

646
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,690
It's from a bakery...

647
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,299
near Sinnonhyeon Station.

648
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,129
- Near Sinnonhyeon Station?
- Yes.

649
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,199
- A bakery there?
- Yes.

650
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,529
Where did you get this?

651
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,540
It's from a place in Hannam-dong.

652
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,439
- It's a dessert shop.
- In Hannam-dong?

653
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,609
- It's in Hannam-dong.
- Yes.

654
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,969
It's very tasty.

655
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,479
What's surprising...

656
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,140
is that you remember...

657
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,349
exactly where they are from.

658
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
- Of course.
- Yes.

659
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:26,349
Since you write about it in detail.

660
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,380
- Yes.
- That's right.

661
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,719
- I love bread.
- You do?

662
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,819
Do you like bread, Gong Myoung?

663
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,889
- I love it.
- I have to eat at least three.

664
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,920
- You do?
- Yes.

665
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
(Another recommendation for the bread lovers)

666
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,489
Many bakeries in Korea...

667
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,129
- fill melon bread with cream.
- You're right.

668
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,329
- I don't like that.
- I see.

669
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,429
So this is melon bread without cream.

670
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,299
The original melon bread isn't filled with cream.

671
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,139
- This is melon bread without cream?
- Yes.

672
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,620
- It really doesn't have cream.
- No.

673
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,180
I feel like I was fooled.

674
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,010
It's green on the outside but white on the inside.

675
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,809
Try it.

676
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,479
I've never tried melon bread.

677
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,549
- You haven't?
- No.

678
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,080
(Marveling)

679
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,090
It's tasty.

680
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,359
- I can...
- It tastes like melon, right?

681
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,490
I love it.

682
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,880
- Isn't it tasty?
- It's so good.

683
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,929
Then people who like bread or desserts...

684
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,699
- must work here.
- That's right.

685
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,029
- Yes.
- I learned about this magazine...

686
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,929
- because I like bread and desserts.
- Me too.

687
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,699
I found this magazine in a bookstore...

688
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,769
and saw a job opening in it.

689
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,409
That's how I applied for the job.

690
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,379
I've never worked at the same place for five years before this.

691
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,509
- How did you stay here so long?
- I was surprised myself.

692
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,150
- It's about something you like.
- Right.

693
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,049
It must fit you well.

694
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,689
The company seems to have a friendly vibe.

695
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,019
- Yes, it does.
- It looks like someone's home.

696
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
- Yes.
- You're right.

697
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,959
There can be two sides to that.

698
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,159
Being friendly and family-like...

699
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,429
isn't always all good, right?

700
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,899
It can be uncomfortable at times.

701
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,669
The chief editor is too close.

702
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,669
It's like they're this close.

703
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,070
(Overreacting)

704
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,239
That's right.

705
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,909
The president's office is right next door.

706
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,669
- The president is nearby.
- You could say...

707
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,540
That looks like the boiler room.

708
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,109
Where is the president's office?

709
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,679
It looks like the break room.

710
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,079
There is a room next to it.

711
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,180
There is?

712
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,519
Why is the president's office...

713
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,619
next to the kitchen?

714
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,819
(If you open the door way in the back, )

715
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,989
(there is a sunny office that belongs to the president.)

716
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,019
- Is the president here?
- No, not today.

717
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,329
We are careful not to be too noisy...

718
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,699
when we eat or do other things here.

719
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,299
- You are?
- Yes, because of the structure.

720
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,029
What kind of bread...

721
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,139
are your readers interested in nowadays?

722
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,469
The readers...

723
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,470
(Hesitant)

724
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,409
We introduced it recently.

725
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,779
She needs this to tell us.

726
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,079
- It's in the magazine.
- Yes, it is.

727
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,309
(It's all over the cover of the magazine.)

728
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,180
You asked a useless question.

729
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,789
It's right there.

730
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,819
- Just take a look at it.
- Sorry.

731
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,919
- I know.
- Come on.

732
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,289
This is our March edition.

733
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,919
- We introduced salt bread.
- Salt bread in March.

734
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,089
It sold out...

735
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,329
- within the month.
- That's right.

736
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,559
- This edition?
- Yes.

737
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,969
You can see various types of salt bread in it.

738
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,329
Take a look here.

739
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,999
It isn't the original salt bread.

740
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,299
Pollack roe salt bread is really good nowadays.

741
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,399
- Yes.
- Yes, that's right.

742
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,009
You can see here...

743
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,069
that we listed places with salt bread all over Korea.

744
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,779
Then you can do a bread tour with it.

745
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,479
- That's right.
- That must be why...

746
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,680
- the March edition sold out.
- Yes.

747
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,549
Do you feel stressed about deadlines?

748
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,719
Yes, every month.

749
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,419
- We're super busy this week.
- It's the busiest week.

750
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,619
We usually take the last bus home.

751
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,689
What time did you go home yesterday?

752
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,359
Since I took the last bus home,

753
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,659
it was around 1:30am when I got home.

754
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,189
No wonder your eyes...

755
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,160
are bloodshot.

756
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,629
Does your busy schedule end today?

757
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,169
We won't have to work late after today.

758
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,250
We won't have to work late.

759
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,269
It was interesting to hear them...

760
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,069
talk about the job they had for five years.

761
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,510
But she just mentioned working late,

762
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,979
and they go home the next day.

763
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,049
I know.

764
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,349
Do you have get-togethers?

765
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,879
- We celebrate each edition.
- Yes, we have get-togethers...

766
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,589
and celebrate every month...

767
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,219
after publishing a new edition.

768
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,489
We visit a dessert shop we wanted to visit.

769
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,259
- I see.
- You do?

770
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,959
Don't you get...

771
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,729
sick of bread...

772
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,229
after the deadline?

773
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,529
- Not really.
- We get curious about desserts.

774
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,469
- You do?
- And we want to try new desserts.

775
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,599
- That's impressive.
- This job seems perfect...

776
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,399
for you two.

777
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,939
Yes, our passion is our profession.

778
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,369
- You're right.
- You're right.

779
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,240
It would be nice if your boss could hear this.

780
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,380
- You're right.
- Tell the boss to come.

781
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,649
They aren't at the office today.

782
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,619
They should hear things like this.

783
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,919
It's truly impressive.

784
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
(For the two journalists whose work is their passion...)

785
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:23,419
We'll start...

786
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,389
- by trying to clear the mission.
- That's right.

787
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,359
You have to pick coupons.

788
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,199
(Bonus coupon)

789
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,599
(A Whenever Guest can participate...)

790
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,469
(in a game in the place of one of the members.)

791
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,599
(It doesn't count as a try when a coupon is used.)

792
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,839
We always roll this die...

793
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,239
- when we visit a guest.
- We toss it.

794
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,410
The biggest number on it is two.

795
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,549
- The higher the number, - The better.

796
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,849
- the more chances you have.
- All right.

797
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,319
- Would you like to try, Soo Ji?
- Who would like to roll it?

798
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,449
I read my horoscope this morning,

799
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,226
but it said I only have 20 percent luck today.

800
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,920
I'm in the middle of my three years of misfortune.

801
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,229
Why would you bring that up?

802
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,830
Because she brought up her luck for today.

803
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,869
I'm in the middle of my three years of misfortune.

804
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,269
- You are?
- Yes.

805
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,469
- Would you like to roll it?
- Go ahead, Seung Won.

806
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,339
- Can I toss it...
- Just roll it.

807
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,839
- as high as I want?
- Yes.

808
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,009
- All right.
- We need to get a two.

809
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,039
- Two?
- Yes.

810
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,216
- All right.
- We need to get a two.

811
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,250
- Two?
- Yes.

812
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,110
(Chanting)

813
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,160
(They get 2 coupons!)

814
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,860
- Nice.
- Nice.

815
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,506
It can't be your three years of misfortune.

816
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,630
Is it over?

817
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,399
- It must be over.
- It must be.

818
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,510
He overcame it.

819
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,360
- He overcame the misfortune.
- Right.

820
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,539
Here are the two coupons.

821
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,940
Let's take a look at the prizes.

822
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,480
- What is it?
- What is it?

823
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,550
Let's check the prizes first.

824
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,279
- It must be written here.
- This is Round One.

825
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,549
The more rounds we play, the better the prizes are.

826
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,320
- That's right.
- I see.

827
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,529
"We enjoy desserts every day."

828
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,459
"We want to have coffee with it. A Nespresso coffee machine."

829
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,960
(Prize for Round 1, a coffee machine)

830
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,999
It's a coffee machine.

831
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,170
- Nice.
- You need that.

832
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,169
- Awesome.
- Don't you have a coffee machine?

833
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,170
- Wait.
- No, we don't.

834
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,310
- Really?
- That's great.

835
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,140
I use this at home.

836
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,679
It's a nice machine.

837
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Yes, it is.

838
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:29,709
(Jam Lid Flicking)

839
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,209
(They each flick a jam lid...)

840
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,880
(to get rid of the target lid.)

841
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,889
(Round 1, Target: 2 lids)

842
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,389
They're on the edge.

843
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,289
We have to push that off the table?

844
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,030
The 4 of you have to push off the 2 lids.

845
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,430
- For Round One.
- Yes.

846
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,829
They must've chosen jam jar lids on purpose.

847
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,759
Yes, since it's related to us.

848
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,169
That's why they are jam jar lids today.

849
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,400
- It isn't easy.
- It isn't easy.

850
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,670
That's right.

851
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,070
You don't have to flick it too hard, Seung Won.

852
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,379
- Give it a try, Gong Myoung.
- Give it a try.

853
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,440
Let me try.

854
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,850
Go ahead and practice.

855
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,010
Like that?

856
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,219
We only get one chance each.

857
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,260
- That's right.
- It's hard to make it go straight.

858
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,319
You can't flick it too hard.

859
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,860
How did you come up with this game?

860
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,930
Aren't you used to it by now?

861
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,059
- Do you need another one?
- Yes.

862
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,660
This is difficult.

863
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,270
You can't apply too much power.

864
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,539
It's hard to aim.

865
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,900
We have to succeed.

866
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,010
Wait a second.

867
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,810
- What?
- You do it like that?

868
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,480
- What?
- You do it like that?

869
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,850
Try it.

870
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,889
(Jae Suk and Seung Won hit the mark in a row.)

871
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,960
- Your aim is good.
- Should we give it a try?

872
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,290
Gosh.

873
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,589
- Let's give it a try.
- Yes, try it.

874
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,629
- Round One.
- How many tries do we get?

875
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,199
- We get a total of 10 tries.
- We get 10 tries.

876
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,499
We have a total of 10 tries but also have 2 free passes.

877
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,769
So you can think of it as 12 tries.

878
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,699
Okay, Round One.

879
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
In 1, 2, 3.

880
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:02,939
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

881
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,169
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

882
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,240
Let's go.

883
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,210
- Should I go first?
- Yes, go ahead.

884
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,549
It's better when there are two lids.

885
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,610
That's right.

886
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,880
(Focusing)

887
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,289
I could see how nervous you were.

888
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,389
You get nervous...

889
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,189
- when you're playing the real game.
- You get nervous.

890
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,259
He said, "I don't worry about it at all."

891
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,959
"I don't get nervous about things like that."

892
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,329
Why is my middle finger numb?

893
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,200
Seriously. Wait a second.

894
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,710
(First try, Seung Won)

895
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,910
Nobody move.

896
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,750
Yes!

897
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,079
(He hits 1.)

898
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,749
- Hey.
- Did you see that?

899
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,889
- What was that?
- Seung Won!

900
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,119
- He's got it now.
- He's got it.

901
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,190
- That was amazing.
- You're on a roll now.

902
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,759
- This is the tough part.
- That's incredible.

903
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,259
Only one of us has to hit it.

904
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,630
That was actually incredible.

905
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,670
- Seung Won!
- Awesome.

906
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,829
That was great.

907
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,739
We still have many chances. Take your time.

908
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,970
- Myoung, no pressure.
- Right.

909
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,339
Look. Picture...

910
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,140
one more lid here.

911
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,609
- You get what I mean?
- Yes.

912
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,709
That makes it so much easier.

913
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,309
Why are you giving him so much pressure?

914
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,320
Stay put. We need to give them the gifts.

915
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,049
All right. Good luck.

916
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,319
- Go for it, Myoung.
- Take your time.

917
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,789
- Take your time.
- All right.

918
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,919
(Try number one, Gong Myoung)

919
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,990
He's careful.

920
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,599
Good. It's fine.

921
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,269
It went to the spot where you told me to picture a lid.

922
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,369
I know.

923
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,039
Why did you tell him to picture it there?

924
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,940
Gosh. I shouldn't have said that.

925
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,869
- All right. My turn.
- Yeon Seok.

926
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,009
I mean, Jae Suk.

927
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,309
(Try number one, Jae Suk)

928
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,450
But it's better to imagine a lid.

929
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,809
Here I go.

930
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,880
If we make it in the first attempt,

931
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
- we can aim for Round 3.
- We can aim for Round 3.

932
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
Oh, gosh.

933
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,190
It was too weak.

934
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,230
I fail every time it begins.

935
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,199
(Try number one, Yeon Seok)

936
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,539
- It's Yeon Seok's turn.
- Take us home.

937
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,970
I'm pretty good at using my upper body.

938
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,610
I'm pretty good with my hands.

939
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,039
- Just make this one.
- Yes.

940
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,209
- Let's give it a go.
- Good luck.

941
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,309
- Okay. A straight line.
- Good luck.

942
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,380
Just like this.

943
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,180
- I'm going this way.
- Okay.

944
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,090
- All right.
- Just...

945
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,120
In a straight line.

946
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,559
- Too bad.
- You told us to look there, so...

947
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,959
These guys are unbelievable.

948
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,329
Seung Won did such a good job, though.

949
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,070
- That was so close.
- What does this mean?

950
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,230
- We failed.
- We failed try number one.

951
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,840
That was really close.

952
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,439
Do you want to try it right away?

953
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,509
- Should we practice?
- No.

954
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,409
- Just try it.
- In 1, 2, 3.

955
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,579
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

956
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,739
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

957
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,549
- I must be confident.
- Are you 2nd or 3rd?

958
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,780
I need to be confident. Don't get intimidated.

959
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,420
- There.
- Gosh!

960
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,320
How did it go right between them?

961
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,110
- That was so close!
- You've got the hang of it.

962
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,689
Move.

963
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,759
(Try number two, Seung Won)

964
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,860
You've got this. Please.

965
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,129
- He's so accurate!
- Yes!

966
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,229
You're so accurate.

967
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,100
Who says I'm in three years of misfortune?

968
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,999
He's really good!

969
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,139
He's so accurate!

970
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,169
(Amazed)

971
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,509
You're so accurate.

972
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,190
Who says I'm in three years of misfortune?

973
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,719
- You said so yourself.
- Hey.

974
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,149
That was amazing.

975
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,280
Seriously.

976
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,219
- He must feel comfortable.
- Next. Good luck.

977
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,819
- Give it a go.
- Me?

978
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,860
- Yes. You need to be confident.
- I'll go last.

979
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,529
Let's go!

980
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,459
- If he succeeds, - Yeon Seok.

981
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,500
- You need to make it.
- they get a coffee machine.

982
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,200
Oh, gosh.

983
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,010
How...

984
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,980
Oh, gosh.

985
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,710
How...

986
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,109
How can you flick it so far from it?

987
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,150
Which finger did you flick it with?

988
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,319
- How did he...
- Myoung.

989
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,649
- I get it.
- Let's go!

990
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,890
- Let's go, Myoung.
- Let's go!

991
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,459
Myoung, we need you to make this one.

992
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,589
- It's a lot of pressure on him.
- This is...

993
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,590
(Try number two, Gong Myoung)

994
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:20,659
(Focused)

995
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,069
I'm the only one here.

996
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,430
Good mindset.

997
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,369
Please make it.

998
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,170
(They pass Round 1 if they get rid of only 1.)

999
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,920
(Not even close)

1000
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,590
(Moaning)

1001
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,720
Are you hurt?

1002
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,159
- It was so...
- Did it hurt?

1003
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,520
I had such a good feeling, though.

1004
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,059
- We need to kick it up a notch.
- Gosh.

1005
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,420
We, the striped seabreams, must...

1006
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,599
(Seung Won's great performance was in vain.)

1007
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,970
Sadly, we failed.

1008
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,970
- It's fine.
- We...

1009
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,639
- But...
- If you had succeeded...

1010
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,710
her face hardened.

1011
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,039
- We should have...
- We have a total of ten tries.

1012
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,010
- Please smile.
- For the coffee machine!

1013
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,210
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1014
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,379
- Let's do this.
- Should we use...

1015
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,519
a coupon?

1016
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,749
- Should we?
- What's a coupon?

1017
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,989
- Then, Soo Ji should...
- One of you can...

1018
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,990
(A Whenever Guest can participate without losing a try.)

1019
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:22,259
Can the better one of us try it?

1020
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,429
- Sure.
- No?

1021
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,690
You have to flick it from here.

1022
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm terrible at this.

1023
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,999
- You should do it.
- Wait.

1024
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,139
- Eun Ae.
- Eun Ae.

1025
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,540
That's good energy.

1026
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,509
Eun Ae, who do you want to take out in this try?

1027
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,880
Please stare at the person you want out.

1028
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,580
(She naturally looks at...)

1029
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,620
- You're out.
- I'll step aside.

1030
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,990
- Then...
- We got rid of a striped seabream.

1031
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,759
- One striped seabream is out.
- Eun Ae, you'll go first.

1032
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,190
- Okay.
- You've got this.

1033
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,929
- I like your energy right now.
- Yes. You can do this.

1034
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,060
(Bonus coupon round)

1035
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,830
Just like you practiced.

1036
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,970
Yes!

1037
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,469
Yes!

1038
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,909
(Pinpoint accuracy)

1039
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,780
Her shots are so accurate!

1040
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,709
We're going to make it.

1041
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,979
- That was unbelievable.
- Look.

1042
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Her shots are so accurate!

1043
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,119
(This is our opportunity.)

1044
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,289
- I'll go right away.
- Hang on.

1045
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,589
- Seung Won hit that one so easily.
- You can do it.

1046
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,659
Seung Won hit it so easily.

1047
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,590
- He was all over it. We won.
- Please.

1048
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,130
- Please hit it.
- We won.

1049
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,999
- Seung Won hit it so easily.
- Seung Won.

1050
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,830
- He was all over it. We won.
- Please.

1051
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,330
Darn it.

1052
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,339
(Coupon round, Gong Myoung)

1053
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,609
- Gosh.
- Wait.

1054
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,839
- Myoung. You've got this.
- Take your time.

1055
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,710
(A golden opportunity created by the Whenever Guest)

1056
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,420
(I only need to take out one.)

1057
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Yes!

1058
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,320
Yes!

1059
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,460
(Yes!)

1060
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,400
Yes!

1061
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,040
- Why?
- Why...

1062
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,540
Yes!

1063
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,840
- Why?
- Why...

1064
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,950
- Why is this happening?
- Why did you...

1065
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,150
(So close)

1066
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,109
- Why do you do this to me?
- Why did you...

1067
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,079
- What's wrong with you?
- Why do you keep...

1068
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,490
- How come you're so weak?
- What's the matter with you?

1069
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,360
Come on.

1070
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,089
- Jae Suk.
- Oh, gosh.

1071
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,759
- You're our last hope.
- Jae Suk.

1072
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,659
- You have to make it.
- We have to make it this time...

1073
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,799
to make it to Round Two.

1074
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,729
- This is so...
- We need to succeed now.

1075
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,829
(Coupon round, Jae Suk)

1076
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,740
I mean it. It's now or never.

1077
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,770
(Exhaling sharply)

1078
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,649
(Failure)

1079
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,750
It's tough.

1080
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,390
It seems difficult.

1081
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,619
Can I practice?

1082
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,789
I should have hit it to the side.

1083
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,189
(Special training)

1084
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,190
Hold on.

1085
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,860
Okay.

1086
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,000
- Now, I understand.
- This is...

1087
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,870
You can stop worrying.

1088
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:18,999
(Realizing)

1089
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,740
Yes, that's what I'm talking about. Was it like this?

1090
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,969
(The striped seabreams are lost.)

1091
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,380
I'm getting the hang of it.

1092
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,110
Or not.

1093
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,980
I think I get it. Now...

1094
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,450
Can you let us use their attempts?

1095
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,860
Are you guys in the three years of misfortune?

1096
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,090
Seriously.

1097
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,436
- Who should go first?
- Shall we begin?

1098
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,829
- Jae Suk, you go 1st.
- I'll go 1st.

1099
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes, you go first.

1100
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,769
- That was so close.
- There are two. I'll take it easy.

1101
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,869
Try number four. Let's go.

1102
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,340
I hit a home run when I hit one.

1103
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,310
- We might not get to Round Three.
- This is it.

1104
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,380
Like this. There are two of them.

1105
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,380
Just hit one of them.

1106
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,650
Good. That's what I'm talking about.

1107
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,750
Good. That's what I'm talking about.

1108
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,419
(Yeon Seok!)

1109
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,829
- I'll go.
- No, go after me.

1110
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,059
- I'll go this time.
- Go after me.

1111
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,329
- Move.
- I did it!

1112
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,659
- Get out of the way.
- We can...

1113
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,106
- We can finally succeed.
- Seung Won.

1114
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,669
You should be going last.

1115
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,790
(Try number four, Seung Won)

1116
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,740
Yes, this is the spot.

1117
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,040
Darn it.

1118
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,740
That was close.

1119
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,480
Darn it.

1120
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,970
We should make him hit the one on the right.

1121
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,450
Can you move it?

1122
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,879
(Jae Suk can go before me.)

1123
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,690
We should make him hit the one on the right.

1124
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,089
Can you move it?

1125
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,289
No, we can't.

1126
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,689
(Try number four, Jae Suk)

1127
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,760
I...

1128
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,789
I don't think I can watch this. Please make it.

1129
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,859
(Try number four, Jae Suk)

1130
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,399
(Minute adjustments)

1131
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,000
I'll move it over here and go.

1132
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,140
(Please hit one.)

1133
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,080
You got it!

1134
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,350
You got it!

1135
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,749
(He's done it!)

1136
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,790
- Well done.
- Yes!

1137
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,620
You got it!

1138
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
You got it!

1139
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,389
You got it!

1140
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,529
(Clapping like seals)

1141
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,659
- Awesome.
- Yes!

1142
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,300
Yes! A coffee machine!

1143
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,500
- Thank you.
- We did it!

1144
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,500
- We did it.
- We did it.

1145
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,169
- Great.
- Round One.

1146
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,240
- Success!
- Success!

1147
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,210
That was great.

1148
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,110
Now, you need to make a decision.

1149
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,819
There are bigger prizes in Round Two.

1150
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,450
- However, it gets more difficult.
- It's way more difficult.

1151
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,890
And if we fail in Round Two,

1152
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,889
you lose all the prizes in Rounds 1 and 2.

1153
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,760
So, you must decide whether to go for it...

1154
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,459
- or stop here.
- Please make a decision.

1155
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,859
In 1, 2, 3.

1156
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,459
- Go.
- Go!

1157
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,940
Let's open the fortune cookie for Round Two, then.

1158
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,899
"I want to be able to get..."

1159
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,870
"warm, delicious bread whenever I want."

1160
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,609
"Samsung Qooker Multi-Oven."

1161
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,309
(Round 2, Samsung Multi-Oven)

1162
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,410
A multi-oven?

1163
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,349
What's that?

1164
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,520
(This multi-oven from Samsung lets you heat up bread easily.)

1165
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,970
I'll put this here so that we can give you both.

1166
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
(Round 2)

1167
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:29,530
(Target: 3 lids)

1168
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,460
- Three.
- Three.

1169
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,230
Isn't the possibility too low?

1170
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,569
(From 2 lids...)

1171
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,670
(to 3 lids)

1172
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,869
We might be able to hit it out with the ones...

1173
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,230
- Exactly.
- already on the table.

1174
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,339
We might be able...

1175
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,909
(They may be able to hit 2 lids with 1.)

1176
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,010
I'll go first.

1177
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,280
- We have to say, "Here we go."
- Seung Won.

1178
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,980
This is try number five.

1179
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,719
- All right. Let's win Round Two.
- Let's cheer.

1180
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,890
Yes, a cheer.

1181
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,220
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1182
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,019
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

1183
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,119
- We can hit 2 with 1.
- We might.

1184
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,260
- Yes.
- And...

1185
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,660
Gosh.

1186
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,030
- Yes.
- And...

1187
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,300
Gosh.

1188
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,840
But...

1189
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,500
You were too reckless.

1190
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,110
We have to hit it hard, though.

1191
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,269
Myoung, do you want to go early?

1192
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,940
- As you said, - Yes.

1193
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,279
- it's best to hit 2 with 1.
- Yes, 2 with 1.

1194
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,909
- Yes.
- It's possible.

1195
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,470
- That's the only way we can win.
- We need to hit at least one.

1196
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,290
- Now...
- Darn it.

1197
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,059
(It just flew away.)

1198
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,590
Close the door.

1199
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,060
Why...

1200
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:38,960
Come on.

1201
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,860
Please make it.

1202
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,170
- Hit one, at least.
- We might see a miracle.

1203
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,000
But, I...

1204
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,739
- But I...
- What was that?

1205
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,979
- But...
- That was...

1206
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,080
- You know, Myoung, - Now...

1207
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,710
I rarely say this,

1208
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,750
but you're terrible at this.

1209
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,949
We don't know yet, though.

1210
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,319
- Yes, so give it a try.
- Yes.

1211
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,520
I might...

1212
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,190
unbelievably...

1213
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,189
- hit all three of them.
- You might.

1214
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,460
Yes. We don't know that.

1215
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,630
- But...
- It would have to edge its way.

1216
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,469
It would have to...

1217
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,930
- edge its way through.
- Exactly.

1218
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,800
He might make it.

1219
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,909
It could...

1220
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,410
(Whatever the others talk about, )

1221
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,649
(the younger seabream practices by himself.)

1222
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,750
You need to be confident.

1223
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,380
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1224
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,420
- Just like I said.
- Yes.

1225
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,620
Oh, gosh.

1226
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,159
(He made up for others' mistakes a bit too late.)

1227
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,060
I think we should try and hit them 1 by 1.

1228
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,099
Unfortunately, we've failed.

1229
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,000
- Now, it's try number 6.
- Try number 6.

1230
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,329
All right, Myoung.

1231
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,039
- This isn't...
- I need to hit at least one.

1232
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,300
(He goes 1st as it's less pressure.)

1233
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,580
- I'll hit it hard. It was too weak.
- Yes, flick it hard.

1234
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,450
What?

1235
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,990
That's...

1236
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,419
(Scratching)

1237
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,690
Did you hear that sound?

1238
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,890
Myoung is...

1239
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,190
He's...

1240
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,629
- It's fine.
- We'll keep trying.

1241
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,229
(Try number six, Seung Won)

1242
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,429
- I...
- One at a time.

1243
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,639
Why do you keep...

1244
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,039
Let's hit them one at a time.

1245
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,739
- One at a time.
- One at a time.

1246
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,610
- One at a time.
- I get it.

1247
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,640
- I'll be discreet.
- Good.

1248
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,610
Yes, this is the spot.

1249
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,009
This is it.

1250
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,220
(One at a time...)

1251
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,550
(Please make it.)

1252
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Seung Won, what was that?

1253
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,400
(What just happened?)

1254
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,440
(Seung Won hits all of them out.)

1255
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,850
Who says I'm in my three years of misfortune?

1256
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
(I've done it!)

1257
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:12,550
Who said that?

1258
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,779
You completely blew away all three years!

1259
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,740
- All three years of misfortune.
- Who said that?

1260
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,760
Seung Won!

1261
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,190
Seung Won!

1262
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,210
(A shot to break down all three years of misfortune)

1263
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,630
(A shocking moment)

1264
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:31,999
How...

1265
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
(A miraculous shot)

1266
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:34,300
Who said that?

1267
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,040
- Yes!
- Great job.

1268
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,939
You completely blew away all three years!

1269
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,579
- All three years of misfortune.
- Who said that?

1270
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,810
What just happened?

1271
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,050
- Did you see that?
- Seung Won!

1272
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,220
- Nice shot.
- Gosh.

1273
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,519
- How did he do that?
- With one flick.

1274
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,120
I wish I could watch the replay.

1275
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,259
- I just...
- Now,

1276
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,700
we've passed Round Two!

1277
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,999
(They've passed Round 2.)

1278
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,760
- Seung Won.
- Are we going for Round Three?

1279
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,670
- Hold up.
- If you are, do it without me.

1280
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,369
- Seung Won.
- I'm totally drained.

1281
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,709
- How many tries do we have?
- We have...

1282
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,279
four attempts left.

1283
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,009
- But...
- Four attempts?

1284
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,810
They'll put four lids this time.

1285
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,950
It gets far more difficult.

1286
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,979
But the prize is bigger.

1287
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,220
It's not so easy to stop here,

1288
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,889
- but you can.
- I feel like you'll keep...

1289
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,189
doing well as you've got some practice in.

1290
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,460
But think it through.

1291
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,829
- I mean...
- You might lose all of that.

1292
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,030
You might.

1293
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,799
- You can have a discussion.
- Can we?

1294
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,770
- Talk to your colleagues first.
- Can we?

1295
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,306
Don't you think we can go for it? They might hit multiple again.

1296
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,469
That was...

1297
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,570
Round Three?

1298
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,839
- They have a good feeling about it.
- They want to go for it.

1299
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,169
- They have a good feeling.
- They can feel it.

1300
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,539
- They can feel it.
- What?

1301
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,509
- Pardon?
- We believe in you.

1302
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,379
- Eun Ae.
- You might lose everything.

1303
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,210
I told you to stop!

1304
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,149
- Goodness.
- Anyway...

1305
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,419
In 1, 2, 3.

1306
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,900
- We'll go for it!
- We'll go for it!

1307
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,189
This time...

1308
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,089
We do have a lot of attempts remaining.

1309
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,320
It'd be a shame to stop here.

1310
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,330
No way.

1311
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,859
"From interviews to writing copies,"

1312
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,429
"it's a necessary item for editors. Two iPads!"

1313
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,170
(The prize in Round 3 is 2 iPads.)

1314
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,240
- But we have to succeed first.
- Wait.

1315
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,339
- Seeing how happy you are...
- Exactly.

1316
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,240
- Two iPads?
- The pressure is bigger.

1317
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,149
(A must-have item for magazine editors, 2 iPads)

1318
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,319
- That's awesome.
- Every time we cover a story,

1319
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,579
- we're the only ones...
- We take notes.

1320
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,249
- taking notes by hand.
- Really?

1321
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,689
This is amazing.

1322
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,289
Now, we have to succeed.

1323
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,819
(Round 3)

1324
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,589
(Target: Eliminate 3 lids by hitting 1 lid each in a relay.)

1325
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,330
(But the lid you're flicking must stay on the desk to succeed.)

1326
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,570
- What?
- In a word,

1327
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,040
- we're dribbling the lid.
- That's correct.

1328
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,639
One person goes like this.

1329
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,040
- Yes.
- And...

1330
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,840
the next guy hits one out.

1331
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,726
We have to eliminate three like this.

1332
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,350
But the red one has to stay in the end?

1333
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,619
- But that's...
- That's so tricky.

1334
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,649
- How does it stay on the desk?
- It can. We've tried it.

1335
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,450
- Hold on.
- First of all,

1336
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,260
- the first guy has to...
- He has to bring it here.

1337
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,659
Put it here,

1338
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,289
- and the other three...
- That's right.

1339
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,659
- can hit them out 1 by 1.
- Precisely.

1340
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,900
Myoung was good at placing it here.

1341
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,599
- Putting it close?
- He was...

1342
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,499
- I can put it near them.
- good at putting it here.

1343
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,530
All right.

1344
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,039
- Can I practice?
- We might actually make it.

1345
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,139
- Let me practice.
- Go ahead.

1346
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,240
You can practice.

1347
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,939
- That's great.
- Like this?

1348
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,279
He knows how to bring it there.

1349
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,210
I'll safely place it right here.

1350
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,550
So, this is what you're here for!

1351
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,550
You were controlling the strength for that.

1352
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,189
You were invited for Round Three.

1353
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,850
- That's right.
- All right.

1354
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,619
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.
- Here we go.

1355
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,659
- Now, Myoung.
- Myoung, you've got this.

1356
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,629
- It's what you're good at.
- That's our strategy for now.

1357
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,730
(The 1st hitter's role is vital in Round 3.)

1358
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:48,830
Good luck.

1359
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,739
- There you go.
- He's good.

1360
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,170
- That's...
- He's so good at this.

1361
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,809
- There you go.
- He's good.

1362
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,880
- That's...
- He's incredibly good at this.

1363
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,409
You were here for Round Three.

1364
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,410
I knew you had potential.

1365
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,420
(Feeling proud)

1366
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,190
All right.

1367
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,550
We might succeed in one go.

1368
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,530
- Now...
- We might win.

1369
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,629
We have a shot at this.

1370
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,369
- Jae Suk, hit this one...
- Yes.

1371
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,090
- and we hit that one.
- Just like earlier.

1372
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,740
- Just like earlier.
- Yes, just like it.

1373
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,210
Great.

1374
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,380
Awesome.

1375
00:49:34,381 --> 00:49:36,139
(Their expectations grow.)

1376
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,210
Do it like before.

1377
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,410
That's good.

1378
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,050
Hold on.

1379
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:44,319
- Hold on. Listen.
- When he practiced it earlier...

1380
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,719
- This is it! We can do this.
- So, in this case,

1381
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,360
we should make it a success.

1382
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,659
If I aim it here, I can make it.

1383
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,089
- You should hit it here.
- If I aim it here,

1384
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,799
- it'll hit it here and go this way.
- Exactly.

1385
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,860
All right.

1386
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,469
- I think he can do it.
- Yes.

1387
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,869
If it goes this way!

1388
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,199
The last round!

1389
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,539
(Gong Myoung started it, and Yeon Seok will finish.)

1390
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,800
Wait a second.

1391
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,009
- Let's go!
- Don't be nervous. You can do it.

1392
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,309
I'll just do as I practiced.

1393
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,840
- Just do it.
- Do it.

1394
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,609
- Just as I practiced, - Yes, exactly.

1395
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,410
- I should hit it gently.
- Hit it gently.

1396
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,179
- I'll just hit it.
- Yes. Please.

1397
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,519
- Gently.
- Good luck!

1398
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,050
(Good luck!)

1399
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,900
- You did it!
- Oh, my gosh!

1400
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,340
- You did it!
- Oh, my gosh!

1401
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,770
Oh, my gosh!

1402
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,340
(The elder striped seabream did it!)

1403
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,880
(Screaming)

1404
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,379
Success!

1405
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,790
(Their perfect team play)

1406
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,719
We've passed Round 3!

1407
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,429
(They've passed Round 3!)

1408
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,859
- Yes!
- It's unbelievable.

1409
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,929
- It's unbelievable.
- Yes!

1410
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,160
As a result,

1411
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,670
Eun Ae and Soo Jin...

1412
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,399
got all the prizes in every round.

1413
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,669
(A coffee machine, a multi-oven, and iPads!)

1414
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,770
I can't believe it.

1415
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,309
It's amazing.

1416
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,809
(Congratulations.)

1417
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,409
Soo Ji, did it bring you some joy?

1418
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,810
Yes, I'm so happy.

1419
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,219
- Really?
- Yes.

1420
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,119
The lunch break is coming up soon.

1421
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,750
(Let's joyfully go out for lunch.)

1422
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,919
- I can't believe we did it.
- It feels rewarding.

1423
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,680
- It was amazing.
- Round 3 was challenging.

1424
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,930
It feels rewarding.

1425
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,029
Unbelievable.

1426
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,459
(Leaving after giving it all)

1427
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,930
My throat hurts.

1428
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,829
- Because I screamed a lot.
- Yes.

1429
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,999
I'm feeling so good.

1430
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,139
- Is this the taste?
- Yes, the taste of success.

1431
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,170
Gosh.

1432
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,669
I think I've done my part for today.

1433
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,940
- Seung Won.
- Yes?

1434
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,040
- You were incredible in Round 2.
- He was.

1435
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,379
- Hitting three at once?
- Yes.

1436
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,279
(Laughing)

1437
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,979
Hitting three at once was amazing.

1438
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,319
Myoung moved the lid...

1439
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,119
- to the perfect position.
- Yes, it was the perfect position.

1440
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,520
Gong Myoung, you probably saved your skills for that today.

1441
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,119
For Round 3!

1442
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,800
(He put all his skills to use in Round 3.)

1443
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,959
I can't believe this.

1444
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,789
- Hold, so now...
- I can't believe that he did it.

1445
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,400
- I know where it is.
- Where is it?

1446
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,799
It's near the hair salon.

1447
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,169
- On the right after going down.
- Do you mean Dosan-daero?

1448
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,699
- Yes.
- The one on the main road?

1449
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
The spare time is 12:30pm.

1450
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,499
It's 11:00am now.

1451
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,370
So, we have an hour and a half.

1452
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,309
- Then, - It's on Dosan-daero.

1453
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,409
- I think we should have lunch.
- Sure.

1454
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,879
- Wait.
- It's an early lunch.

1455
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,800
- Let me see the direction.
- I'm so hungry now.

1456
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,320
You have no idea, Seung Won.

1457
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,519
- We need to go this way.
- Okay. Let's go this way, then.

1458
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,420
- We should go down.
- Let's go down.

1459
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,849
Wait, what are some good restaurants around here?

1460
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,220
How about...

1461
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,366
How about having a Korean BBQ after a long time?

1462
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,659
Grilling it like this.

1463
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,400
- Do you mean the BBQ place there?
- Yes.

1464
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,799
- The one called "Mu" something?
- Yes.

1465
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,230
(That's it!)

1466
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,669
(Thinking about a BBQ place makes them smile.)

1467
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,099
- I used to go to that place.
- I used to go too.

1468
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,169
I couldn't go often because it was too expensive.

1469
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,239
- Let's go.
- Shall we?

1470
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,580
Okay. Let's go.

1471
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,179
Let's go. It's been a long time.

1472
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,579
- Let's go.
- It's been ages since I last went.

1473
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,110
Really? I'd like to go too.

1474
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,950
It's on the way.

1475
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,080
- It's right down there.
- It's right down there.

1476
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,726
I think it's the first time we're having meat on the show.

1477
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,750
Really?

1478
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:06,860
Then, should we...

1479
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,460
play a game to find out who pays for lunch?

1480
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,759
I believe Seung Won will pay.

1481
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,760
I see.

1482
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:13,800
What?

1483
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,629
- When he was with me alone earlier, - What?

1484
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,939
- he said he would never pay.
- What?

1485
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,399
- Did he say he would never pay?
- Yes.

1486
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,270
- I see.
- I'll sit at a different table.

1487
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,169
I will...

1488
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,480
(Laughing)

1489
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,810
This is good.

1490
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,210
- It's good.
- It's fresh and green.

1491
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,049
- Fresh leaves are sprouting.
- Yes.

1492
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,619
(Passing the fresh and green leaves)

1493
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,489
- As we get closer...
- It's here.

1494
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:40,919
- Here we are.
- It's here.

1495
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,989
(A familiar storefront)

1496
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,659
It's been a really long time.

1497
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,029
It says, "Since 1985."

1498
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,130
I've been coming...

1499
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,699
It's as old as me.

1500
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,830
- here since the 1990s.
- Yes.

1501
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,269
They started it in this place, actually.

1502
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,339
It's under construction for renovation.

1503
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,300
They started it here.

1504
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,439
The business was thriving,

1505
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,710
- so they moved into this place.
- They moved it here.

1506
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,140
(Excited)

1507
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,279
- I bet it tastes good.
- It's been a long time.

1508
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,579
I've never come here.

1509
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,609
- Really?
- Why not?

1510
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,119
I only passed by many times.

1511
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,579
It's so good.

1512
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,349
I can't believe we're having meat for lunch.

1513
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,890
Don't worry. We have Seung Won.

1514
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,589
(Come on in.)

1515
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,389
If we play a game and I lose, I'll be in big trouble.

1516
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,429
- Sure.
- Wait.

1517
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,560
Hello.

1518
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,160
We came nearby to film.

1519
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,569
- So, we'd like to have lunch here.
- Yes.

1520
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,369
- We'll just have lunch.
- Yes.

1521
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1522
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,039
(Sitting at a table right away)

1523
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,240
- Of course.
- What?

1524
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,940
What do we order?

1525
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,690
- What are you going to order?
- So...

1526
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,009
We'll have what you order for us.

1527
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,680
What do we order?

1528
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,449
(Seung Won is so excited.)

1529
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,219
- Okay, then, - Could we have the menu?

1530
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,520
I'll look at the menu...

1531
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,889
and order something.

1532
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,189
(Seung Won will choose the dishes.)

1533
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,960
We should have meat.

1534
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,830
(Let's see.)

1535
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,559
I don't know how much it costs since I haven't come lately.

1536
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,960
It's pretty expensive.

1537
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,099
- It is.
- We should have this.

1538
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,739
- Okay. That sounds good.
- We'll have four portions of this.

1539
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,969
Can we get four portions of this?

1540
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:04,970
- Yes.
- I like that.

1541
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:06,509
We'll have this first.

1542
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,039
And we'll have the meal later.

1543
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,279
- Okay.
- We'll order it later.

1544
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,710
I'm feeling so good.

1545
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,949
- So am I.
- I'm feeling good.

1546
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,556
Having lunch this way after passing all the rounds...

1547
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,650
- feels like a company dinner.
- Today is special.

1548
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,289
We're having meat.

1549
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,290
We came here because we passed all the rounds.

1550
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,589
If we hadn't passed, we'd be having that.

1551
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,360
- Just a boxed lunch, right?
- Of course.

1552
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,529
We'd eat a boxed lunch...

1553
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,429
- at Cheongdam Park.
- There are many of them here.

1554
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,500
I might lose hair...

1555
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,470
because I'm so drained by the game.

1556
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,669
You said you wouldn't care much about the games.

1557
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,940
But still.

1558
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,870
But still.

1559
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,579
Since those who receive the prizes are in front of me...

1560
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,549
- That's right.
- and want it,

1561
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,009
- That's different.
- I became desperate.

1562
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,250
I saw their eager eyes.

1563
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,089
When we fail, it's so awkward...

1564
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,749
to leave saying, "Thanks for your time."

1565
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,120
We leave as if we are escaping.

1566
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,019
- I bet.
- I'm not lying.

1567
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,229
(Staring)

1568
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,790
By the way, looking at you...

1569
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,059
feels like I'm at a models' gathering.

1570
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,299
Why?

1571
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,740
I just feel like it. Is it because of my sense of inadequacy?

1572
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:07,999
I feel strange.

1573
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,400
You're also a model.

1574
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,409
- He's right.
- You're a model.

1575
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,609
You could say that, but I...

1576
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,110
Even Yoo Hai Jin calls himself a model.

1577
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,279
Anyone can be a model.

1578
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,419
(It's about Yoo Hai Jin after all.)

1579
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,650
That's funny.

1580
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,020
Gong Myoung. Are you...

1581
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,519
good at sports?

1582
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,160
I'm actually pretty athletic.

1583
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,289
I play all kinds of ball games.

1584
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,829
- Really?
- I also like soccer.

1585
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,830
- I see.
- I see.

1586
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:37,099
I've practiced Taekwondo for a long time.

1587
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,330
- No wonder his lower body was...
- Really?

1588
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,669
I could tell he worked out hard when I saw his thighs.

1589
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,939
How long have you practiced Taekwondo?

1590
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,980
- I started it when I was eight...
- What?

1591
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,209
- and practiced until I was 17.
- Gosh.

1592
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,609
You were a professional.

1593
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,009
- I've been in many competitions.
- Really?

1594
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:56,219
But his Taekwondo skills don't seem...

1595
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,790
to have anything to do with our games.

1596
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,589
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1597
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,890
Would you do well later if we played a game using our feet?

1598
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,129
I think I could do better.

1599
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,359
A game using our feet?

1600
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,159
I don't know what game we would play, but...

1601
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,529
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1602
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,929
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1603
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,410
(Food is served at the perfect time.)

1604
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,940
(Excited)

1605
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,639
- They also serve beef blood soup.
- Yes.

1606
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,640
(Hot beef blood soup is served first.)

1607
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,210
(Exclaiming)

1608
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,480
- It's good.
- Gosh.

1609
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,750
It tastes so good after a long time.

1610
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,720
Gosh.

1611
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,060
After making money,

1612
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,720
I came here...

1613
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,399
and ate freely without worrying about the cost.

1614
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,629
(He ate as much as he wanted at this place after earning money.)

1615
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,699
- I know what you're saying.
- We calculated it before.

1616
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,469
- We did.
- We counted as we were eating.

1617
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,670
"How much is for 150g of it? We ordered 3 portions."

1618
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,870
"He's eating a lot." We thought about such things.

1619
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,540
You would've thought, "We should order cold noodles."

1620
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,249
(Savoring memories slowly)

1621
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,619
It tastes so good after a long time.

1622
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,650
(Slurping)

1623
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,850
(Slurping)

1624
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,426
Gong Myoung, didn't you have breakfast?

1625
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,460
No.

1626
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,230
(Hungry Gong Myoung with his empty stomach)

1627
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,700
(Admiring)

1628
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,300
(Slurping)

1629
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,870
(Slurping)

1630
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,070
(Exclaiming)

1631
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,370
(Slurping)

1632
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,939
(Gong Myoung can't stop eating it.)

1633
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,010
You're really enjoying this soup.

1634
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,780
- Myoung, do you like it?
- Yes.

1635
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,010
(Grilling)

1636
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,280
I've never imagined...

1637
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,750
we would have meat for lunch on Whenever Possible.

1638
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,920
When I first tried meat here,

1639
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,259
I was blown away by the taste.

1640
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,730
(Jae Suk was blown away by every bite in his 20s.)

1641
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,269
- Myoung, you're lucky.
- Yes.

1642
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,570
You're having beef.

1643
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,500
You can eat it now, Myoung.

1644
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,899
- You can eat.
- You should eat first.

1645
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,269
- Eat.
- Please have it first.

1646
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,509
Jae Suk, eat it.

1647
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,669
- Come on. Eat.
- It tastes good.

1648
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,879
Myoung, dig in. Come on.

1649
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,379
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1650
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,409
Since we passed all the rounds,

1651
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,780
it feels so rewarding.

1652
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,390
Gosh.

1653
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,429
(The taste makes him smile.)

1654
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,490
It's so tender, isn't it?

1655
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,900
It's really tender.

1656
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,470
(Exclaiming)

1657
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,300
Thank you.

1658
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,910
(His chopsticks are dancing.)

1659
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,739
This is so good.

1660
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,579
Thanks to you, I could come here after a while.

1661
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,749
(The meat reminds Jae Suk and Seung Won of their younger days.)

1662
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,949
- Goodness.
- This is good.

1663
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,120
- We got to have some protein here.
- Right.

1664
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,349
(He keeps admiring it.)

1665
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,630
Gong Myoung keeps on doing this.

1666
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,530
Seriously.

1667
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,830
This is crazy.

1668
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,460
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

1669
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,829
Gong Myoung, now you understand why I was surprised...

1670
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,510
when I had this for the first time, right?

1671
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,630
Yes.

1672
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:02,500
We're having this comfortably since we succeeded. If we hadn't...

1673
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,239
I think we can say that...

1674
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,640
this is the taste of success.

1675
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,240
- Right.
- It feels like...

1676
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,150
(They finished 4 servings of beef in a blink.)

1677
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,250
Then... Hold on.

1678
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,020
The payment...

1679
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,420
(Hesitant)

1680
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,459
(The payment...)

1681
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,659
(How do we do this?)

1682
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,160
- The payment...
- What? I got this.

1683
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,099
- Really?
- Why? I can pay this.

1684
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,129
- Seung Won...
- But...

1685
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,669
- No. It's okay.
- Seung Won.

1686
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,870
- No worries.
- Goodness.

1687
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,470
But Seung Won, you...

1688
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,970
You got us coffee too.

1689
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,009
- He's so kind inside.
- And...

1690
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,040
- Of course.
- Since morning...

1691
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,249
He said, "Why would I need my credit card?"

1692
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,979
He kept saying that he wouldn't need anything,

1693
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,740
- but he's got everything with him.
- Right.

1694
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,650
He talks the opposite of what he thinks.

1695
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,020
I'm like him too.

1696
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,380
You really don't want to pay for others, though.

1697
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,220
- Why would you...
- My goodness.

1698
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,099
It seems like you're stuck to your seat.

1699
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,369
- I mean...
- Gosh.

1700
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,999
You didn't say, "Seung Won, no."

1701
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,539
- My gosh.
- "You're a guest. Why would you?"

1702
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,969
You could have done this.

1703
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,869
Why would I do that? He said he got it.

1704
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,469
You guys were just sitting like me too.

1705
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,979
That's because we're younger than him.

1706
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,379
But you could've stopped him.

1707
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,010
Why would I do that? It would make me look rude.

1708
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,149
Why would it make you look rude?

1709
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,879
- I would look rude if I did that.
- What do you mean?

1710
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,550
- He was going, so I...
- My goodness.

1711
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,660
(Seung Won paid for the meal.)

1712
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,430
Gosh. Why would you shoot me doing this?

1713
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,999
Gosh, Seung Won. The weather is...

1714
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,199
(The sun is shining as they come out after eating.)

1715
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,299
The temperature rose a little.

1716
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,999
When it gets warmer, I go like this.

1717
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,240
When it gets warmer.

1718
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,739
- When it gets warmer.
- Because he ate,

1719
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,809
he feels better now.

1720
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:49,810
(He's in a good mood as he's full.)

1721
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:51,679
- Seung Won, you feel...
- Thank you for the food.

1722
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,286
- Thank you for the food.
- Don't mention it.

1723
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,679
- Thank you for the food.
- Okay.

1724
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,420
It's so nice that you're here.

1725
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,949
He gets us everything.

1726
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,489
Wire me the money, okay?

1727
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:03,389
It's 986-06-085 and 2 more digits. Got it?

1728
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,590
Shall we go this way?

1729
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,260
It's 86-06 and 2 more?

1730
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,099
We should head that way and cross the road.

1731
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,229
We're on the main road...

1732
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,430
- of this area.
- Right.

1733
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,140
Seriously.

1734
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,010
This feels awkward.

1735
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,110
Shall we...

1736
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:24,609
go there and see what cars they have?

1737
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,579
Where? You mean there?

1738
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,119
(He's asking for one to his friend who treats others often.)

1739
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,800
- There's one over there too.
- There too.

1740
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,419
- Oh, there's one here.
- Over here.

1741
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,719
- Oh, there.
- Right.

1742
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,840
- An expensive one.
- There are many car stores here.

1743
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,390
- Actually...
- They are expensive.

1744
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,160
They are expensive.

1745
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,759
That studio apartment is...

1746
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,900
- That's really old, right?
- It has a long history.

1747
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,899
- So many stylists live there.
- There.

1748
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,740
- So many of them live here.
- Right.

1749
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,660
- Yes. Here.
- People in our industry.

1750
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,810
Oh, they are people from your old company?

1751
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,740
Yes. One of them is.

1752
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,710
- Is that so?
- I see.

1753
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,879
Gong Myoung used to work in the same company as you?

1754
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,320
(Nodding)

1755
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,050
Why did he leave that company?

1756
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,849
They didn't let him go, right?

1757
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,089
They couldn't meet his contract conditions?

1758
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,919
We're asking because you two seem awkward.

1759
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,019
- No.
- You're on bad terms, right?

1760
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,130
Right. They seem...

1761
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,530
Which floor was it? Was it the sixth floor?

1762
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,169
- Hold on. It's here.
- Right.

1763
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,300
- Which floor is it?
- It's the sixth floor.

1764
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,739
- Second guest. It's Gwak Jae Eun.
- Ms. Jae Eun.

1765
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,140
"Before I knew it, I'd worked with 1,000 couples until now."

1766
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,539
"To make a special day for someone,"

1767
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,479
"I work hard without a break."

1768
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,279
- That means she's...
- She's a couple manager.

1769
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,210
Right. A wedding planner.

1770
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,049
"As I try to give positive energy to others every day,"

1771
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,950
"I become exhausted."

1772
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,719
"Please fill me with happy energy."

1773
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,820
- All right.
- All right.

1774
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,059
- There's a sign here.
- There it is.

1775
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,589
- It says, "Wedding."
- You're right.

1776
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,830
It says, "Wedding."

1777
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,099
- It's a nice building.
- Right.

1778
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,329
(They have the address.)

1779
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,699
- Is it in there?
- Yes, come this way. I'll take you.

1780
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,970
Okay. Gosh, it's nice.

1781
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,800
This place looks luxurious.

1782
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,570
Gosh. This office is really big.

1783
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,410
- Here...
- Oh, hello.

1784
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,309
- Hello.
- Hello.

1785
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,450
Hello.

1786
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,910
Why are you standing in the corner?

1787
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,979
- Hello.
- Who is Gwak Jae Eun?

1788
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,919
- It's me.
- I see. She's here.

1789
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,519
- You were here.
- Yes.

1790
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,159
- Hello.
- Hello.

1791
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,519
We have Seung Won and Gong Myoung with us today.

1792
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,229
- Hello.
- And Yeon Shik is here too.

1793
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,259
Hello.

1794
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,230
- Where shall we go?
- You can come this way.

1795
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,829
- That is...
- Here...

1796
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:25,900
(Amazed)

1797
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,439
This is nice.

1798
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,039
(It's the office of the wedding planners.)

1799
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,609
There are many meeting rooms.

1800
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,756
(They are the consulting rooms for the soon-to-be married couples.)

1801
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,440
So we're here today.

1802
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,079
It's a wedding company, right?

1803
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,679
It's a wedding consulting company.

1804
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,719
- Wedding consulting?
- Yes.

1805
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,849
Seung Won and I are married.

1806
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:47,359
- But them, especially Yeon Seok...
- They are...

1807
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,959
- Someday...
- They are our future customers.

1808
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,219
- Of course.
- Right.

1809
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,330
- Yes.
- They can be your future customers.

1810
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,629
So when people prepare for their wedding,

1811
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,229
what are the things that you do for them?

1812
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,769
Since they are here to prepare for their wedding,

1813
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,599
- they don't know much yet.
- Of course.

1814
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,009
That's why we're here.

1815
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,039
There are so many things to do.

1816
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,709
Even if they come here with no background knowledge at all,

1817
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,030
if they're here for a consulting,

1818
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:13,380
we explain everything about it and help them prepare their wedding.

1819
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,289
What's your position here?

1820
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,450
I'm the general manager.

1821
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,819
How long have you been...

1822
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,719
- working in this industry?
- It's been 13 years.

1823
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,029
(Amazed)

1824
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,859
Gosh. You've been in this industry for that long?

1825
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,129
Yes. At this company only.

1826
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,760
- At this company only?
- Yes.

1827
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,529
It has been 13 to 14 years since this company was established.

1828
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,700
- You're 1 of the...
- I'm 1 of the original members.

1829
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:37,510
- Really?
- Yes.

1830
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,740
What made you work here for 13 years?

1831
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,539
- Is it about money, after all?
- It is...

1832
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,409
That's one of the reasons. That's true.

1833
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,279
- She's calm.
- Yes.

1834
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,320
She's so calm.

1835
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,379
- She didn't get startled.
- Right.

1836
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,780
"Is it about money, after all?" "That's one of the reasons."

1837
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:56,120
- Since she meets various customers.
- I love it.

1838
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,489
Then is it lunchtime now?

1839
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,199
Yes. I did some office work in the morning,

1840
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,859
and I have to work outside the office later.

1841
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,199
So this is the spare time.

1842
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,199
If you're working outside the office, you'll meet customers?

1843
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,270
I'm going on a dress shop tour.

1844
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,309
- A dress shop tour?
- I'm going on a tour. Yes.

1845
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:12,909
They are around this area.

1846
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:15,839
Photo studios, dress shops, makeup places. All of them are...

1847
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,509
- in Cheongdam-dong.
- Right.

1848
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,709
- All of them are here.
- It's SDM.

1849
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,249
- You know it well.
- Yes.

1850
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,580
- Right.
- What's SDM?

1851
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,949
- Studio, dress, and makeup.
- Studio, dress, and makeup.

1852
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,319
- They shortened it to SDM.
- "SDM."

1853
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,589
- They shortened it?
- Yes. It's SDM.

1854
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:28,910
(PSE: People shorten everything.)

1855
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,429
Come to think of it, Cheongdam has many wedding-related places.

1856
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,559
- Yes.
- There are so many places here.

1857
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,429
Can you tell us about the people who get married these days?

1858
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,069
Like a trend or characteristics?

1859
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,899
They plan their wedding so early.

1860
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,699
The point of planning their wedding is so early.

1861
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,039
- I see.
- How many months?

1862
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,969
On average, they come to us 1.5 years before their wedding.

1863
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,139
- Really?
- They have to start that early.

1864
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,379
- For their wedding?
- That's a must?

1865
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,579
That's when you need to start planning for your wedding.

1866
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,949
How can they do that?

1867
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,049
- For the wedding...
- What do they need to do?

1868
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,649
Reserving a wedding hall is so difficult these days.

1869
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,549
- Is it?
- I heard that it was so hard.

1870
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,220
Yes. It's really difficult.

1871
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,290
I guess there are many people getting married these days.

1872
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:07,399
You know, during COVID-19,

1873
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,499
my friends postponed their weddings.

1874
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,980
They were going to get married back then, but they delayed it.

1875
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,869
That's why so many people get married these days.

1876
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,569
This is what I heard.

1877
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,769
I heard that they don't let you...

1878
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:20,439
take the photos of the dresses.

1879
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,480
That's right.

1880
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,480
Then how do you remember them?

1881
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,709
A dress shop tour means this.

1882
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,579
You go on a tour to try the dresses and compare them.

1883
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,619
There are dresses...

1884
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,819
- that aren't revealed yet.
- The new dresses.

1885
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,190
Sometimes, they try the new dresses.

1886
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,619
Because people upload their photos on social media,

1887
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,859
- So to prevent that...
- if it gets leaked...

1888
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,329
Because it's...

1889
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,599
- their original design.
- Yes. It's their original design.

1890
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,629
So I heard that the brides...

1891
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,899
make the grooms...

1892
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,069
sketch the dress so that they remember the dresses.

1893
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,239
Since they can't take photos.

1894
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,299
(Instead of telling her how it looks)

1895
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,839
Right. People actually sketch them.

1896
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,939
- People do that?
- Really?

1897
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,369
- They sketch them.
- I heard that they must to that.

1898
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,440
Yes. If they don't, they're in trouble.

1899
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,779
Goodness. They need to sketch them?

1900
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,219
So there's no time to be impressed by how she looks.

1901
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,480
They need to sketch it fast.

1902
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,189
Gosh, it's so hard.

1903
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:06,510
- It's so hard to get married.
- They need to sketch them?

1904
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,659
Since you've been a wedding planner for more than ten years,

1905
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,936
is there an occupational disease?

1906
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,459
- I do have one.
- What is it?

1907
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,000
When I go to weddings of people I know...

1908
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,829
- You can estimate the cost?
- I can see...

1909
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,299
- I can estimate the cost too.
- She can see that.

1910
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,039
I think, "I'd like to change that to something else."

1911
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,299
(She looks at the wedding as a planner, not a friend.)

1912
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,509
"The dress should be spread."

1913
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,309
If the hair accessory is loose,

1914
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,880
- I want to fix it. Right.
- You want to fix it.

1915
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,679
- I can't stay still.
- I see.

1916
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,819
I've been hosting people's weddings for quite a long time now.

1917
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,920
I do that often.

1918
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,450
So when I see others host weddings, I can't stop evaluating them.

1919
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,889
Right. That can happen.

1920
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,929
- Before I know it, - Of course.

1921
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:45,930
- I go, - "They shouldn't do that."

1922
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:48,160
- "That remark wasn't necessary."
- I see.

1923
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,929
"He shouldn't have said that." I think of these things.

1924
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,229
- I don't know why.
- You meddle in it.

1925
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,169
I meddle in it.

1926
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,569
As for us, we can't enjoy movies or dramas comfortably.

1927
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,769
- Right?
- He's right.

1928
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:01,580
We can't help but focus on how people act.

1929
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,979
Do you know what the cameramen's occupational disease is?

1930
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,080
What is it?

1931
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,910
Oh, this?

1932
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:09,710
- Why do they do this?
- Why do they...

1933
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,389
Why do they do this?

1934
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,790
They want to see things in a frame.

1935
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,760
Back in the old days, they did this a lot.

1936
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,330
"Hey. From here, you need to go down."

1937
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,530
"From here, you go like this, okay?"

1938
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,399
"Okay? Now, go."

1939
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,699
- Then...
- They did this.

1940
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,900
- They do this a lot.
- "It should be like this. Okay?"

1941
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,170
There are occupational diseases.

1942
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,339
Anyway, today, we...

1943
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,709
I have a good feeling today.

1944
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,110
We succeed in Round Three before coming here.

1945
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,109
- Really?
- Director Ma here...

1946
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,580
(Director Ma did his work today.)

1947
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,179
- I'll trust you.
- You see...

1948
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:47,560
I think that was the best thing I did in the last three months.

1949
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,560
- Today, I did...
- It was amazing.

1950
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,929
- Then shall we...
- But...

1951
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,689
- We have the bonus coupon.
- We need to roll it.

1952
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,029
- Yes.
- Gong Myoung will do it this time.

1953
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,899
- It's Gong Myoung's turn.
- You should give it a try.

1954
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,730
- Gong Myoung will roll it.
- Okay.

1955
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,139
- You can throw it high.
- Yes.

1956
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,240
Relax and do it.

1957
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,770
Let's see.

1958
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:07,070
(Will their day with good energy continue?)

1959
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,609
Let's see.

1960
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,039
- He did it!
- Goodness.

1961
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,749
(He got 2.)

1962
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,110
- You did it.
- Gosh, today...

1963
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:14,749
- We're lucky today.
- My goodness.

1964
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,819
We're lucky today.

1965
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,696
- I have a good feeling today.
- I feel lucky today.

1966
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,789
- All right.
- I feel lucky today.

1967
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,919
Let's begin right away then.

1968
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,960
It's the fortune cookie for Round One.

1969
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,759
"You walk and run without a break every day."

1970
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,430
"Mobility is a must. Running Shoes."

1971
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,729
Because we have a lot on our schedules,

1972
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,229
we often wear running shoes.

1973
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,269
(Enhancing mobility for SDM tour, Functional Shoes)

1974
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,869
(The mission for the running shoes is...)

1975
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,139
(Every Jack has his Jill.)

1976
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,079
(Wear a dress shoe on one foot...)

1977
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,510
(and kick the jegi in relay.)

1978
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,079
(Round 1)

1979
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,410
(10 kicks in relay)

1980
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,180
We need to kick the jegi?

1981
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,550
Everyone must kick at least 1 as you kick 10 in total.

1982
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,949
What do you mean?

1983
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:57,159
- We need to wear them and kick it.
- Seung Won, this is...

1984
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,329
Two will wear the shoe on their right foot,

1985
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,459
and two will wear it on their left foot.

1986
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,899
So one must use his right foot only.

1987
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,959
- One must use the left foot only.
- One must use the left foot only.

1988
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,029
I see. So that's how it goes.

1989
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,830
Each of us should pick a side that is better.

1990
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,199
I'll use my left foot.

1991
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,176
- I can use my left foot.
- Left foot is okay with you?

1992
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,299
- He'll use his left foot.
- He chose the left one.

1993
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,969
What about you? Are you good at kicking jegi?

1994
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,009
For me, both feet are...

1995
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,410
Then you should use your left foot.

1996
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,739
- Use your left foot.
- It's just the same.

1997
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,779
- Use your left foot.
- He's not good with his feet.

1998
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,379
- But this is...
- You and I should go with right.

1999
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,749
Can I practice? Kicking jegi is...

2000
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,950
- This is hard.
- I'm not used to kicking jegi.

2001
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,689
(This taekwon boy said he was confident using his legs.)

2002
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:29,120
Gosh. I've never tried kicking jegi before.

2003
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:31,429
You've never tried kicking jegi?

2004
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,830
I haven't done it very much.

2005
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:34,959
Let's see.

2006
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,960
(He practices using his left foot.)

2007
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,969
(Doubtful)

2008
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,400
Gosh, this is tough.

2009
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,070
I'll practice again.

2010
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,750
- He's using his left foot.
- Try it.

2011
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:48,290
- He's using his left foot.
- Try it.

2012
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,279
- Gosh, he's terrible with his feet.
- Well...

2013
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,909
- It's not like that.
- Seriously.

2014
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,119
I have to use my left foot.

2015
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,919
It's not easy even with my right foot. Using my left foot...

2016
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,520
Yeon Seok is terrible at using his feet.

2017
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,649
(The two seabreams get nervous again.)

2018
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,220
You have to kick jegi like this.

2019
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,729
This is how we do it.

2020
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,160
One, two...

2021
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,336
It would be hard because they have to wear dress shoes.

2022
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,260
(His sock shows his strong will.)

2023
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,070
- Guys.
- We can kick it behind him.

2024
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,269
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Goodness.

2025
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:17,516
You shouldn't do it all, Seung Won.

2026
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,569
Like this.

2027
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,710
He's really good.

2028
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,656
- I know, right?
- This is how we do it.

2029
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,840
So no more than seven times.

2030
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,950
- Two, three, four...
- Three, four,

2031
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,549
- five...
- Six, seven.

2032
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,850
- There you go.
- My goodness.

2033
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,966
- He's good at it.
- You have to be flexible.

2034
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:35,659
- And we have to pass it along.
- And we pass it to the next person.

2035
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,136
- I see.
- So they have to pass the jegi.

2036
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,159
I think the left-foot players should do one each.

2037
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,789
- I think that would be better.
- It's hard with the left foot.

2038
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,299
- If possible, we could try two.
- Right.

2039
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,429
One, two...

2040
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,876
(They practice kicking jegi in relay.)

2041
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,500
One, two, three, four, five. You got this.

2042
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,170
- Six, seven, eight.
- Seven.

2043
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,110
- Good. We can do it like this.
- Like this.

2044
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,910
We can do it like this.

2045
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,579
I have to kick it at least once.

2046
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,879
(Yeon Seok and Gong Myoung must kick it at the end.)

2047
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,049
- You only need to kick it once.
- This is really awkward.

2048
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,350
Okay, we'll give it a try.

2049
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,890
You can do it!

2050
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,590
The first player is Seung Won.

2051
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,559
- Seung Won, me...
- Right.

2052
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,589
(Seung Won, Jae Suk)

2053
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:14,090
Either you or Gong Myoung. Once each.

2054
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,430
Whoever can do it.

2055
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,700
- Okay.
- The first try.

2056
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,969
Okay, here we go. In 1, 2, 3.

2057
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:18,970
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2058
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:20,000
Ready.

2059
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,370
Set.

2060
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,310
Hold on a second.

2061
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,880
- Two, three, four.
- Four.

2062
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,780
- Gosh, hold on.
- You can kick it.

2063
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:37,179
- You can kick it.
- Right.

2064
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,850
- You can kick it again.
- Why me?

2065
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,090
You can kick it again.

2066
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,489
(They can kick the jegi again even if they've kicked it.)

2067
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,089
- We can kick it again.
- We can kick it again and again...

2068
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,329
- while everyone kicks once.
- We only need to kick...

2069
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,360
at least once.

2070
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,029
- All right.
- Let's say, "Here we go."

2071
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,499
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

2072
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,130
- Okay, I'll go.
- Ready.

2073
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:53,600
Set.

2074
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,600
- One, two, three, - Two, three,

2075
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,340
- four, five, six, seven...
- four, five, six, seven...

2076
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,179
(They failed.)

2077
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,340
- It was up here.
- How do we do this?

2078
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,079
(He feels guilty.)

2079
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,800
Is there anyone who's good at kicking jegi?

2080
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,220
Let's see.

2081
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,990
- I'll go first this time.
- Go ahead.

2082
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,249
- He has long limbs.
- It came to me so fast.

2083
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,620
Should we stand in a circle?

2084
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,520
Did I block the camera?

2085
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,359
I'll kick 6 or 7 times...

2086
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,429
- and pass it.
- Pass it to me.

2087
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,159
- Then I'll kick 2 times.
- Then you can kick 1 or 2 times.

2088
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,476
- And then you pass it to them.
- Okay.

2089
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
- Ready.
- I'll kick once.

2090
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:28,800
Set.

2091
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,209
- Three, four, five...
- Three, four, five...

2092
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:37,310
- Six, seven, eight.
- Eight.

2093
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,549
(Failure)

2094
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:40,710
Gosh.

2095
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,820
Gosh.

2096
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:47,959
(It was so close.)

2097
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,889
- The last one who kicks...
- This is really tough.

2098
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,230
- Only one more.
- That's right.

2099
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,789
It wasn't bad this time.

2100
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,959
- When I was doing it...
- That was...

2101
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,280
- When it was almost seven...
- They did so well just now.

2102
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,099
- You need to do 1 each, right?
- Kick 1 each, okay?

2103
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,170
- Okay.
- Goodness.

2104
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,540
This is our fourth try already?

2105
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,440
Let's cheer once more.

2106
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,270
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

2107
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,939
- Okay.
- This is our fourth try already?

2108
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,209
It's our fourth try.

2109
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,780
- This is difficult.
- Ready.

2110
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:12,410
Set.

2111
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,419
(Mumbling)

2112
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,519
They need to...

2113
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,620
Quiet!

2114
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,100
- We're sensitive right now.
- Right.

2115
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:23,759
- It's making me sensitive.
- Let's be quiet.

2116
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,830
Quiet.

2117
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,760
- Two.
- Two, three, four,

2118
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,299
- Nice.
- five, six, seven, eight...

2119
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,530
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2120
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,640
How many times?

2121
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,810
Kicking with the left foot isn't easy.

2122
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,609
- I'll use my right foot then.
- Okay. You do it.

2123
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,690
- I'm so bad with my left foot.
- This is hilarious.

2124
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,649
(Seung Won practices kicking with his left foot.)

2125
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,179
I'm just so bad at this.

2126
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,790
I thought we were having a party.

2127
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,089
Seung Won, you can use your left foot.

2128
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,920
Get rid of this! Trash or whatever it is!

2129
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,760
Get rid of it.

2130
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,230
It's annoying me.

2131
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,359
(Yeon Seok tries it with his right foot.)

2132
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,859
- You need to kick it high.
- Try it.

2133
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,130
Throw it to me. Make it high. Okay.

2134
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,399
See? I can...

2135
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,570
- That's good.
- See? I can use my right foot too.

2136
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,940
Use your right foot.

2137
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,210
By the way, do you know that you're doing it like this?

2138
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,179
- Yeon Seok. When you kick jegi...
- Goodness.

2139
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,950
- You're doing it like this.
- It's because I'm focused.

2140
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:23,649
It doesn't matter if I can manage to kick it.

2141
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,790
But you did it like this.

2142
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,619
I'm trying to balance myself.

2143
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,620
I thought we were having a party.

2144
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:31,690
- Let's go now.
- Please.

2145
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,459
Goodness. In 1, 2, 3.

2146
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,589
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2147
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,860
Because I felt bad for them, I couldn't ask them to join us.

2148
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,399
- Ready.
- We need to get past this.

2149
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,070
- We need to succeed Round One.
- Okay.

2150
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,040
Ready. Set.

2151
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:48,740
Goodness.

2152
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,410
(They failed their sixth try like this.)

2153
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,280
- One...
- Goodness.

2154
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,449
Can we not count this one?

2155
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,219
(The Coupon Round)

2156
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:59,849
(They failed...)

2157
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:03,790
(and failed again.)

2158
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,560
We used up the two chances?

2159
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,889
- My gosh. This is so...
- Now, we should...

2160
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:10,229
- We need to get them the shoes.
- If it goes like this...

2161
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,130
If it goes like this...

2162
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,630
They really want the shoes.

2163
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:18,269
- We need to succeed in Round 1.
- We need to succeed in Round 1.

2164
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:20,270
- Round 1, at least.
- We must succeed in Round 1.

2165
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,080
If not...

2166
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,650
Shall we go as we did in the first place?

2167
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,020
You try it. I'm...

2168
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,219
- I am...
- What do we do?

2169
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,419
I'm losing confidence.

2170
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,300
- What do we do?
- I keep losing my confidence.

2171
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,290
Gosh, what do we do? Hold on.

2172
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,560
What about this?

2173
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:39,860
What is it?

2174
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,429
- One.
- Two.

2175
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,070
- Three.
- We pass it to the next person.

2176
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,229
- Gosh.
- It will go 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

2177
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:48,540
- That won't be easy.
- It seems hard.

2178
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,970
Try passing it to me then.

2179
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,670
Throw it to me.

2180
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:55,140
- Two, three, four.
- Four.

2181
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:56,879
- Five, six, - You can kick only once each.

2182
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,280
- seven, eight.
- Eight.

2183
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,179
(It seems like it's working.)

2184
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,620
- Seven, eight, - Eight.

2185
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,319
- nine, ten.
- Gosh.

2186
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,989
(They did 10 in practice.)

2187
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,419
- I got goosebumps.
- Like this?

2188
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,220
- Gosh, we should do it like this.
- Amazing.

2189
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,919
- One at a time?
- One person...

2190
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,529
- Let's do it 1 by 1.
- Let's do it 1 at a time.

2191
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,989
- One person...
- Let's find the right timing.

2192
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,359
- Let's not put too much pressure...
- Let's play it by ear.

2193
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,529
- Let's play it by ear.
- Let's play it by ear.

2194
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:19,030
- Let's see how it goes.
- But make sure we kick it high.

2195
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,199
- Okay.
- Kick it high.

2196
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,669
All right. Let's cheer.

2197
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,710
- Let's cheer.
- A cheer. Please join us, Ms. Gwak.

2198
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,269
- Please.
- How many times are we doing this?

2199
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,369
- Please!
- Please!

2200
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,409
Gosh, Ms. Gwak.

2201
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,650
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

2202
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:31,450
- We need to succeed in Round One.
- Gosh, Ms. Gwak.

2203
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,049
Kick it high. Okay.

2204
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,079
- It went really well just now...
- Ready.

2205
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,119
- because we had no pressure.
- I know.

2206
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,179
Set.

2207
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:40,750
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2208
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,830
- One, two, three, four, - Three, four,

2209
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,429
- five, six.
- five.

2210
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:49,559
- Four, five.
- Four, five, six,

2211
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,400
- seven.
- Eight, nine.

2212
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,430
Nine.

2213
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,070
Nine.

2214
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,970
- Ten.
- Ten.

2215
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:06,810
(They succeeded in Round 1.)

2216
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,380
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

2217
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,680
Who says I'm in my three years of misfortune?

2218
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,889
(He got goosebumps.)

2219
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,060
- My goodness.
- We did it!

2220
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:19,930
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2221
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,099
We made it.

2222
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,459
(They won the functional shoes.)

2223
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,530
Okay.

2224
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,200
- He's like Zhuge Gong Myoung.
- Right.

2225
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,809
- He's Zhuge Gong Myoung.
- That's right.

2226
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,840
He's...

2227
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:36,640
- He's Zhuge Gong Myoung.
- Right.

2228
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,110
How many tries do we have left?

2229
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:41,350
- All right.
- Round One.

2230
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:43,120
All right, Director.

2231
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,719
- You have think wisely.
- Right.

2232
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,319
We passed Round One.

2233
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,590
- Right.
- We will give you everything...

2234
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,089
- if we pass Round Two.
- Right.

2235
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:56,229
- But if we fail, all of it will...
- Won't it be 20 times next?

2236
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,429
Will the number go up?

2237
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,390
- I guess so.
- You have to choose to go or stop.

2238
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,199
- All right.
- You must decide what to do.

2239
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,269
- You must decide.
- Right.

2240
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:04,439
- You can stop here.
- You can stop here.

2241
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,240
If you think we don't have what it takes...

2242
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:08,639
Then...

2243
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,549
But his idea sounded really good.

2244
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:14,610
But his idea sounded really good.

2245
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:15,979
We will go!

2246
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,020
- What?
- Go!

2247
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,149
- Go?
- Go?

2248
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,550
Yes. Go!

2249
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,860
(Frozen)

2250
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,390
Gosh!

2251
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,089
- The strategy was really good.
- Great.

2252
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,000
Well, they've decided to go.

2253
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,099
All right. Let's check the prize for Round Two.

2254
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,300
(The die has been cast.)

2255
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,730
What is it?

2256
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,639
"There are 100 couples."

2257
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,370
"Not a single message can be missed. The Apple Watch."

2258
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,409
It's the Apple Watch.

2259
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:43,879
(Not a single message can be missed.)

2260
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,310
(The Apple Watch)

2261
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,509
- Gosh, I don't have this.
- All right.

2262
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,919
- You don't?
- No.

2263
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,779
- You should be wearing something.
- I'm not wearing anything.

2264
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,549
(Her wrist looks rather empty.)

2265
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:54,266
- I'm not wearing anything.
- This is expensive.

2266
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,759
Round Two.

2267
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,690
We're going to be sweating buckets.

2268
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,989
(Round 2)

2269
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,689
(It's the same as Round 1.)

2270
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,230
(However, the shoes will change.)

2271
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,270
I think the shoes will change.

2272
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,400
- Gosh!
- Gosh! This will be too...

2273
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,199
Left and right foot for this again?

2274
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,470
(Slippers)

2275
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,510
Slippers!

2276
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:16,779
- You're good with your left foot.
- Right. I'll use my left foot.

2277
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,609
(Serious)

2278
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:21,149
- Gosh, this is bad.
- This is bad.

2279
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:22,549
I'll use my left foot again.

2280
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,019
- You're good with your left foot.
- Right. I'll use my left foot.

2281
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:26,650
(Same sides as Round 1)

2282
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,859
Could I...

2283
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,359
borrow that ribbon?

2284
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,689
- Sorry?
- The ribbon.

2285
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:32,730
Oh, right.

2286
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,259
- He's using the ribbon.
- Seung Won.

2287
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,000
Why are you working so hard?

2288
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,300
(Balletcore)

2289
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,569
(He quietly cheats.)

2290
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,370
- You can't tie it!
- Why not?

2291
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,080
The rule is to do it with the slippers on.

2292
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,810
- Fine. Take it back.
- Two.

2293
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,579
Shall we give it a try?

2294
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,620
Let's go for it.

2295
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,989
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2296
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,089
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2297
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,720
- Let's go!
- Let's go! We can do this.

2298
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:03,719
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2299
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,460
Hold on. Everyone should be prepared to go.

2300
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,899
- Should we call out, "Mine?"
- Sure.

2301
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,199
- "Mine."
- "Mine."

2302
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,230
Ready.

2303
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,630
- Go with the same direction.
- Set.

2304
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,340
Mine!

2305
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:23,640
Mine!

2306
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,849
- "Mine!"
- Mine!

2307
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,949
"Mine?"

2308
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:30,020
- He missed it while saying that.
- What was that?

2309
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,820
- Gosh.
- Was that "Oh, my gosh?"

2310
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,490
- "Oh, my gosh."
- "I'm Director Mine."

2311
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,860
- "Director Mine."
- "I'm Director Mine."

2312
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,029
- "I'm Director Mine."
- What were you doing?

2313
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:41,030
"Director Mine."

2314
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:42,259
What was that?

2315
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,560
(Crying)

2316
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,760
Was he calling for me?

2317
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,070
- Your "mine..."
- What was that?

2318
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:49,840
Filled the whole room.

2319
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,640
- "Mine!"
- Mine!

2320
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,010
Don't say, "Mine."

2321
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,210
Oh, no.

2322
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,149
- Gosh.
- I feel so nervous.

2323
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,680
What do we do?

2324
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:03,919
Gosh.

2325
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,319
(He gets thirsty.)

2326
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,389
- We have one try left.
- Right.

2327
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:07,719
- We have 1 try left.
- We have 1 try left.

2328
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,136
- We still have one try left.
- Right.

2329
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,490
Let's do this.

2330
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,529
We can make it on the last try.

2331
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,370
(If we fail, we have to leave as if escaping.)

2332
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,230
Can't you receive it?

2333
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:20,170
I can't be there.

2334
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,000
- Try giving it to me, Myoung.
- Gosh.

2335
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,640
But we only have one try left.

2336
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,540
I feel nervous.

2337
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,100
All right. It's the last try.

2338
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:31,640
Let's go for it!

2339
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,310
Let's hope for a miracle.

2340
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:35,519
- Let's hope for a miracle.
- Let's go!

2341
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,119
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2342
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,589
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2343
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,749
- Let's go!
- In 1, 2, 3.

2344
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,789
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2345
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,559
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2346
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,166
- It's the last try.
- Let's try our best.

2347
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:45,589
I'll make sure to get it.

2348
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:46,660
- Let's go!
- Gosh.

2349
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:50,160
Hold on.

2350
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,530
- Ready.
- Done. Okay.

2351
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,070
Set.

2352
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,840
You can do it.

2353
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,040
- Okay.
- Set.

2354
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,940
- Okay.
- You can do it.

2355
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:10,050
Please!

2356
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,520
Please!

2357
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,990
That was close.

2358
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,930
(Mission failed)

2359
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,500
- That was close.
- Right.

2360
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,270
It's okay.

2361
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:31,670
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

2362
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,710
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

2363
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,010
That was close.

2364
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:39,180
That was a close try.

2365
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:40,379
- I thought we made it happen.
- Right.

2366
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,220
- That was close.
- That was close.

2367
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:47,050
(Solemn)

2368
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,350
Gosh.

2369
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:50,700
- They're all silent.
- Well...

2370
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,260
- This is our souvenir.
- Right.

2371
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:55,090
Thank you.

2372
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,499
The souvenir is all we can give you.

2373
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,230
Thank you!

2374
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,870
- This is a clock.
- Right.

2375
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,069
If you need it at home...

2376
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:03,200
- We're sorry.
- And...

2377
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,570
- We did our best.
- Right.

2378
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,009
That was really close.

2379
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,139
You all went through so much.

2380
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,540
My gosh.

2381
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,556
- So this is what this feels like.
- Right.

2382
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,209
- Seung Won...
- Gosh.

2383
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,586
Definitely said this during the opening.

2384
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:18,380
"I'm someone who isn't interested in what others win!"

2385
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,149
But he turned out to be the most passionate.

2386
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:22,260
- I lost my voice.
- He lost his voice.

2387
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,259
As things have ended like this...

2388
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,189
- It feels uncomfortable, right?
- Right. It does.

2389
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:30,229
I think we had a bit too much meat before coming here.

2390
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:32,099
(A time with the Whenever Friends)

2391
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,169
Right. We were all out of it...

2392
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,500
and slipped.

2393
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,540
(They feel holy!)

2394
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,740
(Holy Whenever Friends?)

2395
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,180
(Ryu Deok Hwan, Lee Jung Eun)

2396
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,730
(She's from Hanyang University.)

2397
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,310
(Clapping)

2398
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:49,796
(She even goes to Hanyang University Hospital.)

2399
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:50,980
(Cheering)

2400
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,120
(This is my area.)

2401
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,189
(The one who is familiar with the whole Hanyang University area)

2402
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:57,190
(Jung Eun, the daughter of Hanyang)

2403
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:59,160
(Next to the daughter of Hanyang, )

2404
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:01,630
(there's someone shining brightly.)

2405
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,730
(Please!)

2406
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,070
(The one who makes the daughter of Hanyang smile)

2407
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,940
(Deok Hwan with the hands of magic)

2408
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,700
One!

2409
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,840
(Even the timing game is easy.)

2410
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,340
(You!)

2411
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,749
(Why did I do that?)

2412
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,179
- What just happened?
- Hold on!

2413
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,520
(Whenever Possible)

2414
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:30,660
(Whenever Possible)
