1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,750
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,079
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,350
The Han River looks so beautiful these days.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,350
You've never been here on weekends, right?

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,680
On weekends...

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,860
- You...
- I came last weekend for a shoot.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,820
I also came here for a shoot.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,690
- You too?
- It was so packed.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,499
- My gosh.
- Yeouido is amazing.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,529
- Yeouido is great, isn't it?
- Gosh.

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,530
(Today's spare time in Yeouido)

12
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,200
Yeouido has long been...

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,370
a symbol of wealth.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,500
- Is that so?
- Yes.

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,309
Especially in the old days, one had to be determined...

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,340
to make it to Yeouido.

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
- Right.
- Yes.

18
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,210
It was an important place and still is.

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
The finance sector is here.

20
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,880
- So is the TV industry.
- The finance sector.

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,820
The Korea Exchange is located here.

22
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,489
You seem to know a lot about stocks.

23
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,119
- Yes, I like stocks.
- I see.

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,289
- You like stocks?
- Yes.

25
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,389
It's just that stocks don't seem to return the love I give them.

26
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,459
- Especially... Yes.
- Aren't we all in the same boat?

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,099
That's the thing with stocks. We pour our love...

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,799
- to stocks, - Yes.

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,469
- but they don't oddly reciprocate.
- How come...

30
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,640
- all my stocks are always down?
- Right. I wonder why.

31
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,900
My gosh. Seriously.

32
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,110
You said you wanted to come here on a date when you get a girlfriend.

33
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,909
- That's my dream date.
- I see.

34
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,410
- I'd love to come here with kids.
- Yes.

35
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,450
Do you often come out here with your kids on weekends?

36
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,850
Sometimes. But my kids are growing up.

37
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,119
- They don't hang out with you?
- Right.

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,419
- Ji Ho has his own life now.
- Is that so?

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,019
- Yes. Of course.
- Already?

40
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,729
From time to time, Ji Ho joins family meals...

41
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,429
- without much complaining.
- Really?

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,129
- Do you arrange the time with him?
- Of course.

43
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,129
- Really? I see.
- Ji Ho has a busy schedule too.

44
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,281
- My gosh.
- Anyway,

45
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,000
it's nice to come to Yeouido. It's been a while.

46
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,540
- Are they already filming?
- Right.

47
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,040
We're on an SBS show.

48
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,209
- Gosh, we're filming outdoors.
- Oh, no. I can see them there.

49
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,410
- Oh, my. Sir, I'm so nervous.
- Yes.

50
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,909
- Same here.
- What do I do?

51
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,750
I've been nervous since yesterday.

52
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,150
- Yes.
- Yes, that's true.

53
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,989
- My gosh. They're here.
- Hello.

54
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,649
- My gosh.
- Hello.

55
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,659
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,360
- How long has it been?
- Hello.

57
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,459
Why are you wearing a sporty outfit?

58
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,430
- I heard the dress code was navy.
- My gosh.

59
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,729
- My gosh.
- Hello.

60
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,230
- Ms. Gong.
- Hello.

61
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,969
- Take your time.
- How long has it been?

62
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,199
- Thank you.
- Please come this way.

63
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
- Nice to meet you.
- Sul. My gosh.

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,210
(With his character, General Manager Baek, "Hot Stove League" marked...)

66
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,909
(the start of his streak of 3 Grand Awards.)

67
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,349
("Hot Stove League," "The Veil," and "My Dearest")

68
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,150
(Namkoong Min, the actor who can guarantee superb acting)

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,389
(She was in "Be Melodramatic" and "Vincenzo.")

70
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,119
(A multitalented actress who transforms completely in every role)

71
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,960
(Jeon Yeo Been, the master of channeling her roles)

72
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,689
(She was in "D.P." and "Less Than Evil.")

73
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,029
(The actress who has everyone's attention)

74
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,130
(Lee Sul, the actress with 1,000 faces)

75
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,930
(Polite)

76
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,399
- Hello.
- Ms. Gong is here today. My gosh.

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,739
- Where... Which side...
- Hello.

78
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
The three of you should sit in the middle.

79
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,000
- You should sit in the middle.
- Yes.

80
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,810
It's been so long, Min. My gosh.

81
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,639
How come you didn't call me Koong Min today?

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,810
I'll call you Min today.

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,479
Just call me Koong Min like you used to.

84
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,879
- I used to call him Koong Min.
- Yes.

85
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,609
- But I'm calling him Min today.
- Yes.

86
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,949
You look like a Min today.

87
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,519
- Really? That's why?
- That's why.

88
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,890
Yes. You look different than usual today.

89
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,859
It looks like it'd keep him the coolest.

90
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,019
- Right.
- He's wearing shorts.

91
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,059
You must be really cool.

92
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,189
Your outfit looks sporty.

93
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,190
Thank you.

94
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,660
(A sporty salute)

95
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,730
"Thank you."

96
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,770
Have you met Yeon Seok?

97
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,399
- We've never worked together.
- Never?

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,470
- I see.
- No.

99
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,039
We only met at awards ceremonies...

100
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,669
- in passing a few times.
- Yes.

101
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,040
From what I remember,

102
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,739
there was a time...

103
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,550
when we lived in the same apartment complex.

104
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,449
It was at the intersection of Gyeongbok Apartment.

105
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,649
- Yes, that's right.
- Remember?

106
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,279
We lived in different buildings of the complex.

107
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,049
- Right.
- So we never crossed paths.

108
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,220
But the security guard told me that he lived in the same complex.

109
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,289
I think I heard about him from the security guard too.

110
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,089
- Really?
- Yes.

111
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,430
- I've met Min and Yeo Been.
- Yes.

112
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,259
(Sul has never met Jae Suk before.)

113
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,229
- I've never met you before, Sul.
- Yes.

114
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,369
- Can we pause for a second?
- Right?

115
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,470
- Your hair...
- What is it?

116
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,869
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

117
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,899
We don't pause here.

118
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,270
I'm sorry.

119
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,710
- We don't pause here. Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,379
- Okay. Sorry about that.
- Actors...

121
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,779
and actresses are used to do-overs.

122
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,509
- I see.
- We're used to do-overs.

123
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,749
- That's why she said it loudly.
- I'm sorry.

124
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,379
- We never stop filming.
- I see.

125
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,390
Right.

126
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,289
I'm happy to welcome the three of you to our show today.

127
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,289
You're all starring in an SBS drama, right?

128
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,859
- Yes.
- My gosh.

129
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,259
- "Our Movie."
- Right.

130
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,430
- Could you tell us about the drama?
- What kind of drama is it?

131
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,630
Yeo Been is really good at introducing our drama.

132
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,040
Well, "Our Movie" is...

133
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,540
You want me to do it? Okay. I'll do it.

134
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,810
Well, in the drama,

135
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,009
- there's a movie director.
- Yes.

136
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,650
Then there's a woman who's terminally ill.

137
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,549
This director writes a movie about a terminally ill patient.

138
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,190
Then he ends up casting an actress who's really terminally ill.

139
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,289
(The drama is about a movie director...)

140
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,219
(who only lives for today due to the sophomore jinx...)

141
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,359
(and a terminally ill actress...)

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,630
(who wants to play the lead for her last role in life.)

143
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,899
("Another Hit for Namkoong Min with Romantic Drama, 'Our Movie'")

144
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,400
("Jeon Yeo Been Impresses Viewers with Her Terminally Ill Character")

145
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,540
My character doesn't believe in love.

146
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,369
And her character is nearing the end of her life.

147
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,909
When these two characters interact,

148
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,839
they come to understand love more deeply.

149
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,049
- Gosh. It sounds like a tearjerker.
- That's the story about.

150
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,519
What's your character in the drama, Sul?

151
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,550
Can I describe her character?

152
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,019
- She wants to describe Sul's role.
- Yes.

153
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,390
- Yeo Been. I thought it was over.
- Yes.

154
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,060
You should've done that first. Ms. Gong.

155
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,129
Well, I thought this was the perfect time...

156
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,889
- for me to add to what he said.
- Great.

157
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,499
Here's why.

158
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,599
He's playing a movie director named Lee Je Ha.

159
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,369
- Okay. I see.
- His first movie was a mega hit.

160
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,339
Her character played the female lead in his successful movie.

161
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,039
- I see. That's her character?
- She played the lead role.

162
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,109
- They are...
- Are they lovers?

163
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,880
Were they lovers? I'll leave that as a question.

164
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,250
I'll leave that as a question.

165
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,949
- You left that as a question.
- What are you doing?

166
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,519
- She's good at this.
- Where did you leave it?

167
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,149
- I'll leave that as a question.
- You'll leave it as a question.

168
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,820
- I bet there's a question mark.
- Yes.

169
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,089
A few years have passed since his first movie.

170
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,690
He then decides to make his second movie.

171
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,959
What kind of relationship will he and I have?

172
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,459
- I'll leave that as a question.
- Another one.

173
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,129
- If you were going to be detailed, - Gosh.

174
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,329
you should've described the drama...

175
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,369
- when he asked you first.
- You should just...

176
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,969
tell us the plot for the first episode.

177
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,039
- What?
- Tell us...

178
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
(You can get your answers every Friday and Saturday.)

179
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,269
So Koong Min...

180
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,839
- Yes.
- Koong Min?

181
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,309
- I'm back to Koong Min now.
- Why are you calling him that now?

182
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,539
- Nam Koong Min.
- Gosh.

183
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,550
Let me explain. I first met Koong Min...

184
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,709
- on "X-Man."
- Right.

185
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,049
- Right?
- Yes.

186
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,919
I've been calling him that ever since then.

187
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,089
I guess I got used to calling him that.

188
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,349
When you call me Min,

189
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,389
- it feels awkward. Totally.
- Doesn't it feel awkward?

190
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,559
- Same here.
- Yes.

191
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,829
- It doesn't have the same vibe.
- It doesn't roll off the tongue.

192
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,029
So I call him Koong Min.

193
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,829
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, okay.

194
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,430
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

195
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,069
So we're filming in Yeouido today.

196
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,270
Is it because the three of you have ties to Yeouido?

197
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,799
I see. When I was a rookie,

198
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,969
- Yes. They were all here.
- TV stations were located here.

199
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,269
- Right.
- I see.

200
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,810
Whenever I come here, I'm reminded of all the times I got scolded.

201
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,739
- I was scolded a lot too.
- I was just...

202
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,580
- Gosh. I was...
- My gosh.

203
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,779
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

204
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,949
None of the stories are appropriate for TV.

205
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,950
- Right?
- Yes.

206
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:55,019
- I feel the same way when I'm here.
- My gosh.

207
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,960
I used to come here very often ever since I was a rookie.

208
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,359
- This place has tearful memories.
- Yes.

209
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,189
Sul. Do you have any memories in Yeouido?

210
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,999
- When I first moved to Seoul, - Yes.

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,929
having fried chicken by the Han River was my dream.

212
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,799
- That first spot was in Yeouido.
- Was it in Yeouido?

213
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,839
- Yes.
- I see.

214
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,499
- You had fried chicken here?
- Yes.

215
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,670
- I had fried chicken and beer.
- Gosh.

216
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,940
When did you move to Seoul?

217
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,539
I came to Seoul when I was 20.

218
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,139
- Where are you from?
- Do you know Cheongdo?

219
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,209
- I know Cheongdo.
- Cheongdo.

220
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,649
- You do?
- Of course, I do.

221
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,049
- Bullfighting is famous there.
- Her dialect...

222
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,929
Yes.

223
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,219
It's so legit. She sounds like someone else.

224
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,819
- I bet she's a native speaker.
- Yes.

225
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,890
(Shy)

226
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,149
- You know what? Today...
- We should go and meet...

227
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,090
- the Whenever Guest.
- Yes, we should.

228
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,060
- "Lee Guk San, Park Jung Bin."
- Okay.

229
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,829
"All year round,"

230
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,159
"we set out on romantic trips, gliding through sunset-lit waters."

231
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,230
- What?
- I see.

232
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,640
"This best driver spent 40 years only thinking about the Han River."

233
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,440
"I've been playing Cupid for love in secret operations for ten years."

234
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,439
"Today, we're responsible for making someone's day special..."

235
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,779
"as always."

236
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,009
"We'll share the real hidden spot of the Han River no one knows."

237
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,110
Really?

238
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,979
"Glide through the waters?"

239
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,889
- Do they run a waterski shop?
- That must be it.

240
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,249
- I hope it's for duck pedal boats.
- A waterski shop.

241
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,259
- Right?
- Duck pedal boats.

242
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,760
I see. It's that way.

243
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,730
- Is it right in front of here?
- Yes.

244
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,330
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

245
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,259
You know what? I've looked around.

246
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,429
(Current time: 11:56am)

247
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,270
I'm seeing waterski and duck pedal boats here.

248
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,940
- I hope it's for duck pedal boats.
- Jae Suk, it's over there.

249
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,910
- What's that?
- It's where the cruise is.

250
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,539
They might operate fast boats, not duck pedal boats.

251
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,980
- That might be it. Yes.
- Will we do something on the water?

252
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,480
Gosh, you might be cold.

253
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,810
Me?

254
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,680
I feel like I picked the wrong outfit for today's shoot.

255
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,489
By the way, everything looks pretty. Look at the flowers too.

256
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,689
How beautiful.

257
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,819
- Girls, come closer.
- Yes?

258
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,319
- You should join the conversation.
- Okay, we will.

259
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,129
- We'll do better.
- It's...

260
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,130
What do you mean by do better?

261
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll turn the question mark into an exclamation mark.

262
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,270
- Yes.
- That's it.

263
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,466
- I don't see any boats here.
- But...

264
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,639
according to the map, it's that facility.

265
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,439
- Then it must be the cruise.
- I see. That's...

266
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,379
- Will we get on the cruise then?
- I see.

267
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,879
- I guess we'll get on the cruise.
- It has to be the cruise.

268
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,009
- I'm excited.
- This will be fun.

269
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,210
- That's it.
- This must be the place.

270
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,550
- Yes.
- This is the location.

271
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,150
We must find Lee Guk San.

272
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,619
- I see someone over there.
- I see.

273
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,950
- It's a man in a uniform.
- Hello.

274
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,619
- Are you Mr. Lee Guk San?
- Hello.

275
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,959
- Yes. That's me.
- Gosh, hello.

276
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

277
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,189
- Are you Mr. Lee Guk San?
- My gosh.

278
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,629
- Yes. Hello.
- Nice to meet you. Gosh, hello.

279
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,630
(Lee Guk San, the first Whenever Guest)

280
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,370
- Gosh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Yes.

281
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
- So this is the place.
- Yes.

282
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,539
- Could we enter?
- Yes, please.

283
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,139
- I see.
- Let's go.

284
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,970
- Let's go. Join us, please.
- My gosh.

285
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,580
Gosh, it's been a while since I got on a cruise.

286
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,350
This one... Yes, I've been on this cruise before.

287
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,580
Isn't this a yacht?

288
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,279
- It's a cruise.
- No.

289
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,889
- Hello.
- Hello.

290
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,489
- Are you Park Jung Bin?
- Yes.

291
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,550
- Hello.
- I see.

292
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,960
(Park Jung Bin, Lee Guk San, the first Whenever Guests)

294
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,259
- Should we head upstairs?
- Yes, please head upstairs.

295
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,730
- We have to go upstairs.
- Yes.

296
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,970
Please sit down.

297
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,830
- Gosh, this place is nice.
- Yes.

298
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,740
- It's shaking a bit.
- Right.

299
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,540
- A boat is passing by.
- Yes, it shakes a bit.

300
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,680
I thought I was shaking because I woke up early this morning.

301
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,379
- You thought so?
- Yes.

302
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,749
- I'm getting older and all.
- That's so funny.

303
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,779
So I thought I was shaking.

304
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,350
(Chuckling)

305
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,690
- Are you the captain?
- Yes, I am.

306
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,089
- A long time ago, I competed...
- Yes.

307
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,419
in Episode Three...

308
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,089
- of "Infinite Challenge."
- The duck pedal boats?

309
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
Yes, the duck pedal boats.

310
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,159
- Did you drive the cruise?
- Yes.

311
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,200
Yes. I said, "Let's use domestic products."

312
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,230
Right!

313
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,099
You're Captain Lee Guk San.

314
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,300
- Captain Domestic.
- That's right.

315
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,970
My gosh.

316
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,540
(He clearly remembers the memory of that day.)

317
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,109
(Episode 3 of "Infinite Challenge," May 7, 2005)

318
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,209
(Footage courtesy of MBC)

319
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,650
(Captain Lee Guk San)

320
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,450
Hello.

321
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,190
(The captain's name is Lee Guk San.)

322
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,220
(He must definitely be from Korea.)

323
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,720
(Let's use domestic products.)

324
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,630
(What a crazy connection this is.)

325
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,229
- How many years ago was that?
- That was...

326
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,469
- It's been 20 years.
- We met in 2005 or something.

327
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,139
(They met 20 years ago.)

328
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,639
- A duck pedal boat and a cruise...
- Right.

329
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,540
- competed on the Han River.
- Yes.

330
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,240
- I really liked that episode.
- The cruise...

331
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,709
He wrote he had been at this job for 40 years.

332
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,780
- Yes. It's my 40th year.
- My gosh.

333
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,010
I can't believe this.

334
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,719
So you're the captain. What about Jung Bin?

335
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm a manager in charge of food and beverages.

336
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,759
- I see.
- So people can have meals here...

337
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,959
when the cruise sets sail in the afternoon.

338
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,859
- Right.
- They can have drinks too?

339
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,900
- That's right.
- I see.

340
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,970
To put it simply, this is a buffet cruise.

341
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,870
Regular cruises are operated for Love Cruise.

342
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,739
- Love Cruise?
- Is that where people propose?

343
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,509
- It's just the name of the cruise.
- I see.

344
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,809
(Awkward)

345
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,980
- I thought it was a special cruise.
- I thought so too by the name.

346
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
I thought it was...

347
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
- for married couples.
- The name...

348
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:52,379
I thought it was a romantic cruise.

349
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,520
- The name is Love Cruise.
- I see. Love Cruise.

350
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,319
Jung Bin. How long have you been working here?

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,919
It's only been ten years.

352
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,429
- "Only ten years?"
- That's a long time.

353
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,529
- That's a long time.
- Ten years...

354
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,059
It's hard to work at one place...

355
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,229
- for ten years nowadays.
- Right.

356
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,799
- But around Captain Lee, - Yes.

357
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,769
- he can't say it's been long.
- Right.

358
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,899
(His 10-year work experience is nothing to Captain Lee.)

359
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,139
As for the history of cruises in Korea,

360
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
they were brought in for the Summer Games...

361
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,539
- or the Asian Games.
- Right.

362
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,539
- When the Han River was developed, - That's right.

363
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,909
cruises were brought in for the first time.

364
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,649
So hasn't that been about 40 years?

365
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,919
- It opened in October of 1986.
- Right.

366
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,949
- That's right.
- Yes.

367
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,889
Then have you been working here since the opening? Or...

368
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,619
When the cruise line opened on October 26,

369
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,390
I had been working as a manager since June.

370
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,430
I've been working here ever since then.

371
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,889
You've been guarding the Han River for 40 years.

372
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,259
Aren't you the living witness of the Han River's history?

373
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,969
I mean, you've been working here for 40 years.

374
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,730
I spent my entire life on the Han River.

375
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,839
When people ask you to choose between mountains or beaches,

376
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,709
I'm more drawn to mountains.

377
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,939
- You know?
- I'm more drawn to mountains now.

378
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,740
- What about you, Koong Min?
- I'd choose the beaches.

379
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,939
- Really?
- Yes.

380
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,380
- So you would look young?
- No.

381
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,279
You chose the beaches to look young, right?

382
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,919
- I think I did. Yes. That's it.
- But...

383
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,089
A part of me wanted to look young when I answered that.

384
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,389
- Right?
- Yes.

385
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,019
You wanted to pick the beaches if I asked you.

386
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,730
- Come to think of it, I did.
- I bet.

387
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,260
- I knew that was your intention.
- Then...

388
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,729
What about you, Yeo Been?

389
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,329
I'd choose the beaches too.

390
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,330
- The beaches?
- Yes.

391
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,970
- What about you, Sul?
- I like mountains.

392
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,399
- What about you, Jung Bin?
- I'd choose the beaches.

393
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,969
- I see. They like the waters.
- Beaches.

394
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,039
- They do.
- I see.

395
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,179
What kind of spare time is this?

396
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,309
What do you usually do starting at noon?

397
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,379
This is our lunchtime.

398
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,009
- This is your lunchtime?
- Yes.

399
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,620
We operate the cruise from 4pm to 5pm.

400
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,119
Then we operate it one more time after that.

401
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,790
- It operates two times a day?
- Yes.

402
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,289
- Earlier, you asked them to pick...
- Yes.

403
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,859
- between mountains and beaches.
- Yes.

404
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,890
How come you didn't ask me that?

405
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,960
(Pardon?)

406
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,529
What do you prefer? The mountains or the beaches?

407
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,829
- We assumed it'd be the beaches.
- As for me,

408
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,299
my father gave me my name...

409
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,970
- after a big mountain.
- I see.

410
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,840
But whenever I go to the mountains,

411
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,840
my lower body feels weak.

412
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,709
- My legs feel weak on mountains.
- I see.

413
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,150
- But I'm a great swimmer.
- Okay.

414
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,549
- So...
- So which do you prefer?

415
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,580
I like the river.

416
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,220
That's what we thought too.

417
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,920
That's what we had in mind too.

418
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,660
So we didn't ask you.

419
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,460
We naturally assumed that.

420
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,029
You couldn't have stayed here for 40 years...

421
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,760
- if you didn't like the river.
- You know what?

422
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,999
You know what? You're at this vast river.

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,170
But you're narrow-minded.

424
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,140
He's sulking now...

425
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,469
- because we skipped him.
- We didn't ask him.

426
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,470
(But he feels great to share his answer.)

427
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,210
Which one of you wrote to the show?

428
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,979
- I did.
- You did?

429
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,280
- Yes.
- What made you write to our show?

430
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,150
I wanted to show people the Han River.

431
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,679
Not many countries have a natural river...

432
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,190
- In the middle of the city. Right.
- this large.

433
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,560
- This is quite rare.
- Yes.

434
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,989
The river is about 1km in width.

435
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,490
- Right.
- It's wide too.

436
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,959
- Yes. That's right.
- Foreigners love the Han River.

437
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,299
Is there a secret spot on the Han River...

438
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,299
regular people might not know?

439
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,269
- The fountain in Banpo.
- The fountain in Banpo.

440
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,399
It was listed in the Guinness World Records...

441
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,109
- because it stretches over 1km.
- I see.

442
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,739
- The bridge.
- On the bridge. Yes.

443
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,110
- There are lights too.
- Yes.

444
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,409
But a lot of people know about the bridge, right?

445
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,610
Well,

446
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,950
it would be a different sight on the cruise.

447
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,179
- It's beautiful.
- Right, it's beautiful.

448
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,749
Sir. Tell us a spot we don't know, though.

449
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,790
A spot you don't know?

450
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,520
Well, Yeouido is a great spot to look at the Han River.

451
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,260
- Yeouido?
- Some people might not know.

452
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,200
(Smiling innocently)

453
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,059
- Jung Bin. Please help him out.
- Right.

454
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,330
- Let me step in.
- The captain...

455
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,239
- He only told us the spots we know.
- We all know these spots.

456
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,739
I see. The Hangang Bridge looks beautiful at night.

457
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,869
There's Nodeul Island too.

458
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,979
When you look at the bridge...

459
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,579
from the riverside or a cruise like this,

460
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,509
- It's different.
- the angles are different.

461
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,980
- It's different.
- Yes.

462
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,779
But I'm sure there are some challenges...

463
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,120
when it comes to working on a cruise. Could you share a few?

464
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,289
As for today's shift, we start at 2pm.

465
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,359
We work for 9 hours. So we end up 11pm.

466
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,729
(Their shift ends at 11pm.)

467
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,760
- Our shift starts and ends late.
- Yes.

468
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,760
That makes the job difficult.

469
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,029
But it's nice once I got older.

470
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,030
What's nice about it?

471
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,440
Being on the cruise by myself.

472
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,280
Do you like being on the cruise or being by yourself?

473
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,239
It's great to be by myself on the cruise.

474
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,509
- That's the best combo.
- I see.

475
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,680
- They're the best combo? I see.
- It's a cherry on top.

476
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,019
Anyway, now that we're here,

477
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,149
I hope we can complete the missions with Namkoong Min, Yeo Been,

478
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,489
- and Sul.
- Yes.

479
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,119
- So we can give them nice presents.
- Right.

480
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,429
- Yes.
- We'll begin now.

481
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,059
- Before we start the game, - Yes.

482
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,160
we must throw this for bonus coupons.

483
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,399
- Right.
- That's a lot of money.

484
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,459
Would you like to start?

485
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,199
- Gosh, let the youngest throw it.
- Okay.

486
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,739
- Sul will do it. Great.
- Sul.

487
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,199
- Okay.
- Throw it here.

488
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,440
Let's give them good energy.

489
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,910
- All right.
- Get two.

490
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,210
(Kissing)

491
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,220
- One.
- One.

492
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
- We got one.
- Okay.

493
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,090
- Good job.
- Gosh.

494
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,660
- One is pretty good.
- I'm glad it wasn't a zero.

495
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,330
Let's find out what kind of present is at stake on Round One.

496
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,830
All right. Here are the fortune cookies.

497
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,699
- That's huge.
- Grab one.

498
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,199
Once you break it, the paper says what the present is.

499
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
- Please check.
- Yes.

500
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,740
- I'll choose this.
- Yes.

501
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,539
- You have to start with that.
- I see.

502
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,770
(Oh, I see.)

503
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,739
Could you read this? I must wear glasses to read this.

504
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,810
Okay.

505
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,510
- I have presbyopia.
- My gosh.

506
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,110
- Same here. It's slow focusing.
- We call it slow focusing.

507
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,679
"We're excited to welcome passengers on board every day."

508
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,850
"We can groom ourselves neatly before work with this."

509
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,049
"Two electric shavers."

510
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,260
(Present for Round 1, 2 electric shavers)

511
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,529
(Groom neatly before work, 2 electric shavers)

512
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,960
- There are two.
- My gosh.

513
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,799
- They look good.
- Round One...

514
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,259
(Smiling from ear to ear)

515
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,600
Look at him. His face lit up.

516
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,330
- Look at the captain.
- Thank you.

517
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,740
They look good.

518
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,000
- Yes.
- Round One...

519
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,440
- Do you want it?
- Gosh. Sort of?

520
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,640
Gosh. Sort of?

521
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,409
What's the game?

522
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,779
We must do well...

523
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,839
- to give them the present.
- I see. I got it.

524
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,610
(Flying Spoon)

525
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,179
(Tap on the spoon...)

526
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,050
(and get it to land on the plate.)

527
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,649
(Round 1)

528
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,990
(Get one spoon to land on the plate.)

529
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,520
- I see. From here.
- But...

530
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,989
- I see. Like this?
- What?

531
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,330
- We have to get it on the plate?
- Yes. In one go.

532
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,759
- In one go?
- Is that possible?

533
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,029
(Starting point, landing point)

534
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,199
- This is way too hard.
- It's too hard.

535
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,329
- It's similar to flipping erasers.
- This...

536
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,769
- Let's practice.
- Okay.

537
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,940
I guess we have to hit it hard.

538
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,869
- I hit it too hard. Okay.
- You need a skill to do this.

539
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,940
It's harder than you think.

540
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,380
Gosh. We're in trouble.

541
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,609
Isn't this way too hard?

542
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,350
- I don't think we can do it.
- You can try it there.

543
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,319
- He did it.
- Will that count?

544
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,849
- Will this count?
- The spoon can't touch the table.

545
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,519
- The whole thing must be on it?
- It can't touch the table.

546
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,750
I have to give it a nice tap.

547
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,359
- You need a skill to do this.
- Okay.

548
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,460
It's harder than you think.

549
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,290
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

550
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,330
You did it.

551
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
- You have to hit it really hard.
- You did it.

552
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,830
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

553
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,399
- How did you do that?
- It's...

554
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,470
- You can give it a nice snap.
- Right.

555
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,409
- Gosh, this... Right.
- You can give it a nice snap.

556
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,540
Right.

557
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,109
Hold on.

558
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,879
- No, we might be able to do it.
- Right.

559
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,010
Hold on.

560
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,010
- Sul. Try again.
- Wait. Sul.

561
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,350
- I don't think I can do it.
- It's okay.

562
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,779
- Wait.
- Try again.

563
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,219
Sul. You do have to hit the spoon.

564
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,620
You have to hit the spoon.

565
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,559
(Min seems to be getting the hang of it.)

566
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,890
You must give it a nice snap.

567
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,530
Koong Min seems stricter with Sul than with others.

568
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,099
That's because...

569
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,270
- they're in the same agency.
- They're in the same agency.

570
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,369
- She's his direct junior.
- Yes. She's his direct junior.

571
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,540
Sul.

572
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,840
- Let me try it too.
- Try it.

573
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,240
- This is hard.
- Yes.

574
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,509
- Wait.
- Gosh.

575
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,609
- This is hard.
- This one...

576
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,850
- Yes.
- Wait.

577
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,409
- Gosh. This is hard.
- This one is in the air.

578
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,749
So it counts, right?

579
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,502
- You did it.
- Yes, you got it.

580
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,850
Yes, you got it.

581
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,249
Right?

582
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,390
(You're doing a good job.)

583
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,360
Did you come up with this game?

584
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,790
For the electric shavers.

585
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,730
- We might be able to do it.
- Right. All right.

586
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,729
- A group chant before we start.
- Let's do a group chant.

587
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,770
- Let's try out Round One.
- Let's do it.

588
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,539
- One, two, three. Let's go!
- Let's go!

589
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
Here goes our Round One.

590
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,339
- Yeo Been, do you want to go first?
- Yes.

591
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,009
- Great.
- I'll give it a try.

592
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,539
Throw the spoon just like you'd throw questions.

593
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,909
- Try that.
- Give it a nice throw.

594
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,480
- All right. You got this.
- You got this.

595
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,680
Who knows? She might suddenly succeed.

596
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,589
- Nice try.
- Gosh. It was... Okay.

597
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,849
(She hit the spoon too hard, so she failed.)

598
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,289
Gosh, why am I so nervous?

599
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,959
- Let me try next.
- My gosh. Okay.

600
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,889
Great. All right, Koong Min.

601
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,499
- I should try from the side.
- It's...

602
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,729
Right. That doesn't matter.

603
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,800
(Focused)

604
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,100
- The distance...
- I see.

605
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,870
Please...

606
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,940
My gosh.

607
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,240
Please...

608
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,840
Please...

609
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,279
- Hold on.
- Wait.

610
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,450
- This...
- That's it.

611
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,579
Wait. Is my turn over? That's it?

612
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,650
- That's it.
- You touched it.

613
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,020
- This is...
- Oh, no.

614
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,360
In golf, this would count as a swing.

615
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,320
(Scratching)

616
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,689
My gosh. Oh, no.

617
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,860
This is so embarrassing.

618
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,729
- I mean... Right.
- It's so embarrassing.

619
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,170
- You scolded Sul earlier.
- I guess I was too nervous.

620
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,230
- Gosh, it's so embarrassing.
- What was that?

621
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,769
- I was too nervous.
- All right.

622
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,839
We still haven't gone. Right?

623
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,540
- Sul, you, and I haven't gone yet.
- Yes.

624
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,770
- Why don't you try?
- Let me go next.

625
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,310
- Please.
- Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

626
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,149
- We might succeed unexpectedly.
- Yes.

627
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,350
- Right?
- Out of the blue.

628
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,990
Please.

629
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,490
- It could happen out of the blue.
- Out of the blue.

630
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,860
- Out of the blue. Seriously.
- My gosh.

631
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,199
(It's on the plate!)

632
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,260
- Out of the blue. Seriously.
- My gosh.

633
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,030
- Out of the blue. Seriously.
- My gosh.

634
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,770
(Impressed)

635
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,869
(Amazed)

636
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,080
- What is this?
- My gosh.

637
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
(Clapping like a seal)

638
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,780
What just happened?

639
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,150
What?

640
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,650
- What...
- Out of the blue!

641
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,490
- Out of the blue.
- It happened out of the blue.

642
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,319
- This is it then?
- Round One...

643
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,459
- is complete!
- It's complete!

644
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,120
(They complete Round 1 on their 1st try!)

645
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,889
- It happened out of the blue.
- This is crazy.

646
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,460
- I just...
- I should've gone after you.

647
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,459
- Sul didn't even get to try it.
- I'm relieved.

648
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,729
- We completed Round One.
- All right.

649
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,039
- You now get the electric shavers.
- You won them.

650
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,170
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

651
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,939
- Gosh, it's going smoothly today.
- Thank you.

652
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,709
- But...
- It's going smoothly today.

653
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,809
- there's a catch.
- Okay.

654
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,149
We still have Rounds 2 and 3.

655
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,949
You must decide whether you want to continue or stop.

656
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,619
- All right. Make your decision.
- Okay.

657
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,749
One, two, three.

658
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,519
(What will they decide?)

659
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,750
- Go. Go for it no matter what.
- Go.

660
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,560
- Were you going to stop here?
- If we fail...

661
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,190
- Really?
- No?

662
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,259
"We wear uniforms all year round."

663
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,400
"We want to stay dry even in summer."

664
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,370
"Two Samsung dehumidifiers."

665
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,770
- Two dehumidifiers?
- My gosh.

666
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,140
- The rainy season is approaching.
- Right.

667
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,539
- We need it.
- You really need this, right?

668
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,280
- We need it.
- Dehumidifiers are perfect.

669
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,940
- They're brought in right away.
- That's amazing.

670
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,609
- Gosh, I want it too.
- Oh, my.

671
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,779
- You really need this, right?
- Dehumidifiers. Right?

672
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,249
- I really wanted a dehumidifier.
- I bet it will get harder now.

673
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,220
- Sul said she wanted it more.
- My gosh.

674
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,050
- Can I write to the show later?
- Yes, you can.

675
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,719
- Apply to be on the show.
- I will.

676
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,659
- You should write to the show.
- Yes.

677
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,630
How will the game change now?

678
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,400
(Round 2: The plate will get smaller.)

679
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,139
- Gosh.
- It's smaller.

680
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,670
(The spoon barely fits on the plate.)

681
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,006
(It's too small.)

682
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,439
- This...
- That's a small plate.

683
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,579
- We're using the same spoons.
- Gosh. Remember that time?

684
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,050
We couldn't complete Round Two with the ball before.

685
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,779
- We passed Round 1 quite early.
- We did well with Round 1.

686
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,880
Round Two...

687
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,549
- My gosh. Listen.
- You should...

688
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,689
Sul. Look at it before you hit it.

689
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,490
- I did look at it.
- Make sure to look first.

690
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,360
- I hit it.
- That's more powerful than before.

691
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,900
- You try it.
- Me too.

692
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,769
Hey.

693
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,530
- Ms. Gong.
- Wasn't that pretty good?

694
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,238
My gosh.

695
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:52,837
You should let it fly a bit.

696
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,769
- How did he do that?
- That might be better.

697
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,470
Can you show me how you did that, Jae Suk?

698
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,180
(Analyzing his skill)

699
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,179
(They keep trying.)

700
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,449
- My gosh. In the beginning...
- Ms. Gong.

701
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,150
(But Round 2 is difficult.)

702
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,949
(Staring)

703
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,150
We passed Round One pretty early that time too.

704
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,820
- Round Two...
- This is...

705
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,689
Hold on.

706
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,230
(Min quietly picks a spot in the corner.)

707
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,070
(Training hard by himself)

708
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,540
Gosh, I'm ready.

709
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,469
- I can at least hit it well.
- Try it here.

710
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,880
- I doubt practicing will help.
- It didn't work.

711
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,640
- I didn't think it'd help.
- Great.

712
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,749
(It was almost on the plate.)

713
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,750
Great.

714
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:39,120
- That was so close.
- You got really close.

715
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,719
- That was good.
- I see.

716
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,319
- That's how I should do it.
- You got really close.

717
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,089
- Should we try it?
- It's...

718
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,259
- We might succeed out of the blue.
- We could do it out of the blue.

719
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
- Out of the blue again.
- One of us might succeed...

720
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:47,320
- out of the blue again.
- Yes.

721
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,289
- All right. Round 2.
- This is our 2nd try. Yes.

722
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,429
- Is this our 2nd try? The 2nd try.
- Let's do a group chant.

723
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,700
- It's our second try.
- Yes.

724
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,430
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

725
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,999
- Hitting the spoon...
- We might do it out of the blue.

726
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,430
- It happens out of the blue.
- Yes. I...

727
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,440
- Did he...
- I'm good with my hands.

728
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,210
I hit it too hard.

729
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,380
(Disappointed)

730
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,580
- I'm getting the hang of it now.
- Who will go next?

731
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,349
Yeo Been? Sul?

732
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,920
- Sir, I warmed it up.
- Great.

733
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,750
- Sir, I warmed it up.
- Great.

734
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,490
She warmed it up?

735
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,320
- You warmed up the spoon?
- My gosh.

736
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,730
- That's a bit over-the-top.
- My gosh.

737
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,959
No. I mean...

738
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,529
- She's taking good care of him.
- My gosh. Hey.

739
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,059
- I told you...
- What did you do to her?

740
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,229
- I mean...
- Seriously.

741
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,699
- They're getting the wrong idea.
- She has to warm up...

742
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,170
- Isn't this too much?
- I mean...

743
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,339
- I mean, the spoon...
-You made her warm up your spoon?

744
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,739
Why would I ask her to do that?

745
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,539
- Hey. Come on.
- What was that?

746
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,070
- Does she warm up his chair?
- Seriously.

747
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,109
Koong Min. What just happened?

748
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,710
I told you not to do this when we were out.

749
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,049
- My gosh. All right.
- Fine. Since you warmed it up,

750
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,050
I'll give it a try.

751
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,590
I should relax and just do it.

752
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,220
- Relax.
- Right.

753
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,990
It could happen out of the blue.

754
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,359
- My gosh. That was close.
- You got so close!

755
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,399
- You got so close.
- That was so close.

756
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,659
- All right.
- That was so close.

757
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,930
It was on the plate and then bounced out.

758
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,729
- That was so close.
- Should I go next?

759
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,799
- Yes.
- Gosh.

760
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,099
- Should I go next?
- Okay. Go ahead.

761
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,239
- I'll try it on the opposite side.
- My gosh. I hit it too hard.

762
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,969
- Sul, you should go last.
- Gosh. Okay.

763
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,940
No, I'll stick to the side I've been practicing just in case.

764
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,239
- Here.
- Okay.

765
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,009
(She carefully thinks about her every move.)

766
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,150
- Why can't we do this?
- Okay.

767
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,689
(Oh, my...)

768
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,890
(Laughing)

769
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,030
- You did a good job.
- You encourage each other a lot.

770
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
It's over.

771
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:33,029
(All they have is each other to rely on.)

772
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,429
- It could suddenly work.
- Right.

773
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,199
- You're our only hope, Jae Suk.
- Suddenly.

774
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,299
- It could suddenly work.
- He has this.

775
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,999
- It just has to fly a bit.
- Jae Suk.

776
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,470
I warmed this spoon up.

777
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,870
Nice.

778
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,109
- This is a good attitude.
- Jae Suk.

779
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,380
- Learn things like these.
- Wait.

780
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,780
Learn things like these. This is good.

781
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,550
- This is nice.
- It's tough, isn't it?

782
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,250
You should start the car beforehand in the winter.

783
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,120
- All right.
- "All right."

784
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,389
(Second try: Yeon Seok, Min, Yeo Been, Jae Suk)

785
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,960
It sometimes works out of the blue.

786
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,800
Wait. This is a lot of pressure.

787
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,600
"Out of the blue."

788
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,870
It sometimes works out of the blue.

789
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,440
That was close.

790
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,779
(Bummer)

791
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,109
- We have one person left.
- Sul.

792
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,309
- Yes.
- It's my turn.

793
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,510
(Very nervous)

794
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,150
Go, Sul.

795
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,327
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

796
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,979
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Sul.

797
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,675
Good luck.

798
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,420
(Their second try ends in failure.)

799
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,159
You aren't saying anything.

800
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,490
Even Captain Lee groaned.

801
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,359
- Please encourage us.
- I didn't mean that.

802
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,700
(Embarrassed)

803
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,230
- You're strong, - Yes.

804
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,729
- but you hit the wrong spot.
- Yes.

805
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,640
Would you like to give it a try?

806
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,269
- Let's have him try.
- Okay.

807
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,609
- We'll use a coupon.
- All right.

808
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,840
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

809
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,909
One person has to step out when you're playing.

810
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,209
- Who should take a break?
- You can stare at the person...

811
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,580
you think should step out.

812
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,120
(Smiling)

813
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
You.

814
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:03,019
The production crew can't step out.

815
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,249
- It has to be one of us.
- One of us.

816
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,489
- Do you dislike the producer?
- Choose one.

817
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,759
You're taking one person's place.

818
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,959
Then I won't play.

819
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,329
- Come on.
- You should play.

820
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,659
- You have to take someone's place.
- Come on.

821
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,599
- Should I step out?
- This person.

822
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
- Should I step out?
- This person.

823
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,540
You had already made up your mind.

824
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,299
- He already thought about it.
- That's right.

825
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,569
- All right.
- I'll step out.

826
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,739
Come over here, Yeo Been.

827
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,970
(Yeo Been steps out, and Guk San steps in.)

828
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,509
Try practicing.

829
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,849
- Okay. I'm left-handed.
- Yeo Been.

830
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,049
You're left-handed?

831
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,980
- You can practice.
- I think I can do this.

832
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,820
- That was close.
- The distance was pretty close.

833
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,589
Is it a success if it goes under the plate?

834
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,860
- No.
- No?

835
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,960
What are you talking about?

836
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,929
I don't think we can apply enough strength to get in on the plate.

837
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,930
- That won't work.
- No?

838
00:28:46,931 --> 00:28:48,630
You're good at insisting on something.

839
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,799
- Here we go.
- Right away?

840
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

841
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,399
We have to say it together.

842
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,939
- We have to say it together.
- Okay.

843
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,209
- Are you done practicing?
- Try practicing.

844
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,270
- We can try now.
- Sorry. No, not yet.

845
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,610
Are you practicing?

846
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,639
Guk San is good...

847
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,110
at variety shows.

848
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,110
It doesn't work. I'm in trouble.

849
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,879
How am I supposed to do this?

850
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,750
It isn't easy, is it?

851
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,849
- Hit it.
- Hit it harder.

852
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,790
- Let's practice 1 more time.
- Practice 1 more time?

853
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,989
That's good.

854
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,459
- He's really good.
- Let's give it a try.

855
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,889
Let's try.

856
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,529
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

857
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,829
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

858
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,099
We'll start with Captain Lee.

859
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,470
- Here I go.
- Please work.

860
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,879
It flew all the way here.

861
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,940
(Glancing at Jae Suk)

862
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,809
It's okay.

863
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,249
- It's okay.
- It flew all the way here.

864
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,949
We still have four more people to try.

865
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,619
- It's okay.
- Yes.

866
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,659
- He's really...
- Do you understand how I feel now?

867
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,259
- Yes.
- Right?

868
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,729
I'm sorry.

869
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,659
- Don't be.
- You're so old-fashioned.

870
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,129
You did a good job trying.

871
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,899
- All right.
- It warms your heart.

872
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,570
- All right.
- Here I go.

873
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,769
I got the hang of it.

874
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,339
(Coupon round: Guk San, Yeon Seok)

875
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,570
It could work out of the blue.

876
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,810
It could work out of the blue.

877
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,380
It could work out of the blue.

878
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,780
It was almost a dunk shot.

879
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,650
- Should I go next?
- Yes.

880
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,460
We still have Sul and Min.

881
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm so nervous.

882
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,100
(Gasping)

883
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,240
(It landed on the plate!)

884
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,840
(Screaming)

885
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,810
You're amazing today, Jae Suk.

886
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,549
(Awesome!)

887
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,849
- Gosh.
- What just happened?

888
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,950
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

889
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,250
- You're amazing today, Jae Suk.
- That was amazing.

890
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,620
- Gosh.
- You're so good today.

891
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,929
- Gosh.
- What is going on?

892
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,429
- Nice.
- What is going on?

893
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,759
I'm so lucky today.

894
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,399
(Today is Jae Suk's lucky day.)

895
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,599
With that,

896
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,030
- we cleared Round 2.
- We cleared Round 2.

897
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,640
- Gosh.
- All right.

898
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,039
(Captain Lee is finally smiling brightly.)

899
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,810
- I had a good feeling.
- This is awesome.

900
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,440
- I don't believe it.
- This is amazing.

901
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,910
- We got him the dehumidifier.
- That was so clean.

902
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,509
The game...

903
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,179
continues getting harder.

904
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,979
- Yes.
- But the prize gets bigger.

905
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,850
- I see.
- You have to decide.

906
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,319
We still have many tries left.

907
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,289
- Yes.
- Will you continue or stop?

908
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,290
Yes.

909
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,319
(What will the two decide?)

910
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,729
- You can stop now.
- Okay.

911
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,960
- Or you can continue.
- You can continue.

912
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,560
Stop.

913
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Stop.

914
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,570
(Stop?)

915
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,739
(When you have eight tries left?)

916
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,410
- Wait.
- What?

917
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,680
- Wait.
- What?

918
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,010
- We'll continue.
- No, it's okay.

919
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,179
- You can stop.
- I thought he'd...

920
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,649
- You thought he'd continue.
- Yes.

921
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,319
We have many tries left, but you can choose to stop.

922
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,019
It's okay if you want to stop.

923
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,219
You might lose everything if the game gets harder.

924
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,489
- That's right.
- Let's try that again.

925
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,029
You can discuss it again.

926
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,659
Don't continue for the show.

927
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,029
- All right.
- I'm serious.

928
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,100
It's your decision.

929
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,130
- It was so abrupt and neat.
- I was surprised.

930
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,669
I thought variety shows have changed a lot.

931
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,370
He could stop there.

932
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,339
But we still have many tries left.

933
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,480
It's really okay if you want to stop.

934
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,380
- What do you think?
- It was so abrupt and neat.

935
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,250
- Let's continue.
- I thought variety shows...

936
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,580
- changed a lot.
- Go?

937
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,820
It's okay for us to stop.

938
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,549
- You think so?
- Yes.

939
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,790
(Contemplating)

940
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,560
- Don't think about us.
- No.

941
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,459
- One, two, three.
- Three.

942
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,189
(What is their final decision?)

943
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,190
- Three.
- Three.

944
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:39,200
- Stop.
- Stop.

945
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,530
All right.

946
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,069
Variety shows have become realistic.

947
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,300
- That's right.
- Gosh.

948
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,909
In the past, we would've continued.

949
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,180
- We would've convinced him.
- Right.

950
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,579
This is nice.

951
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,549
It may be a smart decision.

952
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,579
- Right.
- Yes, that's right.

953
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,679
We succeeded in Round Two,

954
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,079
- thanks to Captain Lee.
- That's right.

955
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,889
We will give you the presents...

956
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,919
for the two rounds.

957
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,460
(They won an electric shaver and dehumidifier.)

958
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,390
Congratulations.

959
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,959
We also have souvenirs.

960
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,789
- Yeo Been and Sul...
- Gosh.

961
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,730
- Give it to them.
- You can give it to them.

962
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,299
- Yeo Been and Sul...
- Gosh.

963
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,130
- Give it to them.
- You can give it to them.

964
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,740
- Sul.
- I thought it was mine.

965
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,609
I thought it was for us.

966
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,009
- Yeo Been.
- I'm sorry.

967
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,180
You're making many mistakes today.

968
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,839
- I want to keep it.
- Give it to them.

969
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,249
Do we get one too?

970
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,749
- Nice. We get one too.
- We'll give you one.

971
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,480
- Really?
- We'll give you one.

972
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,390
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

973
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

974
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,759
I thought it was for us.

975
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,419
We failed in all the games...

976
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,659
a couple of days ago.

977
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,930
That's right.

978
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,760
- Gosh.
- You know...

979
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,830
Variety shows have changed a lot, haven't they?

980
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,569
They aren't how they used to be.

981
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,599
- No, they aren't.
- I see.

982
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,069
That was neat.

983
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,309
I think it was a nice and neat decision.

984
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,569
Yes, you're right.

985
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,109
- Sometimes it's necessary.
- Of course.

986
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,779
You sometimes need to make...

987
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,309
- a firm decision.
- Yes.

988
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,149
What if they decided to continue and we failed?

989
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,420
- What are we going to do?
- You're right.

990
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,679
We meet our next guest at 2:30pm.

991
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,019
That's perfect.

992
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,289
- Where should we have lunch?
- We can have lunch.

993
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,789
- Yeouido...
- There are many good restaurants.

994
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,390
There is a buckwheat noodle place.

995
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,729
Cheongsu Udon Buckwheat Naengmyeon.

996
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,529
- Cheongsu.
- Cheongsu.

997
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,729
- Buckwheat noodles.
- Are you okay with noodles?

998
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,629
- I'm okay.
- I love noodles.

999
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,169
I see. Are you okay with buckwheat noodles?

1000
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,669
Yes, it sounds tasty.

1001
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,869
Let's go there.

1002
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,683
Let's walk.

1003
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,871
Would you like to use the restroom?

1004
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,170
Sounds good.

1005
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,409
It isn't far from here.

1006
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,640
- It's close.
- Yes.

1007
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,949
Yeon Seok,

1008
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,119
how did you decide to be on variety shows?

1009
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,950
I don't know. It suddenly happened.

1010
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,250
The producer and writer asked me to do it with Jae Suk.

1011
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,519
They gave me the chance.

1012
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,860
- You're really good at it.
- No, I'm not.

1013
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,200
You happened to succeed in the games today, Jae Suk.

1014
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,700
- Even Round Two.
- I know.

1015
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,700
The games are...

1016
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,540
- strange.
- Right?

1017
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,639
It doesn't go as I wish.

1018
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,809
It's annoying.

1019
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,869
It seems lame,

1020
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,110
- but it doesn't go as you wish.
- It's lame but difficult.

1021
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,709
And you weirdly get nervous.

1022
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,710
(Lame, difficult, nerve-racking, and strange Whenever Possible)

1023
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,710
- Shall we?
- Yes, let's go.

1024
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,319
The restaurant is nearby.

1025
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,949
- It isn't that close.
- We have to walk a bit.

1026
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,119
It's a 15-minute walk.

1027
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,160
- Yes.
- I see.

1028
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,119
Can we go without calling first?

1029
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,129
- We can just go.
- Yes.

1030
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,189
We don't arrange it beforehand.

1031
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,099
- It's past lunchtime.
- Gosh.

1032
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,429
- That's great.
- Across the restaurant,

1033
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,199
there is a waffle place.

1034
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,929
- I know the place.
- The owner...

1035
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,169
- is from Belgium.
- I saw it on TV.

1036
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,469
- I want to try it.
- That's the place.

1037
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,339
- It's tasty.
- Wasn't it on TV?

1038
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,939
When I first started acting...

1039
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,580
and had an audition at Yeouido,

1040
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,509
- I used to eat there.
- I see.

1041
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,609
I wanted to try it.

1042
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,049
- It's old and well-known.
- That's right.

1043
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,379
It's well-known.

1044
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,579
I ran into older actors there.

1045
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,649
- It sounds tasty.
- I see.

1046
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,920
Since the waffles are so good.

1047
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,860
Yeouido.

1048
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,019
(Glancing at something)

1049
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,459
What kind of flowers are those?

1050
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,089
Do you like flowers and plants?

1051
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,729
- Yes. When I was young, - Clover flowers.

1052
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,859
- I used to make rings.
- Are those clover flowers?

1053
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,669
We used to make rings with these, Jae Suk.

1054
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,770
You did?

1055
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,329
- Don't you know?
- I also made wreaths.

1056
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,000
I rarely see so many of them together.

1057
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,070
(The clover flowers are a bright white.)

1058
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,440
- It's pretty.
- There are other flowers here.

1059
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,710
Look.

1060
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,109
Are they thistles?

1061
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,810
- Are these thistles?
- They aren't thistles, are they?

1062
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,550
I've never seen that flower before.

1063
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,479
It looks nice...

1064
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,489
when a handsome couple does that.

1065
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,019
- They look good doing anything.
- You can make rings with these.

1066
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,320
- Yes.
- You cut it in the middle.

1067
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,130
This is how you do it.

1068
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,889
You make rings with these.

1069
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,200
Cut it in the middle.

1070
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,570
- Haven't you tried this?
- No.

1071
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,429
Don't you have these memories?

1072
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,039
I...

1073
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,770
I've made umbrellas.

1074
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,140
But I've never made rings with flowers.

1075
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,009
- An umbrella?
- Yes.

1076
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,279
- With leaves?
- Something like this.

1077
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,309
(The leaf umbrella in Jae Suk's memory)

1078
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,679
I don't know what the leaf I used is called.

1079
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,119
- You made an umbrella?
- How did he make an umbrella?

1080
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,790
- Umbrella?
- He's from a different generation.

1081
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,589
Let's go up this way.

1082
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,620
(Pretending not to hear)

1083
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,360
(He is still making a ring.)

1084
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,800
- What do you think? Do you like it?
- Yes.

1085
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,370
(He slips it onto her finger.)

1086
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,000
It's a lucky ring.

1087
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,839
You and Sul have something in common.

1088
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,709
- That's right. It's pretty.
- It's a lucky ring.

1089
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,310
- It looks good on you.
- It's pretty.

1090
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,509
- It looks good on you. It's pretty.
- It looks good on you.

1091
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,609
(She loves it.)

1092
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,009
Try better with the next guest since you're wearing that ring.

1093
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,080
You look rich.

1094
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,950
- It's huge.
- It's a ruby.

1095
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
- It's a big stone.
- Of course it should be.

1096
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,619
- The stone should be big.
- It's hilarious.

1097
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,660
(I'll wear the ring and try my best.)

1098
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,630
(They soon reach the main road.)

1099
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,730
- We're walking along Yeouido.
- I know.

1100
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,670
I used to have many filmings in Yeouido.

1101
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,240
(Communicating whenever possible)

1102
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,540
(Communicating whenever possible as well)

1103
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,610
- Does it smell nice?
- It smells very nice.

1104
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,609
(Gasping)

1105
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,549
- It's fragrant.
- Yes, it is.

1106
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,779
Smell the flower, Min.

1107
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,979
(Sharing the scent of the flower)

1108
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,289
- It's really nice.
- Shall we?

1109
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,320
- Yes.
- It's nice.

1110
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,220
Yeo Been...

1111
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,530
keeps answering from somewhere.

1112
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,500
- We discussed this earlier, Min.
- Yes.

1113
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,499
Back in the day when we filmed at studios,

1114
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,599
- the producers...
- Right.

1115
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,469
spoke constantly through the talkback.

1116
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,270
They wouldn't stop talking.

1117
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,609
They'd point out our mistakes in front of everyone.

1118
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,639
(Sad memories of when they were rookies)

1119
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,650
And the producers had a lot of anger back then.

1120
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,580
- That must've been scary.
- It was really scary.

1121
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,389
If you made several mistakes,

1122
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,760
- they pushed you to the last.
- Yes, you had to film at the end.

1123
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,789
- "We'll film this scene later."
- Oh, no.

1124
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,189
(Relating to it)

1125
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,893
You know what?

1126
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,129
I never want to go back to how it used to be.

1127
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,599
- Me, neither.
- Really?

1128
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,440
- I don't ever want to go back.
- It was horrible.

1129
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,769
What was it like at the set of "Our Movie?"

1130
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,439
They're both very outgoing.

1131
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,079
They often came up to me first although I'm older.

1132
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,080
They lightened the mood.

1133
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,249
Frankly,

1134
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,890
I tiptoe around my juniors nowadays.

1135
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,959
But Yeo Been is very generous with compliments.

1136
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,089
It was because...

1137
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,059
I grew fond of him.

1138
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,859
And I relied on him a lot.

1139
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,100
He kept telling us we were doing well.

1140
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,799
I didn't know how to repay him.

1141
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,109
She paid me back with compliments.

1142
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,369
Yes, repay compliments...

1143
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,470
- Really?
- with compliments.

1144
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,979
It isn't a normal amount of compliments.

1145
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,810
Even when I wanted to speak,

1146
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,179
she went on for 15 to 20 minutes once she started.

1147
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,679
- She complimented you?
- Yes, she did.

1148
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,149
Then she was giving you a hard time.

1149
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,889
- No, I wasn't.
- Gosh.

1150
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,089
- It wasn't?
- That's what it was.

1151
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,589
Weren't you trying to stop him from saying anything...

1152
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,159
- by complimenting him?
- That's right.

1153
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,389
- I couldn't talk.
- That's what you were doing, right?

1154
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,199
- You got me.
- Sul...

1155
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,729
and Yeo Been came up with that idea, right?

1156
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,029
- You got us.
- You got us.

1157
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,799
They kept complimenting me even when I tried to cut in.

1158
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,200
(There was a reason for the never-ending compliments.)

1159
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,639
We're almost there.

1160
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,639
We just have to cross the street at the light.

1161
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,839
(They arrive near the restaurant while chatting.)

1162
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,909
- I see.
- It's a very old restaurant.

1163
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,480
- It was here when I was a rookie.
- That's right.

1164
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,310
- It's really old.
- Yes.

1165
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,479
I'm sure I've been there.

1166
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
- I just don't remember.
- Right?

1167
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,649
It looks like a good restaurant.

1168
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,189
- It looks good.
- It looks really good.

1169
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,859
- I've seen this place.
- The food looks tasty.

1170
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,089
It's still busy.

1171
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,529
(They arrive at the restaurant they used to eat at as rookies.)

1172
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,959
- Are there any seats?
- Are there any seats?

1173
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

1174
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:28,300
It's been a while. Hello.

1175
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,699
- Gosh.
- It's been a while.

1176
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,100
(They sit down after warmly greeting the owner.)

1177
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,599
This is amazing.

1178
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,470
- We just came in here.
- What?

1179
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,180
You just walk up to any restaurant and go in.

1180
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,979
- We don't arrange it beforehand.
- This is unbelievable.

1181
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,380
(Min is surprised all day.)

1182
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,779
(They study the menu.)

1183
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,249
I haven't been here for a very long time.

1184
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,719
Gosh.

1185
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,190
- Buckwheat noodles set meal.
- Let's have buckwheat noodles.

1186
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,660
- There are other types of noodles.
- I'll have the set meal.

1187
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,719
- Me too.
- Buckwheat noodles set meal?

1188
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,930
Yes, I'll have that.

1189
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,400
- Buckwheat noodles.
- Just the noodles?

1190
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,630
What is buckwheat noodles with young radish?

1191
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,299
- The young radish sounds good.
- Young radish?

1192
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,569
- Should we order it and share?
- The young radish is tasty.

1193
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,799
- It is? Can we order?
- Yes, it's refreshing.

1194
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,640
- Yes, I'll take your order.
- Clean this table.

1195
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,139
How many young radish noodles?

1196
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,079
We'll have 1 young radish noodles, 1 buckwheat noodles,

1197
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,010
- and three set meals.
- She left.

1198
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,779
- She left.
- She'll be back.

1199
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,219
- She'll be back.
- Say that again.

1200
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,320
Okay.

1201
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,719
It's 1 young radish noodles, 1 buckwheat noodles, and 3 set meals.

1202
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,089
- Also 1 fried tofu rice balls.
- And 1 meat dumplings.

1203
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,960
We'll add one meat dumplings.

1204
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,889
I had this every time I was in Yeouido.

1205
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,729
(Feeling nostalgic)

1206
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,830
You ordered three set meals.

1207
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,770
- I haven't been here.
- The food is served quickly.

1208
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,129
Three set meals.

1209
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,540
- You ordered a set meal, right?
- Yes.

1210
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,609
(The fried tofu rice balls and dumplings are served right away.)

1211
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,410
- Thank you.
- That looks so tasty.

1212
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,909
The buckwheat noodles are here.

1213
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,910
(The buckwheat noodles, the main dish, are served last.)

1214
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:49,080
This is included in the set meal.

1215
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,449
- This is the best in the summer.
- Of course.

1216
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,849
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

1217
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,389
- Here.
- Thank you.

1218
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,850
(Thank you for the food.)

1219
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
(Slurping)

1220
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,560
(Marveling)

1221
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
(Slurping)

1222
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,200
(Nodding in approval)

1223
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,539
You can use that dish.

1224
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,570
(Min slurps his noodles as well.)

1225
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,869
It's been a while since I had this,

1226
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,010
- It's tasty.
- but it's so tasty.

1227
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
It's tasty.

1228
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,610
- Can I have some of yours?
- Yes.

1229
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,379
- Do you want green onions?
- Who ordered the young radish?

1230
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,479
- Him.
- The young radish looks tasty.

1231
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,919
(Cold buckwheat noodles with young radish)

1232
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
It looks delicious.

1233
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,620
Look at this.

1234
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,420
It comforted me after auditions when I felt empty inside.

1235
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,360
(Yeon Seok's soul food when he was a rookie actor)

1236
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,200
Did you know if you got the part after auditioning?

1237
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,670
Right away.

1238
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,169
- Isn't it the same for you?
- Yes.

1239
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,639
I felt like I didn't get the part...

1240
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,609
around 95 percent of the time.

1241
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,979
I only felt like I'd get the part if I were lucky...

1242
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,180
the other five percent of the time.

1243
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,810
Surprisingly, I often didn't get the part...

1244
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,249
- when I felt like I'd get it.
- That's right.

1245
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,520
When I auditioned without high hopes,

1246
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,449
the judges sometimes liked it...

1247
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,789
and gave me the part.

1248
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,960
That's right.

1249
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,489
I had auditions all the time.

1250
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,189
We used to audition a lot.

1251
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,729
We auditioned so much.

1252
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,860
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1253
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,730
Min struggled for a long time.

1254
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,639
Did you become an actor through open recruitment?

1255
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,440
I tried it three times but didn't make it.

1256
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,539
You usually get an answer within ten days...

1257
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,310
- after auditioning, right?
- Yes.

1258
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:34,420
When it gets closer to the tenth day without an answer,

1259
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,249
you realize you didn't make it.

1260
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,590
- It's better to know right away.
- Right.

1261
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,660
Did you ever experience that, Sul?

1262
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,490
I didn't get the part for most auditions.

1263
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,260
- That's only natural.
- You're right.

1264
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,629
You don't get most parts...

1265
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,870
- before landing one.
- Right.

1266
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,239
At first, I didn't even get a call...

1267
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,869
after applying for an audition.

1268
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,810
I didn't get to audition often.

1269
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,749
So I started slowly with independent films.

1270
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,519
The people that watched those films...

1271
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,120
reached out to me.

1272
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,389
This also happened to me once.

1273
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,860
I got cut from a project after a script reading.

1274
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,189
Right. That happened to me too.

1275
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,329
You go to dinner for the first time after the script reading.

1276
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,360
You get close to one another as you get drinks together.

1277
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,530
I got cut from the project after that.

1278
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,639
I saw the others on TV...

1279
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,899
when I didn't make it.

1280
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,239
It was a terrible feeling.

1281
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,769
I didn't know that happened.

1282
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,940
That must be hurtful.

1283
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,679
- It is.
- I wondered...

1284
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,880
who took my place.

1285
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,149
Then I realized who it was and thought,

1286
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,820
"I saw him in many commercials, and he took my place."

1287
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,390
It's tough when that happens to you.

1288
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,089
It's tough.

1289
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,690
When I run into actors who survived at awards ceremonies,

1290
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,429
we look at each other...

1291
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,269
with a look that says,

1292
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,399
- "You've survived."
- When did you debut?

1293
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,270
I empathize with you.

1294
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,209
Thank you.

1295
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,640
We all struggled and gave it much thought.

1296
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,610
Were you interested...

1297
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,149
in directing or production in real life?

1298
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,019
Yes, I actually tried directing several times.

1299
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,819
I met my wife...

1300
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,189
while directing a film.

1301
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,529
- You did?
- She auditioned for the film.

1302
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,030
- And that's how we met.
- I see.

1303
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,229
But directing in real life and playing the role of a director...

1304
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,969
- It's different.
- in a drama is different.

1305
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,699
When I'm playing the role,

1306
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,139
I look cool and say,

1307
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,039
"Ready, action."

1308
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,209
But in real life,

1309
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,380
I say, "Let's start in 1, 2, 3. Action."

1310
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,119
- You sound less serious.
- Yes, you're right.

1311
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,849
You say, "Cut."

1312
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,050
But when I was acting, I said, "Cut. That was good."

1313
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,559
I had to exaggerate.

1314
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,630
Lee Jung Heum, the director,

1315
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,899
said no director is as cool as he is in real life.

1316
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,960
That's right.

1317
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,529
(They go back to focusing on the buckwheat noodles.)

1318
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,930
Our production crew likes it too.

1319
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,870
Wait.

1320
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,909
Sul seems to love the buckwheat noodles.

1321
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,069
- It's so tasty.
- It's really good, right?

1322
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,109
- Yes.
- It's tasty.

1323
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,709
Look at her still wearing the ring Yeon Seok made her.

1324
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,579
She's so nice.

1325
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,249
- But...
- You can take it off now.

1326
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,619
You can throw it away.

1327
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,780
She's so nice.

1328
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,519
(Looking around)

1329
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,150
Their udon is also tasty.

1330
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,959
(I can't hold myself back anymore.)

1331
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,930
- I'll have one udon.
- Dumplings?

1332
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,160
Yes.

1333
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,930
You're a pretty big eater for your size.

1334
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,399
And he likes noodles.

1335
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,770
I do.

1336
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,739
- I haven't come here in so long.
- Also, he genuinely likes the food.

1337
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,840
It's so good.

1338
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,870
It's so tasty. Also, I see...

1339
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,610
the menu right in front of me.

1340
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,710
- So, - You can't help but order it.

1341
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,850
I keep trying to choose one.

1342
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,450
The ones that I've been wanting to eat.

1343
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,750
Here's your udon.

1344
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,019
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

1345
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,320
The outside isn't that hot.

1346
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,490
- It's good.
- How are the noodles so...

1347
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,900
(Moaning)

1348
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,770
(Fascinated)

1349
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,230
At this point, you should pay for the food.

1350
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,300
I feel like I should, but we have to play a game.

1351
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,410
Oh, there's a game.

1352
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,369
There isn't a fixed game, though.

1353
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,680
We just play some games to decide who pays.

1354
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,479
- The total is huge.
- Is it over 100 dollars?

1355
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,610
How much is the bill?

1356
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,580
- It's...
- It's nearly 100 dollars.

1357
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,750
What game were you going to play?

1358
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,820
- There's a game I have in mind.
- What is it?

1359
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,490
It's a game using your phone's battery.

1360
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,019
We ask the production crew...

1361
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,289
- to pick a number.
- And?

1362
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,300
The person whose battery level is the closest...

1363
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,429
- to that number...
- That person pays.

1364
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,899
- pays.
- Sounds good.

1365
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,240
- I like that.
- Let's play it.

1366
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,439
It's totally a game of luck.

1367
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,600
- Exactly.
- It is.

1368
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,109
- "Our Movie" premieres on June 13, - Yes.

1369
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,610
so we'll multiply 6 by 13. The number is 78.

1370
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,810
- Seventy-eight.
- Seventy-eight?

1371
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,710
- Let's check it out.
- On the count of three?

1372
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,980
In 1, 2, 3.

1373
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,950
- Hang on.
- This is amazing.

1374
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,750
I'm at 99 percent.

1375
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,590
I'm at 73 percent.

1376
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,219
I...

1377
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,420
I'm at 81 percent.

1378
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,290
- That's a 3-point difference.
- I'm at 77 percent.

1379
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,060
Seventy-seven?

1380
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,959
- Seventy-seven?
- Seventy-seven?

1381
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,299
- All right.
- Seventy-seven.

1382
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,529
- Yeo Been...
- She's at 77 percent.

1383
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,599
Seventy-seven?

1384
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,399
- What's your battery level?
- I think it's 80-something.

1385
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,370
- It's 70-something.
- What's the level?

1386
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,369
- The screen is too bright.
- The number was...

1387
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,579
- Is it 78?
- If it is...

1388
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,680
It could be.

1389
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,040
It's 76.

1390
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,949
- What was your number?
- It's at 77 percent.

1391
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,449
(Lunch is on Yeo Been.)

1392
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,319
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1393
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,849
- Thank you.
- Yeo Been.

1394
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,149
- That was...
- I enjoyed the meal too.

1395
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,589
Jae Suk should have paid.

1396
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,520
I normally charge my phone to 100 percent.

1397
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,490
- I...
- It's so funny that it's 99.

1398
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,659
I get anxious...

1399
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,930
- once it goes below 80.
- You get anxious.

1400
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,160
I have to charge it, then.

1401
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,429
- I see.
- Yes.

1402
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,630
- Thanks for the food, Yeo Been.
- Thank you.

1403
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,600
That was a great meal.

1404
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,369
Thank you for coming.

1405
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,369
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

1406
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,339
(After Yeo Been pays...)

1407
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,480
That looks delicious.

1408
00:49:03,546 --> 00:49:04,650
They have ice cream waffles.

1409
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,949
That sounds tasty.

1410
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,079
It's very good.

1411
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,479
It's what Yeo Been and Sul have been dying to eat.

1412
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,550
- Yes.
- Exactly.

1413
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,720
It looks so tasty.

1414
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,059
Hold on.

1415
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,630
- How should we...
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1416
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,560
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Make it simple.

1417
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,959
- It's simple.
- How about the two losers...

1418
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,800
play muk-jji-ppa after rock-paper-scissors?

1419
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,899
- I like that.
- If there are two losers?

1420
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,269
- If there are two losers.
- Yes.

1421
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,469
- Okay.
- Good.

1422
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,770
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1423
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,339
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1424
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,840
(Yeon Seok and Sul win.)

1425
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,410
I'm out.

1426
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,480
I always lose when it comes to these games.

1427
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,879
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Hang on.

1428
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,819
What if Yeo Been loses again?

1429
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,979
- There's no choice.
- Isn't it too harsh?

1430
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,419
- We don't have a choice.
- It's so mean.

1431
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,689
- That's the game we agreed on.
- Good luck.

1432
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,490
You should be the loser to make it funny.

1433
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,920
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1434
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,190
(Yeo Been wins.)

1435
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,289
Yes!

1436
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,129
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- We're playing muk-jji-ppa.

1437
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,260
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1438
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,270
Scissors!

1439
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,470
Rock. It's your turn.

1440
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:01,969
Go on.

1441
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,140
Oh, did I win?

1442
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,409
You're winning.

1443
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,669
- It's your turn.
- I was wondering...

1444
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,609
- What were you waiting for?
- I must have been nervous.

1445
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,409
- I almost got a cramp in my hand.
- My bad.

1446
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:10,680
- My bad, Min.
- Go on.

1447
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,649
Scissors! Paper!

1448
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,249
(Min loses.)

1449
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,950
- Did you lose on purpose?
- No, I didn't.

1450
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,250
Nice.

1451
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,059
Yes!

1452
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,119
I want an ice cream waffle.

1453
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,559
Then, two ice cream waffles...

1454
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,130
and three original waffles.

1455
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,369
- That will be 18.60 dollars.
- Okay.

1456
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,469
You can insert the card here.

1457
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:32,869
That's a bummer. I wanted to pay...

1458
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,240
- for everything today.
- I know.

1459
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,540
What a bummer.

1460
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,569
Why don't we play another round for coffee?

1461
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,440
Oh, dear.

1462
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,909
This time...

1463
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,450
(A game with coffee at stake)

1464
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,180
Why don't you pay?

1465
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,580
Why don't I?

1466
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,950
You should buy coffee.

1467
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,520
Okay. I'll buy coffee for you.

1468
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,589
(Laughing)

1469
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,660
We're eating more than we expected.

1470
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,389
It's got a nice course set up for us.

1471
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,900
- The course is...
- They're all connected.

1472
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,060
- It's a three-course meal.
- Exactly.

1473
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,469
They cover everything.

1474
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,070
- They coexist.
- Yes.

1475
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,970
Here it is.

1476
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,239
It looks good.

1477
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
(Taking a bite instantly)

1478
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,770
It's so good.

1479
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,379
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

1480
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,710
(Off to the next spare time with both hands full)

1481
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,650
If we go straight,

1482
00:51:19,982 --> 00:51:21,419
- we'll see our next guest.
- This is so good.

1483
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,950
- We can just go straight.
- Really?

1484
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:28,912
Walking on the street...

1485
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,290
with both of my hands full...

1486
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,299
- at this age feels like...
- You haven't done it recently.

1487
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,029
- Isn't it your first time?
- Not just recently.

1488
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,370
Have you ever done this in the last few years?

1489
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,839
- Except for on this show.
- Well...

1490
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,640
If I'm not on this show, I rarely go around like this.

1491
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,280
- I feel so rich.
- Totally.

1492
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,249
Also, we look like a group of coworkers.

1493
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,950
Right? Even the way we're dressed...

1494
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,679
That's so funny.

1495
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,620
- Motorbike.
- This waffle is...

1496
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,449
It's so tasty.

1497
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,619
- You know, - But it's...

1498
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,960
I thought Yeon Seok was far younger than me,

1499
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,060
but he said, "Motorbike."

1500
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,159
- I'm 42.
- He's not that young.

1501
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,400
He's also gone through turbulent times.

1502
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,430
(Identifying with him)

1503
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,470
I think we can cross if we run.

1504
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,299
No, we have to eat.

1505
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,040
Take your time.

1506
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,480
I just realized that Jae Suk was...

1507
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,479
- very obedient to Yeon Seok.
- Of course.

1508
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,379
- You're usually not like that.
- No, I'm always like this.

1509
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,020
Plus, he can be very sensitive.

1510
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,620
- It's just that you're eating.
- You're right.

1511
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,860
That's true.

1512
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,489
(Staring at her ice cream)

1513
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,860
Do you want a bite?

1514
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,560
(Walking over)

1515
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,100
You guys are such good friends.

1516
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,399
- Such best friends.
- You're looking at them...

1517
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
as if they're you're nieces.

1518
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:51,139
I adore them. They're so lovely together.

1519
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,239
Right.

1520
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,409
They're just so cute.

1521
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,279
- Have you bought them tasty food?
- Very often.

1522
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,849
- So many times.
- He did.

1523
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,079
- Tasty food...
- I tried...

1524
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,149
the best sushi of my entire life, thanks to him.

1525
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,290
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1526
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,859
It was so good.

1527
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,290
We ate far more than what we achieved today.

1528
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,259
I know. We only played about three rounds.

1529
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,359
You're right.

1530
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
The way he said, "Stop," was hilarious.

1531
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,500
- He didn't hesitate for a second.
- Yes. "Stop!"

1532
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,770
And there were lots of presents in the first two rounds.

1533
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,110
- I wanted that dehumidifier.
- Me too.

1534
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,070
The dehumidifier.

1535
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,480
Sul genuinely wanted those prizes.

1536
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,849
- She genuinely needs them.
- She does.

1537
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,919
Exactly.

1538
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,149
And you tend to be materialistic.

1539
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,249
(Her earthly desires pop out every now and then.)

1540
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,719
You've got some earthly desires.

1541
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,849
Also, I thought...

1542
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,489
- I was getting the hat.
- This hat?

1543
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,689
- I thought it was just for us.
- If we got one...

1544
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:44,929
We'll give you one each.

1545
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,930
All right.

1546
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,360
(Happy)

1547
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,030
I think it is on the eighth floor here.

1548
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,070
I frequented this building back when I was a rookie.

1549
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,700
- On the 8th floor.
- On the 8th floor here?

1550
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,200
Eighth floor.

1551
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,509
"Kim Hui Hyun."

1552
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,539
- Hui Hyun.
- Yes.

1553
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,439
"From 'College Music Festival' to 'Bbo Bbo Bbo...'"

1554
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,079
"and 'Open Concert,'"

1555
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,379
"I was the rhythm master of Yeouido..."

1556
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,949
"during the golden age of Korean broadcasting."

1557
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,249
"Rhythm master?"

1558
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,390
Maybe he's a musician.

1559
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,859
"With just one pair of sticks, I've captivated the whole world."

1560
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,689
"Come and hear the story of my great birth!"

1561
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,959
- He must be a drummer.
- Yes.

1562
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,060
- I think he plays the drum.
- Drummers are cool.

1563
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,560
Drummers are so cool.

1564
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,800
Let's go.

1565
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,499
- This is it.
- What is this place?

1566
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,669
This is the one.

1567
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,369
- Unit 810.
- Mr. Kim Hui Hyun.

1568
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,500
He's a drummer.

1569
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,970
"MBC Orchestra."

1570
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,169
(Realizing)

1571
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,080
- Oh, it was the MBC Orchestra.
- He said he was on TV.

1572
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,579
He won an award at an Entertainment Awards.

1573
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,950
- Let's step inside.
- Let's go.

1574
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,250
Amazing.

1575
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,880
(Entering carefully)

1576
00:54:40,058 --> 00:54:40,771
Sir.

1577
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:43,080
- Why, hello.
- Hello.

1578
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,289
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1579
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,449
- Hello.
- Hello.

1580
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,759
Are you Mr. Kim Hui Hyun, the drummer?

1581
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,059
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

1582
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,290
Yes, that's me.

1583
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,189
It's nice to meet you.

1584
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,900
(Kim Hui Hyun, the second Whenever Guest)

1585
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,270
- Is this a drum school?
- It is.

1586
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,370
I just noticed...

1587
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,639
Did you work with Cho Yong Pil too?

1588
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,369
- Yes, back in the day.
- Great Birth, the band?

1589
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,440
Yes.

1590
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,279
(Formed in 1979, Great Birth is Cho Yong Pil's backing band,)

1591
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,580
(renowned for bringing together the most talented musicians.)

1592
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,309
I was the third drummer.

1593
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,019
(The 3rd drummer of Great Birth)

1594
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,480
I was a member for about ten years.

1595
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,550
- I see.
- Yes.

1596
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,559
How long have you run this school?

1597
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,689
It's been about 29 years.

1598
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,959
It will be the 30th year next year.

1599
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,760
- The whole time here?
- Yes, the whole time.

1600
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,729
I never changed the interior design.

1601
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,529
- Why don't we take a seat first?
- Let's sit down.

1602
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:30,670
Have a seat.

1603
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,029
It's pretty small.

1604
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,329
I played it on "Hospital Playlist."

1605
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,340
- The drum?
- Yes, on "Hospital Playlist."

1606
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,269
- Oh, right.
- You're right.

1607
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,409
- Right.
- I was the drummer for the band.

1608
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,039
I played the drums a little in a show.

1609
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,509
- I forgot most of it, though.
- I see.

1610
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,650
You should play it for us later.

1611
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,849
Me?

1612
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,250
(Inhaling sharply)

1613
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,189
I can't dare to play in front of the best.

1614
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,190
Please don't say that.

1615
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:54,490
How long have you been playing the drums?

1616
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,860
This will be my 60th year.

1617
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,289
- Since you started playing?
- Yes.

1618
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,599
- Sixty years?
- Yes.

1619
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,730
It's been 59 years and 3 months.

1620
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,070
(Whenever Guest and Cho Yong Pil)

1621
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,470
(A 1st-generation drummer that performed on countless stages)

1622
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,639
(And undoubtedly a legend...)

1623
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,179
(who still performs)

1624
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,849
How did you get into drums at first?

1625
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,590
When I had just started learning to speak...

1626
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,749
Do you know the buk for pansori?

1627
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,389
- Yes.
- The round one.

1628
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:30,189
My father used to play that as a hobby.

1629
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,429
He enjoyed playing buk...

1630
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,559
with pansori music in the background.

1631
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,399
When he went off to work,

1632
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,800
I would lay it down and study on it.

1633
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,700
I used to roll it like a rolling hoop too.

1634
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,669
I played it every day.

1635
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,739
(He's always been with buk ever since he was little.)

1636
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,569
- And then...
- You naturally learned.

1637
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,309
Yes. When I was in middle school,

1638
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,839
I watched a musical troupe perform for the first time ever.

1639
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,949
They had come into town.

1640
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,650
The drummer was sitting at the center...

1641
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,250
and played that drum,

1642
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,890
but I had only seen one drum called buk.

1643
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,860
But he was stomping and hitting the hanging ones.

1644
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,890
I had never seen that before.

1645
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,860
You know what people call your vocation?

1646
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,669
As if I was overwhelmed by light.

1647
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,129
- You were mesmerized.
- Yes!

1648
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,270
I couldn't think about anything else.

1649
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,599
I just thought, "I'm playing this for the rest of my life."

1650
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,839
That's how I began.

1651
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,280
I know this is our first encounter, but you're a very bright person.

1652
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,609
- I love his energy.
- He seems so happy.

1653
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,709
- You're so smiley.
- Thanks.

1654
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,579
I try to stay positive...

1655
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,480
and happy.

1656
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:34,120
Do any of you play an instrument?

1657
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,920
I can play the janggu.

1658
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,129
- Another percussion instrument!
- That's a percussion instrument.

1659
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,100
- So is the drum.
- That's right.

1660
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,360
You play the drum up and down, but you play the janggu...

1661
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,499
- from the side.
- Like this.

1662
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,599
You must have a good rhythm.

1663
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,799
You simply need to turn your grip sideways.

1664
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,299
- Like this.
- That's right.

1665
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,969
- What about you, Min?
- I don't have...

1666
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,409
- You don't play any instrument?
- None.

1667
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,339
Learning how to play an instrument will be very helpful in your life.

1668
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,409
- Do you mean the drum?
- Well...

1669
00:57:58,410 --> 00:57:59,579
(Tempted to play the drum)

1670
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,719
Once you play the drum,

1671
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,349
- all your limbs have to play...
- Right.

1672
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,850
to create the rhythm.

1673
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,790
It will prevent dementia.

1674
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,019
I should be worried about dementia.

1675
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,390
- You should be.
- I should prepare.

1676
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,859
- All your limbs move separately, - Precisely.

1677
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,929
- so it's very tricky.
- It works your brain.

1678
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,429
- It sounds fun.
- Yes.

1679
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,930
- It must relieve some stress.
- I can teach you one day.

1680
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,840
- By hitting it like this.
- Yes.

1681
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,669
You know, we came all the way here, so we'd like to...

1682
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,209
- Would you play it for us?
- listen to you...

1683
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,080
- playing the drum.
- That's right.

1684
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,539
- I'm a fan of yours, actually.
- Okay.

1685
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,309
I love your songs.

1686
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,479
- Okay.
- Songs...

1687
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,819
- like "Redevelopment of Love..."
- Yes.

1688
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,679
- and "Hapjeong Station Exit No. 5."
- Yes.

1689
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,749
I actually practiced "Hapjeong Station Exit No. 5."

1690
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,059
- Would you show us?
- Do you want me to play it?

1691
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,729
- Yes.
- Yes, please.

1692
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,329
- I can't wait.
- Please do.

1693
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,829
You need the melody to play the drum.

1694
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,299
He also has a YouTube channel, so...

1695
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,929
We have a microphone if you want to sing.

1696
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,170
Sure.

1697
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,129
He's going to play the drum.

1698
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,439
(To the drum studio to show off his skills)

1699
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,839
This looks...

1700
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,310
- This is nice.
- Yes.

1701
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,640
He has a jam session with the band here.

1702
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,910
- This looks legitimate.
- Yes.

1703
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,510
- Yeon Seok also...
- Yes.

1704
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,819
- On "Hospital Playlist."
- played the drum before.

1705
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,249
- Why don't you...
- Oh, no.

1706
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,690
- Play it, Yeon Seok.
- Sure.

1707
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,689
- But I forgot all about it.
- Please play it.

1708
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:13,960
Try playing it.

1709
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,789
- But I forgot everything.
- Nonsense.

1710
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,259
- You still have it in you.
- Once you play it...

1711
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,489
It's like riding a bicycle and playing pool.

1712
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,500
(Drumming)

1713
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,560
Goodness.

1714
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,900
The sound is...

1715
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,999
He's pretty good.

1716
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,399
I actually forgot everything.

1717
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,370
- But that was pretty good.
- I don't remember anything.

1718
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,810
(Getting into it)

1719
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Yes!

1720
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,079
(Amazed)

1721
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,779
- That was cool.
- You're pretty good.

1722
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,780
I forgot all about it.

1723
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:42,479
That's how good you are even after you forgot?

1724
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,849
You still have that groove in you.

1725
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,090
- Why don't you play it this time?
- Okay.

1726
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,690
- Show us.
- Sure.

1727
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,030
I'll give it a go.

1728
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,429
- He's different.
- He is.

1729
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,570
Look. That's a tough skill.

1730
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,240
My gosh.

1731
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,810
That's impressive.

1732
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,760
That was...

1733
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,930
The sound was beautiful.

1734
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,559
I'll play a song that I like.

1735
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,690
- Sure.
- Sure.

1736
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,760
- You grabbed the microphone.
- He gave it to me.

1737
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,740
(He starts playing right away.)

1738
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,440
Go!

1739
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,710
Gosh.

1740
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,879
(Immersed)

1741
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,019
I love it.

1742
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,920
(I love it.)

1743
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,330
(The owner of the song begins.)

1744
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,050
Amazing.

1745
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,310
This is wild.

1746
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:46,269
(Hapjeong Station Exit No. 5)

1747
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,140
Thank you for that.

1748
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,379
(A big round of applause)

1749
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,210
- That was...
- He's certainly different.

1750
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,250
- Awesome!
- It's different with live music.

1751
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,890
- Gosh.
- I felt it instantly.

1752
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,490
- It makes your heart race, right?
- Yes!

1753
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,819
Listening to the drums right next to me...

1754
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,319
- That was so cool.
- It was an honor.

1755
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,960
Thank you so much for that.

1756
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,929
- I'm a huge fan, - That was amazing.

1757
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:07,959
and I love this song.

1758
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,259
The way he played it was so cool. Like...

1759
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,899
- It was amazing.
- He's got a great sense of rhythm.

1760
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,600
He does.

1761
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,569
- Thank you for playing.
- Yes.

1762
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:16,800
Thank you.

1763
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,509
- The experience of 60 years...
- Incredible.

1764
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,539
He looked like a master of martial arts.

1765
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,579
- A master.
- Yes.

1766
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,880
That was fantastic.

1767
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,810
I wish I could learn.

1768
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,779
- While the sound was loud, - Right.

1769
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,689
he moved so smoothly.

1770
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,149
- I know, right?
- Did I?

1771
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,190
You must learn to play an instrument, such as the drum.

1772
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,689
(He tries to make them learn the drum whenever possible.)

1773
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,230
I felt it today.

1774
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:42,029
- I think I'm falling for it.
- I'm sorry?

1775
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,059
- I wish...
- She fell for it.

1776
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,199
I think you'll take classes here.

1777
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,870
I'll come to class with Min.

1778
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,239
All right.

1779
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,470
(Expected to be new students)

1780
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,510
Right.

1781
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:55,909
Do you usually have spare time at around 2:30pm?

1782
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:59,750
Yes. I have an event later today,

1783
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,619
so I finished things early...

1784
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,149
so that I could pick the songs.

1785
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,789
I was just practicing.

1786
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,949
You're not exactly free...

1787
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,789
- every day at 2:30pm.
- Right.

1788
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,529
- But you have an event at 4pm, - Yes.

1789
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,730
so you're going there right after this shoot, right?

1790
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,459
(The spare time was right on time for his event.)

1791
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,599
- He checked his schedule, - Yes.

1792
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,570
and it was the perfect gap.

1793
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,069
I come here and hang out...

1794
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,800
- as soon as I wake up.
- I see.

1795
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,309
May I ask what made you apply for this show?

1796
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,379
I watch pretty much every episode...

1797
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,509
- of Whenever Possible.
- Really?

1798
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,609
I do.

1799
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,750
But now that I'm keeping a low profile,

1800
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,879
some people started thinking I was dead.

1801
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,120
So, I wanted to show them that I was alive and kicking...

1802
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:41,819
and hitting the drum. That's why I applied.

1803
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,630
To tell people about your existence.

1804
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,229
- That I still live.
- "I still live."

1805
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,430
Alive and kicking.

1806
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,799
You made a great choice to be on our show.

1807
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,270
That's true.

1808
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,529
- At last...
- At last.

1809
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,840
Today,

1810
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,069
we made it to Round Two.

1811
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,209
- So, we have a good feeling.
- Okay.

1812
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,280
- This time, Yeo Been will...
- Yes.

1813
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,949
I'll throw it.

1814
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,379
- Roll a two.
- Do I just roll it?

1815
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

1816
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,049
- One.
- Well done.

1817
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,089
(They get 1 coupon.)

1818
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,189
- Great.
- We got it.

1819
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,419
It could have been a zero.

1820
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,560
(Relieved)

1821
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,090
- There are three rounds in total.
- Yes.

1822
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,599
Here's Round One.

1823
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,559
You'll see your prizes inside.

1824
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,770
Please check them.

1825
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,540
- Do I eat it?
- No.

1826
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,939
(A truly naive question)

1827
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,909
Well, you can, but check what's inside first.

1828
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,340
- I can check it?
- Yes.

1829
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,979
- Like this?
- But you said...

1830
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,340
that you watched every episode.

1831
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,709
I don't think he watches the show.

1832
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,980
(A fan of the show who's not familiar with the rules)

1833
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,049
"The stage outfit of a drummer with 60 years of experience..."

1834
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,449
"is a suit."

1835
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,920
"The tie is the highlight."

1836
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,489
A Gucci tie.

1837
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,219
(The present of Round 1, a designer tie)

1838
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,160
That's a great gift!

1839
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,760
We have to succeed.

1840
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,859
- A designer tie.
- A designer tie.

1841
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,930
It looks so good on him.

1842
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,159
(He pulls it off perfectly.)

1843
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,630
- Now...
- It looks great on you.

1844
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,930
He even poked his cheek.

1845
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,569
(The mission for the designer tie)

1846
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,970
(Buk and Smash)

1847
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,809
(They take turns to hit the buk...)

1848
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,280
(and try to flip all the coins on it.)

1849
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,710
(Round 1, 5 coins)

1850
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,480
- I see.
- We've got this.

1851
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,780
We have to flip them.

1852
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,650
But...

1853
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,589
- On that?
- That looks tough.

1854
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,219
We may have to think wisely...

1855
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,590
- about where to put the coins.
- That's true.

1856
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,189
I think we should...

1857
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,559
- take turns...
- Yes.

1858
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,559
- Flip all five coins at once?
- This is...

1859
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,260
- It looks difficult.
- quite tricky.

1860
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,270
If 1 person flips all 5 coins...

1861
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,569
In one go?

1862
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:35,139
- This looks tough.
- Yes.

1863
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,739
- It's pretty difficult.
- This is...

1864
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,970
(Jae Suk practices first.)

1865
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,079
We can go like this.

1866
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,709
But the rest of you have to flip the other three.

1867
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:43,779
This is a game of luck.

1868
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,049
- We need to think simple.
- It's just luck.

1869
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,410
Min, give it a try.

1870
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,320
- What...
- What?

1871
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,749
- But...
- What...

1872
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,019
- What?
- What?

1873
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,649
All right.

1874
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,719
- Should I go next?
- Just flip this one.

1875
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,760
All right.

1876
01:05:56,962 --> 01:05:57,856
You can do this.

1877
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,729
- Oh, it goes like that.
- It does.

1878
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:00,527
You can do this.

1879
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,130
You can do this.

1880
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:04,499
(Back to its original side)

1881
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,299
We might end up flipping the rest...

1882
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,239
- while trying to flip that.
- Exactly.

1883
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,070
- How...
- This is hard.

1884
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,569
The best-case scenario is...

1885
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,780
the first one flipping all of them.

1886
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,309
(Practicing in the meantime)

1887
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,480
- Goodness.
- What was that?

1888
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,979
(She flipped the rest!)

1889
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,050
What was that?

1890
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,720
(Laughing)

1891
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,290
(Bewildered)

1892
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,759
Don't you think it'd be better when we do it later?

1893
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,760
(She tries it again as she's on a roll.)

1894
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,290
- What?
- Don't you think it'd be better?

1895
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,360
(She succeeded again.)

1896
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:35,530
I think we'll do it well.

1897
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,960
She has the Hand of Master.

1898
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,029
My goodness. You should go last.

1899
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,169
- Should we just try it?
- Yes.

1900
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,599
What happens if the coins fall? Do we try it again?

1901
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,769
- It's out.
- Then you fail.

1902
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,409
- What? Goodness.
- That's right.

1903
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:46,440
Let's do a cheer before we try it.

1904
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,909
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1905
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,979
- It's our 1st try. It's Round 1.
- Okay.

1906
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,179
Who will go 1st? Shall I go 1st?

1907
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,649
- Okay.
- Let's go this way.

1908
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,850
(They will go counterclockwise starting from Jae Suk.)

1909
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,579
- Please. Don't get to my turn.
- All right.

1910
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,220
It'd be bad if I do it too many.

1911
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,120
Gosh. I think we'll be able to do it.

1912
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:02,160
(You can do it!)

1913
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,819
You can turn all of them all at once.

1914
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,890
That's right. All at once.

1915
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
You failed.

1916
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,960
(A coin fell.)

1917
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:11,530
You failed.

1918
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:12,830
(Jae Suk failed.)

1919
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,100
- My goodness.
- That was okay.

1920
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,240
- That was so...
- You shouldn't have dropped it.

1921
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,079
(Embarrassed)

1922
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,340
- Seriously.
- Goodness.

1923
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,580
It seems like you don't want to play games today.

1924
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,880
Hey, guys. You were praising me just now.

1925
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:30,119
But how could you change like that?

1926
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,189
- Goodness. As soon as I failed...
- What was that?

1927
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:34,020
It makes you so angry, right?

1928
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,859
I won't go first from now on.

1929
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,959
- I don't have a good feeling.
- Okay.

1930
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,659
- Let's start from over there.
- I'll start then.

1931
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,829
- You can go 1st.
- It's your 2nd try.

1932
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:43,759
It's our 2nd try. In 1, 2, 3.

1933
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,869
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

1934
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,100
Let's go.

1935
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,469
(He turned over 1 coin.)

1936
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,500
Goodness.

1937
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,640
- You can do it, Yeo Been.
- Yes.

1938
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,940
(Next is Yeo Been, the Hand of Master.)

1939
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,150
- Shall we try 1 by 1?
- What was that?

1940
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,480
- We're back again.
- Gosh, it's not working.

1941
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,789
- What? I got one at least.
- Goodness.

1942
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:07,790
- You got one.
- Okay.

1943
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,460
I have a bad feeling about this.

1944
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,260
- This game makes me angry.
- You turn over two coins and...

1945
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,500
(He turned over 1 more coin.)

1946
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:20,770
We have two left.

1947
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,910
(Now, only Jae Suk is left.)

1948
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,469
The last person would feel...

1949
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,539
- so much pressure.
- Jae Suk, hit here...

1950
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,509
Try hitting here to turn over both of them.

1951
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,309
But I'm worried that the coins would fall.

1952
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,109
About here? Should I hit about here?

1953
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,449
Which would be better? Here or here?

1954
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:35,879
- You need to hit it once...
- Hit in the middle.

1955
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,020
- and turn over both of them.
- Okay.

1956
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,520
Try hitting that spot.

1957
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,960
- I'll do it confidently.
- Okay.

1958
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,890
- You said you'd do it confidently.
- Goodness.

1959
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,630
(He failed.)

1960
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,770
- You seemed to lack confidence.
- Right.

1961
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,140
What happens if I hit here?

1962
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,139
(It won't work, of course.)

1963
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,270
- Gosh, it's hard.
- The coins shouldn't fall.

1964
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,440
- Goodness.
- Let me practice one last time.

1965
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,380
Good.

1966
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,479
(He turned over all the coins at once!)

1967
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,620
- Gosh, I should've gone for it.
- You should have...

1968
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,020
(Laughing)

1969
01:09:14,021 --> 01:09:15,689
- Good.
- I got the hang of it.

1970
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,119
- All right.
- Okay.

1971
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,559
- We have a good feeling now.
- Yes.

1972
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,929
- Let's try it.
- It's our 3rd try. In 1, 2, 3.

1973
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,500
- Here we go!
- Here we go! Do it right away.

1974
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,630
- That was good.
- Do it right away.

1975
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,539
- That was good.
- Goodness.

1976
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,339
(Min turned over 3 coins.)

1977
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,039
- That was good.
- Good job.

1978
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,270
- You did great.
- Great job.

1979
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,210
(There are 2 coins left.)

1980
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:42,280
(They turned over all the coins!)

1981
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,620
(Exclaiming)

1982
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,690
(The Hand of Master did it!)

1983
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,330
- Round One. We did it!
- We did it!

1984
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,070
Yeo Been.

1985
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,540
- Great job.
- My goodness.

1986
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,869
- You did a great job.
- I'm so happy.

1987
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,110
- You did it.
- I'm so happy.

1988
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,410
- I'm so happy.
- All right.

1989
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,439
- We've won the Gucci tie!
- My goodness.

1990
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,209
(They won the luxury tie.)

1991
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,649
- Now...
- I'm so happy.

1992
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:17,019
you need to decide if you want to try the next round.

1993
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,889
Please decide if you'd want to go or stop.

1994
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,320
Of course I'm going for the next round.

1995
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,389
- It's a go.
- Let's go.

1996
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,520
- We must go.
- Of course.

1997
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,030
The second prize.

1998
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,159
"I was born on an island."

1999
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,029
"I want to have some relaxing time while watching the East Sea."

2000
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:32,799
"A voucher for Yangyang Sol Beach Hotel."

2001
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,800
"A suite room with an ocean view..."

2002
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:34,839
- "for 2 days."
- For 2 days.

2003
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,840
(A voucher for a suite room for 2 days)

2004
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:37,609
- For 2 days?
- Gosh. A suite room for 2 days?

2005
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,410
- That's amazing.
- Amazing.

2006
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,879
- At Yangyang, Gangwon Province.
- That's amazing.

2007
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,009
- This is a nice place.
- I love it.

2008
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,010
It's a nice place.

2009
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:46,649
(Round 2)

2010
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,019
(They'll use 1 coin,)

2011
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,520
(and they must turn it over 5 times in a row.)

2012
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,820
What?

2013
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,420
- Five times in a row?
- So everyone must turn it over?

2014
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,590
If it doesn't turn over...

2015
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,889
It's so difficult because everyone has to turn it over.

2016
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:01,959
(There's only 1 coin, but everyone must turn it over to succeed.)

2017
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,669
The odds of turning it over five times in a row is...

2018
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,700
- Gosh, it won't be easy.
- My goodness.

2019
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,469
- Goodness. That's too much.
- We can do it.

2020
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,369
- I think we'll be able to do it.
- We can do it.

2021
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,540
I think we can do this.

2022
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,740
Like that game that you turn over ttakji.

2023
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,580
That could be too weak.

2024
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,020
Darn it.

2025
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,950
(Furious)

2026
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,090
Are we allowed to throw a tantrum while shooting?

2027
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,290
Of course. It makes me angry.

2028
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,360
Do you think there's a way to do this?

2029
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,130
As expected.

2030
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,560
Her eyes are so...

2031
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,200
- They tell us that she's a pro.
- Yeo Been.

2032
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,969
(The room is filled with the scent of the professional.)

2033
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,770
It's so hard because all of us must turn it over.

2034
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:47,980
This is...

2035
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,149
- I got it.
- You got it?

2036
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,909
- When we did it before...
- You need to do it with a snap.

2037
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,819
No. You lift your arm up like this.

2038
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,950
Lift my arm up?

2039
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,749
(Lifting the arm is the winning strategy?)

2040
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,689
- I need to lift my arm?
- Lift it up a little.

2041
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,819
Lift it like this.

2042
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,220
(Lift your arm and hit it from above.)

2043
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:03,890
(Yeo Been turned it over.)

2044
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:06,130
Hold the tip of the stick.

2045
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,960
(She turned it over.)

2046
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,430
(She did it again.)

2047
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:13,599
(It really works!)

2048
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,640
We got this.

2049
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,140
You should try it, Sul.

2050
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,469
- Good job.
- So this is how you do it.

2051
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,510
- Try it, Yeon Seok.
- So this is how you do it.

2052
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,280
- We should've said we'd go.
- This is...

2053
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,920
(Jae Suk did it too.)

2054
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,649
When you do it like this...

2055
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:31,850
I think you've become a master at this.

2056
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:34,319
All right. Let's go for it.

2057
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,320
I'll do it...

2058
01:12:35,321 --> 01:12:37,019
- when I have the hang of it.
- All right. It's our fourth try.

2059
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,590
- Here we go!
- Here we go! Let's see how it goes.

2060
01:12:39,123 --> 01:12:39,824
I'll try it.

2061
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,030
You failed.

2062
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,530
- Min.
- Hold on.

2063
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,240
(Min failed as soon as he went.)

2064
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,000
(Goodness, Min...)

2065
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,469
(Embarrassed)

2066
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,609
It took only 0.1 seconds.

2067
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,939
(Min gave it away in 0.1 seconds.)

2068
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,010
We were all excited, but all of a sudden...

2069
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,550
It was as if we had a cold shower.

2070
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,289
It cooled down all of a sudden.

2071
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,519
(He drinks cold water as he is surprised.)

2072
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,060
- This is so embarrassing.
- It was as if we had a cold shower.

2073
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:10,960
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

2074
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,590
Your face is so red right now.

2075
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:15,400
Seriously.

2076
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,170
"So I was such a pitiful man."

2077
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,029
- Min, it's okay. We still have...
- Seriously.

2078
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,699
- many more tries.
- Right.

2079
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,239
(Yeo Been encourages everyone.)

2080
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,839
This time, let's start with Yeo Been.

2081
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,869
- That sounds good.
- Yes.

2082
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,239
- I'll go first.
- Yeo Been, Sul,

2083
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,279
- Yeon Seok, me, and Min.
- Okay.

2084
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,209
- You'll go last.
- Okay. I'm good with it.

2085
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,349
- All right.
- This is our sixth try.

2086
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,449
Our sixth try.

2087
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,680
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

2088
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,920
- The pro will go first.
- I'll try it.

2089
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,790
(The sixth try, Yeo Been's turn)

2090
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,299
(She succeeded cleanly like a pro.)

2091
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,329
- My goodness.
- As expected, she's so good.

2092
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,169
- It's your turn, Sul.
- What do I do?

2093
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,499
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

2094
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,500
- Be confident.
- But...

2095
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,500
- Do you want to go later?
- Gosh.

2096
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,040
- You should do it now.
- I'll just get it over with.

2097
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,570
What do I do?

2098
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,109
- Find a way that feels good.
- Do I do it like this?

2099
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,579
- I think I should hit it here.
- Gosh.

2100
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,850
- Yeo Been, like this?
- Yes. It looks good.

2101
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,510
Hit it a bit strong.

2102
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,929
- Good job!
- I did it.

2103
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:18,959
- Good job.
- It's Yeon Seok's turn now.

2104
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,159
(Sul succeeded.)

2105
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,399
- It's Yeon Seok's turn now.
- Is it my turn?

2106
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,359
- We got this. Let's go!
- Goodness.

2107
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,969
- Let's go.
- I have a good feeling about this.

2108
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,569
- I feel good right now.
- Focus!

2109
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:28,570
I have a good feeling right now.

2110
01:14:28,571 --> 01:14:31,140
If I hit here, it will turn over.

2111
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:33,439
- About there.
- Here? This way?

2112
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,939
- Make a straight line.
- A straight line?

2113
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:35,979
(The coaching is quite delicate.)

2114
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,879
- Here.
- That's so funny.

2115
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,610
(Yeon Seok will hit the spot where it makes a straight line.)

2116
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,720
Please.

2117
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,050
I'll do it boldly.

2118
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,689
(Yeon Seok succeeded.)

2119
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:49,460
(Even Yeon Seok succeeded.)

2120
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,060
(Laughing)

2121
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:54,089
- Now it's up to the two of you.
- Hold on.

2122
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,899
(Jae Suk and Min are left.)

2123
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,299
- Jae Suk, show us.
- Jae Suk.

2124
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,169
I'm happy when others succeed,

2125
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,330
but my heart sinks at the same time.

2126
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,140
- Because it will be my turn.
- Right.

2127
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,139
- Hold on.
- It's up to you two.

2128
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,670
- Jae Suk, show us.
- Jae Suk.

2129
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,679
- Here?
- About here.

2130
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,780
(They seriously choose the spot to hit.)

2131
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,450
- Please.
- We got this.

2132
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,220
(We're close to success.)

2133
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,190
(Failed)

2134
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,669
We could see the sticker though.

2135
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:33,500
(Frustrated)

2136
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,140
(Laughing awkwardly)

2137
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,709
You hit it so timidly.

2138
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,069
(Everyone is frustrated.)

2139
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,979
But why did I think...

2140
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,010
- it was a relief?
- Why do you look happy?

2141
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:48,249
- Why do you look happy?
- You thought it was a relief?

2142
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,050
- I hope my turn doesn't come.
- My goodness.

2143
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:54,389
I don't think I can do it anyway.

2144
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,019
- Please don't let me do it.
- It's so hard.

2145
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:58,429
- Gosh, this is making me crazy.
- My goodness.

2146
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,460
What is this? I like it, but I feel pressure too.

2147
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,299
I get to hope that someone fails right before me.

2148
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,569
- Right.
- Yes.

2149
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,800
Gosh, we did really well though.

2150
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,500
- Shall I go first then?
- Yes.

2151
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,569
Since we're not good at this,

2152
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,609
- we should just do it first.
- We should... Right.

2153
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,039
- You should go 1st then.
- Shall I? Shall I go 1st?

2154
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,909
- Okay. In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

2155
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,310
- All right.
- Let's go. Be confident!

2156
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,150
Be confident!

2157
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,950
(He succeeded right away.)

2158
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,520
(Exclaiming)

2159
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,120
He was good...

2160
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:30,160
- since he had no pressure.
- Good job.

2161
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,089
- All right!
- We got this. Let's go!

2162
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,429
(Min succeeded.)

2163
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,560
(It's Jae Suk's turn.)

2164
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,270
(His hand is shaking.)

2165
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,110
(Jae Suk did it too!)

2166
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,540
- All right!
- Good!

2167
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,579
(Next player in line)

2168
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,679
- All right!
- Good!

2169
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,120
- This is interesting.
- All right.

2170
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,519
- I suddenly feel pressure.
- Right?

2171
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,649
- We got this.
- Right?

2172
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,289
- It was...
- When the coin soared,

2173
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:02,590
I thought time stopped.

2174
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,589
- My goodness.
- You can do it.

2175
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,930
I'll go for this spot.

2176
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,960
I'll aim for this spot.

2177
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,530
Don't make it too weak.

2178
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,629
- It shouldn't be weak.
- It shouldn't be too weak.

2179
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,070
If it's too weak, it won't do anything.

2180
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,339
- Since you two succeeded...
- Seriously.

2181
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,009
- My goodness.
- They're giving too much advice.

2182
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,369
- It shouldn't be weak.
- If it's too weak...

2183
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,439
It won't do anything if it's too weak.

2184
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,039
If we don't see it flipping,

2185
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,180
- Right. That shouldn't happen.
- it would be disappointing.

2186
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:26,549
- Gosh, I'm feeling the pressure.
- It shouldn't be like that.

2187
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,650
Of course it shouldn't.

2188
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,120
- You got this.
- I'll go.

2189
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,430
(Yeon Seok succeeded too!)

2190
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:43,259
(Finally, it's Sul's turn.)

2191
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:44,829
- It's Sul's turn.
- Sul.

2192
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:45,970
It's hard to breathe.

2193
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,000
- Gosh. I want to cry.
- About here. Hit here.

2194
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,500
- Let's go!
- Let's go for this spot.

2195
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,269
- Should I?
- Pick a nice spot.

2196
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,410
- Yes.
- Let's do this.

2197
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:55,710
It shouldn't be too weak.

2198
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,110
You can do it.

2199
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,550
- You can do it.
- Goodness.

2200
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,780
(It makes the people watching nervous too.)

2201
01:18:01,781 --> 01:18:02,850
You can do it.

2202
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:05,090
You can do it.

2203
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,960
(Failed)

2204
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,030
I'm sorry.

2205
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,289
(Laughing awkwardly)

2206
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,399
I'm sorry.

2207
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,460
- I could see the blue sticker.
- Right. I could see it.

2208
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:21,300
(They failed their seventh try.)

2209
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,139
It's too hard for Round Two.

2210
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,540
I think they chose the wrong game.

2211
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,769
It's the hardest for the fourth player.

2212
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:28,839
- Right.
- I know.

2213
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,009
We'll use the coupon.

2214
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:32,150
- Okay.
- Yes.

2215
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:34,050
- It's a free coupon.
- Now, we need to...

2216
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,119
switch 1 player among the 5.

2217
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,290
Please switch with me.

2218
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:42,189
- Why?
- I'm not confident in this.

2219
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:43,859
- Why? How can you do that?
- Hold on.

2220
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,259
- You can't do that.
- My goodness.

2221
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,090
- I was going to ask him that.
- You can't do that.

2222
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,760
- You can't do it like that.
- I mean...

2223
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,900
- He gets to choose the one.
- I'm so not confident.

2224
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,299
- Please pick one person.
- Goodness.

2225
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,399
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2226
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,070
- Since you insisted...
- Yes. All right.

2227
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,610
Come here.

2228
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,409
- You can practice first.
- Right.

2229
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,939
- This is too hard.
- My gosh.

2230
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,039
This is too tough.

2231
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,049
We have a master of drums here.

2232
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,950
(He's been playing drums since childhood.)

2233
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,979
I think we'll do it well.

2234
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,750
(We believe in your long experience.)

2235
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,390
- You can go first.
- All right.

2236
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,690
All right.

2237
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,020
You failed.

2238
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:19,629
You failed.

2239
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,600
(Chuckling)

2240
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,960
- I'm sorry.
- My goodness, sir.

2241
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,899
Having a lot of experience playing drums...

2242
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,840
- doesn't make you good at this.
- I guess not.

2243
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,439
He's been playing the drums for 60 years, but...

2244
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,940
- I thought it was a rehearsal.
- Right.

2245
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:34,980
How many tries do we have left now?

2246
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,839
We still have three tries left.

2247
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,180
- Okay.
- Let's try it again.

2248
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,749
- Okay.
- I hope he can wear that tie...

2249
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,850
- and stay at the hotel.
- Right.

2250
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,850
Let's make sure we do that for him.

2251
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,489
- Let's do this.
- Right.

2252
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,019
- This is our 8th try.
- Our 8th try.

2253
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,190
(Out of 10 tries, they're on their 8th try.)

2254
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,959
(Yeon Seok goes first.)

2255
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,030
You can do this!

2256
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,729
(He flipped the coin.)

2257
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,700
(Yeon Seok succeeded.)

2258
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,940
(Showing 100-percent pure joy)

2259
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,270
(They're only 50 percent happy.)

2260
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,539
- Let's go this way.
- That's a good idea.

2261
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,109
- We should go this way.
- Okay.

2262
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,310
- I'm the last one then.
- Okay. Let's go this way.

2263
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:12,709
- We can do this.
- Right.

2264
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:16,620
(The eighth try, Jae Suk)

2265
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,890
(Jae Suk succeeded!)

2266
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,830
You failed.

2267
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,560
Wasn't it a practice?

2268
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:32,569
(While everyone was happy,)

2269
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,330
(he suddenly takes his chance.)

2270
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,900
You failed.

2271
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,500
You failed.

2272
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,410
Wasn't it a practice?

2273
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,180
- We didn't say, "We'll go." Right?
- This is what happened.

2274
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,240
He tried it before all the eyes were on him.

2275
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:46,950
(Disappointed)

2276
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,250
Why did you...

2277
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,390
He wanted to do it before he got all the attention.

2278
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,619
I hoped I could make it...

2279
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,460
- and you would all cheer.
- That's what he wanted.

2280
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,859
(Min wanted to surprise everyone.)

2281
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,160
That wasn't helpful.

2282
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,389
- We only have two tries left.
- But this is...

2283
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,599
I know it's not our try,

2284
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,130
- but I just want to flip it once.
- Go ahead.

2285
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:05,169
You did it right away.

2286
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,270
- There you go.
- Gosh.

2287
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,100
- I just want to flip it once.
- Go ahead.

2288
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,070
You did it right away.

2289
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,309
- What?
- What is this?

2290
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:14,440
You never fail.

2291
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,240
My goodness.

2292
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,739
Do you want to go first right now?

2293
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,749
- Should I go first?
- Go ahead.

2294
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,710
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

2295
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,719
(It's their 9th try.)

2296
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,120
(They have to succeed now.)

2297
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,359
(He succeeded nicely.)

2298
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,000
My gosh.

2299
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,030
- I did it.
- Should we go this way?

2300
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,969
- Yeo Been.
- What do we do?

2301
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:39,999
This way? Hold on.

2302
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,670
- This way?
- My gosh.

2303
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,599
- Yeo Been?
- Should we go this way?

2304
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,939
- Yeo Been, you go next.
- Right.

2305
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,009
- Yeo Been, you go next.
- Right.

2306
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:47,810
(Yeo Been goes next.)

2307
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:53,310
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry.

2308
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:54,980
It's okay, Yeo Been.

2309
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,350
(They failed again on their 9th try.)

2310
01:21:57,351 --> 01:21:58,419
I'm sorry.

2311
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,619
It's okay, Yeo Been.

2312
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,690
Is this our last try now?

2313
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,460
Is this our last try now?

2314
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,589
(Glancing)

2315
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,730
My goodness.

2316
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,730
It's so easy when we're practicing.

2317
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,369
I think our success rate is almost 30 to 60 percent.

2318
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:15,300
It's as if I'm controlling it with the remote control.

2319
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,139
- We're relaxed when we practice.
- I know.

2320
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,139
- I know.
- Since this is our last try,

2321
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:24,139
would you decide the order, sir?

2322
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,249
- Since this is our last try.
- Right.

2323
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,479
- Please make a strategy.
- Right.

2324
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,549
- How are we going to do this?
- We'll follow your plan.

2325
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:29,679
This is our last try, so we really want to make it.

2326
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,419
You should go this way. One, two, and three.

2327
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,719
- So this way?
- Right.

2328
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,789
- Like before?
- Right.

2329
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,390
- One, two, three, four, and five.
- Okay.

2330
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,629
- We can do this. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2331
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:39,730
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2332
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,859
This is our last try.

2333
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,860
(Today's last try)

2334
01:22:42,861 --> 01:22:44,960
I didn't expect I would risk my life for this.

2335
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:47,570
I'm not watching it.

2336
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:49,839
- I didn't expect...
- I must do this.

2337
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,000
I need to do this.

2338
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,239
I need to do this.

2339
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,739
(I need to succeed this time.)

2340
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,540
He should go to Yangyang. He's going to Yangyang.

2341
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:03,180
(The tie and the hotel voucher in Yangyang lie upon the coin.)

2342
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,720
I'm not watching it.

2343
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:08,120
Gosh.

2344
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:14,890
(He flipped it!)

2345
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,499
Gosh, this is...

2346
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,599
I did it!

2347
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,000
I feel glad at first, and then I suddenly feel nervous.

2348
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,110
If we were going to fail this try,

2349
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,080
I would like you to fail, Jae Suk.

2350
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,140
I would like you to fail, Jae Suk.

2351
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,710
(Tearful friendship)

2352
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,050
You must succeed no matter what.

2353
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,149
Gosh.

2354
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,419
(He's the second player in their last try.)

2355
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,890
My goodness.

2356
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:48,030
I would like you to fail, Jae Suk.

2357
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,200
(Jae Suk succeeded.)

2358
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,710
- He wished you to fail.
- Gosh, look at him.

2359
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,309
Koong Min.

2360
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,310
(It's Koong Min's turn again.)

2361
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:07,750
It's your turn.

2362
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,320
- You go next.
- He turned red.

2363
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:13,290
- My goodness.
- It's your turn.

2364
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,890
- You can do it!
- I'm a mess.

2365
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:17,790
I'm a mess. Leave me alone.

2366
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,460
I'm so worked up now.

2367
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:20,690
- Please.
- Please.

2368
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,600
I'm so worked up now.

2369
01:24:22,653 --> 01:24:23,913
- Please.
- Please.

2370
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:25,965
I think he got this.

2371
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:27,900
Please. Be confident.

2372
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,639
I think he got this.

2373
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,180
(He hit it!)

2374
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:44,649
You failed.

2375
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,390
(They failed eventually.)

2376
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,389
You failed.

2377
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,090
(The end)

2378
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,430
I'm so sorry.

2379
01:25:00,206 --> 01:25:01,379
Seriously. This is...

2380
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,840
(They take the tie back quickly.)

2381
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,169
They took it right away.

2382
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,340
Seriously. This is...

2383
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,310
- Gosh. I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry.

2384
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,149
(Teary eyes)

2385
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:14,380
- It was too tough.
- Gosh, this is...

2386
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,149
I thought Round Two would be easy...

2387
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,350
because we succeeded in Round One quicker than we thought.

2388
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,789
- Right.
- Gosh.

2389
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,129
Gosh, thank you.

2390
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:27,190
(The souvenir for failing gets handed.)

2391
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,459
He's changing it himself.

2392
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,600
- Gosh.
- It was hard.

2393
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,530
(Whenever Possible)

2394
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,969
Thank you.

2395
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,239
We couldn't make it happen.

2396
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,940
Is this what this show is about?

2397
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,369
- It's over anyway.
- Gosh.

2398
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,410
I really came with a good heart.

2399
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,609
- It really feels terrible.
- It's okay.

2400
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:48,849
(Variety shows these days leave a bitter taste in your mouth.)

2401
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:51,150
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

2402
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:54,150
This is what it's like when we fail.

2403
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,059
These three came...

2404
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,959
- thanks to "Our Movie."
- Right.

2405
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,460
Forget about "Our Movie."

2406
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,659
This was the most humiliating moment...

2407
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,470
in my last five years of my life.

2408
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,170
- I just feel very sorry.
- Right.

2409
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,799
- Well, right.
- Gosh.

2410
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,609
I have nothing else to say. I'm sorry.

2411
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:13,640
(A packed day with the movie-like "Our Movie" team)

2412
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,410
(Whenever Possible has come to Cheorwon!)

2413
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,422
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2414
01:26:19,649 --> 01:26:21,448
It looks great to see them wearing that.

2415
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:23,719
(Salute!)

2416
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,720
(Laughing)

2417
01:26:25,226 --> 01:26:27,256
(I'm joining the army in the second half of the year!)

2418
01:26:27,774 --> 01:26:29,544
(A slightly coincidental encounter with Cheorwon)

2419
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:31,809
(I thought this place was chosen on purpose.)

2420
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:33,479
(I came at an exceptional time.)

2421
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:34,979
(You have to do well with shooting.)

2422
01:26:35,109 --> 01:26:36,949
(Like this?)

2423
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:42,418
(All of his shots hit the target!)

2424
01:26:42,419 --> 01:26:44,349
(HOSHI has found an unexpected talent,)

2425
01:26:44,619 --> 01:26:46,159
(and the passionate boy gets too absorbed.)

2426
01:26:46,489 --> 01:26:47,988
(Cheering is done with discipline.)

2427
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:49,088
(Getting charged with energy)

2428
01:26:49,089 --> 01:26:50,789
(I'll show you.)

2429
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,112
(I'll get a clean shot!)

2430
01:26:52,857 --> 01:26:54,457
(Gosh, MINGYU!)

2431
01:26:54,778 --> 01:26:56,888
(- Was that your shot? - Yes.)

2432
01:26:57,318 --> 01:27:00,518
(They feel somewhat lacking,)

2433
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,257
(but they are full of desperation...)

2434
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:04,358
(and passion.)

2435
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:07,828
(A day full of energy in Cheorwon)

2436
01:27:07,898 --> 01:27:09,797
It feels like I'm here on a trip with you guys.

2437
01:27:09,798 --> 01:27:11,898
(Whenever Possible Season 3)
