1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,640
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,710
- Gosh, the weather is great today. - Oh, my.

3
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:11,822
It's neither hot nor cold.

4
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:14,436
I wish the weather would stay this way.

5
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:16,277
- Right? - Yes.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,889
- I want it to stay like this. - The weather is perfect now.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,689
- This is the perfect weather. - Yes, it's nice and sunny too.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,430
- This is the perfect spring day. - Yes.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,032
- Hello. - Hello.

10
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,373
- I've never been here before. - Right?

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,300
A lot of our colleagues...

12
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,113
live around here, right?

13
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,878
- Right. We're in Geumho-dong. - Yes.

14
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,377
- Geumho-dong. Yaksu-dong. - A lot of celebrities live here.

15
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:38,679
I briefly heard about today's Whenever Friends.

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,249
- I didn't. - You didn't?

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,759
How come only you got to hear about them?

18
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:43,554
- I found out when I got here. - I see.

19
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,582
- I have no idea who they are. - Right.

20
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:47,147
Idol stars are joining us today.

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,290
- Idol stars? - Right?

22
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,659
- Really? - They live nearby.

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,659
- They live nearby? - Yes, they live nearby.

24
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,290
- Who lives around here? - Here's the thing about idol stars.

25
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,500
If my intel about today's guests is indeed true,

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,400
I can definitely interact with them without a problem.

27
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,299
- I've crossed paths with them. - You have?

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,140
- So I can interact with them. - Yes.

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,309
But as for the idol stars who are just starting out,

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,310
to be honest, I don't feel completely comfortable.

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,809
- I'm sure the feelings are mutual. - Both parties feel the same way?

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,110
Yes. It would be a bit awkward between us.

33
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,316
You know what? Now, they're considered...

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,819
- senior idol stars. - Really?

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,589
- Right. - Then I feel a bit relieved.

36
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,599
It's been a decade...

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,459
- since their debut, right? - Really?

38
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:26,572
- Yes. - Right?

39
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,460
Gosh, it's already been a decade?

40
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:30,659
Why won't you tell me?

41
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,929
- Spending a decade... - I don't know how to react to that.

42
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,900
Can't you guess after hearing that they made their debut a decade ago?

43
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,964
An idol group that made a debut a decade ago...

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,151
There are several groups, right?

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,740
- They are... - Is it SEVENTEEN?

46
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:43,726
They did make a debut around the same time, I guess.

47
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:44,960
Who are they?

48
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,050
I can smell the grass.

49
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,850
- The weather is amazing. - Gosh.

50
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,879
- Spring is really here. - Yes.

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,850
I haven't been out around this time of the day in a while.

52
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,419
- Yes. - All right. So...

53
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,619
- They're here. - They are here?

54
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,189
- My goodness. - Hello.

55
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,829
- Hello. - I see.

56
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,999
- Do we go this way? - My gosh.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,529
- Do we take this path? - Come this way.

58
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,559
- This way? - It's TWICE?

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,249
- Come this way. - It's TWICE?

60
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,860
- Yes, it's TWICE. - My gosh.

61
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,299
(Today's Whenever Friends: Jihyo and Sana of TWICE)

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,440
- Jihyo is joining us today. - I see.

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,280
(The leader of TWICE, the national girl group)

64
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,280
(The powerful main vocalist, Jihyo)

65
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,680
(Everyone's heard of this highlight at least once.)

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
(Shy shy shy)

67
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,680
(The Highlight Fairy of TWICE, Sana)

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,719
(Today's spare time will be spent...)

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
(with Sana and Jihyo of TWICE.)

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,960
(Rushing)

71
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,289
- Hello. - How long has it been?

72
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,290
- Hello. - Hello.

73
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,589
- It's been so long, Jihyo. - Right.

74
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,029
- It's been so long, Sana. - Nice to meet you.

75
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,859
- Right? Hello. - I haven't seen Sana for so long.

76
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,976
- Hello. - Right.

77
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,766
Hold on. Jihyo and I met recently.

78
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,161
I ran into you whenever I went to a concert.

79
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,409
- You go to a lot of concerts. - My gosh.

80
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,269
Lately, I've been attending...

81
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,979
- many concerts all of a sudden. - Right.

82
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,609
- I saw her at a concert. - Yes.

83
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,249
- At another idol group's concert. - Yes.

84
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,220
Since I've been to many concerts lately, I ran into Jihyo.

85
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,479
But I haven't seen you for so long, Sana.

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,879
Right. Have you been well?

87
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,290
When was the last time we met? I think it was three years ago.

88
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,420
I think so. But I've always been watching on TV.

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,729
- Have you met Yeon Seok? - We've never met before.

90
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,776
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - I knew it.

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,266
- But... - We've met before.

92
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:14,616
- Where did you see him? - Gosh.

93
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,369
- Where did you see him? - Where?

94
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,012
- A birthday party a long time ago. - What?

95
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,995
- I see. - Whose birthday party was it?

96
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,016
It was Seul Ong's.

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,509
- I see. - I see.

98
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,539
It was at his birthday party.

99
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,309
- You met at his birthday party. - We met briefly. Yes.

100
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,980
Jihyo, you've been keeping busy.

101
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,479
I like to go out.

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,649
- She's a social butterfly. - Yes.

103
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Right. Jihyo is definitely a social butterfly.

104
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,389
When I attend gatherings or meetings,

105
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,190
she's always there.

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,059
For today's episode of our show, Jihyo and Sana...

107
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,829
- will join us. - I see.

108
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,359
(They will be visiting every nook and corner.)

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,159
TWICE made their debut ten years ago?

110
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,299
- Yes. - Gosh.

111
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,200
- You know what? Time... - It flies, doesn't it?

112
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,570
- Ten years... - My gosh.

113
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,670
- How long has it been for you? - I want it to be a secret now.

114
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,969
Now that we're in the double-digits, I'd rather not say.

115
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,809
- Jihyo said, "It flies." - Let's say it's been nine years.

116
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,209
(A genuine comment from the bottom of her heart)

117
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,739
- My gosh. - Time does fly.

118
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,749
- Gosh. - Right.

119
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,979
But this is impressive.

120
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,049
Of course.

121
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,849
It's tough to survive in this entertainment industry.

122
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,549
- They performed for 10 years. - Lasting 10 years...

123
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,720
as a group is a huge feat.

124
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,519
You guys are still active, right?

125
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,089
We didn't have a break for the past ten years.

126
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,090
- Right. - Really?

127
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,289
- We're always doing something. - Right.

128
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,029
They went to the US and packed that huge stadium...

129
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,969
- with their fans. - Yes.

130
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,369
Coldplay recently came to Korea on their concert tour.

131
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,870
We opened for them. We performed at their concert.

132
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,269
("TWICE, the First Girl Group to Fill SoFi Stadium")

133
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,510
("TWICE Continues to Break Records with Their Sold-out Shows")

134
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,510
(Every concert of this global group was sold out.)

135
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,079
I really wanted to go to their concert.

136
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,119
- Really? - Yes. I couldn't get the tickets.

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,689
- I did hear it was hard to get. - Yes.

138
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,190
- It was hard even for us. - Yes.

139
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,659
Jihyo, you've been living in this area for a long time, right?

140
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,320
- Yes. That's right. - Is this your hometown?

141
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,590
- No, it's not. - Okay.

142
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,829
I've been living here for over four years.

143
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,359
- Four years? - Yes.

144
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,699
Then that makes this her second hometown.

145
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,799
- Of course. - Yes.

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,970
Let's get going now.

147
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,599
- We need to go. - All right.

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
- Let me introduce... - Okay.

149
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,069
- the Whenever Guest. - My gosh.

150
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,870
- The weather is amazing here. - Gosh.

151
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,610
- Their reaction was generous. - The sky is so clear.

152
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,739
- It's like watching that thing. - Like what?

153
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,309
- A magic trick? - A magic trick?

154
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,309
- Yes. - It had a lot of slots.

155
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,719
- But only a few of them are filled. - This is...

156
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,019
our third episode for this season.

157
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,149
- I see. - Yes.

158
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,449
We'll fill up the slots pretty soon.

159
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,890
- We will. - Yes.

160
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,919
All right. The first Whenever Guest is Choi Min Woo.

161
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,989
- What's the address? - Okay.

162
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,389
"I resigned from my office job, which gave me no spare time."

163
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,429
"I'm a rookie who began a new adventure..."

164
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,760
"in the alley of Geumho-dong."

165
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,029
"I'm a bit concerned that I have too much free time."

166
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,769
"But I'm happy that I get to spend..."

167
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,299
- "more time with my child." - Yes.

168
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,209
"Would you like to have a cup of coffee at my place..."

169
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,409
"where I have a lot of spare time?"

170
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,216
- Sounds good. - I guess it's a cafe.

171
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,979
- Could it be a cafe? - Yes, he mentioned...

172
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,009
- coffee. - That must be it.

173
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,209
- But he said, "My place." - "My place."

174
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,279
Could it be his house?

175
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,449
"A cup of coffee."

176
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,319
A cafe with a homey theme?

177
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,779
- Homey... - So...

178
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,149
that's what you want it to be, right?

179
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,819
Yes. I want to drink some coffee.

180
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,520
- I see. Coffee for the morning? - Yes.

181
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,829
Do you have coffee...

182
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,959
- when you wake up? - Yes, immediately.

183
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
- She drinks it from a tall tumbler. - But...

184
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,959
- From a tumbler? - Really?

185
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,370
- So you drink coffee nonstop? - Yes, like it's water.

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,199
- What about you, Sana? - It depends. If my face is puffy,

187
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,470
I have a cup of coffee.

188
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,439
- She sounds relaxed. - If your face is puffy?

189
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,570
- Yes. - I see.

190
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,609
He said he had a child. Is it a kids' cafe?

191
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,050
That could be it!

192
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,350
Hold on.

193
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,379
"Dokseodang-ro."

194
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,180
Oh, my. The wallet is custom-made!

195
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,720
Would you like to take a look? It's for the show.

196
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,159
- That's right. - I see.

197
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,919
- Do you want one? - It looks nice.

198
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,429
The more you use it, the more vintage it'll look, right?

199
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,260
- Right. It's our third season. - With some scratches and so on.

200
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,829
Sana, where's your hometown?

201
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,240
- It's Osaka. - It's Osaka.

202
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,770
- Do you know a lot about Osaka? - No, I don't.

203
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,009
(Giggling)

204
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,740
I don't know much about Osaka.

205
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,472
- It will take 20 minutes on foot. - So...

206
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,979
- We should walk. - My gosh.

207
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,049
- It's iffy to grab a cab here. - That's right.

208
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,519
- Sounds great. - So we're leaving like this?

209
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,879
- Yes, we are. - This is it.

210
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,420
Gosh, the sky is so clear today.

211
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,490
- This way? - It looks like a path to a wedding.

212
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:03,666
This path...

213
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,429
- It's a bit confusing. - Yes.

214
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,800
- A new... - There's a hammock in the park.

215
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,170
- Do you want to take a break? - What?

216
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,180
There's a hammock in the park.

217
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,480
- We have to go down from there. - Okay.

218
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,250
My gosh. The flowers look lovely.

219
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,380
- Yes. - Royal azaleas.

220
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:23,878
Royal azaleas.

221
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,576
(Glancing)

222
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,571
I guess for Jihyo and Sana,

223
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:32,532
flowers aren't that interesting yet.

224
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:33,905
- Flowers? - Right?

225
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,189
- Yes. - Do you not like flowers?

226
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,759
- I like flowers. - I like flowers.

227
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
I mean, yes, but...

228
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:38,925
I'm just not a fan of royal azaleas.

229
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,769
Do you have a bad memory...

230
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,770
- of royal azaleas? - No.

231
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,739
It's just that I see them so often.

232
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
(It's just a matter of preference.)

233
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,420
Do you grow plants at home?

234
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:48,583
Yes.

235
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,210
- You don't, right? - I do.

236
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:51,265
- Really? - Yes.

237
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,710
How many plants do you grow?

238
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,509
I have about six at home.

239
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,680
- That's a lot. - Yes.

240
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
Are you a plant butler?

241
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,119
I'm an aspiring one.

242
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
(She's just an aspiring plant butler.)

243
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,149
I want to be one,

244
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,850
but they all seem to die whenever I grow them.

245
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,990
But I'm trying my best.

246
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,790
The thing about growing plants is,

247
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,429
- you must ventilate the house. - Right.

248
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,799
- It requires a lot of hard work. - Right.

249
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,329
- You must place it in the sunlight. - Right.

250
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,999
- You must water it regularly. - Yes.

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,269
That's a lot of work.

252
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,299
(Staring)

253
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,240
They look like perilla leaves. Wait, they are.

254
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,839
- No way. - No?

255
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,079
They only look like perilla leaves.

256
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,379
- They might be perilla leaves. - They are, Jae Suk.

257
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,279
- No way. Check the scent. - They are perilla leaves.

258
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,810
- No. - No?

259
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,649
- They look like perilla leaves. - Gosh, there's no way.

260
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,620
If so, they wouldn't be here. People would've taken them all.

261
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,220
They look exactly like perilla leaves.

262
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,860
Do you usually eat breakfast?

263
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,589
I usually have breakfast.

264
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,989
Koreans get energy from rice, as you know.

265
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,830
- I munched on some gimbap. - You had gimbap?

266
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,559
- So... - You munched on them?

267
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,899
(An interesting word choice for an idol star of 10 years)

268
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,929
- Let me explain. It wasn't... - So you ate gimbap.

269
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,539
- to her liking completely. - Right.

270
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,069
But she ate it because she was hungry.

271
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,040
- You're spot on. - So you just had a few pieces.

272
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,479
We can just keep going this way?

273
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Yes.

274
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,080
Do you have a good sense of direction?

275
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,910
- Yes. I go by Navi Yoo. - I see.

276
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,549
I'm pretty good at figuring out the locations.

277
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,290
- Even when we didn't have a GPS... - By the way, if we go this way,

278
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,819
we'll reach the road.

279
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,989
(He interrupts whenever he gets the chance.)

280
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,320
- But we must go this way. - My gosh.

281
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,629
- Right? - Yes.

282
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,630
- We must go this way. - Ma'am.

283
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,090
- We must get to the bottom first. - Look at them.

284
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,529
- The kids are going somewhere. - This way...

285
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,499
- Do we go to the right? - Hello.

286
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,130
Okay. Stay safe.

287
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,639
- My gosh. - It's Yoo Jae Suk!

288
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,739
- Yes. - Hello.

289
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,140
- My gosh. Hello, kids. - It's Yoo Jae Suk.

290
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,239
Yes.

291
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,479
(The kids are super excited.)

292
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,579
- Kids. - They're...

293
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,180
Be careful.

294
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,519
Kids. Right now...

295
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,749
(Covering their mouths)

296
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,020
- They're cute. - These days,

297
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,549
- the weather is great. - They're going on picnics.

298
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,190
- Right. Exactly. - Yes. It's the picnic season.

299
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,019
- We rarely get good weather... - Wait.

300
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,089
- during the year. - Right.

301
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
(Rushing)

302
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,229
- What is it? - We can go down this way.

303
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,599
- Really? - Yes. We'll come to a road...

304
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,160
if we go down that way. So let's go this way.

305
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,500
Do you have dogs or cats?

306
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,069
My family has a cat.

307
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,810
- Your family? - Yes.

308
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,139
Sana, you give off this vibe that...

309
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,439
you might have a cat too.

310
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,909
There was a phase where I wanted to raise a cat.

311
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,419
- But you couldn't? - When I went to see some cats,

312
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,019
they punched me with their paws right away.

313
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,289
- They punched you? - I got scared.

314
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,590
- They punched you with their paws? - Yes.

315
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,989
I approached them, saying, "How cute."

316
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,660
- Then they punched me. - Right away?

317
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,559
- I got punched right away. - Wait. This isn't the path.

318
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,660
- This isn't the path? - Wait, no.

319
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,569
- Which way is it? - Is it this way?

320
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,730
Can I take a look?

321
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,469
Wait. Over there...

322
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,939
(Getting help from a local)

323
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,269
- You can take a look. - No. I was right. It's this way.

324
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,669
- It's this way? - Yes, it's this way.

325
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,109
- Is this the right way? - Yes, it is.

326
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,009
- Right. Yes, this is the right way. - The street here...

327
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,079
(Keeping an eye on the map)

328
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,609
It's difficult to navigate here because...

329
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,150
- This is the right way. - roads split into multiple paths.

330
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,220
The direction confused me a bit because we came down from the hill.

331
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,390
Your shoelace...

332
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,820
- Did it come undone? Or is it mine? - Yes.

333
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,420
- I can't do it for you. - I'll do it fast.

334
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,389
Maybe, we can do it together.

335
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,459
- But... - I can hold you.

336
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,199
- His core is crazy. - His core must be so strong.

337
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,430
I'm good.

338
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,630
I can hold the pose with my core.

339
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,739
- I can pull this off. - His core muscles are so good.

340
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,469
I bet you're good at one-legged chicken fights.

341
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,939
- What game? - The one-legged chicken fight.

342
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
The chicken fight?

343
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,779
- He's not good at physical games. - Well...

344
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,810
(She thinks of a compliment and settles on the chicken fight.)

345
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,510
I didn't know you'd mention that after discussing my core muscles.

346
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,380
(One can never predict what Sana will say next.)

347
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,349
By the way, is it because it's the morning?

348
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,549
(The street is especially empty now.)

349
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,690
- I don't see anyone on the street. - Should we cross here?

350
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,089
(Realizing something)

351
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,560
- I figured it out. - What is it?

352
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,860
The street is quite empty because today falls between two holidays.

353
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,059
(The days before and after the shoot were holidays.)

354
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,659
I thought you meant you figured out who the Whenever Guest was.

355
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,599
- Today falls between two holidays. - Right.

356
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,969
- The long weekend began. - A lot of people went on trips.

357
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,899
My gosh. The TV ratings for this week...

358
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,000
are doomed.

359
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,909
Gosh, the variety shows... Right.

360
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,810
Entertainers will be struggling. Oh, no.

361
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,450
- This is bad. - Right.

362
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,825
- Are we going the right way? - Yes.

363
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,049
(They've been walking and chatting for 15 minutes.)

364
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,179
- Wait. - You know what?

365
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,790
- We have to go around. - I wanted to buy a drink...

366
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,765
if we saw a cafe on the way. But there are no cafes here.

367
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,359
- We have to go this way. - There's one in the alley.

368
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,629
- Which alley? - In that alley.

369
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,730
- There is? - Yes.

370
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,099
You know this area well, don't you?

371
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,799
I now know where we are.

372
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,072
- Okay. - There's a regular spot I go to.

373
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:09,999
- Really? - Yes.

374
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:11,739
- Where is it? - It's over there.

375
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a restaurant.

376
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,970
Yes, it's over there. The restaurant is quite close.

377
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,880
Have you tried spicy pork simmered stew?

378
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,880
- That sounds tasty. - It's very tasty.

379
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,549
- Spicy pork simmered stew? - Yes.

380
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,825
- That's another good restaurant. - What do they serve?

381
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,820
It's great if you like pasta.

382
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,619
- That's a good place. - How interesting.

383
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
(Good Restaurant 2: Pasta and salad)

384
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,319
I frequent this street a lot.

385
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,459
- Really? - Yes.

386
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,789
- What do you usually do here? - What's this?

387
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,889
One of my favorite cafes is on this street.

388
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,730
- There's a cafe? - I come here to eat too.

389
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,829
- Really? - Yes.

390
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,400
Could we be going to one of your regular coffee spots?

391
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,729
Right.

392
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,829
(They might be heading to her regular spot.)

393
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,869
You might not think there are a lot of businesses here.

394
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,100
- But there are. - Right.

395
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:49,716
- We're almost there. - Are we almost there?

396
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,609
- What? - I think it really might be a cafe.

397
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,526
Is it a cafe?

398
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,679
- But he said he had a child. - Wait. It's this way.

399
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,179
- Is this the place? - What? Is this it?

400
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,519
(But I'm happy that I get to spend more time with my child.)

401
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,550
- Where is it? - Wait.

402
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,950
(They did spot a cafe.)

403
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:02,289
- Hold on. Is it on the first floor? - Wait. I see a child.

404
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,749
- There is a child. - How cute.

405
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,489
- I think this is the place. - Hello.

406
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,720
It should be 22-1.

407
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,789
- How cute. - How cute.

408
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,359
- Jihyo was right. - His name is Choi Min Woo.

409
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,799
- It's a cafe. - It is.

410
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,129
- Hello. - Hello.

411
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,370
My gosh, we were right. The child...

412
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,799
- Say hello. - Hello.

413
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,239
- Say hello. - Hi.

414
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,739
(Shy)

415
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,809
- Wait. - Hello.

416
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,810
- Hello. - Hello.

417
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,139
- Are you the one? - Is he Choi Min Woo?

418
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,680
- Yes, it's me. - I see. This is the place.

419
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,010
Jihyo actually said she wanted some egg tarts.

420
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,579
- Hello. - That looks so good. Hello.

421
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,019
- Hello. - Hello.

422
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,150
(Shrieking)

423
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,759
- How cute. - Hello.

424
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,260
- So cute. - What a cutie.

425
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,429
- Hello. - Hi.

426
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,729
- What's her name? - It's Choi Ro Yun.

427
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,960
- Ro Yun? - Yes.

428
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,959
- My gosh, Ro Yun. - Say hello, Ro Yun.

429
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,969
(Choi Ro Yun, Usually glued to her dad)

430
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,029
- Ro Yun, look. - So cute.

431
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,700
- How is she this cute? - Ro Yun, do you know them?

432
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,339
- We're like strangers to her. - Are you shy?

433
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,970
- She's shy around strangers. - You're shy.

434
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,110
No?

435
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,009
- Sir. This place... - It's not just a regular cafe.

436
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,210
It's a cafe.

437
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,950
Yes. It's a cafe and a multi-brand clothing store.

438
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,720
- A cafe and a clothing store. - Yes.

439
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,419
You know what? Running a place like this...

440
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,959
I'm not saying this because you're on our show.

441
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,429
Isn't this everyone's dream?

442
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,960
- Right. - Totally.

443
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,930
- He's very stylish. - Dad.

444
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,270
- He's trendy. - Yes, he's fine. He's right here.

445
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,739
- So cute. - Gosh, it's the cutest age.

446
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,670
- Gosh, so cute. - Please sit here.

447
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,580
Gosh, the space is tight here.

448
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,749
No.

449
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,709
- My sister is at home. - There are just a lot of us here.

450
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,949
- What? - My sister is at home.

451
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,079
Your sister is at home?

452
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,189
- Yes. - You have a sister?

453
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,020
- Yes. - Her cousin came over today.

454
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,619
- Do you want more chocolate? - She's so cute.

455
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,660
Okay.

456
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,459
Give me the chocolate.

457
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,259
- Chocolate? - Stay next to her. I'll get some.

458
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,929
He meant it when he wrote...

459
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,900
- we could have a cup of coffee. - Yes.

460
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,229
Gosh, Ro Yun.

461
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,400
- So cute. - She's glued to her dad.

462
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,670
How old are you, Ro Yun?

463
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,970
- Five? - Four.

464
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,580
- She's so cute. - Are you four years old?

465
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,179
You're wearing a cute jacket too.

466
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,150
- Right. That's a cute outfit. - My gosh.

467
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,320
You take one look at Min Woo...

468
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,720
- and know he's stylish. - Yes.

469
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,720
- So Ro Yun looks stylish too. - Yes.

470
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,659
How long have you been running your business?

471
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,759
It's been one and a half years now.

472
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,229
You wrote that you resigned from your office job.

473
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,059
What made you suddenly decide...

474
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,299
to start this business?

475
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,999
I worked for a company for 12 years.

476
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,139
You worked there for a long time.

477
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,069
- I worked for a fashion company. - That explains it.

478
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,540
So I was an office worker.

479
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,509
But that's the thing with working for a company.

480
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,739
- Your life centers around work. - Of course.

481
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,209
But after becoming a father and so on,

482
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,719
I wanted to do something...

483
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,380
I was passionate about for my family and myself.

484
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,589
That's when I decided to start this business.

485
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,959
- So... - To spend more time with her?

486
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,019
Yes. That's right.

487
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,060
(Ro Yun was the reason behind all of his decisions.)

488
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,089
But this will be great for your daughter.

489
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,000
- When you worked for... Yes. - They can spend time together.

490
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
When he had an office job,

491
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,369
- he couldn't. So this is better. - Right.

492
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,169
How's the business going these days? How are your sales?

493
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,510
It's enough to keep the place open.

494
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,380
Many of the residents here come to have coffee.

495
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,549
So that's about it. Yes.

496
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,550
- That's about it? - That's it.

497
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,879
It's not doing great, but it isn't bad. It's right in the middle.

498
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,219
It's just enough for him to maintain the business.

499
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,359
- Right. - Yes. That's it.

500
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,189
- This area is considered quiet. - Yes.

501
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,989
But if more residents come to your establishment...

502
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,789
- Right. - She's right here.

503
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,259
- Jihyo is a resident here. - Yes.

504
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,099
- I heard you lived in Geumho-dong. - Yes.

505
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,730
I was wondering when you'd come to my place.

506
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,099
- I guess today is the day. - Today...

507
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,569
She frequents many places nearby, but not here.

508
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,740
No, it's my first time here.

509
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,309
- I see. - You can start coming more often.

510
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,740
- Yes. - Right.

511
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,009
- Since this is also a cafe... - Yes?

512
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,009
- What kind of drinks do you have? - Would you like a drink?

513
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,010
- Yes. - Yes.

514
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:52,949
- Sounds good. - I have coffee on the menu.

515
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,019
- Gosh. Look at you. - How cute.

516
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,320
- She goes wherever he goes. - Yes.

517
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,659
So adorable.

518
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,560
- Come here, Ro Yun. - Four-year-olds are that tiny.

519
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,559
- The menu is in English. - Let's check out the menu.

520
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,260
- We can read the menu in English. - Okay.

521
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,930
- Come on. - Okay.

522
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,099
- Come on. - Let me know if you need help.

523
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,969
We can read coffee menus in English.

524
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,439
- "Espresso." - Okay. Just in case you couldn't.

525
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,469
(The rookie business owner is overly careful.)

526
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,739
- There's a chocolate latte too. - Yes, I can serve that too.

527
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,279
You can drink an ade if you want something simple.

528
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,850
I see. I can read all of the English words here.

529
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,549
For me, a chocolate latte sounds good.

530
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,149
- I want an egg tart. - Do you want it iced?

531
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,189
- We'd like some egg tarts too. - Yes, egg tarts.

532
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,389
- I'd like an IC. - "IC?"

533
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,289
- Iced chocolate. - I see. Iced chocolate.

534
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,559
You failed to understand that?

535
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,189
(Egg tarts, 2 iced chocolate lattes)

536
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,259
- I'll take the signature drink. - Gosh.

537
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,399
- The buttercream latte. - Yes, that's the most popular one.

538
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,900
- Then I'll take... - Gosh, what's a buttercream latte?

539
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,269
Matcha espresso latte.

540
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,340
- Yes. - That sounds tasty.

541
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,569
- I'll have your drinks ready soon. - Okay.

542
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,609
- I'll be back. - Okay.

543
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,110
- You're going with him, aren't you? - Make yourselves at home.

544
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,080
You're going with him, aren't you? Okay, go on.

545
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
Help him prepare the drinks.

546
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,349
- She's cute. - Help him prepare the drinks.

547
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,549
- She's so cute. - He suddenly left to make coffee...

548
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,880
during our conversation.

549
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,889
- He's really the owner. - Yes.

550
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,120
He's really the owner.

551
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,689
I have a coffee machine at home.

552
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,530
And I love the way I look when I'm making coffee.

553
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,729
Do you know the feeling?

554
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,060
- You love it? - Do you know the feeling?

555
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,329
I feel cool...

556
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,170
- and like an adult. - I often get that feeling.

557
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,470
I often get that feeling,

558
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,070
especially when I'm making drip coffee.

559
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,639
"I feel pretty awesome about myself."

560
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,839
(A narcissistic moment for adults)

561
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,910
- Yes. - That's right.

562
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,509
That's right.

563
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,780
(While they are enjoying their conversation,)

564
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,950
(he is nervous while preparing the drinks.)

565
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,320
(And next to him...)

566
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,420
(Peek-a-boo)

567
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,119
(Ro Yun isn't here.)

568
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,620
(Peeking out)

569
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,889
We only saw him for a short while, but when I saw Min Woo's face,

570
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,930
he seemed to be doing okay so far.

571
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,699
- It's only been a year. - That's right.

572
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,669
And he also worked for a company before this.

573
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,140
- You debuted ten years ago. - How does that feel?

574
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,640
(Sighing)

575
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,680
- You two had similar reactions. - You know what?

576
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:03,209
Jihyo and Sana used to answer...

577
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,619
- positively right away. - That's right.

578
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,849
- "Yes." - That's right.

579
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,950
"We're still okay." But just now...

580
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,989
(Their reactions have become more thoughtful.)

581
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,290
- You sound relaxed. - Yes, you do.

582
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,559
Time flew by.

583
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,690
- Right? - Yes.

584
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,229
After a decade,

585
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,829
I now think about...

586
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,400
how I should spend the next decade.

587
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,469
It would be nice if we could continue performing for a long time.

588
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,039
But you never know with this kind of job.

589
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,170
- No. - We don't know what will happen.

590
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,980
So... I might end up opening my own cafe.

591
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,440
I don't know.

592
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,710
- That's right. - Suddenly...

593
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,350
You're right when you said, "I don't know."

594
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,089
She might suddenly open a cafe across the street.

595
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,360
We don't know what will happen to us next.

596
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,820
So there is no need to make too many plans.

597
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,590
We just have to do our best.

598
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,130
What is your MBTI, Jihyo?

599
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,929
I'm an ESTP.

600
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,160
ESTP?

601
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,629
- What about you, Sana? - What is yours, Sana?

602
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,799
I'm an ENFP.

603
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,070
- ENFP? - Yes.

604
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,239
- You're an ENFP. - They are very sociable.

605
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,939
She's totally a social butterfly.

606
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,979
- Really? - Yes.

607
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,779
Earlier when a staff member was adjusting her microphone,

608
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,449
she said, "We're wearing matching pants..."

609
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,850
as soon as she saw her.

610
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,180
(This morning...)

611
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,150
The color of our pants matches.

612
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,519
(Laughing)

613
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,889
- How did you hurt your leg? - I fell down.

614
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,989
Oh, no. It must've been a big fall.

615
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,530
- Yes. - My gosh.

616
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,499
As soon as she saw her.

617
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
(The invincible ENFP?)

618
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,170
- I thought they knew each other. - I'm surprised.

619
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,899
Do you easily make friends?

620
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,169
- Yes, I do. - Right?

621
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,240
Yes.

622
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,080
But sometimes, my energy gets drained.

623
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,610
- Your energy? - Yes.

624
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,120
(She puts her guard up.)

625
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,489
(Tapping the sofa)

626
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,990
(Turning around)

627
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,419
I told Ro Yun to come here.

628
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,630
And she gave me a look.

629
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,490
What was that?

630
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,959
She left.

631
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,870
You don't have to feel flustered when kids do that.

632
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,170
If you continue showing interest,

633
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,400
- they come to you. - Eventually.

634
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,069
- Yes. - That's how you do it?

635
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,040
Yes, be consistent. That's how you do it.

636
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,269
- Consistently show interest. - But she seems to be...

637
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,880
- glued at the hip to her father. - That's right.

638
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,579
I smell something nice.

639
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,110
- I can already smell it. - Yes.

640
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,850
We ordered too much of a variety, right?

641
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,789
- It's okay. - We're going to pay for everything.

642
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,349
- Yes, it's okay. - All right.

643
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,920
(He is filming, making coffee, and watching his kid simultaneously.)

644
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,290
My hands are so dirty.

645
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,430
What?

646
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,830
Min Woo.

647
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,930
You sounded firm with your daughter.

648
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,070
- I was... - What happened?

649
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,839
- He was focused. - Come here, Ro Yun.

650
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,409
You sounded different from earlier.

651
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,439
It was totally different.

652
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,540
Parents don't always have to be sweet.

653
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,580
That's true.

654
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,610
Go out. Daddy will bring the drinks.

655
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,450
Come here.

656
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,019
Ro Yun.

657
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,250
- Come here. - Come here, Ro Yun.

658
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,849
Come here, Ro Yun.

659
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,989
You're so cute.

660
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,620
- Thank you. - No problem.

661
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,459
- This looks tasty. - Thank you.

662
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,089
- It looks so pretty. - This is the matcha espresso latte.

663
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,360
- Matcha. - This is the cream latte.

664
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,800
Mix it thoroughly.

665
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,099
- It looks tasty. - It really does.

666
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,200
- Iced chocolate? - Yes, mix it thoroughly.

667
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,699
Thank you.

668
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,800
Let's have a seat.

669
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
(Sighing)

670
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,440
- Are you okay? - Yes.

671
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,739
I should've helped you.

672
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,340
This place is usually empty.

673
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,609
- You must have mixed feelings. - Yes.

674
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,520
- I'm grateful, but... - But you're too busy.

675
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,619
Have you ever had four customers at the same time?

676
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,690
They usually all have iced Americanos.

677
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,259
I'm sorry.

678
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,390
No, I'm grateful.

679
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,759
- You should get used to it. - You're right.

680
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,129
- You have to get used to it. - I'm grateful.

681
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,499
You showed us your various signature drinks.

682
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,569
- Yes, many people have that. - They do?

683
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,640
- This is tasty. - Buttercream latte?

684
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,069
Yes, many people drink that.

685
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,839
I'm sorry, but where are the egg tarts?

686
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,939
Oh, right.

687
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,070
(Surprised)

688
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,310
Excuse me.

689
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,809
Where are you going?

690
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,810
(I'm going with you.)

691
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:56,349
Did you see that?

692
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,910
She wanted you to let go.

693
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,320
Wait.

694
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,680
- Thank you. - Of course.

695
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,920
- This looks tasty. - It looks tasty.

696
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,120
- It's been a while, and it's tasty. - It's tasty.

697
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,389
(Gasping)

698
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,130
What are you drinking, Ro Yun?

699
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,530
Here you go, Ro Yun.

700
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,600
Say, "Thank you."

701
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,470
The egg tart is so tasty.

702
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,970
It's tasty.

703
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,140
What kind of spare time is this for you?

704
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,839
When I open the store in the morning,

705
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,950
it's usually after feeding Ro Yun breakfast, helping her wash up,

706
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,279
dressing her,

707
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,050
and sending her to day care.

708
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,090
But her day care is closed today.

709
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,749
- Because it's between holidays? - Yes.

710
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,490
So it's usually when I have the least number of customers.

711
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,789
It's right before I get busy.

712
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,000
I get busy around noon, when it's lunchtime.

713
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,359
The moms send their kids to day care,

714
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,530
have lunch, run errands...

715
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,600
- And have coffee? - Yes, they have coffee.

716
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,570
It's pretty slow before that.

717
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,009
So I design merchandise. We make our own goods.

718
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,339
You design it yourself...

719
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,039
- and sell it here? - Yes.

720
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,209
- Really? - I see.

721
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,549
- Even the clothes? - I buy some of it...

722
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,449
- and design some of it. - That's impressive.

723
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,049
What made you...

724
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,889
send a letter to Whenever Possible?

725
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,090
I thought it'd be nice if you came to Geumho-dong.

726
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,289
It's a quiet...

727
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,030
- and warm neighborhood. - That's right.

728
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,199
- Geumnam Market is nearby. - That's right.

729
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,530
There are also several apartments.

730
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,170
I wanted to introduce this nice neighborhood.

731
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,610
And after opening this cafe,

732
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,870
I realized I have too much spare time.

733
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,110
It met the purpose of the show.

734
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,880
- You realized this was for you. - Yes, it's for me.

735
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,550
- That's why. - It's okay to be a bit busier...

736
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,319
- Yes, that's right. - A little bit.

737
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
(Glancing at Ro Yun)

738
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,690
- Your daughter... - Ro Yun.

739
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,220
You aren't sleeping, are you?

740
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,789
You aren't sleeping, are you?

741
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,160
What is she doing?

742
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,290
She has her dad by her side...

743
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,030
and seems to have gotten used to the surroundings now.

744
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
- She looks comfortable. - Yes, she does.

745
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,329
She looks very comfortable.

746
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,570
- She feels comfortable. - I can tell you.

747
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,570
She feels comfortable now.

748
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,840
How is her body bent backward like that?

749
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,410
Do you want to lie down? She wants to lie down.

750
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,750
Okay, lie down.

751
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,913
Since we're here,

752
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:16,362
we have...

753
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,189
If you see here,

754
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,060
you can get up to two bonus coupons.

755
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,159
You can participate as many times as the number.

756
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,590
- Who should roll it? - That means you get more chances.

757
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,999
Will you?

758
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,700
- Sana can... - Would you like to try, Sana?

759
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,570
(Sana decides to roll the die.)

760
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,940
All right. Relax.

761
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,670
- Roll it like this? - Yes.

762
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,350
- Yes. - Yes.

763
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,680
- It's a two. - Nice.

764
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,549
(They get 2 coupons.)

765
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,889
- That's perfect. - Good job.

766
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,550
That's the biggest number.

767
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,820
Let's start with Round One.

768
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,860
- Take one. - Do you want to pick, Ro Yun?

769
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,600
Pick one, Ro Yun.

770
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,400
Should I do it? Okay.

771
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,030
- Do I just open it? - Yes.

772
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,769
"The three of us would like to wear matching shoes..."

773
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,169
"and go on a relaxing trip."

774
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,209
"Matching Nike shoes for the family."

775
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,210
(Round 1 present: Matching Nike shoes)

776
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,479
- Three pairs of shoes. - That's nice.

777
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,809
- This is nice. - The size is so cute.

778
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,279
- It's so cute. - We needed shoes.

779
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,049
- You did? - Yes, we needed sneakers.

780
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,120
Can I take a look?

781
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,350
- Gosh. - That's cute.

782
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,249
- The Cortez. - It's so cute.

783
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,290
- It's so cute. - Do you want to wear these?

784
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,789
- Do you want them? - It's so cute.

785
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,970
Gosh, Ro Yun.

786
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,329
It's so cute.

787
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,629
- Say, "Thank you." - Look at that.

788
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,559
- I really hope we pass Round One. - Thank you.

789
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,729
I'm worried.

790
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,769
- I wanted sneakers. - All right.

791
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,899
(Feeling pressured)

792
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,169
- It'll look so nice. - It's cute.

793
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,199
- The Cortez. - Yes.

794
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,240
It's so pretty.

795
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,259
I'll tell you the mission after we clear the table.

796
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:46,725
- Okay. - Okay.

797
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,143
Come here, Ro Yun.

798
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,879
You might get hurt.

799
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,050
(It isn't her dad.)

800
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:52,917
Come here, Ro Yun.

801
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,050
Sit here for a while.

802
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,150
Your dad is doing something but will be back.

803
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,320
Wait with me.

804
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,230
(Glued at the hip)

805
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,629
This is the cutest age.

806
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,670
- Right? - Yes.

807
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,699
- When they're 3 to 5. - Yes.

808
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,369
- It's nice to spend time with her. - I bet.

809
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,410
It's the cutest age.

810
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,040
You get to spend that time with her.

811
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,449
We'll try our best to at least...

812
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,809
- win you the matching shoes. - I know.

813
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,949
- It's so cute. - Seriously.

814
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,180
- I feel mentally pressured. - Yes.

815
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,389
If we fail,

816
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,220
- they get nothing. - They get absolutely nothing.

817
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,759
Right.

818
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,089
I'm not sure how you'll feel if I say this,

819
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,599
but the games you play here seem petty.

820
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,199
- Come on. - Do you know what I mean?

821
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,699
How could you say they are petty?

822
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,829
How should I put it?

823
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,229
I think there might be a better expression.

824
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,199
- I know what you mean. - Right?

825
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,369
So I think I can do well.

826
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,509
The petty games are different...

827
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,009
when you're watching from home...

828
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,109
- and when you're playing them here. - It's different.

829
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,110
It's different when you're playing for prizes.

830
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,509
What game are we playing?

831
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,819
(Coaster Ping Pong)

832
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,889
(Use a coaster to bounce a ping pong ball...)

833
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,819
(into the goalpost.)

834
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,189
(Everyone has to hit it at least once.)

835
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,790
- We're playing ping pong? - Yes.

836
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,459
We use these?

837
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,599
Yes, bounce it with them and put it in the goalpost.

838
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,100
We failed many of these petty games.

839
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,539
This isn't a petty game.

840
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,770
You have to put it in here.

841
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,569
- It's big. - After bouncing it around?

842
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,039
- Yes. - Okay, got it.

843
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,879
We just have to put it in here...

844
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,909
- after bouncing it once each? - That's right.

845
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,909
It's close and seems easy.

846
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,910
Let's try.

847
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,249
We once did something similar but failed.

848
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,319
- It bounced away. - You're right.

849
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,350
They have to bounce the ball and get it in that bucket.

850
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
Let's clap. Okay?

851
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,419
- I'm going to clap. - You are?

852
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,829
- We did something similar, right? - Passing the ball is difficult.

853
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,260
- It's difficult. - I bet.

854
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,000
- Wait. - Pass it to Sana.

855
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,869
- Hey. - Hey.

856
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,900
- Come on. - Sana.

857
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,240
You have to pass it to us, Sana.

858
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,899
It bounces off harder than I thought.

859
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,369
You're right. I have to control my strength.

860
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,840
- Yes, since it's wood. - Here it goes.

861
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,249
- I'm sorry. - All right.

862
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,549
- You have to put it in the bucket. - Score.

863
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,010
You have to end it, Jihyo.

864
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,280
The last part is difficult.

865
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,249
(She practices again.)

866
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,720
That's right.

867
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,159
We can try again.

868
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,420
- I'm sorry. - We can try again.

869
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,930
- I'm sorry. - We can try again.

870
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,729
It's difficult when you try it.

871
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,929
Didn't it hurt? I'm sorry.

872
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,029
The petty games are different from when you're watching at home.

873
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,930
- It's tough when you're playing it. - Let's try again.

874
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,700
Okay.

875
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,700
Pass. Here.

876
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,310
(Person to keep an eye on)

877
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,009
- Gosh! - That's good.

878
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,379
(Everyone touched the ball. Now they just need to end it.)

879
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
You can do this.

880
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,549
That's how you do it.

881
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,250
- I'm good at finishing games. - You're right.

882
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,589
- They're so good, right? - Let's try again.

883
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,920
- Let's try. - Okay.

884
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,619
That's right.

885
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,690
- Let's try again. - Okay.

886
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,229
That's good. We got this.

887
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,230
That's right. That's good.

888
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,269
- That's good. - I think I can do it.

889
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,429
- That was good. - She got the hang of it.

890
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,639
I think we can succeed if we're this good.

891
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,839
Let's start our first try.

892
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,369
- Let's go. - Let's go.

893
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,470
- Give me five. - Let's go. Here we go.

894
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,510
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

895
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,139
Ready.

896
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,080
- Should I end it? - Set.

897
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,020
(Sighing)

898
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,690
(She passes it to Sana.)

899
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,690
(Just do as we practiced!)

900
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,260
(Passing it back?)

901
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,630
That's good.

902
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,940
Why did you bypass me?

903
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,609
- Why did it bounce forward? - Wait a second.

904
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,909
(She skipped Yeon Seok and passed it back to Jihyo.)

905
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,510
I was right here.

906
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,850
She said she could do it.

907
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,489
I think I can do it.

908
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,849
I felt rushed.

909
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,919
I'm sorry.

910
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,389
Why don't we have Sana begin?

911
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,519
- Okay. - Okay.

912
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,629
You can pass it to whoever you want.

913
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,630
Okay.

914
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,699
- This is our second try. - It can go all the way here.

915
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,029
I just have to bounce it once.

916
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,129
- Right? - Yes, just once.

917
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,669
This is our 2nd try. In 1, 2, 3.

918
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,769
- Here we go. - Here we go.

919
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,699
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

920
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,340
Ready. Set.

921
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,510
There.

922
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
Fail.

923
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:15,780
Hey.

924
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,149
(Grunting)

925
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,350
(She only bounced it once like she mentioned.)

926
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,820
- Get out of here. - Wait a second.

927
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I'm sorry.

928
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,719
(They are speechless.)

929
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,460
- Get out of here. - Wait a second.

930
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,590
- I'm sorry. - We're in trouble.

931
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,299
The problem is getting past Sana.

932
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,870
This is driving me nuts.

933
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,070
You aren't very good at games.

934
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
Wait.

935
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,739
Min Woo's face turned grim.

936
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,569
He can't hide his feelings.

937
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,810
(Patting the present)

938
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,909
(Today's key player)

939
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,109
One more thing, Sana. When the ball comes to you,

940
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,449
- don't hit it. - Okay.

941
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,749
- Let it tap the coaster. - I'll stay still.

942
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,350
- Let's try it. - Okay.

943
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,819
That's right.

944
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,189
That's what you have to do.

945
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,220
Okay.

946
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,445
- Pass it back to me again. - Here.

947
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,470
We'll try again.

948
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,092
That's right.

949
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:04,222
That's good.

950
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,199
- That's good. - That's good.

951
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,300
You can put it in the bucket.

952
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,829
- That's good. - That's good.

953
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,429
You can put it in the bucket.

954
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,999
You've gotten better.

955
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,270
- Here we go. - Okay.

956
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,169
This is our 4th try. In 1, 2, 3.

957
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,739
- Here we go. - Here we go. Let's go!

958
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,839
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

959
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,639
(Focusing)

960
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,710
Set.

961
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,620
That's good. We got this.

962
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,619
(She stably receives the ball.)

963
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,560
That's good. We got this.

964
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,259
That's good. We got this.

965
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,560
I have to play too.

966
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,500
Gosh. I have to play.

967
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,070
(Once again, Yeon Seok didn't get to play.)

968
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,869
I'm sorry. I was too focused on staying still.

969
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,580
I thought you'd come to me.

970
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,879
- I was just waiting. - Gosh.

971
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,180
That was your fault.

972
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,979
- It was my fault, right? - At this point,

973
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,489
we should use one of our bonus coupons.

974
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,549
Let's use a bonus coupon.

975
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,149
- That means... - You have to play,

976
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,889
and one person has to leave.

977
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,559
- Who would you choose? - Who should leave?

978
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,129
I don't want to exclude anyone even if we fail.

979
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,259
One person has to leave.

980
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,959
- That's the rule. - Take a close look.

981
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,929
You can just stare at the person.

982
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,570
This is tough.

983
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,900
I'll stand up in advance.

984
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
(Sana leaves.)
All right.

985
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,979
- You can play with Ro Yun. - Spend some time with her.

986
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,139
- Okay. - Play with her.

987
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,639
- We'll be having a good time. - Yes, with Ro Yun.

988
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,009
- Ro Yun. - Give me a second.

989
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,479
Ro Yun, your dad will briefly play this game.

990
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,779
Let's rest here.

991
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
All right.

992
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,089
- Let's go. - You put it in the bucket.

993
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,689
- You want me to do it? - Let's go in this order.

994
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,859
We have to succeed this time.

995
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,259
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

996
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,659
- Here we go. - Here we go.

997
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,759
Ready.

998
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,829
(Bonus coupon round)

999
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,860
Set.

1000
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,130
I'll pass it to Jihyo.

1001
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,300
Here it comes.

1002
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,640
That's good.

1003
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,440
I'll take it.

1004
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,410
(Flinching)

1005
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,780
(They succeed in passing it to Yeon Seok, the last player.)

1006
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,810
I got you covered.

1007
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,910
(He just has to put it in the bucket now.)

1008
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,220
That's good.

1009
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,050
I got you covered.

1010
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,560
I got you covered.

1011
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,700
(It went in!)

1012
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Success.

1013
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:26,340
(They did it!)

1014
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,770
Success.

1015
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,239
(Sneakers!)

1016
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,580
- We did it. - We did it.

1017
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,380
With this, we are able to give Min Woo...

1018
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,580
the present for Round One.

1019
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,219
(They win the matching Nike sneakers!)

1020
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,259
We haven't given it to him yet.

1021
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,820
- I meant... - Wait.

1022
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,659
You have a choice to make.

1023
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,630
This round was already pretty tough.

1024
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,829
You can decide...

1025
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,570
to stop right now.

1026
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,169
Give it a good thought.

1027
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,799
We still have one bonus coupon left.

1028
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,409
We have six tries and a coupon left.

1029
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,609
That means we have seven chances.

1030
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,539
All right. Give it a thought.

1031
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,280
In 1, 2, 3.

1032
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,510
- Let's go to Round Two. - Okay.

1033
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,450
- Go to Round Two. - You should continue.

1034
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,019
- Read it for us, please. - "I enjoy putting together..."

1035
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,949
"a playlist to play for my customers. Marshall speakers."

1036
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,860
They have good sound quality.

1037
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,160
- The designs are also nice. - That's right.

1038
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,559
- Gosh. - Look at this.

1039
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,789
It will look nice here.

1040
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,959
I needed speakers.

1041
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,330
- Really? - Yes.

1042
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,170
We customized the presents to your needs.

1043
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,399
I wanted this.

1044
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,639
- Really? - Yes.

1045
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,739
(Round 2)

1046
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,469
(It's the same as Round 1,)

1047
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,739
(but the coasters are smaller.)

1048
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,809
- I see. - Now the coasters are smaller.

1049
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,179
They are the ones he uses.

1050
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,209
I think you could use...

1051
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,720
- bigger coasters. - They're too small.

1052
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,289
We'll have to imagine we're using our palms.

1053
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,589
That's what we should think.

1054
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,990
This isn't too bad.

1055
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,119
- This is difficult. - I don't think it'll be easy.

1056
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,030
- What should I do? - I don't know.

1057
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,029
What should we do?

1058
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,959
What should I do? It doesn't even touch the ball.

1059
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,330
This isn't easy.

1060
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,740
Jihyo, I'll pass it to you.

1061
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,840
- That's good. Good job. - Are you ready, Sana?

1062
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,670
- Sana. - Here it comes.

1063
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,539
(Touching her nose)

1064
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,179
- Let's start over there. - Okay.

1065
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,579
Can the two of you try passing the ball back and forth?

1066
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,510
Give it a try.

1067
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,049
- That's good. - Wait.

1068
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,149
(He caught it well.)

1069
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,050
That's good. Pass it to me.

1070
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,090
(Everyone bounces the ball before they know it.)

1071
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,890
- Awesome. - Jae Suk.

1072
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,129
- Awesome. - Let's try it this way.

1073
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,529
- Yes, let's do that. - Yes.

1074
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,729
- Should we go in this order? - Yes.

1075
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,729
All right. This is Round Two.

1076
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,439
- It's going better than I thought. - Yes.

1077
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,539
- All right. - In 1, 2, 3.

1078
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,670
- Let's go! - Here we go!

1079
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,880
(Indifferent)

1080
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,739
- Let's do this. - She doesn't trust us.

1081
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,379
Starting from Yeon Seok. This is try number five.

1082
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,450
Here we go.

1083
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,620
I'm going.

1084
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,489
Go.

1085
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,820
(A nice toss to Sana)

1086
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,607
Go.

1087
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,699
(Great defense)

1088
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,400
- That was great. - Here it comes, Jihyo.

1089
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:10,945
- That's good. - To Jae Suk.

1090
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,799
(It has gone to the last player.)

1091
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,609
(He only needs to put it in the bucket.)

1092
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,669
To Jae Suk.

1093
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,410
Yes, just go for it.

1094
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,190
Just go for it.

1095
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,060
Jae Suk.

1096
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,430
(A hollow laugh)

1097
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,330
(Jae Suk.)

1098
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,270
(Jae Suk?)

1099
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,540
Why am I sweating so much? It's pretty hot in here.

1100
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,079
We were so close!

1101
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,909
(Try number five is a failure.)

1102
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,220
- But there's an upside. - Okay.

1103
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,449
We would have had to go for Round Three if we had succeeded.

1104
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,749
That's true.

1105
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,250
I didn't mean to fail, but...

1106
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,119
You stopped us from going for Round Three?

1107
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,520
Round Three can be tough.

1108
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,090
- But that was good just now. - Yes.

1109
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,429
- You're doing great. - Sana and Jihyo got the hang of it.

1110
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,629
- Yes, you did great. - We got the hang of it.

1111
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,329
At this rate, we might succeed.

1112
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,870
- Let's cheer up. - Let's go.

1113
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,369
Ready.

1114
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,939
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

1115
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,669
(Focused)

1116
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,740
Set.

1117
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,649
Hang on. Here.

1118
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,750
Sorry!

1119
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,819
I'm sorry.

1120
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,219
(Try number six is a failure.)

1121
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,320
What was that?

1122
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,959
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

1123
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,260
- Let's go! - Try number seven.

1124
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,230
Ready. Set.

1125
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,280
(What just happened?)

1126
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,350
I just saw their faces, and they were stunned.

1127
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,620
Like, "What's wrong with you?"

1128
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,189
Give me the ball.

1129
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,190
(They trusted Yeon Seok, but he failed twice in a row.)

1130
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,330
We need him to join us now.

1131
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,729
Should I leave this time?

1132
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,939
No, I'll sit this one out. I think I have the yips.

1133
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,869
- Yes, sit this one out. - I'll stay out.

1134
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,540
- You're scared all of a sudden. - Yes.

1135
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,179
Wish us luck, Ro Yun.

1136
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,279
- Let's go. - Wish us luck.

1137
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,179
- In 1, 2, 3. Good luck! - Good luck!

1138
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,519
- Good. Sana should go 1st. - I should go 1st, right?

1139
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,319
It bounces off if it drops from too high up.

1140
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,389
All right.

1141
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,049
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

1142
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,190
- Let's go! - Let's go! Please.

1143
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,659
Ready.

1144
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,959
(Bonus coupon round)

1145
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Set.

1146
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,030
There you go. Jihyo.

1147
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,460
Here.

1148
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,970
(It's successfully connected to the last player.)

1149
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Here.

1150
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,410
(He only needs to put it in now.)

1151
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,920
(It bounced out!)

1152
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,120
(This is so frustrating.)

1153
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,820
(The bonus round was a failure.)

1154
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,060
We have two more tries left.

1155
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,600
We're in trouble.

1156
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,369
I'll get out of the way after hitting it.

1157
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,639
- And I come in? - Yes, come in.

1158
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,999
- The coupon round is over. - It's over.

1159
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,400
- Is it over? - Yes.

1160
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,439
What do we do?

1161
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
(Daddy's back!)

1162
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,880
I feel rushed.

1163
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,719
Jihyo, how about you go first?

1164
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,949
- Should I? - Yes.

1165
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,419
Like earlier, I'll pass it to Sana,

1166
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,589
- Yes. - and Sana will pass it to you.

1167
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,089
- That looked promising. - Yes.

1168
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,089
- We can't lose the shoes. - We need to make it.

1169
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,489
- We can't lose them. - Ready.

1170
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,289
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

1171
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,430
Set.

1172
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,630
It's going to you.

1173
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
(Screaming)

1174
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,540
(Failure)

1175
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,980
In the end,

1176
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,850
we're on our last attempt.

1177
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,119
We have to make it this time.

1178
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,859
- This is tricky. - Let's practice first.

1179
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
(If they fail, Ro Yun doesn't get her sneakers.)

1180
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,099
- This is a lot of pressure. - It is.

1181
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,160
It makes your hands tremble.

1182
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,029
- Last try. - Let's practice before we start.

1183
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,469
- How about... - Who should go last?

1184
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,070
Let's practice. You should go last.

1185
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,809
(Feeling burdened)

1186
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,970
Practice round.

1187
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,269
Start.

1188
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,480
(Their last practice)

1189
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,309
(Yeon Seok for the finish)

1190
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,750
Yes, you're doing great.

1191
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,550
You got it.

1192
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,820
We said, "Here we go," right?

1193
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,990
We just have to go like this.

1194
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,829
(Good luck!)

1195
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,400
- Last try. - Yes, the last try.

1196
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,959
We just have to make this one.

1197
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
(Just like we practiced.)

1198
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,329
- Just do it like we practiced. - Now...

1199
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,569
- Yes. - It's our last attempt. Good luck!

1200
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,070
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1201
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,269
- Get ready. - Good luck.

1202
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,609
Even Ro Yun is saying it.

1203
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,139
- Yes, let's make it now. - Sana, be confident.

1204
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,739
- All right. - Have some confidence.

1205
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,779
(Getting the cheerful energy from Ro Yun)

1206
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,809
- I won't get scared. - Just tap it.

1207
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,519
- He'll blow the whistle, right? - Yes.

1208
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,619
- Yes. - Ready.

1209
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,680
Set.

1210
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,429
(They fail their final attempt.)

1211
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,639
(The prizes go away.)

1212
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,170
They take them right away.

1213
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,370
No. Wait.

1214
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,079
The sneakers...

1215
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,780
(They failed to give Ro Yun new sneakers.)

1216
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:59,950
This is so...

1217
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,219
- She lay down. - Ro Yun.

1218
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,260
Ro Yun.

1219
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,160
It's okay.

1220
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,730
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

1221
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,869
Are you all right?

1222
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,169
(She's pretty shocked.)

1223
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,340
We're sorry, Ro Yun.

1224
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,669
It's okay.

1225
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,770
(Kissing)

1226
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,510
I'll buy you a pair. It's all right.

1227
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,120
Sir. Here.

1228
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,119
- It's from our show. - We apologize.

1229
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,790
I prefer these.

1230
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,690
Look, Ro Yun.

1231
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,189
She's very disappointed.

1232
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,229
(Staring blankly)

1233
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,759
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

1234
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,659
I'm truly sorry.

1235
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,799
Thank you.

1236
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,369
(Heartbroken)

1237
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,069
Jihyo, you often walk by this place, right?

1238
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,309
- I plan on coming here often. - Good.

1239
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,510
- You should have some coffee. - Yes, I'll visit tomorrow.

1240
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,439
And don't make complicated orders.

1241
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,279
- I'll only order an iced Americano. - Iced Americano.

1242
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,650
- And a lot of egg tarts. - Yes.

1243
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,150
That was so close.

1244
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,850
- Gosh. - Poor her.

1245
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,320
- We'll be going, then. - Yes. Thank you for your time.

1246
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,860
We're really sorry.

1247
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,859
- Bye, Ro Yun. - Bye!

1248
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,259
- Thank you for your time. - Thank you.

1249
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,130
- Say goodbye, Ro Yun. - Bye!

1250
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,130
We had a lot of attempts left, so I...

1251
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,829
I mean, I should have been more delicate.

1252
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,029
(He expresses his regret, even outside.)

1253
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,370
Same here. I was pretty confident,

1254
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,239
so I let my guard down. I made two ridiculous mistakes.

1255
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,780
You made a huge mistake today.

1256
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
You were the worst. You cost us two tries.

1257
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,350
Also,

1258
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,019
I adore Jihyo and Sana, and I've known them for a long time,

1259
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,220
but I should tell them off during lunch.

1260
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,389
- Right. - I should...

1261
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,729
- tell them off. - I bet...

1262
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,959
- they realized... - Yes, we should tell them.

1263
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
that it was no petty task.

1264
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,500
How do you feel now, Sana?

1265
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
(Thinking)

1266
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:58,670
It's quite intimidating.

1267
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,000
"Intimidating?"

1268
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,669
- Jihyo, let's talk over lunch. - Yes.

1269
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,740
Sure.

1270
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,880
He says he's going to tell you off.

1271
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,309
- Sorry. - Yeon Seok and I made mistakes too.

1272
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,479
Well, I made the most mistakes.

1273
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,020
- No. - That's not what we mean.

1274
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,749
- We let our guard down. - We let our guard down.

1275
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,359
(They got beaten badly by a silly game.)

1276
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Now, we have to go meet our second guest.

1277
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,830
I feel too bad.

1278
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,500
Let's check the time.

1279
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,169
It's at 1:30pm? Then...

1280
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,430
- We have some time on our hands. - We have a long break.

1281
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,369
- We should eat lunch, then. - We have to.

1282
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,599
Let's eat around here.

1283
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,969
- It's Jihyo's hometown, right? - Yes.

1284
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,539
And you mentioned a few places earlier.

1285
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,279
- Yes. - Or...

1286
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,980
- we could go to that place. - Pasta or simmered stew?

1287
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,249
Pick one.

1288
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,120
- Should we eat pasta? - Should we?

1289
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,119
- Let's go to the pasta place. - Yes.

1290
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,850
Jihyo is a regular there, after all.

1291
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,389
(They walk dispiritedly.)

1292
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,529
We would have been so happy on our way there...

1293
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,729
if we had gotten them the prizes.

1294
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,459
It's so disappointing.

1295
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,000
I feel terrible.

1296
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,999
- Is this the place? - We're here.

1297
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,839
- It looks gorgeous. - It does.

1298
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,270
- It does. - It's an old house.

1299
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,069
The holidays began, so...

1300
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,839
Good afternoon. Are you open?

1301
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,039
- Yes. - To the end.

1302
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,480
- The wall looks beautiful. - Right?

1303
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,150
I like this place.

1304
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,279
- Jihyo, this place is lovely. - Yes.

1305
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,519
(There's a panoramic window on one side.)

1306
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,750
This is beautiful.

1307
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,250
It is.

1308
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:26,960
What would you like to order?

1309
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,560
- This one's pretty good. - Okay.

1310
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,289
- Can I order this one? - Go ahead.

1311
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,299
Yes.

1312
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,060
Can we also get French toast with fruits?

1313
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,699
- Should we order some pasta too? - We must.

1314
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,470
These 2? That's 2 bowls of pasta.

1315
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,770
Garlic butter... This one also looks good.

1316
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,240
- And this one. - Order them.

1317
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:44,870
Isn't that too much?

1318
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:46,310
- We can eat them all. - Can we?

1319
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,040
We can eat all of them.

1320
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,310
- Done. Sure. - Can I get a cup of coffee?

1321
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,719
But you had coffee earlier. Wasn't it enough?

1322
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,780
No.

1323
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,190
I guess you're craving some caffeine all of a sudden.

1324
00:46:57,726 --> 00:46:59,336
I'm having a hard time emotionally.

1325
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,720
(Clearing her throat)

1326
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,030
Can you tell me where the restroom is?

1327
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,630
What a bummer.

1328
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,370
(Hesitant)

1329
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,630
I won't give you a long speech.

1330
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,070
Please do better in the next game.

1331
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,370
That's a lot of pressure.

1332
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
(Joking)

1333
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:23,279
(The variety show instructor is excited.)

1334
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,679
- Understood? - Yes.

1335
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,879
We'll eat first.

1336
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,320
(Speechless)

1337
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,860
Why have you gone so quiet?

1338
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,120
We're not exactly in a party mood.

1339
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,729
Also, I told Jihyo and Sana off.

1340
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,830
Did you?

1341
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,270
Should we change the subject? Let's stop talking about the game.

1342
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,270
I'm sure we'll come back to that topic.

1343
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,769
Now that you've tried it,

1344
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,739
do you realize how different it is from watching it at home?

1345
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,939
- It's very different. - Right?

1346
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,110
I was so surprised.

1347
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,549
- With that much pressure... - Right?

1348
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,980
- Yes, there's pressure. - Exactly.

1349
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,389
Here.

1350
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:07,060
- Let's do better in the next one. - Let's do it.

1351
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,700
But the weather today is...

1352
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,159
It's so sunny, unlike how I'm feeling.

1353
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,870
(The weather is sunny as if it can't read the room.)

1354
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
We should be enjoying this spring.

1355
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,139
Do you often go out?

1356
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,579
- Maybe you go on walks. - I tend to walk around this area.

1357
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,709
I don't really like the night,

1358
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,810
- so I go out in the afternoon. - Really?

1359
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,419
When I've got nothing to do, I go to a coffee shop...

1360
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,420
and sit outside.

1361
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:36,650
- I like to do that. - Really?

1362
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,989
I just space out.

1363
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,490
But too many people will recognize you.

1364
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,890
But most of the neighbors know that I live in this neighborhood,

1365
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,600
so I think they just look past me.

1366
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,130
Sana, do you often fly to Osaka?

1367
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,599
When I'm working in Osaka,

1368
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,300
I visit my parents and have a meal.

1369
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,140
I saw one day...

1370
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,779
that the people of Osaka will act like they've been shot...

1371
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,710
- when you pretend to shoot them. - Right.

1372
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,009
Have you watched that?

1373
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,980
(Bang!)

1374
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,650
(For some reason, the people of Osaka react to the bang.)

1375
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,320
- Right. - Have you seen that?

1376
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,819
I used to do that when I was little.

1377
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,429
It's not like anyone taught me.

1378
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,129
- You just automatically react. - Really?

1379
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,230
But so many people in Korea found out about that later,

1380
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,599
so I decided not to be one of them.

1381
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,230
So, I just don't react.

1382
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,699
- You don't react? - No.

1383
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,400
- "I'm not going to be one of them." - Exactly.

1384
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,579
Thank you.

1385
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,610
What's this?

1386
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,949
- Is this what we ordered? - It's just pre-meal bread.

1387
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,179
- It's pre-meal bread. - Pre-meal bread?

1388
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Yes.

1389
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,780
- Should we share them? - Yes.

1390
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,719
Now, even food reminds me...

1391
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,620
- of that moment from earlier. - Me too!

1392
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,520
- No. - This is tough.

1393
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,229
Let's forget all about it and eat well.

1394
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,959
That way, we can win the prizes for the next guests.

1395
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,099
If the coaster had been as big as this one,

1396
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,169
- we would have succeeded. - Yes, we would have.

1397
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,499
- Why did you give us that? - Right.

1398
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,439
There are bigger coasters.

1399
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,140
- If it had been as big as this. - I know.

1400
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,080
This is the one that Jihyo ordered.

1401
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,410
Romaine salad.

1402
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,409
This looks delicious.

1403
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,550
(Crunchy Romaine lettuce salad)

1404
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,079
What's this?

1405
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,120
Squid.

1406
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,680
It looks scrumptious.

1407
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,789
- Let's eat and cheer up. - We should.

1408
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,089
- We need to cheer up. - Forget about it.

1409
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,790
- And let's win next time. - Yes.

1410
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,330
- I'll do better next time. - Yes.

1411
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,429
That's enough!

1412
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,100
What's the matter?

1413
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,099
- She said she'd do better. - She might get an upset stomach!

1414
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,200
Well,

1415
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,070
she said she'd do better, so I said yes.

1416
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,969
(Getting the knife)

1417
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,710
- Jihyo. - Thank you.

1418
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,410
We'll...

1419
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,449
- Oh, you have to cut it? - Yes.

1420
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,520
Thank you.

1421
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,050
(Cutting the stem off)

1422
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,420
(They eat conveniently, thanks to Jihyo.)

1423
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,360
- It's tasty. - Yes.

1424
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,530
- It's atmospheric. - Yes.

1425
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,330
- It would make a fine brunch place. - It would.

1426
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,970
(Exclaiming)

1427
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,540
We're going to a restaurant next, so...

1428
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,269
This is also good.

1429
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,870
- Do you like it? - I do.

1430
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,380
(Pondering)

1431
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,449
Do you eat Romaine lettuce?

1432
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,710
I don't.

1433
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,579
- He'll eat napa cabbage, but... - Not Romaine lettuce.

1434
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,650
He would eat regular lettuce or napa cabbage.

1435
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,520
He normally doesn't eat Romaine lettuce.

1436
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,329
(Struggling with the Romaine lettuce)

1437
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,390
Look.

1438
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,530
Did you see how Romaine lettuce didn't suit me?

1439
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,560
(Laughing)

1440
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,399
This is so good.

1441
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,399
This is a great restaurant.

1442
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,199
(Having delicious lunch, thanks to Jihyo)

1443
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,340
No wonder you mentioned it.

1444
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,639
I love their food.

1445
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,969
(Feeling proud)

1446
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,839
My trainee days were long.

1447
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,779
- Really? - I was a trainee for ten years.

1448
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,649
- Ten years? - Yes, I started when I was a kid.

1449
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,620
Counting the years when I prepared for it...

1450
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,219
Have another piece of squid.

1451
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,390
I'm fine.

1452
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,020
You can have it.

1453
00:51:59,021 --> 00:52:00,260
I had three pieces already.

1454
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,020
Have some more.

1455
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,830
They need to take the plate away.

1456
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,689
- Why... - Just eat it.

1457
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,999
Am I a leftover bin to you?

1458
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,230
- Why... - This is called love.

1459
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,530
What do you two normally do in your free time?

1460
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,570
I normally work out...

1461
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,810
or lie about at home.

1462
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,910
(The national MC's secret hobby)

1463
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,949
I like lying at home.

1464
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,550
- He also takes walks outside. - Right.

1465
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,120
But that's only when there are cameras.

1466
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,619
I rarely go outside unless there are cameras.

1467
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,820
The amount of activity from Whenever Possible...

1468
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,429
- and "Running Man" is enough. - I spend a lot of time outside.

1469
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,660
- I get that. - I'm mostly outside on camera.

1470
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,660
Have some pasta.

1471
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,630
I'm full now.

1472
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,500
But we ordered so much.

1473
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,170
I can keep eating.

1474
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,569
(Staring)

1475
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,739
Your answers are very definite.

1476
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,039
- What do you mean? - There's no middle ground.

1477
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,110
Of course.

1478
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,880
I don't like to keep things vague.

1479
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,249
You know that wasn't a compliment, right?

1480
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,490
- No, that was a compliment. - What?

1481
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,819
- That's a compliment. - It is.

1482
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,620
- It was, right? - Of course, it was.

1483
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,129
I'm an ISFP,

1484
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,149
and we're called social Type Ts.

1485
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,160
- Thank you. - What's this?

1486
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,000
It's the seafood pasta.

1487
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,130
- Right. We ordered two pastas. - We did.

1488
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,470
- All our food is here now. - Yes.

1489
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,210
(Handing out the bowls)

1490
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,540
This much is fine.

1491
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,079
Are Japanese people reluctant when it comes to rejection...

1492
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,719
- because they don't want to... - Thanks, Sana.

1493
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,879
- You're welcome. - be mean to others?

1494
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,250
(Slipping)

1495
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,890
Sana, something is definitely wrong with you today.

1496
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,589
The bowl looks fine, though.

1497
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,930
It didn't break.

1498
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,429
- I'll take it. - It's okay.

1499
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,069
- We apologize. - It's all right.

1500
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,630
Give it to me. I'll use it.

1501
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,469
(Tilting her head)

1502
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:54,970
Sana, are you okay?

1503
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,640
- Yes, I'm okay. - I'm pretty startled too.

1504
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,710
I thought there had been a huge accident.

1505
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,079
I guess I clenched my fingers too hard earlier.

1506
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,479
My hands feel weak.

1507
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,220
(We must keep an eye on Sana today.)

1508
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,580
You startled me.

1509
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,250
- Thank you. - How about this much?

1510
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,519
Sana, you joined the agency through a global audition, right?

1511
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,119
I was cast.

1512
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,289
Really?

1513
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,589
After I was cast, they wanted me to come to an audition,

1514
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,030
so I went.

1515
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,429
The next day, they asked my parents...

1516
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,529
if they were willing to send their daughter.

1517
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,470
- They asked them on the spot. - What was your mother's answer?

1518
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,339
She said yes at that moment.

1519
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,880
Then, we came back home, and she suggested that I stay.

1520
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,309
Because it meant you had to stay in a foreign country.

1521
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,810
- Yes. - Yes.

1522
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,750
Then Jihyo must have been your senior when you were a trainee.

1523
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,289
She was already preparing to make her debut.

1524
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,689
So, we didn't even run into each other.

1525
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,230
- We even took different lessons. - Right.

1526
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,029
So you two first met when the group was formed?

1527
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,130
I knew about her, but I had never talked to her.

1528
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,940
Also, Sana could barely speak Korean at the time.

1529
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,270
We weren't in a situation where we could have a conversation.

1530
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,339
All I could say in Korean was, "Hi."

1531
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,280
- Really? - "Hi." That was all.

1532
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,050
Now, you speak Korean so fluently.

1533
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,920
- Right. - That was hilarious earlier.

1534
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,319
"It's so intimidating."

1535
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,820
It's quite intimidating.

1536
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,590
- Now, she's... - Yes.

1537
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,519
practically Korean.

1538
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,029
The non-Korean members in our group...

1539
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,729
have to deal with things personally,

1540
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,359
such as bank issues and phone network issues.

1541
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,900
I listen to her when she's on the phone, and I'm fascinated.

1542
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,940
The fact that she understands everything.

1543
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,300
It fascinates me.

1544
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,640
That's a tough thing to do.

1545
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
You know, living in a foreign country...

1546
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,110
while visiting your parents a couple of times a year.

1547
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,879
I once thought about going home late at night...

1548
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,150
without telling anyone.

1549
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,419
I thought hard...

1550
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,619
about how to take my suitcase without making a noise...

1551
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,890
- at the entrance. - But you held yourself back?

1552
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,620
My passport was in the company building.

1553
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,889
I had to sneak into the building and get it...

1554
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,260
if I wanted to leave.

1555
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,529
- You gave them your passport. - You had a detailed plan.

1556
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,430
But it was impossible, realistically speaking.

1557
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,199
You might have left if you had sorted that out.

1558
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,240
I might have.

1559
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,700
- I was planning to leave with Momo. - With Momo?

1560
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,739
(Her friend from the same country had the same idea.)

1561
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,239
- That's hilarious. - At least, you won't be lonely.

1562
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,310
Right.

1563
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,180
Did you bring your cards?

1564
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:22,079
Yes, I did.

1565
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,150
You did?

1566
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,389
- The bill is going to be high. - Yes.

1567
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,620
It's going to be a big game.

1568
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,959
- This is a bit... - Yes.

1569
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,460
This one is going to cost you.

1570
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,290
(Punching)

1571
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,130
Why did you do that?

1572
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,259
- I want to gather good energy. - I see.

1573
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,370
If I do well in this game, I'll have good energy for later.

1574
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,640
Shall we do it now?

1575
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,000
What can we do?

1576
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,270
Do you have any games you play with your friends?

1577
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,010
(Pondering)

1578
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,909
"I came alone. Two came."

1579
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,579
- I know this. - "Three came." That game.

1580
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,150
That game is from the 1990s.

1581
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,920
- Is it from the 1990s? - Yes.

1582
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,119
(Honorary Korean)

1583
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,280
What about this one?

1584
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,489
It's simple.

1585
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,819
(Yeon Seok suggests a game.)

1586
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,989
- Here is a napkin. - Yes.

1587
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,660
- Each person holds one side. - Yes?

1588
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,329
- The least... - The one who has the smallest part?

1589
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,430
We can decide on the rule.

1590
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,800
- The smallest? - The smallest should pay.

1591
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,499
- Right. - The one who has the smallest part?

1592
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
(The one who rips the napkin the smallest loses.)

1593
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,469
- I like this game. - Wait. Don't hold it yet.

1594
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,839
Do you work at a game research center?

1595
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,070
- You know good games. - Exactly.

1596
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,210
- Where do you want to hold? - I'll hold here.

1597
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,440
(Jae Suk)

1598
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,940
Is there a secret?

1599
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,910
- I don't know. - I don't have to hold the corner.

1600
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,249
(Regretting)

1601
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,420
This is a little...

1602
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,219
- Don't move. - You can't move.

1603
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,589
- You don't get to move. - No.

1604
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,020
- Jihyo. - Yes?

1605
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,090
I didn't know what this would be like.

1606
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,660
Does the person with the smallest piece pay?

1607
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,890
- The smallest piece? Okay. - Yes.

1608
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,030
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1609
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,830
It'll be either one of you.

1610
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,899
(Celebrating)

1611
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,499
Sana.

1612
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,840
- Yes? - We were fooled.

1613
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,239
- Wait. - We should've held the inside.

1614
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,539
But mine is much bigger than yours.

1615
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,909
- You're right. - Isn't mine bigger?

1616
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,509
No, it's not.

1617
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,180
Yours is longer, though.

1618
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,579
- I'll pay. - Yours is smaller in area.

1619
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,390
- Its area was smaller. - Yes.

1620
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,059
I should've held the inside. Gosh.

1621
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,330
I didn't do anything, but you all pulled.

1622
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,829
Can I pay?

1623
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,059
(Jae Suk pays for lunch.)

1624
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,859
- Here. - Thanks for the lunch.

1625
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,169
- It's nothing. - Thank you for the lunch.

1626
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,170
It's nothing.

1627
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,510
Thank you.

1628
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,769
How do we go back? Wait.

1629
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,009
Don't you know the direction? You said we should go to the left.

1630
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,609
- We can go this way. - Which way is better?

1631
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,350
- We can go this way. - This way?

1632
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,650
We'll pass that cafe again if we go this way.

1633
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,919
(An uncomfortable reunion)

1634
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,750
- What do we do? - I know.

1635
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,360
- There are customers. - Yes, there are indeed.

1636
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,129
- One person. - They're looking around.

1637
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,290
There are two, and they're looking at clothing.

1638
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,430
I should've given my autograph on the clock. I feel so bad.

1639
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,070
(Hi!)

1640
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,069
- You have customers. - Thanks.

1641
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,599
- Good luck today. - I'm sorry.

1642
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,010
No worries.

1643
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,769
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1644
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,080
- Good luck. - I'll visit again.

1645
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,240
(Awkward smiles)

1646
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,409
- Later, you come by... - Yes?

1647
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,850
- and grab a coffee. - Yes. I'll buy clothes too.

1648
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,550
- Buy a hat too. - Yes.

1649
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,589
- Hello. - Hi.

1650
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,119
You look better in person.

1651
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,315
Thank you. I look better, don't I?

1652
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,990
- Yes. - You're like a high school student.

1653
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,499
(Overblown praise)

1654
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,030
Thank you.

1655
00:59:23,356 --> 00:59:24,526
That was...

1656
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,229
I can't agree with him, but...

1657
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,000
That was how he saw me.

1658
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,339
I won't deny what he said.

1659
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,710
- Do you agree? - Yes.

1660
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,379
It was his personal opinion.

1661
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,380
- I'll respect that. - Okay.

1662
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:39,180
Okay. We'll talk based on facts today.

1663
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,280
Based on facts. All right. Sana.

1664
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,449
Look, this is a place for a personal color test.

1665
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,649
- You're right. - Yes.

1666
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,789
- Have you done it? - A personal color test?

1667
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,790
- No. - No, I haven't.

1668
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:49,419
- I have. - Really?

1669
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,459
- I want to guess yours. - Guess.

1670
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,359
- What is my personal color? - Something yellowish.

1671
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,659
- Jae Suk. - "Yellowish."

1672
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,760
Yours is monotone.

1673
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,669
Pastel colors suit you, don't they?

1674
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,899
I prefer vivid colors.

1675
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,439
I see. You do?

1676
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,609
- "You do?" - I get it.

1677
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,009
(Sana's talk beats Jae Suk's.)

1678
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,010
Sana.

1679
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,279
Do we know where we're going?

1680
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,349
Yes, we're almost there.

1681
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,650
- Are we? - Yes.

1682
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,280
It's Geumnam Market.

1683
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,919
- It's a market. - It's Geumnam Market.

1684
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,949
(The second spare time is near Geumnam Market.)

1685
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,749
There are lots of delicious foods in Geumnam Market.

1686
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,219
- That's right. - Donuts.

1687
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,360
It looks delicious.

1688
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,960
Glutinous rice donuts are always good.

1689
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,490
This is what is fun about the market.

1690
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,660
I think we're almost here.

1691
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:32,699
Yes. The closer we are, the more dakgangjeong places there are.

1692
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,799
- Is that right? - Yes.

1693
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,400
I think it's a dakgangjeong place.

1694
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,139
- Choi Hong Sik. - Hong Sik.

1695
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,239
"The only path taken with passion."

1696
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,079
"A life devoted to spicy flavor."

1697
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,149
(Spicy flavor?)

1698
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,349
"Even after 25 years of hard work..."

1699
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,250
"from 7am to 2am,"

1700
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,690
"I always feel refreshed when someone says, 'It's delicious.'"

1701
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,389
"Whenever possible, please visit me."

1702
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,589
"I'll treat you to a bowl of a sweet and spicy dish."

1703
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,890
- What? Is it a restaurant? - Wait. A restaurant?

1704
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,600
- I think it's a restaurant. - Yes.

1705
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,429
(What restaurant would it be?)

1706
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,769
- I think we're almost there. - We're almost there.

1707
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:05,368
Give me a second.

1708
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,800
- Tteokbokki? - This place is...

1709
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,570
- This? - Is this?

1710
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,309
- It's tteokbokki. - Is it here?

1711
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,510
- I told you. - It is 25-1.

1712
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,640
- I don't think this is it. - Is this it?

1713
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,149
Hi, how are you?

1714
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,809
- Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi.

1715
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:20,310
- Hi. - How are you?

1716
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,580
Hello.

1717
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,279
(Choi Hong Sik, The second Whenever Guest)

1718
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,219
- It's a snack bar. - Are you Choi Hong Sik?

1719
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,449
- Yes. - Nice to meet you.

1720
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,020
- Hi. - Let's go in.

1721
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,029
That's why it said, "Spicy flavor."

1722
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,129
(Tteokbokki place with a cozy kitchen and dining area)

1723
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,629
Has your busy time passed?

1724
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,130
Yes, it has passed.

1725
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,829
On our way to this place,

1726
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:40,969
we were guessing many types of restaurants.

1727
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,639
I thought it was a gukbap place.

1728
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,839
Because you work from 7am to 2am.

1729
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,309
I meant from when I woke up.

1730
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,139
(It means the hours that he's awake.)

1731
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,940
So, what's the business hour?

1732
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,649
Around 9am, I start to turn on the stoves.

1733
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,419
- Yes. - And I open until 10pm.

1734
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,219
Then, I go to the market and head home.

1735
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,619
By then, it's around 1:30 or 2am.

1736
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,589
Do you run this place alone?

1737
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,619
I run it alone.

1738
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,830
(He runs the place alone.)

1739
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,959
It's been 13 years since I opened this shop.

1740
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,799
I also ran one in Songpa-gu for 12 years before this place.

1741
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,629
- Running a snack bar for 25 years? - Yes.

1742
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,969
- Yes. - I see.

1743
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,599
That's amazing.

1744
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,739
The elementary school kids who used to come to my store...

1745
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,009
now have finished their military service.

1746
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,410
- That's right. - I see.

1747
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,540
The other day, one of them came by...

1748
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,179
on his vacation from the army...

1749
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,079
- and got me coffee with his salary. - Did he?

1750
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,119
He used to be one of my regulars.

1751
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,120
I see.

1752
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:33,489
Since Geumnam Market became popular,

1753
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,819
I guess you have quite a lot of customers.

1754
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,390
Yes, I have many regular customers.

1755
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,490
- What can I get you? - Tteokbokki.

1756
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,630
Tteokbokki it is.

1757
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,499
Do you have days off?

1758
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,100
Yes, I do. I rest on Sundays, no matter what.

1759
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,370
Instead, I work hard Monday through Saturday.

1760
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,440
I work those days, no matter what.

1761
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,779
That's because it's my promise to my customers...

1762
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,879
that I will open this place during this time,

1763
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,579
so they can come here during those hours.

1764
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,420
I can't let myself break the promise because it's my rule.

1765
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,659
Since you always have small talk...

1766
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,789
- With your customers. - You're great at conversing.

1767
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,790
Exactly.

1768
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,989
I've learned from you a lot, Yoo Jae Suk.

1769
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,300
- From me? - Yes.

1770
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,399
No offense, but looking at you two,

1771
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,799
- you somehow look alike. - I thought so too.

1772
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,429
- We somehow look alike. - Yes.

1773
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,469
- You both are wearing glasses. - Yes.

1774
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,270
Usually, those who are thin with glasses...

1775
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,210
have many aspects that are similar to mine.

1776
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,879
He especially looks like you in that photo, Jae Suk.

1777
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,609
I've been thinking the same.

1778
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,180
If he had glasses on...

1779
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,149
- It's him, though. - I know.

1780
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,389
- He's naturally good at talking. - Yes.

1781
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,790
- He's really good. - Yes.

1782
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,789
Doesn't your family complain?

1783
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:44,229
Or ask to go on a trip for a vacation?

1784
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,889
My kids are all grown-ups now.

1785
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,360
They don't hang out with me.

1786
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,359
How old are your children?

1787
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,229
The firstborn is 36 years old.

1788
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,499
I see.

1789
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,169
My second child is a girl, and she is married.

1790
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,970
- She's living abroad. - I see.

1791
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,639
- That's right. I have good news. - What is it?

1792
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,609
My daughter just had a baby a few days ago.

1793
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,010
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1794
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,949
- So, you have a grandchild now. - Yes.

1795
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,149
Then, you should visit your daughter, right?

1796
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,650
I'm too tired to travel.

1797
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,919
You're waiting for your daughter to come with your grandchild.

1798
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,289
- She has to come here. - Yes, she should.

1799
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,690
His daughter and grandchild should visit him.

1800
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:18,629
- We actually had lunch. - Yes?

1801
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,729
But we'd love to try your food.

1802
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,229
- Your tteokbokki. - Could we try some?

1803
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,360
Of course.

1804
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,299
- I'll get some for you. - Thanks. Just a little, please.

1805
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,369
- Okay. I'll be right back. - Okay.

1806
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,239
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1807
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,339
In Japan, are there any snacks...

1808
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,470
- that you have in your school days? - I want to know that too.

1809
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,379
- When you go to a takoyaki place, - In Osaka...

1810
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,979
there is something called takosen.

1811
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,980
- What is it? - Takosen?

1812
01:04:38,981 --> 01:04:41,649
- Tako sandwich? - It has something...

1813
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,849
- I see. - that looks like cookies.

1814
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,849
- You put takoyaki between them. - I see.

1815
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:47,919
I've never heard about it.

1816
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,559
I had that a lot.

1817
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,530
- Takoyaki is really famous. - Yes, you're right.

1818
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:56,229
Do you like snacks such as tteokbokki, Jihyo?

1819
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,499
Yes, I like it.

1820
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,600
What if you had to choose only one?

1821
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,239
Tteokbokki, sundae, fritters, or fishcake?

1822
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,499
I'd choose sundae without hesitation.

1823
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,739
- Sundae? - Really?

1824
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,169
I like the intestines of sundae.

1825
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,609
I'd choose fritters.

1826
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,610
You choose fritters.

1827
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,180
With tteokbokki sauce.

1828
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,750
- I like tteokbokki. - Okay.

1829
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,480
I'll choose it depending on my mood.

1830
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,520
Was that an option too?

1831
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,389
- I didn't expect that answer. - Yes.

1832
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,389
I go for a different thing, depending on the day.

1833
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,819
- What will you choose today? - Today...

1834
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,429
I feel like I want fishcake.

1835
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,459
(Jae Suk chose fishcake after pondering)

1836
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,300
- Because it comes with soup. - I see.

1837
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,769
It's perfect to eat together.

1838
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,169
- Exactly. - We chose all different things.

1839
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,569
- She's right. - We can order one of each.

1840
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:34,600
That's right.

1841
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:38,010
(Meantime, the owner of the snack bar...)

1842
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,439
(Tteokbokki)

1843
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,579
(Fritters)

1844
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,579
(Sundae)

1845
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,719
(A platter of TteokFriSun)

1846
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,050
It's a set.

1847
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,219
- It looks so delicious. - It looks so good.

1848
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,390
- Look at them. - Gosh.

1849
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:00,130
You probably heard us talking.

1850
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,530
You probably heard what Jihyo said.

1851
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,270
- I heard her from behind. - I see.

1852
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,130
Thank you.

1853
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,599
Which one do people prefer between wheat rice cakes or rice cakes?

1854
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,410
It depends on their personal taste.

1855
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,509
So, everyone is different.

1856
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:15,979
People usually want wheat rice cakes and rice cakes together.

1857
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,180
- It's a bit spicy. - It's so good.

1858
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,550
It's sweet and spicy.

1859
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,579
I make my own sauce for this.

1860
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,090
Really?

1861
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,089
(Enjoying)

1862
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,960
Sana, you said you liked fritters dipped in tteokbokki sauce.

1863
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,460
- Right. - And Jihyo is so...

1864
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,860
She went right for the intestines.

1865
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,730
- She's eating lungs right away. - She goes for the lungs.

1866
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,099
They go so well together..

1867
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,799
- Is it tasty? - It's so tasty.

1868
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,399
I fry all the fritters myself here.

1869
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,369
I roll all the seaweed rolls myself too.

1870
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,509
- You rolled them all? - Really?

1871
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,510
Of course.

1872
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,479
- It's so good. Do you deliver too? - They're amazing.

1873
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,610
Yes, I do deliveries.

1874
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,249
- It's a shame we ate. - We ate before coming here.

1875
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,450
But I can still enjoy it.

1876
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,190
Is this liver?

1877
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,190
- That's liver. - No, it's not.

1878
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,989
- This is liver. - I'm sorry.

1879
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,599
- So this is liver. - This is liver.

1880
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,459
- And this is the heart. - I see. So this is the heart.

1881
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,600
The famous heart.

1882
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,600
Jae Suk, try this.

1883
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,540
I don't enjoy eating the heart.

1884
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,900
No?

1885
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,740
Okay.

1886
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,010
You won some awards. What are those?

1887
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,840
An elementary school student gave it to me.

1888
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,509
He came to eat since he was a preschooler.

1889
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,519
- He's now in middle school. - I see.

1890
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,520
- That's so cute. - And...

1891
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:31,549
I think he had an activity in school.

1892
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:33,289
- Giving an award to someone. - I see.

1893
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,119
- So he gave you that? - Yes, he did.

1894
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,430
I put it up there to commemorate it.

1895
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,189
Goodness. That's so touching.

1896
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,500
That's so sweet.

1897
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,259
He still comes from time to time.

1898
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,269
- Is that so? - Yes.

1899
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:47,229
Then does the student get a discount or anything?

1900
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,539
Well, I give him some more without notice.

1901
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,169
(He secretly gives him some more.)

1902
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,440
When he wants 1, I give him 2.

1903
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,609
It must've been so touching when you received that.

1904
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,180
Of course. It felt like I was on cloud nine.

1905
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,109
- I see. - I'm sure you did.

1906
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,980
I have my wings here. Can't you see them?

1907
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:02,880
He's such a smooth talker.

1908
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,690
I told him right away that he had no wings.

1909
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,759
(The two who resemble each other hit it off.)

1910
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,789
Since you gave us tasty food,

1911
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,829
- I really want to give you some... - Seriously. Before coming here...

1912
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:17,829
To our regret, we played a game with a cafe owner,

1913
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:18,830
but we couldn't give him a present.

1914
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:19,869
- So... - I see.

1915
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,639
- Let's give him a big smile. - All right.

1916
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,440
- We'll try to do that. - Okay.

1917
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,640
- Jihyo? - Okay.

1918
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,580
- That's... - That was too mean, right?

1919
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,380
I was worried about this falling.

1920
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,180
- "That was too mean?" - Goodness.

1921
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,719
- Jihyo. - Yes?

1922
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,820
I love it.

1923
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,649
You seem so comfortable.

1924
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,060
I love that you say those things.

1925
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,930
- Throw it up to here. - Make it roll.

1926
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:47,699
Please.

1927
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,300
(Their goal is to earn two coupons.)

1928
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,370
- Please. - What's the number?

1929
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:54,670
- It's zero. - Goodness.

1930
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,139
Gosh, today... Can you call me again another day?

1931
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,979
I don't feel good today. I can't do anything right.

1932
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:03,980
This is...

1933
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:05,579
We just need to do it once out of the ten tries.

1934
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,350
- We should do it well then. - Right. We should do it well.

1935
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,180
All right. Let's begin Round One.

1936
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,889
- I need to crack open this? - Yes.

1937
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,150
- I'll crack it. - Okay.

1938
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,119
"On holidays with good weather, go trekking at 1.5 times the speed..."

1939
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,159
"to become healthy."

1940
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,589
- An Arc'teryx windbreaker. - A windbreaker.

1941
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,599
(A luxurious windbreaker)

1942
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,469
- Arc'teryx. - A luxurious windbreaker.

1943
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,899
When you go out for a walk...

1944
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,739
(This mission to win a windbreaker)

1945
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,069
(Food Expert Quiz)

1946
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:32,610
(Guess the name of the food after looking at the picture)

1947
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,070
(Sighing)

1948
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,280
- Name of the food? But... - I see.

1949
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,649
It doesn't come to mind right away.

1950
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,609
It's not just Korean food, right?

1951
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,619
It can be any food.

1952
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,079
We did this when Kim Yeon Koung was here.

1953
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,790
- Did you do well? - No, we were bad at it.

1954
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,349
- In Round One, - We are...

1955
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,860
- Gosh. - you need to get one right each.

1956
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,930
Gosh. This can be difficult.

1957
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,389
- Let's do a good job. - This is a practice round.

1958
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,660
The order is important too.

1959
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,899
- It's a practice round, so... - Jae Suk will go first.

1960
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,900
Okay.

1961
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,200
Here comes the question.

1962
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,269
- In 1, 2, 3. - Bibimbap.

1963
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:06,169
(Incorrect)

1964
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,909
- Bibimbap. - It's beef tartare bibimbap.

1965
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,439
- There are more letters. - It was five letters.

1966
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,440
Jae Suk, below it...

1967
01:10:10,441 --> 01:10:11,750
(They need to give an answer that fits the given number of letters.)

1968
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,579
- Now, let's... - I wasn't sure...

1969
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,149
if it were Jeonju or beef tartare.

1970
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,020
Next, it's Jihyo. Here comes the question.

1971
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,689
In 1, 2, 3.

1972
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:21,560
- Hot pot bulgogi. - Gosh, that's good.

1973
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,260
Sana.

1974
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,460
In 1, 2, 3.

1975
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,600
- Cheese gimbap. - Right.

1976
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,500
Next, Yeon Seok. Here comes the question.

1977
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:34,840
- In 1, 2, 3. - Naengmyeon.

1978
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,599
- You got it right. - So this is how it will be?

1979
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,639
Yes. It will be something like this.

1980
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,140
Okay. I think we have a chance.

1981
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,570
- We can do it. - In Round One, at least.

1982
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,909
- All right. - Okay.

1983
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,309
- But... - We'll win Round One...

1984
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,709
- when the game begins... - Let's go.

1985
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:46,749
- for the owner here. - Let's go.

1986
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,079
In 1, 2, 3.

1987
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,180
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1988
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,090
- We'll go in this order. - Okay.

1989
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,620
- We need to do it right. - Why is it making me so nervous?

1990
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,230
- It's making me nervous. - I have a heartache now.

1991
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,999
- Seriously. - You'll go, right?

1992
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,129
- Yes. - Give us easy ones.

1993
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,699
- First, Jae Suk. - Let's begin.

1994
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,300
Here comes the question.

1995
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:07,300
In 1, 2, 3.

1996
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,469
- Seaweed... - Incorrect!

1997
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,299
(Time's up.)

1998
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,910
In 1, 2, 3.

1999
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,070
- Seaweed... - Incorrect!

2000
01:11:13,071 --> 01:11:14,309
- They're seaweed rolls. - Unbelievable.

2001
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,510
- Why would you... - I think he said seaweed rolls.

2002
01:11:16,825 --> 01:11:18,449
- That's strange. - We're at a snack bar,

2003
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,080
- and seaweed rolls are... - I think he said seaweed rolls.

2004
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,449
That's strange.

2005
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,980
(Grunting)

2006
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,619
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

2007
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,489
- We lose if it goes like this? - I am...

2008
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,220
(Feeling the eyes)

2009
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,559
Jihyo is...

2010
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,820
- She's no joke. - I'm sorry.

2011
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,529
- The owner is... - I really wanted to win.

2012
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,800
- I'm sorry. - He looked...

2013
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,200
He looked so disappointed.

2014
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,830
Because I went first...

2015
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,299
- It gave you pressure? - It gave me pressure.

2016
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,669
- Shall we start from that side? - Okay.

2017
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,769
Then you need to change seats.

2018
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,410
Is that so? What a shame.

2019
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,780
I couldn't remember it at the moment.

2020
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,750
You had them just earlier.

2021
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,950
You had them just earlier.

2022
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,689
(He has nothing to say.)

2023
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,019
- Right, sir. - Yes.

2024
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,350
That's a good point.

2025
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,520
- That was... - I apologize.

2026
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,760
I get nervous when we play games.

2027
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,560
- I understand. - All right.

2028
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,159
- Okay. In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2029
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,170
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2030
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,769
Gosh. I couldn't do this well the last time.

2031
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:16,200
- Do it like we're watching TV. - Yeon Seok.

2032
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:18,940
- Right. - Ready.

2033
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:22,039
Here comes the question. In 1, 2, 3.

2034
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,310
- Tofu with stir-fried kimchi. - Right.

2035
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,049
- Next one. - I'm sorry,

2036
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,379
but can you put that down fast?

2037
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,679
I couldn't see how many letters it had. I'm sorry.

2038
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,049
(She's become competitive.)

2039
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:32,349
- She's sensitive. - She became competitive.

2040
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,959
- Jihyo is sensitive. - She became competitive.

2041
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,060
Here comes...

2042
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,229
the question. In 1, 2, 3.

2043
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,659
- Rice cake soup. - All right.

2044
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,330
You should've given me something like that.

2045
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,130
Next, Sana.

2046
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,400
Here comes the question.

2047
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,539
In 1, 2, 3.

2048
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,699
- Incorrect! - Rice cake skewers?

2049
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,799
Sausage and rice cake skewers?

2050
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,939
- Incorrect! - Rice cake skewers?

2051
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,940
(Sausage and rice cake skewers)

2052
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:54,579
- Sausage and rice cake skewers? - This was difficult.

2053
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,640
- It's... - This one was difficult.

2054
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,409
I couldn't see the sausage because of the sauce.

2055
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,480
Right.

2056
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,380
(She points it out, even though it's late.)

2057
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,249
I really like sausage and rice cake skewers.

2058
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,289
Why did I get it wrong?

2059
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,319
- I know. - You knew what it was?

2060
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,729
- That's my favorite. Seriously. - Is that so?

2061
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,330
- It doesn't come to mind. - Right.

2062
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,129
- I know. This is... - Gosh. Thank you.

2063
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,130
Seriously. It doesn't...

2064
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:17,330
- He's different from earlier. - When you watch this on TV...

2065
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,429
- He missed the seaweed rolls, so... - Right.

2066
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,439
(The variety show instructor has nothing to say.)

2067
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,440
I can't remember when it's my turn.

2068
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:23,799
- That's how it goes. - Everyone feels the same.

2069
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,470
Sana, you can't remember it when it's your turn.

2070
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,109
Sana, do you want to go first?

2071
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,110
- I'll be the third one to go. - Should I push this? Okay.

2072
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,549
(Yeon Seok will be the last one to go.)

2073
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,149
- I suddenly feel pressured. - Can you...

2074
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,180
remove snacks from the picture? Because...

2075
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,349
when we get it wrong...

2076
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,519
(They can't remember the names when they are snacks.)

2077
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,749
We need to get it right this time.

2078
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,750
All right. Let's cheer up.

2079
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:42,190
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

2080
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,490
Sana will start. It's your fourth try.

2081
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,160
Here comes...

2082
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,060
the question.

2083
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,830
In 1, 2, 3.

2084
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,530
- Incorrect! - Gosh, Sana!

2085
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,299
(It's a corn dog.)

2086
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,339
- You eat this a lot. - I thought it was a corndog,

2087
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,040
and I thought I needed more letters.

2088
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:05,310
I told you I was a foreigner.

2089
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,849
- But... - You should have that in mind.

2090
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,880
- How do you say it in Japanese? - Please let it slide once.

2091
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,319
"Corn dog."

2092
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,889
- There are 6 letters. - Right. It has 6 letters.

2093
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:15,089
It has six letters. You read it like that.

2094
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:16,190
Because this is...

2095
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,929
(They fail even though they come up with global excuses.)

2096
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,029
- If I had said, "Corndog," - If you had...

2097
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,829
- we would've gotten it right. - At least we could argue about it.

2098
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,259
- Say anything next time. - You should've insisted...

2099
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,669
that you were right.

2100
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,930
I'll say anything that comes up.

2101
01:14:26,513 --> 01:14:27,355
Hold on.

2102
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,599
- Going first is... - Don't you change the players...

2103
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,639
about now?

2104
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,710
- When I rolled the die... - We don't have that.

2105
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:35,380
You're killing her again with that.

2106
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:37,880
(Jihyo lowers her head.)

2107
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:40,650
Jihyo, did you notice this? Your voice became colder.

2108
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,849
- I'm sorry. - I didn't know...

2109
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:43,850
your voice was so low.

2110
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,420
- She's become sensitive. - Gosh. Your voice was this low?

2111
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,960
I'll do my best.

2112
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,560
I didn't get it wrong until now, though.

2113
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,430
- You're telling that to me, right? - I'm just saying.

2114
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,459
(He has nothing to say.)

2115
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,669
Gosh, this is crazy.

2116
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,869
- Shall I go first then? - Yes.

2117
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,699
Going first is pressuring.

2118
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,969
Until when are we going to...

2119
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,640
- just change seats? - Seriously.

2120
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,410
Gosh, this is making me crazy.

2121
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,140
- We're back to the original order. - It's the original order.

2122
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,350
Is that so?

2123
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:16,050
(They changed seats while making a fuss.)

2124
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,290
(They're back to the original order.)

2125
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,889
(Laughing)

2126
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,920
- Sana, will you try going last? - Shall I?

2127
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,629
I think Sana going last is a good choice.

2128
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,999
(They're trying out all the options.)

2129
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,359
Now, the sixth try.

2130
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,969
(It's already their 6th try.)

2131
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:35,769
We can't just give him a windbreaker only.

2132
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:37,040
(They might not even be able to give him a windbreaker.)

2133
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,170
All right. Let's cheer up.

2134
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,509
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2135
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,609
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2136
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:42,780
Say, "Here we go."

2137
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,779
- The sixth try. - We need to get it right.

2138
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,309
Let's relax.

2139
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,280
- Let's relax. - Here comes the question.

2140
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,290
- In 1, 2... Okay. - Shrimp fries.

2141
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,219
- Oh, so you can say it right away. - Good job.

2142
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,220
Next, Jihyo. Here comes the question.

2143
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,060
- In 1, 2... Okay. - Tanghulu.

2144
01:15:57,190 --> 01:15:59,045
- I could've gotten that right. - Next, Yeon Seok. Here comes...

2145
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:00,231
Just look at it relaxedly.

2146
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,899
the question. In 1, 2...

2147
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,200
- Walnut cakes. I really love them. - Sana.

2148
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:06,970
(Yeon Seok got it right too.)

2149
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:08,799
- Sana. - Walnut cakes.

2150
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,170
- I really love them. - Sana.

2151
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,879
- Relax. - Gosh. I'm going to hyperventilate.

2152
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,079
- Hold on. - Please.

2153
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,080
(There's only Sana left.)

2154
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,610
Breathe.

2155
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,449
She can't breathe. Hold on.

2156
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,750
- Okay. - Let her calm down.

2157
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,389
Just imagine that you're watching TV at home.

2158
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:28,460
- I know. - Think that you're watching TV.

2159
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,460
- No. - Sana.

2160
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,090
- One more. Okay. - You succeed if you get it right.

2161
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,660
Here comes the question.

2162
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,860
- In 1, 2, 3. - Abalone porridge.

2163
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:38,769
(They succeed in Round 1.)

2164
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,830
- Yes! - Goodness.

2165
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,069
- Abalone porridge. - My gosh!

2166
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:43,600
(Sana did it!)

2167
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,110
- Abalone porridge. - My gosh!

2168
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:48,410
(Smiling broadly)

2169
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,680
Abalone porridge.

2170
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,510
(They succeed in their 6th try.)

2171
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:56,949
See? Sana can do it!

2172
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,820
Abalone porridge wasn't easy.

2173
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,819
- Gosh, good job. - You did great.

2174
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,020
I'm so relieved.

2175
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,619
- Success. Okay. - We won the windbreaker!

2176
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,989
(They won the windbreaker in Round 1.)

2177
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,459
- Next. - Okay. Next.

2178
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:10,799
Now, you need to decide now.

2179
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,030
- Will you go to Round Two? Or... - Of course, I should go.

2180
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,000
But if we fail, you won't get the windbreaker.

2181
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,540
It's okay.

2182
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,839
I have one already. I'm wearing one these days,

2183
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,270
so that's enough.

2184
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,709
(He's the saint of Geumho-dong.)

2185
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:26,280
- If you say so... - It will make me feel sorrier.

2186
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,850
- If you break the cookie... - Sir.

2187
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,250
I'll be honest with you. We're not in our best condition.

2188
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,220
It's okay.

2189
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,820
Let's see what the present is first.

2190
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:39,859
(Exclaiming)

2191
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,329
- What is it? - "You only cared about..."

2192
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,059
"the customers who were hot in summer."

2193
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,799
"We wish your kitchen were cool too."

2194
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,999
"A portable air conditioner."

2195
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,099
Goodness.

2196
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,140
(Round 2 present: A portable air conditioner.)

2197
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,869
(The air conditioner comes in.)

2198
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,000
Gosh, that's...

2199
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,269
(We hope the kitchen is cool in summer.)

2200
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,779
(A portable air conditioner)

2201
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,079
You can put it over there.

2202
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,550
Right. In summer...

2203
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,580
- It's hot next to the stove. - It's so hot.

2204
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,079
- It's really hot. - It's so tough in summer.

2205
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,750
I really want to get him this.

2206
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,290
- Let's do this no matter what. - We should win this.

2207
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,189
I think we have to come back this time.

2208
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,529
(Round 2)

2209
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,059
(A round trip)

2210
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,129
- As you expected... - A round trip?

2211
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,159
Right?

2212
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,429
- This is... - Then the last person...

2213
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,499
- goes only once? - Only once.

2214
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,899
This is a good spot then.

2215
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,129
- This is a good spot. - You do it once.

2216
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,199
- Right. - Right?

2217
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,040
- Let's go in this order. - Let's try it in this order.

2218
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,670
Okay. Let's cheer.

2219
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,270
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2220
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,710
It's the seventh try.

2221
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,579
(We must succeed to win the air conditioner.)

2222
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,680
I feel so nervous.

2223
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,450
Here comes the question.

2224
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,450
- In 1, 2, 3. - Jokbal.

2225
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,960
Why do you make it sound like it's difficult?

2226
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,759
- Gosh, Jae Suk. - I looked at it thoroughly.

2227
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,889
(He's determined for no reason.)

2228
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:47,930
I looked at the picture thoroughly.

2229
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,400
Next, Jihyo.

2230
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,970
Here comes the question.

2231
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,700
- In 1, 2, 3. - Taco.

2232
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,670
- It was confusing. - Good.

2233
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:57,499
- Next, Yeon Seok. - We're doing great.

2234
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,040
Here comes the question.

2235
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,269
- In 1, 2, 3. - Kalguksu with clams!

2236
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,780
- Gosh, great. - How did you get it right?

2237
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,309
- Kalguksu with clams! - Gosh, great.

2238
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,580
How did you get it right?

2239
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,949
- Goodness. - That's amazing.

2240
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,219
(This quiz fool improved a lot.)

2241
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,619
- Great. - Goodness.

2242
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,019
(It's Sana's turn in no time.)

2243
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,459
- Sana. You can do it. - Next, Sana.

2244
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,990
Here comes the question.

2245
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,530
(This is...)

2246
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,999
- In 1, 2, 3. - Spicy marinated crab.

2247
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,229
(Spicy marinated crab)

2248
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,399
Spicy marinated crab.

2249
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,840
(Great job, Sana!)

2250
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,169
Goodness.

2251
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,539
(They didn't win the round yet.)

2252
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,440
She must've been so happy to shout like this.

2253
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,409
(They passed the halfway point.)

2254
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:40,309
- Good. - You did great.

2255
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,379
Next, Yeon Seok.

2256
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,879
(It's Yeon Seok's turn again.)

2257
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,780
Here comes the question.

2258
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,220
- In 1, 2, 3. - Salt bread.

2259
01:19:46,221 --> 01:19:47,249
All right!

2260
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,620
Hold on. I have a heartache.

2261
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,660
Let's go.

2262
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,790
- Let's go. You can do it. - Next, Jihyo.

2263
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,100
Here comes the question.

2264
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,559
In 1, 2, 3.

2265
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,600
Fried peppers.

2266
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,930
- I got it, right? - You got it.

2267
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,539
- I got it, right? - You got it.

2268
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:05,109
(The last question)

2269
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:06,870
- Seriously. - My goodness.

2270
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,540
Gosh, my shoulders are stiff now.

2271
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,409
- You can do it. - My shoulders are too stiff.

2272
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,809
- All right. - Let's go.

2273
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:13,180
- Let's go! - Round Two.

2274
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,409
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2275
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:15,519
Okay. Just relax and do it.

2276
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,019
- Here comes... - I got this.

2277
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,020
Let's do this.

2278
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,089
(Please.)

2279
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:23,260
- Here comes... - I got this. Let's do this.

2280
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:24,890
the question.

2281
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,089
- In 1, 2, 3. - Sweet potato...

2282
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,400
- Candied sweet potatoes. - Candied sweet potatoes.

2283
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,699
Candied sweet potatoes.

2284
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,799
In 1, 2, 3.

2285
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,570
- Sweet potato... - Candied sweet potatoes.

2286
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,299
(The answer is candied sweet potatoes.)

2287
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,370
Candied sweet potatoes.

2288
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,739
But didn't you count the numbers faster than before?

2289
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,109
You counted the numbers like this.

2290
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,680
Even so, he couldn't answer it.

2291
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,410
Because you intimidated him by counting fast...

2292
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,810
Incorrect.

2293
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,650
- It was candied sweet potatoes? - Yes.

2294
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,879
Why would you pick candied sweet potatoes?

2295
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,919
- Didn't you say it like this? - But sweet potatoes...

2296
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,089
- Right? - Right? Jae Suk.

2297
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,119
You said candied sweet potatoes like this.

2298
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,760
Didn't you say it like this?

2299
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,590
- I did. - Right?

2300
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,990
I could hear him because we were close.

2301
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,930
Also, they cut them like potatoes.

2302
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,230
But you said sweet potatoes.

2303
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:07,829
- You got it right. - That's true.

2304
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,199
- Hey! - I mean...

2305
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,239
You need to help me out!

2306
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,010
I want to help you out, but...

2307
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,510
- They cut them like potatoes. - You should've just said "Candied."

2308
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,450
You got the sweet potato right.

2309
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,880
You have three tries left.

2310
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,050
We still have three more tries.

2311
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,020
Gosh. You're so positive.

2312
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,519
We still have three more tries.

2313
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,950
(Sana sends a hopeful message to everyone.)

2314
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,359
We still have three more tries.

2315
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,859
I'm not sure if I should tell you this,

2316
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,130
but we had six tries left earlier.

2317
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:33,990
We had six tries left earlier.

2318
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,829
- So... - Let's cheer up.

2319
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,400
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

2320
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,299
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

2321
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,740
- This is your eighth try. - Let's go.

2322
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,000
Let's cheer up.

2323
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,169
(We must give him the air conditioner.)

2324
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:47,370
Jihyo's turn. Here comes...

2325
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,580
the question.

2326
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,010
- In 1, 2, 3. - Popcorn.

2327
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,979
- That was easy. - Here comes...

2328
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,210
- Go right away. - the question.

2329
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,049
- In 1, 2, 3. - Toast.

2330
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:57,119
- French toast. - It's French toast.

2331
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,150
- French toast. - Incorrect.

2332
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,889
- Why? - He corrected it.

2333
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,919
- Your first answer should be right. - But...

2334
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,990
They say it like this in France. "Toast French."

2335
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:05,689
(He's arguing creatively.)

2336
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,889
- I'm serious. - Incorrect.

2337
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:07,930
"I'm serious."

2338
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,329
- You had it earlier. - It's French toast.

2339
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:13,630
How could you not know what you had?

2340
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,740
Seaweed rolls too.

2341
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,870
- He was in a hurry, right? - Sana.

2342
01:22:22,528 --> 01:22:23,302
- All right. - We have two tries left.

2343
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,440
- Two more. - All right.
We still have two.

2344
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:26,709
Okay. Let's go.

2345
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,080
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2346
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,720
All right. Let's go.

2347
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,519
- We'll go now. - We'll succeed this time.

2348
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,719
- Okay. - Let's go.

2349
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,390
(We'll succeed this time.)

2350
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,659
(They have 2 tries left.)

2351
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,719
(Will there be a miracle?)

2352
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,930
Jihyo. Here comes...

2353
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,860
the question.

2354
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,960
- In 1, 2, 3. - Melon bread.

2355
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,929
- Gosh, you did well. - That was difficult.

2356
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,269
- In 1, 2, 3. - Melon bread.

2357
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:48,869
- Gosh, you did well. - That was difficult.

2358
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,540
That was difficult. I thought it was abalone.

2359
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,570
I thought it was a turtle.

2360
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,969
- But that... - I thought it was abalone.

2361
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,939
- We had that in the first episode. - They brought a weird picture.

2362
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,209
- We had them with Seung Won. - I mean...

2363
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,379
They brought something that looked like abalone...

2364
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,549
- and said it was melon bread. - It looked like broccoli too.

2365
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:02,719
- Right? - Yes.

2366
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,320
If I had this one, I would've gotten it wrong.

2367
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,250
- Good job, Jihyo. - Next, it's Jae Suk.

2368
01:23:07,848 --> 01:23:09,580
Here comes the question.

2369
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:11,860
- In 1, 2, 3. - Soft tofu stew.

2370
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,530
(Exclaiming)

2371
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,730
My goodness. You said it so fast.

2372
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:19,670
- Yeon Seok. Here comes... - I'll get it smoothly.

2373
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,100
the question.

2374
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,539
In 1, 2, 3.

2375
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,940
- Rice cake soup with dumplings. - That's right.

2376
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,669
- I thought it was dumpling soup. - They give you many foods...

2377
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,670
with dumplings.

2378
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,339
Dumping soup would've been wrong.

2379
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,509
Next, it's Sana.

2380
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:30,579
(Sana is at the halfway point.)

2381
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,850
Sana. Here comes the question.

2382
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,250
In 1, 2, 3.

2383
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,090
- Incorrect. - Carrot cake?

2384
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,550
- She got it, right? - She got the correct answer.

2385
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,919
But you waited before.

2386
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,989
- "In 1, 2, 3." - Right.

2387
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,760
- You waited like this before. - She's right.

2388
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:46,989
Incorrect.

2389
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:48,290
(It's a failure with no exception.)

2390
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,500
It's our last try.

2391
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,330
- Then, it's... - Sir, we were...

2392
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:56,569
Don't worry. It's okay.

2393
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,740
My gosh. This makes me even sorrier.

2394
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,369
(The last try)

2395
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,709
So that we can succeed...

2396
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,710
Okay. Let's cheer up...
- for the last try. - For the last try. Seriously.

2397
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:06,480
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2398
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,649
- The last try. - Your last try.

2399
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,119
- We can do it. - Let's do this.

2400
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,790
- Jihyo. - I'm so desperate to win.

2401
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,649
Let's do this.

2402
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,219
- Jihyo. - I'm so desperate to win.

2403
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,660
(It's their last chance to give an air conditioner to the owner.)

2404
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,129
Jihyo.

2405
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,300
I'm so desperate to win.

2406
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,471
Here comes...

2407
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,470
the question.

2408
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,029
- In 1, 2, 3. - Egg tart.

2409
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,499
- Right. - We had it today.

2410
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,440
- We had it today. - Since we had it today.

2411
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,109
- Right. - We had it today.

2412
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,369
(Jihyo is so reliable.)

2413
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,679
- Next, it's Jae Suk. - Good job.

2414
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,640
- Please. - Here comes the question.

2415
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,279
- In 1, 2, 3. - It's a soup. What is it?

2416
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,280
- Incorrect! - In 1, 2, 3.

2417
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:42,950
- It's a soup. What is it? - Incorrect!

2418
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:45,319
- Button mushroom... - Button mushroom soup?

2419
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,519
(Button mushroom soup)

2420
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,850
But the button mushroom is...

2421
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,389
Seriously. Just this once.

2422
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:50,419
- Look at the faces... - Please, just this once.

2423
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,420
- of the production crew. - Goodness.

2424
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,730
I can't see the button mushrooms in it.

2425
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,959
Seriously. Just this once.

2426
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,999
- Look at the faces... - Please, just this once.

2427
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,030
- of the production crew. - Goodness.

2428
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,800
Failure.

2429
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,740
That didn't come to mind.

2430
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,070
You know that we had that earlier too, right?

2431
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,610
(He's so consistent.)

2432
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,710
Great job.

2433
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,680
- I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.

2434
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,119
(The air conditioner is gone.)

2435
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,789
That's not important.

2436
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:22,919
What's important is that you came here.

2437
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,690
I'm terrible with food.

2438
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,029
- Oh, right. - Please take this, at least.

2439
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:29,059
- Right. - Right.

2440
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,599
- I'm so sorry, sir. - Gosh, I'm fine.

2441
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,759
This is our shirt.

2442
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,470
- There's a towel too. - I will wear it well. Right.

2443
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:35,969
- The tteokbokki was amazing. - Thank you.

2444
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,570
The seaweed rolls were amazing too.

2445
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:44,610
(Culprit Yoo Jae Suk)

2446
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,309
It would've been great if we had managed...

2447
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,319
to get him the cool air conditioner.

2448
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,349
Exactly.

2449
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,750
I'm sorry, Jihyo and Sana.

2450
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:53,619
- No. I'm sorry. - No.

2451
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:55,890
The incident at the cafe...

2452
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,059
seems to have been avenged.

2453
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,759
Would you like to have a word with him separately?

2454
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,360
I should've kept my mouth shut.

2455
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:05,299
It's okay. Cheer up.

2456
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,099
(It's okay. Cheer up.)

2457
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,600
I'm totally fine.

2458
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,740
You all have visited me,

2459
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:12,809
and there is nothing more precious than that.

2460
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:14,170
Thank you so much.

2461
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:17,240
Whenever possible, I think about making good food.

2462
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,010
(It's her first variety show appearance.)

2463
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:22,419
(She made a brave decision.)

2464
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:23,720
(First variety show appearance, Kim Da Mi)

2465
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,920
(Each person has to make it?)

2466
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,190
(What do I do?)

2467
01:26:27,191 --> 01:26:28,960
(The last puzzle piece of success is left in her hands.)

2468
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,430
(I feel nervous!)

2469
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,860
(Screaming)

2470
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:35,999
(Chuckling)

2471
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,059
(You have to look at it after hitting it.)

2472
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,130
(How can you look at it before hitting it?)

2473
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,800
(Da Mi is cornered.)

2474
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,369
(Push it like this!)

2475
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:43,700
(Assistant Son Suk Ku)

2476
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,070
(I want to make it happen.)

2477
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,809
(I'll come up with a plan.)

2478
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:48,039
(The two people start putting the puzzle together.)

2479
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,280
(How about like this?)

2480
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:50,780
(Going wild)

2481
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,879
(How do you think we are?)

2482
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,779
(You two are way off.)

2483
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,820
(The challenge still continues.)

2484
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:59,520
Gosh!

2485
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:00,890
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2486
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,019
(The puzzle was put together.)

2487
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,160
(I'm getting goosebumps!)

2488
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,990
- How did you do that? - What?

2489
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,159
I don't even know.

2490
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,629
(How will things end for them?)

2491
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:12,530
(Whenever Possible)

2492
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:20,870
(Whenever Possible)
