1
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:06,757
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,489
(Today's spare time, Bundang)

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,970
Are you here to work on a farm field?

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,030
- It's raining a lot. - I see.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,859
- You're fully prepared. Yes. - Wide-leg pants are trendy now.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,199
- Even with the umbrella, - Yes.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,530
- my pants get all wet. - I see.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,399
I don't know about today's Whenever Friend today.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,599
- I know who it is today. - I see.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,669
- Today's Whenever Friend... - Who is it?

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,669
Seeing how he knows, they can't be from my circle.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,710
- Right. They're actors. - I see.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,649
We ran into each other at the hair salon.

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,950
- The hair salon? - Yes.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,919
- Yes. We met at the hair salon. - I'm curious.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,279
- You did? - I was surprised.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,619
"What's he doing here?"

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,020
- "He?" - Yes.

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,219
But he still must be younger than me.

20
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,589
- Right. Yes. - Right?

21
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,119
He said, "I'll see you there."

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,336
- I was like, "What?" - Really?

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
That's when I figured it out. "Oh, him!"

24
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,929
- Seeing your reaction... - He's already been on our show.

25
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,799
(He's been on the show before.)

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,229
He's been on our show before.

27
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,999
It's Cho Jung Seok.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,299
(It's Cho Jung Seok.)

29
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,669
You guessed it right away.

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,440
(The correct answer is Cho Jung Seok.)

31
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,839
I got a good feeling that...

32
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,879
- it was Cho Jung Seok. - Yes, you're right.

33
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,780
- Yes. - He lives nearby too.

34
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,949
He lives in Pangyo.

35
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,510
- Really? - Yes. He lives there.

36
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,160
Is he the only Whenever Friend today?

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,580
There's one more. Guess who it is.

38
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,649
- Give me hints. I'll guess it. - Who could it be?

39
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,719
(He's feeling confident again.)

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,420
Well, she's older than me.

41
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,130
She's older than you. What about me?

42
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
She's younger than you.

43
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:24,499
(This woman's age is between Yeon Seok's and Jae Suk's.)

44
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,930
She was in so many famous movies.

45
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,699
It's Cho Yeo Jeong.

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,770
What?

47
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,040
(How did he figure it out this fast?)

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,480
(Feeling disappointed)

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,979
You seem so surprised.

50
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,449
- My gosh. - He's surprised.

51
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,879
The most famous movie that came to my mind was "Parasite."

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,419
- Right. - It's a global film.

53
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,019
- So true. - When I thought of those movies,

54
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,589
- she came to my mind. - Oh, my.

55
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,289
I was going to tease him about it, but I failed.

56
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,020
- You can't do that to me. - My gosh.

57
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,919
- I just got a feeling. - You have a good gut feeling.

58
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,559
Of course. I got a gut feeling.

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,559
I see Jung Seok from time to time.

60
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,259
But it's been a while since I've seen Yeo Jeong.

61
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,600
- They're here. - They are?

62
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,770
- There they are. - Hey, Cho Jung Seok!

63
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,029
- My gosh. - Yeo Jeong.

64
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,200
Hello.

65
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,299
- Hello. - Yeo Jeong, we met...

66
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,839
- Hello. - We met quite recently.

67
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,279
- At the Baeksang Arts Awards. - Yes.

68
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,839
- Jae Suk. - Jung Shik.

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,850
(Today's Whenever Friend, Cho Jung Seok)

70
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,380
It's nice to see you.

71
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,279
- Sit down, Jung Shik. - Gosh, Jae Suk.

72
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,719
- "Jung Shik?" - Jung Shik.

73
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,249
There's an announcer with that name.

74
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,349
I heard you ran into him at the hair salon.

75
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,689
- We met earlier. - I did.

76
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,790
So I didn't know you were joining us today.

77
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,259
But he gave me some hints...

78
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,429
- Right. - about today's Whenever Friends.

79
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,559
- And I figured it out right away. - He did.

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,370
- Really? - I knew it was the two of you.

81
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,339
I was getting my makeup and hair done.

82
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,770
He suddenly looked at me and said, "Hold on."

83
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,970
"Whenever Possible?"

84
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,810
He asked me that.

85
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,810
I said, "You didn't know?"

86
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,779
I recently met her at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

87
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,050
- At the Baeksang Arts Awards. - Yes, I met her there.

88
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,250
- The bagels here look amazing. - Oh, my.

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,149
Do you usually start with refreshments like this?

90
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,320
- Of course. - Yes.

91
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,849
- Did you eat? - Here you go.

92
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,559
I usually don't eat breakfast.

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,059
- But I had some food today. - Really? Why?

94
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,130
To play games.

95
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,159
What? Already?

96
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,659
Yes. I'm feeling a bit competitive.

97
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,930
Are you good at games?

98
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,769
I can tell she's enthusiastic.

99
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,599
- I'm not good at them. - Okay.

100
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,069
- But after watching your show, - Yes.

101
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,339
I wanted to give presents...

102
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,909
to the people who wrote to the show.

103
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,669
I'm not worried since I'm here with Jung Seok.

104
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,079
Gosh, no. I wasn't good at games the last time I was here.

105
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,079
I see Jung Seok a few times throughout the year.

106
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,219
But it's been a long time since I met you on a TV show.

107
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,220
It's been so long, right?

108
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,519
- Hasn't it been really long? - I can't remember.

109
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,549
- It's understandable for Yeo Jeong. - Why?

110
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,359
- Think about "Parasite." - I see. Her movie...

111
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,389
- Her movie was a global hit. - A global hit.

112
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,059
- That has nothing to do with it. - Right.

113
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,659
Jae Suk figured out it was you pretty quickly too.

114
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,729
- I... - I said you were...

115
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,529
- in a global movie. - Listen to the hints he gave me.

116
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,530
- I was amazing. - Yes.

117
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,829
- My hunch was great. - He figured it out at once.

118
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,439
I said you were in many famous movies.

119
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,839
- And He named you right away. - When I heard that hint,

120
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,869
I knew it was you.

121
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,039
- Gosh. - Yes.

122
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,339
- Thank you. - That's amazing.

123
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
That was the only hint you had?

124
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,879
- I figured it out right away. - At once.

125
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,210
- I knew it was you and... - What was the hint for me?

126
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,750
- As for you, - Yes.

127
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
He made it sound like...

128
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,479
- you were his close friend. - I did?

129
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,019
I got a feeling that you were comfortable.

130
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,390
We see each other so often.

131
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,080
It's a one-way thing. I feel uncomfortable around him.

132
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,760
- What? - Come on.

133
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,999
I only said that so you guys would laugh.

134
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,499
Jung Shik seems uncomfortable around you. You know?

135
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,529
- Why do you change our names? - Well...

136
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,039
- Why? Yeon Shik and Jung Shik. - He calls me Yeon Shik now.

137
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,069
Yeon Shik. By the way, Jung Shik...

138
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,040
Jung Seok said, "There's a guy with that name."

139
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,280
- Yes. There's a guy with that name. - There's a guy with that name.

140
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
That name, Jung Shik, sounds like a word...

141
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,620
- for a meal set. - Gosh, that was lame.

142
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,049
Yeo Jeong. Go ahead and eat.

143
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,389
(Wisely pulling himself out of the conversation)

144
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,689
- This is... - You two...

145
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,990
have great chemistry.

146
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
He won't play along.

147
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,489
- It was understandable. - By the way,

148
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,289
he came to the set when we were filming...

149
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,299
- the movie. - Right.

150
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,929
Yes. He told me he went to butter people up.

151
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,569
I did no such thing.

152
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,599
- You're spot on. - Right?

153
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,469
Come on. I brought you guys twisted breadsticks.

154
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,839
- Right. That day was fascinating. - Yes?

155
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,509
I was craving twisted breadsticks from traditional markets.

156
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,579
- Really? - I was checking them out on an app.

157
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,010
- Really? - Yes.

158
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,949
When he came, he brought twisted breadsticks.

159
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,019
- Right. - Yes.

160
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,049
- So I was so surprised. - I did.

161
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,320
He did a proper job of buttering people up.

162
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,989
He brought the perfect snack. Right?

163
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,990
Jung Seok.

164
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:15,029
- But I was deeply moved. - Yes.

165
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,860
- He has such a good personality. - Anyway...

166
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,960
How did you figure that?

167
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,870
You can tell by the way he comes to you first and says hello.

168
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,769
(Hesitant)

169
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,369
Why won't you confirm that?

170
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,799
She just complimented my personality.

171
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,340
- He has a good personality. - Why...

172
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,839
- That was my reaction. - He's a great guy.

173
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,310
- Jung Seok, why won't you agree? - You made me look bad.

174
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,280
I didn't have anything else to add.

175
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,179
So I didn't say anything else.

176
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,649
Right. She complimented you.

177
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,680
- So that's it. - What...

178
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,689
- Should we have done this? - What could we have done?

179
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,149
That's not right. You know?

180
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,289
"Right, he's got a great personality."

181
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,219
- You could say that. - He's a great guy.

182
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,029
Everyone knows that you have a great personality.

183
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,389
- They do? - The whole world knows.

184
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,699
- Right? - Of course.

185
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,860
- They all know that. - Yes.

186
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,469
I wanted to ask you a question.

187
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,229
You're still managing to host the show...

188
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,030
- with Yeon Seok somehow. - "With Yeon Seok?"

189
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,709
You said you two weren't hitting it off the last time I was here.

190
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,139
You were on our show during the first season.

191
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,480
- Yes. - Right?

192
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,279
After doing the mission with you for that episode,

193
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,809
I ended up in FC Bad Feet.

194
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,426
- When we had to kick the jegi. - The game of jegi.

195
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,880
Right. He's in FC Bad Feet.

196
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,219
By the way,

197
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,019
- they filmed a movie together. - Yes.

198
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,566
- "My Daughter Is a Zombie." - "My Daughter Is a Zombie."

199
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,059
The setting of the movie is really cute.

200
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,829
Your character is trying to train your daughter...

201
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,529
who turned into a zombie.

202
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,929
Right. My character does his best...

203
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,169
- to humanize her. - Right.

204
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,230
She's his daughter.

205
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,099
My daughter is a zombie.

206
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,869
(Jung Seok plays the dad of the zombie daughter.)

207
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,939
Greeting.

208
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,340
- Cham! - Is that her dance?

209
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,669
(Yeo Jeong plays the first love of Jung Seok's character...)

210
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,180
(and a zombie hunter.)

211
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,509
(It's a family comedy movie...)

212
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,979
(centering around a loving dad who launches...)

213
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,020
(a secret training to protect his zombie daughter.)

214
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,320
(Jung Seok's signature comedy acts are coming soon.)

215
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,649
There are so many movies about zombies.

216
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,459
- But this one... - Yes, it's so funny.

217
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,966
- It's such an original idea. - It's so unique.

218
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,259
- The setting is original, right? - Yes.

219
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,529
When I first got the offer to be in the movie,

220
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,000
I said I was in as soon as I heard he was in.

221
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,569
At first, I didn't even read the script.

222
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,899
I thought even if I only had one scene, I ought to do it.

223
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,469
- Really? - I wanted to do it.

224
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,539
We're long-time friends,

225
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,609
but we never had a chance to work together.

226
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,669
- Right. - Really?

227
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,379
We talked about when we'd get to work together.

228
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,110
Then I finally had a chance.

229
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,250
But I found out I had more than just one scene.

230
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,619
- Come on. There was no way... - "I have a lot of scenes."

231
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,519
the director was going to give only one scene to her.

232
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,819
Even so. I wanted to do it, even if I only had one scene.

233
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,120
- Really? - Yes.

234
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,959
- You must feel grateful. - I was very grateful.

235
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,259
- Right, Jung Seok? - Yes.

236
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,989
- I think it will be a fun one. - Really?

237
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,699
His signature comedy acts are already...

238
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,859
in the trailer.

239
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,629
Besides, Jung Shik's movie,

240
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,799
- "Pilot," did well too. - "Jung Shik."

241
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,899
- He... - He even won an award.

242
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,299
- He did. - Exactly.

243
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,786
- My gosh. - At the Baeksang Arts Awards.

244
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,309
Jae Suk sent me a text message,

245
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,909
- congratulating me that day. Gosh. - Gosh.

246
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,749
- He's such a funny guy. - Right.

247
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,080
- Cho Jung Seok. - Yes.

248
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,750
Cho Jung Seok texted back...

249
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,449
- a lengthy message. - Okay.

250
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,989
Back then...

251
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,960
- I bet you were emotional. - Yes. And I was quite drunk.

252
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,389
I was on cloud nine.

253
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,959
I wrote, "Jae Suk. Let's meet up."

254
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,999
I came on too strong.

255
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,399
(Rushing a meeting as he was feeling emotional)

256
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,629
Of course, he and I stay in touch.

257
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,630
But he's never asked to see me like this.

258
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,539
So I was a bit puzzled. Jung Seok...

259
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,209
I said I was up for meeting him anytime he wanted, but...

260
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,109
- Right. - Did he demand to meet right away?

261
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,810
- It sounded like that. - So...

262
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,550
Then I got another message from him the next morning.

263
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,380
He wrote, "Jae Suk. I was so drunk last night."

264
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,050
Right.

265
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,289
"I was too excited."

266
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,419
He must've been so happy.

267
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,120
- Right. - Yes. He was so happy.

268
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,659
So I hear that Jung Seok lives nearby.

269
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,129
- Right. He lives in Pangyo. - Yes.

270
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,229
I live in Pangyo.

271
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,399
Gosh, Bundang has such great parks.

272
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,129
Right. There are so many parks here.

273
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,599
- Yes. - So many great parks are here.

274
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,099
- Yes. - Do you also live in Bundang?

275
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,339
I lived here from when I was in middle school until my late 20s.

276
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,909
- Right. - You lived here for a long time.

277
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,469
- I grew up here. - You lived here for a long time.

278
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,840
It's my second hometown.

279
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
Then where's your first hometown?

280
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,050
Garak-dong?

281
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,909
Garak-dong.

282
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,250
- Garak-dong? - Jamsil...

283
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,020
It sounded like English to me.

284
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,549
- "Garak-dong." - She's been a global star.

285
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,189
It's as expected. It was her accent.

286
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,690
Her accent sounded different.

287
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,960
"Garak-dong?"

288
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,130
She's been to many film festivals. "Garak-dong?"

289
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,630
- She's definitely a global star. - Yes.

290
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,759
Then let's check where we need to go.

291
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,829
- Shall we? - We should get going.

292
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,440
- To find the first Whenever Guest. - Gosh. Bundang... What?

293
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, yes. I remember this.

294
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,740
All right. "Kim Woo Young and Yoo Min Gu."

295
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,670
"Fly to the world."

296
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,780
"Forty-seven countries, including Cambodia, Fiji, Senegal."

297
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,780
"We visit any country in the world."

298
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,579
"We've met again after traveling half the globe."

299
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,649
"We don't know when we'll say goodbye again."

300
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,389
"So make our day unforgettable and full of dopamine,"

301
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,720
"during our spare time in Korea."

302
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,589
Do they travel abroad often?

303
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,929
- Where... - Is it a traveling agency?

304
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,559
- Or is it a business trip? - Or are they pilots?

305
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,569
- Are they pilots? - Pilots?

306
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,469
- Pilots? - Where is this place?

307
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,199
"Daewangpangyo-ro."

308
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,900
- I see. - "Daewangpangyo-ro?"

309
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,539
That's my neighborhood.

310
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,820
Right? Isn't it in the vicinity?

311
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,609
- We must take a car there. - Yes.

312
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,839
- What a pity. - Yes.

313
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
- I wish we could walk there. - All right.

314
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,109
- If we walk there, - It's...

315
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,470
it will take one and a half hours.

316
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,350
- I hear she likes to walk. - Yeo Jeong.

317
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,119
Yeo Jeong loves walking.

318
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,349
- Then... - You like to walk.

319
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,419
How about one and a half hours?

320
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,660
- I didn't know we'd walk that long. - Okay.

321
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
(They're forced to take the car.)

322
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,241
- Should we go? - Yeo Jeong, come here. Get in.

323
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,800
Okay.

324
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,869
(So sweet)

325
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,240
- Thank you. - Get in.

326
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,339
(Escorting her until the end)

327
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Okay.

328
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,280
(Jung Seok is such a gentleman.)

329
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,670
- I'm good. Yes. - Motor Transport Operator.

330
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,079
- Motor Transport Operator. - I'll drive safely.

331
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,819
I haven't been in any car accidents...

332
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,990
after my military discharge.

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,330
Yeo Jeong. I bet you were popular in Bundang.

334
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,000
She's been quite famous since her days in Jamsil.

335
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,799
Like, "She transferred."

336
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,969
Gosh, no.

337
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,039
- She was already famous in Jamsil? - From Jamsil to Bundang.

338
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,570
- Right. - When did you debut, Yeo Jeong?

339
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,740
I made my debut through a magazine when I was in high school.

340
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,809
- That was 1997. - Was it 1998? It was 1997?

341
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,880
- Yes. - See?

342
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,919
- When you were in high school. - To debut through a magazine...

343
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
She had to be super famous.

344
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,479
- She had to be very famous then. - Totally.

345
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,519
I sent my picture to the magazine when they were recruiting...

346
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,619
and didn't tell anyone.

347
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,719
- You did it yourself? - You sent in your picture?

348
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,619
Yes. Back then,

349
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,829
it was the number one magazine among middle and high school girls.

350
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,029
- What was the magazine? - It was CeCi.

351
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,229
CeCi was popular then.

352
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,670
- Right. - I sent my picture.

353
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,699
Which magazine did you read when you were young?

354
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
I read CeCi.

355
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,669
- You did? - Gosh.

356
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,350
- CeCi was... - Did you mean C'est Si Bon?

357
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,309
- Jung Shik. - There's still an age gap...

358
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,909
- between us. - Right. Of course.

359
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,979
- Yeo Jeong and I are the same age. - Right.

360
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,620
So you're the same age.

361
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,079
Did you guys know each other...

362
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,289
before working on this movie? You didn't, right?

363
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,489
We worked on a musical together a long time ago.

364
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,189
- Really? - It was 2005.

365
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,460
- Really? - It was "Grease."

366
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,989
- You guys were in "Grease?" - Yes.

367
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,529
Really? This wasn't your first project together?

368
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,530
I didn't know you were in a musical, Yeo Jeong.

369
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,770
- She was. - I had no idea.

370
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,580
- You were in "Grease" together? - Then...

371
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,740
You guys sang that song. Tell me more

372
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,880
- Right. - Right?

373
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,060
Gosh, this is making me shy.

374
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,349
Anyway, we became close then. It was a long time ago.

375
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,379
I see.

376
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,119
And the cast went on a trip or something...

377
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,079
to build membership.

378
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,090
Yes, we did.

379
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,189
- We went to a valley. - Yes.

380
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,649
- We went to a valley. - We went on a retreat.

381
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,559
- She cut watermelons for everyone. - Really?

382
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,259
Right. I was in charge of cooking, right?

383
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,089
- Right. - I made breakfast too. Yes.

384
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,759
- You brought homemade japchae too. - Right.

385
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,199
Everyone slept in...

386
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,229
- after drinking the night before. - Yes.

387
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,600
I woke up early, though.

388
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,639
I made breakfast.

389
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,699
She's so kind.

390
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,039
- I fried eggs. - Gosh, she's...

391
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,069
She's the best.

392
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,816
- She takes good care of the cast. - She does.

393
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,239
Right. She takes good care of them.

394
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,909
You worked together...

395
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,039
- about 20 years ago. - Yes.

396
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,249
You worked on a movie together...

397
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,509
- Yes. - after 20 years. How was it?

398
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,720
You know what?

399
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,389
It felt like nothing had changed.

400
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,819
It's like that with friends.

401
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,989
- Yes, it is. - It feels the same,

402
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,459
- even if we met a long time ago. - Right.

403
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Right.

404
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,090
Then on top of that,

405
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,830
he's my friend and all, but he's an excellent actor.

406
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
- Gosh. - I was curious about...
what he was like on set.

407
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,230
- Come on. - You know?

408
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,630
My gosh. It's true.

409
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,299
- Well... - So...

410
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,240
- I was curious about his acting. - Right. Jung Seok. It's true.

411
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,380
What are you doing, Yeo Jeong?

412
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,310
You're better than me.

413
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,349
- You two are sweet to each other. - What are you guys doing?

414
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,979
It was like this at our shoot too.

415
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,949
- What is this? Come on. - It was...

416
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,989
- "You're so good." - "You're better than me."

417
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,319
(It's too sweet between the two.)

418
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,120
- Jae Suk, say something else. - Seriously.

419
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,989
- From time to time... - Jung Seok.

420
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,160
What's up with your hands?

421
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,429
- He did this with his hands. - Seriously.

422
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,430
This is fascinating.

423
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,160
(It's hard to receive compliments openly.)

424
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,470
Hold on. For our lunch,

425
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,129
- will we get some recommendations? - Right.

426
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,199
Let's go to one of the restaurants...

427
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,370
he frequents.

428
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,169
- There's cartilage soup. - Okay.

429
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,170
They also serve seolleongtang.

430
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:52,279
- There's Pyongyang naengmyeon. - Everything sounds good.

431
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,209
- There's Pyongyang naengmyeon. - Cartilage soup sounds good too.

432
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,549
Then there's this restaurant with many side dishes.

433
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,619
What do you call it?

434
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,919
- It's the pot rice. - That sounds good too.

435
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,919
- Gosh, anyway... - Pot rice. That sounds good too.

436
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,049
Pick anything. They all sound good.

437
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,059
- Really? - Really?

438
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,289
- Yes. - Even before our first meeting,

439
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,319
we're picking our lunch.

440
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,329
It somehow happened that way.

441
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,990
- It's raining today. - Yes.

442
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,130
- Yes. - Anyway...

443
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,929
- International Cooperation Agency. - KOICA.

444
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,870
- What is this? KOICA? - I see.

445
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,270
- KOICA? - My gosh.

446
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,469
That's why they often go abroad.

447
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,030
Korea International Cooperation Agency.

448
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,839
- What does KOICA do? - Yes?

449
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,209
They're involved in international relief activities.

450
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,820
They must work for that kind of cause.

451
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,419
So they listed the countries they frequently visited.

452
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,820
That must be why.

453
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,920
- This is the place. - Yes.

454
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,529
- We can park it here. - All right.

455
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,259
- They'll take care of it. - Take your umbrellas.

456
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,976
- I have your umbrella, Jae Suk. - I have one.

457
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,759
I took two for you.

458
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,470
- Yeon Seok. You're so kind. - Right. I took too many.

459
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,369
How will you survive in this world if you're that kind?

460
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,930
(It's his way of expressing affection.)

461
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,839
- Let's go, Yeon Seok. - It's here. The Training Center.

462
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,439
- I see. This is the place. - Yes.

463
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,010
I'm getting a feeling they're already waiting for us.

464
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,619
- Hello. - Did you write to the show?

465
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,520
- Hello. - I'm the Whenever Guest.

466
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,349
- Hello. - Did you write to the show?

467
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,249
- Hello. - I'm the Whenever Guest.

468
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,489
- Pardon? - I'm the Whenever Guest.

469
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,619
(The Whenever Guests are waiting for them outside.)

470
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,959
- You were waiting for us outside. - You were waiting for us outside.

471
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,840
Getting around the building can be complicated.

472
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,959
- We didn't want you to get lost. - Thank you.

473
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,359
- Woo Young and Min Gu? - Yes. That's us.

474
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,729
- I'm Kim Woo Young. - I see.

475
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,669
- Jung Seok and Yeo Jeong are here. - Hello. Min Gu.

476
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,270
- They're our Whenever Friends. - Hello.

477
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,940
- Let's go inside. - Shall we?

478
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,069
I can't believe I'm at KOICA.

479
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,809
This building is huge.

480
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,309
- It's indeed big. - Right.

481
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,510
(Welcome.)

482
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,880
- It's funny you're wearing boots. - Hello.

483
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,679
- Cute, right? - Jae Suk.

484
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,079
(His rainboots especially stand out.)

485
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,619
- Hello. - That's...

486
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,850
You know what, Yeon Seok?

487
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,819
- These boots are too much. - Right.

488
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,189
Why did I wear boots today of all days?

489
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,619
- You look like a fashionista. - We drove here today.

490
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,259
Why did I wear the boots today?

491
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,500
From the back, you look like...

492
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,300
you came to Seoul from the countryside.

493
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,599
- Today is... - Hello.

494
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,239
- Hello. - Hello.

495
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,370
This way.

496
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,499
(Amazed)

497
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,139
- Gosh, this place is big. - Right.

498
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,486
(They head over to the global lounge where souvenirs are on display.)

499
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,979
- Nice to meet you. Let's sit. - Sit down, please.

500
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,109
- You can sit here, Yeo Jeong. - Okay.

501
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,709
I must sit down after the elders sit down.

502
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,479
- Pardon? - The elders must sit down first.

503
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,049
- He wants the elders to sit first? - I sat down already.

504
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,520
- My gosh. I sat down already. - I already sat down.

505
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,990
- Please sit down. - The elder sat down first.

506
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,719
I'll sit down too.

507
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,660
Could you tell us what KOICA does?

508
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,799
KOICA is a government-funded organization...

509
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,999
that executes...

510
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,829
- development cooperation projects. - Right.

511
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,269
To explain more about development cooperation,

512
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,269
countries cooperate in various ways...

513
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,970
to improve people's lives

514
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,209
Korea helps build...

515
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,609
essential infrastructure in other countries.

516
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,479
- Right. - We also support materials.

517
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,149
When building infrastructure or transporting materials,

518
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,419
we dispatch experts, so they can help these projects.

519
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,989
We're a public organization under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

520
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,819
that provides assistance in many other ways.

521
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,589
This organization is under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

522
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,019
- Right. - That explains it.

523
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,959
He was so eloquent when he spoke.

524
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,290
- Right. - Totally.

525
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,800
It's...

526
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,470
You know what?

527
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,630
The sound of your laughter was quite sly.

528
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,770
"What do you know about me?"

529
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,510
(Laughing)

530
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,010
(Shy)

531
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,379
You're not even nervous.

532
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,839
- How are you this eloquent? - Right. You're so eloquent.

533
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,249
- I'm nervous. - Really?

534
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,449
- It must be his job. - He has a diplomatic task.

535
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,979
- He handles diplomatic tasks. - Yes.

536
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,920
Thank you. I think the agency helped me grow.

537
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,049
(He's a field-ready employee.)

538
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,720
He can answer any question on the spot.

539
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,659
When I saw him at the entrance... I mean, it was raining and all.

540
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,059
But he was waiting for us outside.

541
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,729
In his line of work,

542
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,869
he handles many international projects.

543
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,299
I wouldn't say he was there to escort us.

544
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,539
- Right? - He was welcoming us.

545
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,799
- You know what I mean? - You're giving it meaning.

546
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,770
He didn't sit down before we sat down.

547
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,410
- Not before the elders sat down. - Right, exactly.

548
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,010
I can sense...

549
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,309
you follow some kind of etiquette...

550
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,049
- when receiving guests. - Yes. That's right.

551
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,849
In your letter, it sounded like...

552
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,719
you spent the majority of the year abroad.

553
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,060
The employees work in the head office for 2 to 3 years.

554
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,229
Then they go to the country...

555
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,130
where their project is being handled for 2 to 3 years.

556
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,830
Then where were you based recently?

557
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,269
He came back to Korea later than me, so...

558
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,570
I was in Senegal from 2023 to 2024.

559
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,099
- You were in Senegal? - Yes.

560
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,270
I worked there for two years.

561
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,439
- I see. - Yes.

562
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,909
I worked in Fiji from 2022...

563
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,379
until last July.

564
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,380
It's been a year since I came back from Fiji.

565
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,350
You were in Fiji.

566
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,789
- And he was in Senegal. - Yes.

567
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,589
You might want to visit Senegal at least once in your life.

568
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,059
- Right. - It's quite far from Korea.

569
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,860
- Yes. - How is it in Senegal?

570
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,600
Gosh, Senegal...

571
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,330
- He started off by sighing. - It's...

572
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,320
- Focus. - Many things must cross his mind.

573
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,699
- Many things must cross his mind. - Right.

574
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,769
Yes.

575
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,509
Personally, I have...

576
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,179
- good memories about Senegal. - I bet.

577
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,850
Senegal is located in the westernmost region of Africa.

578
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,820
That's why people in Korea associate Senegal...

579
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,689
- with hairtails. - That's right.

580
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,219
- Hairtails from Senegal. - And soccer.

581
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,919
- And soccer too. Sadio Mane, - Yes.

582
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,319
- Yes. - Koulibaly and so on.

583
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,789
- They're the best. - Yes.

584
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,360
Then did you have hairtails there?

585
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,429
Senegal exports a lot of hairtails because...

586
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,459
- they don't them eat that often. - They don't?

587
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,099
Islam is predominant in Senegal.

588
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,139
They don't eat any fish that don't have scales.

589
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,739
- Gosh, I didn't know. - I didn't know.

590
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,869
I didn't know.

591
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,239
But you must've made a lot of friends.

592
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,679
Right. Yes.

593
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,739
I was able to spend a lot of time...

594
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,249
with people around my age when I was in Senegal.

595
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,680
I tried to stay busy when I was there.

596
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,449
Then what made you apply to our show?

597
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,220
We were hired by the agency around the same time.

598
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,259
We worked in the same department.

599
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,789
We worked together...

600
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,576
- for about one and a half years. - Yes, about that.

601
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,060
We saw each other every day.

602
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,300
At one point, I was sent abroad.

603
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,400
- Then he was sent abroad too. - I see.

604
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,839
If our timelines got misaligned just once,

605
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,609
- You can't see each other. - we wouldn't be able to meet.

606
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,569
- We'd meet after years. - I bet.

607
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,009
- I bet. - If we get sent abroad again,

608
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,879
- Yes. - it'll be many years until we meet.

609
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,920
So I wanted to make use of our spare time in Korea.

610
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,950
I thought doing a fun show would be nice.

611
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,349
- That's why I suggested it. - That's why.

612
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,719
- This is meaningful. - Yes.

613
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,819
- Right. - When...

614
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,949
- Now that we're here, - Yes.

615
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,319
- let's try out some games. - Yes.

616
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,729
- Jung Seok, you go first. - Yeo Jeong, you throw it.

617
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,890
- No. - You do it.

618
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,360
- You'll have to do it once. - Really?

619
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,699
- The highest number is two. - That's right.

620
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,830
Two? I see.

621
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,200
Hold on. Before you do that...

622
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,609
Hold on. Before you do that, we prepared something...

623
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,169
- so you would do your best. - I see.

624
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,579
- We prepared a small present too. - What is it?

625
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,209
- Okay. - I brought them from Senegal.

626
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,910
- They're handmade dolls. - How cute.

627
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,549
- They're so cute. - How cute.

628
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,779
- You can take one each. - It's so cute.

629
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,519
- The elephant. Sure. - I want this one.

630
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,319
- Take it. Take what you want. - Pick one.

631
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,459
I want this one with big ears.

632
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,319
- I'll take this. The elephant... - It looks like a pineapple.

633
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,860
- Lions are popular in Senegal. - This must be an elephant.

634
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,900
They're imported lions.

635
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,669
- They are imported? - They're not indigenous to Senegal.

636
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,469
- They're imported. - They're from South Africa.

637
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,739
- So they're imported. - But they live in Senegal now.

638
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,999
Right. They do now.

639
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,870
I mean, I saw a lion, so...

640
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,610
It sounded like he was talking about beef.

641
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,049
- They're not indigenous to Senegal. - They aren't many of them.

642
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,080
No.

643
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,650
I was wondering if lions were common in Senegal.

644
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

645
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,420
- Roll it, please. - Sure.

646
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,089
- We have other presents. - What?

647
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,119
- What? - My gosh.

648
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,359
- Hold on. - Not yet.

649
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,489
Why didn't you give them all at once?

650
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,959
He won't let us roll it.

651
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,129
- I forgot. - I see.

652
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,769
I brought a present...

653
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,739
that utilized materials from Fiji. It's a scented candle.

654
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,799
I wanted to give this to the person who succeeded the mission.

655
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,369
- Then give it to the MVP later. - Whoever carries the team.

656
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,079
- Give it to the MVP later. - Sounds good.

657
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,939
The MVP will get the scented candle...

658
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,509
- I'll hold on to it for now. - from Fiji.

659
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,510
- Okay. - Try again.

660
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,279
- Go ahead, Yeo Jeong. - It will roll off the table.

661
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,719
- Should I do it standing up? - It's okay.

662
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,990
- Throw it high? - Yes.

663
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,549
So it can roll.

664
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,619
(How many coupons will they get?)

665
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,860
Hold on.

666
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,559
(They obtain 1 coupon.)

667
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,520
- We barely got one coupon. - That's good enough.

668
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,230
I should've gotten two.

669
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,300
- The presents. - Let's check the prize.

670
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,669
I'm so curious.

671
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,739
The prize first.

672
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,599
"The recommended temperature for AC is 28°C."

673
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,739
"Having an individual fan is a must, not a choice."

674
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,769
Public organizations...

675
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,409
- must set it to 28°C? - That's a policy.

676
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,640
"Two air circulators."

677
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,749
- Air circulators? - Air circulators?

678
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,219
Don't people take this when they go camping?

679
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,119
- That's great. - This is great.

680
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,949
All right. What's the game we're going to play today?

681
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,259
Today, you'll play the global version...

682
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,490
of the relay jegi.

683
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,389
(Oh, no. It's the jegi again.)

684
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,430
Here we go.

685
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,330
(The last time he was here, he was the ace player.)

686
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,569
(But they failed to complete the mission at the end.)

687
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,300
Gosh. Why?

688
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,439
How are you going to play with your boots on?

689
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,539
Boots are great for that.

690
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,039
- I think they will be good. - They're good for that.

691
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,779
- Rainboots? - I mean, they are wide.

692
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,940
- The boots are flat. - Really?

693
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,649
(The global version of the relay jegi)

694
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,949
(Round 1)

695
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,179
(Vietnamese jegi, da cau)

696
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,519
(They must kick the jegi 5 or more times.)

697
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,989
- Da cau? - Da cau?

698
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,119
- Yes. - Da cau?

699
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,566
- I'll show you the Vietnamese jegi. - Okay.

700
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,760
- What's that? - What's that?

701
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,690
- What's that? - It looks like a shuttlecock.

702
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,620
- This is the Vietnamese jegi? - Wait. This will fall fast.

703
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,799
- It's made of feathers. - It looks like a shuttlecock.

704
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,639
- I played it a lot in Cambodia. - This is the Vietnamese jegi?

705
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,739
- I... What do I do? - This is...

706
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,839
I've never kicked a jegi in my life.

707
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,679
- You can do it. - The temperature...

708
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,180
Gosh, I'm in big trouble.

709
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,879
I really have to do well today.

710
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,379
We just have to kick it more than once.

711
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,020
Hold on. Will this work?

712
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,310
- Jae Suk. That's great. - This is cushiony.

713
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,390
I think there's a spring inside.

714
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
- This is so fast. - My gosh.

715
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,590
You know what? It's...

716
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,199
(Showing off a special trick out of the blue)

717
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,706
I thought it was going to stick to your face.

718
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,530
- Give it a try, Yeo Jeong. - I'm in trouble.

719
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,200
- Great. - That's it.

720
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,439
Oh, no. What do I do?

721
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,920
- I'm sorry. - Yeo Jeong, if you can,

722
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,509
- kick it high. - Kick it high.

723
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,569
Go ahead. You go first.

724
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,770
- Let's practice. - All right.

725
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,139
- One, two. - Oh, no. I'm sorry.

726
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,979
- It's okay. - I'll do better. I'm sorry.

727
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,209
- We can practice more. - It's hard to do it back to back.

728
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,149
- Yeo Jeong should start. - Yeo Jeong, you start from there.

729
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,419
- Okay. I'm not good at it. - Yes.

730
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,549
But this is understandable for her.

731
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,270
- It's her first time trying this. - Right.

732
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,620
- One, two, - Good.

733
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,760
- three, four, - Three.

734
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,760
- five. - That's it. We did it then.

735
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,999
(Their strategy with Yeo Jeong as the starter worked.)

736
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,059
Okay.

737
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,669
- This is it. Let's do this. - Okay.

738
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,199
- Let's do a group cheer. - A group cheer.

739
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
- All right. - Okay. Let's go.

740
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,669
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

741
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,039
- All right. - Let's do it again.

742
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,569
- This is our first try. - This brings back old memories.

743
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,109
If we play it right, we can complete Round One.

744
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,016
- It brings back old memories. - Round One. Great.

745
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,449
- You go first. Good luck. - Okay.

746
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,550
You got this.

747
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,920
Ready. Set.

748
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
(Start!)

749
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,149
- Two. - Wait.

750
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,190
(Keeping the jegi alive)

751
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,889
Keep going.

752
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,890
Hey.

753
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,229
(They fail after kicking it 4 times.)

754
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,729
- I didn't want to break it. - Right.

755
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,969
(They were stopped by the world.)

756
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,430
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

757
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,540
I didn't want to kick it.

758
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,410
My kick was really awful, but he managed to keep it alive.

759
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,169
- You did well. - You were good.

760
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,556
- We can do it. - This is how you do it.

761
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,749
- It's our 2nd try. In 1, 2, 3. - In 2, 3.

762
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,750
- Here we go. - Here we go.

763
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,279
When you start, you can grab the feather first.

764
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,750
Let go as you kick it.

765
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,890
- It's much easier. - I see.

766
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,320
- Were you frustrated? - Okay.

767
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,459
- No. - No.

768
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,129
- No. - I must have frustrated you.

769
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,689
He must've been frustrated.

770
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,359
- Don't throw it first. - Right.

771
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,599
- Drop it like this. - Yes.

772
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,806
- Yeo Jeong, do you want to start? - Yes.

773
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,969
- Here we go. - Here we go.

774
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,040
Ready. Set.

775
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,640
(The resuscitator is on standby.)

776
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,440
(Start!)

777
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,410
I'm sorry.

778
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,409
I'm sorry.

779
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,690
(Did the jegi go over her head?)

780
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,620
- Hey. You must've been scared. - It's okay.

781
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,049
Yeo Jeong went like this.

782
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,290
(Scared)

783
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
(Dropping her head)

784
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:47,096
- This will be a long day. - What do you think?

785
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,529
- Our journey to the prize... - Yes.

786
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,699
- It will be a rocky path. - Yes. It will be a long day.

787
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,499
- Nice try, Yeo Jeong. - It will be a rocky path.

788
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,206
- But we'll do it by the book. - You can do it.

789
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,899
- Let's do it by the book. - Let's do it by the book.

790
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,869
- Yes. Let's do it by the book. - Okay?

791
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,070
- When you... - It's too high.

792
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,810
- Think about sending it to him. - Yes. Send it to me.

793
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,930
- You can bring it down close. Yes. - That's it.

794
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,900
- You can bring it down close. Yes. - That's it.

795
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,780
Three, four, five,

796
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
- Great. - six,

797
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:12,381
- When you're kicking... - seven...

798
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,419
- When you're kicking... - Seven...

799
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,620
(He suddenly shoves Jae Suk.)

800
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
- I have to kick it too. - Hey.

801
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,689
- I need to kick it too. - How could you push him?

802
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,459
You practically flung Jae Suk.

803
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,129
- Hey. I... - I need to kick it too.

804
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,506
- I didn't want to keep kicking it. - He wanted to kick it too.

805
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,330
It comes down so fast!

806
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,130
Seriously.

807
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I mean...

808
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,769
He had to kick it too.

809
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,140
So he just pushed you.

810
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,709
You had to let me kick it.

811
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,769
Hey.

812
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,650
(She embarks on the path of rigorous training.)

813
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,610
- Try again. - Yes.

814
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,021
- Why am I so bad at it? - Try to kick it with your toes.

815
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,110
Okay.

816
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,190
- That's it. Great job. - Just like that.

817
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,049
- That's it. Great job. - Just like that.

818
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,349
(The jegi doctor manages to kick it back.)

819
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,149
- Great job. - Gosh.

820
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,419
- Great. - Okay.

821
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,519
- Let's try it. - I'll keep it alive no matter what.

822
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,689
- Just send it my way. - If...

823
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,329
- All right. - Let's stand like this.

824
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,299
- Let's spread out. - Okay.

825
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,659
- You got this. - You got this.

826
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,329
- Let's go for it. In 1, 2, 3. - I got this. In 1, 2, 3.

827
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,399
- Here we go. - Here we go.

828
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,770
It's our fourth try. All right.

829
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,470
Ready, Set.

830
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,510
I'll keep it alive no matter what.

831
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,310
- Gosh. - Oh, no. What am I going to do?

832
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,750
- Gosh. - Oh, no. What am I going to do?

833
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,780
All right.

834
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,189
Did you see that?

835
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,519
(Even the best doctor did not see that jegi.)

836
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
- Let's use a coupon. - Yes, a coupon.

837
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,889
- Time to use a coupon. - Yes.

838
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,059
- We need to get to Round Two. - Yes.

839
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,990
- We'll use a coupon. - Okay.

840
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,230
Then,

841
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,199
- either of you... - Go ahead if you're confident.

842
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,630
- I'm not. - Yes, you are.

843
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,699
- One of you can join us. - Okay.

844
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,740
You can pick a person to replace...

845
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,809
- and stare at him or her. - I'm bad at this stuff.

846
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,810
Okay.

847
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,179
(Yeo Jeong and Woo Young switch.)

848
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,239
Okay.

849
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,709
We need to win this prize.

850
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,510
I can't let everyone down.

851
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,880
- You can practice. - Yes.

852
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,900
That's how you're supposed to play it.

853
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,250
He's got quick feet.

854
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,549
- He's good. - This is going to work.

855
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,659
- He's good. - This is a great opportunity.

856
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,020
Please make it.

857
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,389
It's my first time kicking this jegi,

858
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,859
- This is tough. - and it's pretty fun.

859
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,376
It's also my first time kicking it like this.

860
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,029
You normally kick it back and forth.

861
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,529
- Oh, really? - I see.

862
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,929
Let's practice that way, then.

863
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,469
Right. Can you kick it over to me?

864
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,970
- Good. - Oh, like that?

865
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,210
- Go. - Here.

866
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,639
- Good. - That's five.

867
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,939
It's better to kick it over...

868
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,779
- than to try to kick it many times. - Exactly.

869
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,109
It goes out of your view if you kick it up.

870
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,650
- I see. - Let's do this, guys.

871
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,050
Put your hands together. Come here, Yeo Jeong.

872
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,119
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

873
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,279
We need to make it this time.

874
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,589
You used a bonus coupon.

875
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,590
- Yes. - Then, I'll pass it to Jung Seok.
- Here we go. - Yes.

876
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,420
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

877
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,490
Get ready.

878
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,630
It's like playing soccer.

879
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,130
Set.

880
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,000
(Start!)

881
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,400
To me?

882
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
To me?

883
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,070
Four.

884
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,780
(Just one more!)

885
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,150
Four.

886
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,279
- Five. - We got it.

887
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,320
Six.

888
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,889
- Seven. All right! - We did it!

889
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,189
(They easily succeed with 7 hits.)

890
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,289
(Turning)

891
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,319
Yes!

892
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,920
(We did it!)

893
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,330
Great.

894
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,290
(She finally smiles brightly.)

895
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,659
That was gratifying.

896
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,100
It's far smoother without me.

897
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,599
You need to come back now.

898
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,300
- Do I have to? - Yes.

899
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,199
- But Woo Young. - Yes?

900
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
You said you'd kick it to Jung Seok. Why did you give it to him?

901
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,109
I hadn't played it in ten years, so...

902
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,009
- I was flustered. - I had my guard down.

903
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,609
- I know. - You were excellent.

904
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,579
Round One was a success.

905
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,119
- Success. - Success. Good.

906
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,649
We have six tries remaining at the moment.

907
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,049
- That's right. - You need to decide...

908
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,259
whether to keep going or stop.

909
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,490
In 1, 2, 3.

910
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,590
Go!

911
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,860
He said it instantly.

912
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,399
- Then... - All right, then.

913
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,059
"Always be prepared for a business trip."

914
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,099
"Brighten up your travel with colorful style."

915
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,400
"Two carry-on suitcases."

916
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Two suitcases?

917
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:55,040
What kind?

918
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,039
They're bringing them in.

919
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,509
- Okay. - It's the perfect size.

920
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,990
I'm going on a business trip in July.

921
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,280
(Perfect timing)

922
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,680
(Moving back)

923
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,600
Are you going on a business trip?

924
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,949
Then, a suitcase will be perfect.

925
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,890
(She starts training by herself again.)

926
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,090
She's practicing so hard right now.

927
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,919
After seeing the present...

928
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,089
- Yeo Jeong. - Yes?

929
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,360
- Don't mind me. - Try kicking it over to us.

930
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,999
Keep going without me.

931
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,199
- The rules will change, though. - That was nice.

932
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,300
They change the rules.

933
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,399
- Oh, they do? - Yes.

934
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,440
Okay.

935
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,869
(Round 2)

936
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,710
(Kick it 7 times in a row or more.)

937
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,409
(We need 2 more kicks this time.)

938
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,779
This is a tough one.

939
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,280
Everyone needs to kick it at least once, right?

940
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,409
Okay. Let's give it a go.

941
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,579
Yeo Jeong, try coming in at the end and kicking it.

942
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,389
That might be better. We pass it to each other,

943
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,789
and Yeo Jeong needs to kick it just once...

944
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,910
- at the right time. - Okay.

945
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,190
Just once kick in the end, Yeo Jeong.

946
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,590
One, two,

947
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,460
three, four,

948
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,360
five, six...

949
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,046
Yeo Jeong needs to kick it just once at the right time.

950
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,270
(This is the moment, Yeo Jeong!)

951
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
(Dropping)

952
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,470
Oh, now!

953
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,839
- One more time. - Okay.

954
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,139
If you're going to kick it,

955
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,580
yell, "My ball." Keep communicating.

956
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,649
- "Mine!" - You'll miss it...

957
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,449
- unless you communicate. - We frustrated you, didn't we?

958
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,650
Yell, "My ball!"

959
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,650
He wants us to shout, "My ball!"

960
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,649
- Why didn't we? - "My ball!"

961
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,990
- We failed to cooperate. - Failed teamwork.

962
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,089
- "We failed to cooperate." - Communicate.

963
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,430
- Good luck. - Good luck.

964
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,659
But kicking it last is also pretty hard.

965
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,499
- It is. - Can I go first?

966
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,629
- Yes, go first. - Yes.

967
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,829
- I'm too scared. - You should go first.

968
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,470
Just kick it over to me.

969
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,570
Yeo Jeong.

970
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,710
Do you want to try wearing these boots?

971
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,430
- Why don't you try them? - The boots?

972
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,780
Try these on.

973
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,150
Wait, guys. She just put on the boots.

974
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,979
- Is it a new plan? - You should wear these.

975
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,519
- Yes, I'll wear these. - I'm just trying them out.

976
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,820
Yeo Jeong should wear the boots.

977
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,989
They come off, though.

978
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,649
But it helps you kick it once, right?

979
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,919
- All you need is one kick. - That's right.

980
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,059
It's wide, so...

981
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,889
Don't kick it forward.

982
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,389
You only need to kick it like this. Try it.

983
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,929
- It's pretty difficult. - Good.

984
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,729
It should go as high as that, right?

985
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,770
Good.

986
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,170
- That's good. - I hope it goes like this.

987
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,739
- Good. - Yes, just like that.

988
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,686
- Well done. We've got this. - Do it exactly like that.

989
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,209
- Let's try again. - Let's go for it.

990
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,109
- Sure. - Yeo Jeong, good luck.

991
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,779
- Okay. - Put your hands together.

992
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,109
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

993
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,149
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

994
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,249
I think we'll make it.

995
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,280
Yeo Jeong will go first.

996
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,149
- Get ready. - Kick it over to Jung Seok?

997
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,650
- Hang on. - Here we go.

998
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Set.

999
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,190
(Start!)

1000
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
- No! - No!

1001
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,200
- That's good. - Good!

1002
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,669
- No! - No!

1003
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,700
- That's good. - No!

1004
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,669
(Doing a split)

1005
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,100
- That's good. - No!

1006
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,040
(He failed with his legs split.)

1007
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,760
- Did you hurt yourself? - Are your knees okay?

1008
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,249
- But that was... - I was so startled.

1009
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,079
(Jung Seok still mocks him.)

1010
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,249
- Oh, no. - You caught it, though.

1011
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,519
I thought it was going to Jung Seok,

1012
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,320
but it flew right toward me.

1013
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,359
- You're getting better, though. - Okay.

1014
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,830
- It was better. - Let's try again.

1015
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,560
Yeo Jeong, try this.

1016
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,360
Yes, that's it!

1017
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,970
(Like this?)

1018
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,200
- That's the form. - Great.

1019
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,139
- Good! That's it. - Yes!

1020
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,240
That was my fault. You did perfectly.

1021
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,409
- Go again just like this? - Let's go again.

1022
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,639
- Do we start? - You just need to kick it.

1023
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,010
- Okay. - Okay.

1024
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,409
- One more try. - They're almost there.

1025
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,180
Yes. They'll succeed soon enough.

1026
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,979
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1027
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,849
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Here we go!

1028
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,389
- This is our seventh try. - All right.

1029
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,849
- Get ready. - It might come this way.

1030
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,889
Set.

1031
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,459
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

1032
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,630
(Start!)

1033
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,290
- Good. - Two,

1034
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,460
- three, four. - Three, four.

1035
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,199
- Four. - Four.

1036
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,530
(Failure)

1037
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,100
That was good, though.

1038
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,500
You should have passed.

1039
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,280
You should have shouted, "Mine!"

1040
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,110
Don't you think you're being too greedy?

1041
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,339
It's not as easy as it looks.

1042
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,140
(They blame each other like good friends do.)

1043
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,709
- That was nice, Yeo Jeong. - Was it?

1044
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,250
- It was great. - It was.

1045
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,079
- Okay. - It's tough to keep...

1046
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,120
kicking it by myself.

1047
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,789
I know. We need to kick it back and forth.

1048
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,619
- But one of us needs to kick it... - Should we just pass it right away?

1049
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,519
Kick it over to me,

1050
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,189
- and I'll kick it a few times, - Right.

1051
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,190
- and then... - There you go.
- To Yeon Seok. - I'll just kick it once.

1052
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:12,729
- Receive it. - Good.

1053
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,760
- Nice. - Two.

1054
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,429
- Three. - That's right.

1055
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,630
Receive it. Pass it.

1056
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,739
- Then, I'll only kick it once. - Now...

1057
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,139
- All right. - Just once.

1058
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,169
- Let's do this, Yeo Jeong. - That was over ten kicks.

1059
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,709
- I think they'll make it. - I agree.

1060
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,739
(Yeo Jeong will start them off, and the other three will finish it.)

1061
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,809
We need to make it this time to lessen the burden.

1062
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,679
- Yes. Let's play. - Okay.

1063
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,279
- Get ready. - Just pass it to Jung Seok.

1064
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,420
- Okay. - To Jung Seok.

1065
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,690
- A light tap. - Set.

1066
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,790
(Start!)

1067
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,820
Kick it.

1068
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,660
Keep kicking it.

1069
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,290
(He saved it!)

1070
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,900
Keep kicking it. Great.

1071
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,069
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

1072
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,599
Keep kicking it. Great.

1073
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,840
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

1074
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,209
- I keep... - I got too close to him.

1075
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,639
- It went pretty well. - You did so well, though.

1076
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,039
- That wasn't bad, Yeo Jeong. - But I got too close.

1077
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
(Feeling bad)

1078
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,780
I got too close to him.

1079
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,650
- We need to make it this time. - It went up, but...

1080
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,719
But we only have one try left.

1081
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,720
- Please. - This is our last chance.

1082
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,390
(The hurtful memories of jegi)

1083
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,300
(They're at a crisis of reliving that memory.)

1084
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,670
Last try.

1085
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,800
- Yes. Let's do it. - We've got this.

1086
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,970
Let's go!

1087
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,699
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1088
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,309
- You've got this. - Okay.

1089
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,739
(Can they make a dramatic comeback?)

1090
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,010
Let's make a miracle happen.

1091
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,510
We can do this.

1092
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,950
Here we go.

1093
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,410
Get ready.

1094
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,690
Set.

1095
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,250
(Start!)

1096
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,389
But wait. I've got something to say.

1097
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,429
Failure.

1098
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,460
(Grunting)

1099
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,660
(They failed.)

1100
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,499
But wait.

1101
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,069
I've got something to say.

1102
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,769
- Failure. - No, I need to tell you something.

1103
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,400
(Dispersing)

1104
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,039
Only Yeo Jeong said, "Here we go."

1105
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
The rest of us didn't...

1106
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,450
I'm terribly sorry.

1107
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,920
(Quickly taking them back)

1108
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,090
What do I do?

1109
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,660
I never knew you'd make us kick jegi again.

1110
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,829
It was too difficult for Yeo Jeong, though.

1111
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,299
- It's tough. - It was tough even for us.

1112
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,899
- It was tough. - She's never kicked it before.

1113
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
- It wasn't even a normal jegi. - Too bad.

1114
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,940
It was tough.

1115
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,870
Yeo Jeong, why don't you...

1116
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,239
- Yes. - I'm so sorry.

1117
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,739
We failed because of me.

1118
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,709
- Thank you. - I'm truly sorry.

1119
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,049
- It was really fun. - Thank you.

1120
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,450
- I rooted for you. - Thanks.

1121
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,150
- That was so close. - I like these.

1122
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,589
(They feel solemn.)

1123
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,519
- It was really fun. - Really.

1124
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,689
It was the spare time that we wanted.

1125
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,559
- Was it? - Anyway, thanks.

1126
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,699
Who should we give the candle to?

1127
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,629
- The MVP. - The MVP.

1128
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,630
(Who's today's MVP?)

1129
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:04,899
I think I know who will get...

1130
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,970
this candle.

1131
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:10,093
I wasted so many attempts. It was too hot.

1132
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,903
- That's right. - Me? Why?

1133
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:14,463
- Because you worked the hardest. - Right.

1134
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:16,573
- The hardest? - You were tormented the whole time.

1135
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:17,733
But I was the worst player.

1136
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:20,243
- No, you weren't. - You even changed your shoes.

1137
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:21,244
Exactly.

1138
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:23,013
- You even tried on different shoes. - Oh, my gosh.

1139
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:24,813
- Thank you for this. - Thank you.

1140
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:26,714
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1141
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:28,583
Sadly...

1142
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:29,683
- Yeo Jeong. - Right.

1143
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:30,684
(Heavy footsteps)

1144
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:31,884
- We did our best. - Indeed.

1145
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:34,453
I couldn't help but hate myself.

1146
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,593
A normal jegi is hard to kick as it is.

1147
00:37:36,594 --> 00:37:38,823
- But that was tricky. - That was a tougher one to kick.

1148
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:41,594
There are some games that we just can't win.

1149
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,774
We'll be eating lunch with a heavy heart once again.

1150
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:48,433
Then, among the restaurants we discussed...

1151
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,333
- Oh, right. Pick one. - Pot rice,

1152
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,973
- cartilage soup... - Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1153
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,003
I like all of them, to be honest.

1154
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:55,004
- Me too. - Me too.

1155
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,143
Let's eat what you're craving.

1156
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:57,644
- Then, - Yes.

1157
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,483
How about Pyongyang naengmyeon?

1158
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:02,853
- Pyongyang naengmyeon? - You've been craving that today.

1159
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:03,854
It's just that...

1160
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:05,113
- I like Pyongyang naengmyeon. - So do I.

1161
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:06,323
We're a big group,

1162
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:07,523
- and the parking is easy there. - Let's go.

1163
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:08,683
- They have a huge parking lot. - We'll go there.

1164
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:10,253
- Pyongyang naengmyeon. - Does a friend of yours own it?

1165
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,394
No, not at all. I don't know the owner at all.

1166
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:15,523
I just frequent the place.

1167
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:17,193
- Let's go there. - It sounds delicious.

1168
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,693
I was also craving Pyongyang naengmyeon today.

1169
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:20,603
- Right? I noticed. - Yes. Did you?

1170
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:23,334
Today's lunch is on me.

1171
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:24,633
- Really? - Yes.

1172
00:38:24,634 --> 00:38:27,043
- Seriously? - I don't remember exactly,

1173
00:38:27,044 --> 00:38:28,943
but in the episode that Song Hye Kyo was on,

1174
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:30,243
she said that you bought them food...

1175
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:31,573
at Bennigan's...

1176
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:34,013
- when you were younger. - I did.

1177
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:37,753
- There were Yeo Jeong, Hye Kyo... - It must have been the whole group.

1178
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:39,983
- Jeong Sang Hun was also there. - Right.

1179
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,323
- I see. - And...

1180
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:44,653
when would I ever get a chance to treat Jae Suk to a meal?

1181
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:46,963
I had already made up my mind to buy him a meal today.

1182
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:48,864
- You don't have to do that. - Goodness.

1183
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:51,764
I was wondering why she was carrying her wallet.

1184
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,404
You can eat as much as you can.

1185
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:56,603
It's been so long since I had Pyongyang naengmyeon.

1186
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:57,673
(Off to eat Pyongyang naengmyeon that Yeo Jeong is buying)

1187
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:00,073
When the cast of "Light Shop" was here,

1188
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:01,844
you went to Namsan on a bus.

1189
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:05,013
And I saw Yeon Seok keep conversing...

1190
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:06,284
with the passenger next to him.

1191
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,443
I laughed hysterically while I watched that on TV.

1192
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:10,213
When I talked to the citizen?

1193
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,414
Yes. It was hilarious.

1194
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,253
Jae Suk taught me...

1195
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:15,884
how to communicate with the people.

1196
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:20,123
And the man seemed a bit tired after a while.

1197
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,124
Tired of me?

1198
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,133
(He was tired of Yeon Seok's endless questions.)

1199
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:24,333
I asked him too many questions.

1200
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,174
So, you didn't learn how to read the room yet.

1201
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,103
There were many things to learn, but...

1202
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:30,773
- He didn't teach me that yet. - I see.

1203
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:32,033
- You should have. - I only...

1204
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:34,443
(It's right up her alley.)

1205
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:36,643
- You watched our show a lot. - I know, right?

1206
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:38,873
- Yes. - I'm a fan. I watch it often.

1207
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:39,883
(She's a regular viewer.)

1208
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:42,143
What do you normally have for lunch?

1209
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:44,853
I usually eat what I want.

1210
00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,523
- You eat a proper lunch. - Yes.

1211
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:49,184
Well, I eat all three meals.

1212
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:52,553
But the range is smaller for dinner.

1213
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:53,694
It has to be.

1214
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,764
So, I'm always thinking about food.

1215
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:58,063
- Picturing food makes you happy. - Yes.

1216
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,403
Thinking about what to eat today.

1217
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:02,804
"My Daughter Is a Zombie" was filmed in the Namhae area,

1218
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,103
- It was in Namhae? - so it was lovely.

1219
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:07,804
There were so many good seafood restaurants.

1220
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:09,973
- It was the best. - I was so happy.

1221
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,743
The food was incredible.

1222
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:15,043
Our dorm was in Samcheonpo.

1223
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:16,653
That's near my hometown.

1224
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:17,783
- Really? - Yes.

1225
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:18,913
- Seriously? - Yes.

1226
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:20,683
When I was little,

1227
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,353
I used to think sashimi was cheap.

1228
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,523
- You must have. - Because it was so cheap?

1229
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:26,323
- I bet you did. - We got a huge plate of sashimi...

1230
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,763
for just 10 or 20 dollars.

1231
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:31,133
I realized it was actually expensive when I came to Seoul.

1232
00:40:31,134 --> 00:40:32,194
Yes.

1233
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:33,863
It's not based on a webtoon, is it?

1234
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,103
- Webtoon... - The webtoon...

1235
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:36,403
- It's based on a webtoon. - It is.

1236
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:38,003
- Oh, I see. - Yes.

1237
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:39,874
The original webtoon has so many fans.

1238
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,814
I was glad when they announced the cast...

1239
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:46,383
because the fans said I looked a lot like the character.

1240
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:49,283
- Just you? - No, the whole cast.

1241
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:50,284
The whole cast?

1242
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:53,484
They liked how the actors looked similar to the original characters.

1243
00:40:54,024 --> 00:40:56,054
So, I was relieved.

1244
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:57,754
I can't wait to watch it.

1245
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,463
(The perfect cast makes you excited.)

1246
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:00,864
The parking lot is on your left.

1247
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:02,724
- It's huge. - There.

1248
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:04,604
I don't think I've ever been here before.

1249
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:06,963
- Jung Seok's favorite restaurant. - Yes.

1250
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,333
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

1251
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,004
- There are lots of customers. - I'm excited!

1252
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,203
(Going through the menu as soon as they're seated)

1253
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,244
- I'm eating cold naengmyeon. - Same.

1254
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,514
- It's Pyongyang naengmyeon. - We have to pay for it right here.

1255
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:20,643
I want to pay for it.

1256
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,244
She wants to pay for it.

1257
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,383
- Then... - Then, we'll gratefully...

1258
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:26,853
We'll gratefully accept, Yeo Jeong. Thank you.

1259
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,084
- Are you sure about this? - You bet!

1260
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,453
- Order a bunch. - Can I get cold boiled pork slices?

1261
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:32,793
- Sure. Is one plate enough? - Good.

1262
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,993
- Yes, this is enough. - Really?

1263
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,563
They also have mung bean pancakes and dumplings.

1264
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:40,064
- One mung bean pancake? - Okay.

1265
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:42,834
It's 115 dollars?

1266
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:45,334
- Oh, you can pay at the table? - Yes.

1267
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:47,703
(Polite)

1268
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,224
- You also... - What's with that pose?

1269
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:51,644
- Jae Suk... - You're waiting so eagerly.

1270
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,014
But she says she wants to pay.

1271
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:57,483
I bet it cost you a lot when you took us to Bennigan's.

1272
00:41:57,484 --> 00:42:00,424
No, compared to this, it wasn't that much.

1273
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:03,053
- Thanks for the food. - Yes.

1274
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,553
- You're welcome. - Thank you so much.

1275
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,224
- Let's enjoy the food. - Thank you.

1276
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,264
I should have Hye Kyo buy me food later.

1277
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,893
You can invite me when she does.

1278
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,294
I'll ask her too.

1279
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:13,833
(The food is served right away.)

1280
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:14,904
I'll take those.

1281
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,034
That looks delicious.

1282
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:20,274
Let's put our failure behind us by eating these.

1283
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:21,673
It looks tasty!

1284
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:23,513
It's such a delicacy.

1285
00:42:23,514 --> 00:42:25,014
- Cold boiled pork slices? - So...

1286
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:28,983
Yeo Jeong, put one salted shrimp on a slice...

1287
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:30,984
and eat them together. It's really good.

1288
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:34,854
(Placing a salted shrimp)

1289
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:38,994
(Trying a slice of cold boiled pork first)

1290
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,164
- It's good. - Right?

1291
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:44,364
It's so tender.

1292
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:49,774
- This is incredible. - Isn't it?

1293
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:51,703
This mung bean pancake is great.

1294
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:52,904
- It tastes so good. - Yes.

1295
00:42:53,144 --> 00:42:54,974
I think it'll go well with the naengmyeon.

1296
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:57,043
- Here's our naengmyeon. - I brought them.

1297
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:59,474
- Thank you. - Oh, okay. It looks neat.

1298
00:43:01,114 --> 00:43:02,384
Look at that broth.

1299
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:03,953
You have to eat naengmyeon in the summer.

1300
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:05,014
I couldn't agree more.

1301
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:06,654
It looks so good!

1302
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,593
(Jung Seok tries the soup first when eating Pyongyang naengmyeon.)

1303
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:10,714
This naengmyeon tastes good.

1304
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:13,423
It's so tasty!

1305
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,563
- Is it? - Yes!

1306
00:43:14,564 --> 00:43:16,194
(Jae Suk goes right for the noodles.)

1307
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,594
This is incredibly good.

1308
00:43:19,294 --> 00:43:20,303
Try it.

1309
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:21,464
(Satisfied)

1310
00:43:22,564 --> 00:43:23,574
It's good, right?

1311
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:25,703
It also smells good.

1312
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:26,974
It feels weird...

1313
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:29,404
to come to a restaurant that I frequently visit.

1314
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:32,574
Do you come here with your family?

1315
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,284
Yes.

1316
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:36,014
I also come with my friends.

1317
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:40,253
- Also, Sang Hun lives nearby. - Really?

1318
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:42,754
- He and I often come here. - Together?

1319
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:44,323
Yeo Jeong, what do you do in your free time?

1320
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:46,624
Me? I go to the dance academy that I always go.

1321
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:50,694
I usually watch eating shows when I'm hungry at night.

1322
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,794
There's a compilation of you eating ramyeon.

1323
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,403
Did you know that existed?

1324
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:55,633
He makes it look so tasty.

1325
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,154
- The way you slurp your noodles... - He's really good at that.

1326
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:00,673
I sometimes watch that. The ramyeon eating show.

1327
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,043
These days,

1328
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:05,574
I'm hesitant to make sounds when I slurp the noodles.

1329
00:44:06,114 --> 00:44:07,383
You're a total entertainer now.

1330
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:09,244
- Why? - You even think twice about that.

1331
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:11,283
- Well, it's... - He is on a TV show, after all.

1332
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:13,124
It's so funny that you're hesitant about that.

1333
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,953
- Just follow your style. - It occurs to me once in a while.

1334
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,294
You're calculating those outcomes when you eat,

1335
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:19,624
and that's why you're boring.

1336
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,794
And that's why you're boring.

1337
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,593
Stop considering those and be natural.

1338
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:26,663
How am I supposed to be funny when I eat?

1339
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,664
I'm just saying.

1340
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:31,934
You two are true friends, indeed.

1341
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:35,343
His first movie was with me.

1342
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:37,504
- We were in "Architecture 101." - "Architecture 101."

1343
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:39,643
- He was Nab-ddeuk. - I played Nab-ddeuk.

1344
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,383
- I played the rich senior. - The mean senior.

1345
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:42,743
- That jerk of a senior.. - Yes.

1346
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:44,744
- I know that. - "Jerk" is going a little too far.

1347
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:46,623
- Sorry about that. - That's...

1348
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:48,583
- I was just a rich senior. - Sorry. I went too far.

1349
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:51,394
The character he played at the time made everyone furious.

1350
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:54,323
- He was mean to Suzy. - You were so annoying.

1351
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,324
You were.

1352
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,333
It wasn't supposed to be an evil role,

1353
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:59,494
but everyone remembers him as the villain.

1354
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:01,144
It wasn't exactly an evil character.

1355
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,033
But he was like a disruptor,

1356
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,503
so you could say he was a villain.

1357
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,674
But you took her home.

1358
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:12,674
(Yeon Seok helped Suzy home when she was drunk.)

1359
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:15,784
(Her love interest is watching.)

1360
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:18,554
(Let's get inside for now.)

1361
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:23,924
(The problematic scene that made every guy mad)

1362
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,763
The issue is that you took her to her house.

1363
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:28,093
(The spokesperson of the audience)

1364
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:30,933
That's your problem.

1365
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:32,794
But I didn't do it in real life.

1366
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,533
- What I'm saying is... - I mean,

1367
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:37,933
it was a character in a movie.

1368
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,403
- I know that it was a character. - So, why...

1369
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,373
You should have left the house.

1370
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:42,943
Then, people wouldn't hate you so much.

1371
00:45:42,944 --> 00:45:44,113
I wouldn't even have gone inside.

1372
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,344
That's right.

1373
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,843
You shouldn't have done it in the first place.

1374
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,520
You should have complained to the director.

1375
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:52,614
Who am I to do that? That was my job as the actor!

1376
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:55,553
- Tell the director... - "I won't go inside!"

1377
00:45:55,554 --> 00:45:58,953
- You should have told him, - I was a rookie actor at the time.

1378
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:02,263
"I'm going to need a scene of me leaving the house."

1379
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,864
- That's realistic advice. - That's how it is in real life.

1380
00:46:05,064 --> 00:46:06,603
I shot the scene where I took her home,

1381
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:08,404
and they told me to go home. What could I do?

1382
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,974
- Goodness. - Did I do something wrong?

1383
00:46:11,504 --> 00:46:14,064
You didn't know each other well when you shot that movie, right?

1384
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,373
- We knew each other. - We did.

1385
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:17,120
- When you shot that movie? I see. - Yes, we did.

1386
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:18,644
Not then. But when we filmed...

1387
00:46:18,814 --> 00:46:20,083
- "Hospital Playlist," we got close. - Of course.

1388
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:21,614
- Right. - Of course.

1389
00:46:21,814 --> 00:46:24,514
- He had his own car. - Right.

1390
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:26,054
The others were on foot.

1391
00:46:26,314 --> 00:46:28,024
He would sit on the stairs.

1392
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:31,523
- He would sit on the stairs a lot. - And I...

1393
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:33,224
Either sitting on the stairs...

1394
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,264
- or leaning on somewhere. - Right.

1395
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:37,333
That's what I did.

1396
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,310
- Right. He'd stand next to a wall. - Yes. He was...

1397
00:46:39,334 --> 00:46:41,133
- living a different life. - I would drive like this.

1398
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,464
- You would drive. - Right.

1399
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:44,173
Your acting made your character so annoying.

1400
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:46,603
- Right. - It won't be the same for everyone.

1401
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,203
When you think about your childhood,

1402
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:49,743
- It happened. - there were similar cases.

1403
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,743
- There are episodes... - There were seniors like him.

1404
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,243
- where you were hurt by them. - There were similar cases.

1405
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,843
I wasn't going out with this female friend.

1406
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:57,883
- There was nothing going on. - Right.

1407
00:46:57,884 --> 00:47:00,654
But there was this senior at school.

1408
00:47:01,024 --> 00:47:03,153
He would ask us if we had a meal,

1409
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,923
but he would only take the female juniors to a meal.

1410
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:06,663
- Right. That's similar to it. - That makes you get angry.

1411
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:07,963
- It makes you get angry. - And he had a car too?

1412
00:47:07,964 --> 00:47:09,263
Yes. He would give them a ride as well.

1413
00:47:09,264 --> 00:47:12,694
For that character, I wore half-rimless glasses on purpose.

1414
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,163
- When you wear them... Right. - It makes you look sharp.

1415
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:19,103
If there are rims above and there are no rims below,

1416
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:20,404
it makes you look...

1417
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,873
- That's right. - It makes you look condescending.

1418
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,234
- Because of the glasses. - Right.

1419
00:47:24,444 --> 00:47:26,143
- Your acting was good. - You did great.

1420
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,443
- Yeon Shik was good. - We're saying that you were great.

1421
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,744
Yeon Shik did really well.

1422
00:47:29,444 --> 00:47:30,913
Yeo Jeong, thank you for the meal.

1423
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,283
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

1424
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:33,853
- I really enjoyed it. - I'm glad I could treat you.

1425
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:35,124
With Jung Seok too.

1426
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,394
And Yeon Seok was good today.

1427
00:47:38,624 --> 00:47:39,694
What do you mean?

1428
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,934
- What did I do well today? - I mean...

1429
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,094
I loved that you startled him.

1430
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:52,003
Since we have some time left, shall we go to a cafe?

1431
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:53,643
- Let's do that. - We have some time left...

1432
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:55,320
- before going to the next spot. - It's crowded here.

1433
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:56,543
- Hold on. - It's 2pm now.

1434
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:57,744
At Daejang-ro...

1435
00:47:58,074 --> 00:47:59,883
It's at Daejang-ro? It's close.

1436
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:01,043
Right. You know this place.

1437
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,283
- Jung Seok knows this place... - I know it so well.

1438
00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:06,483
- so well. He knows everywhere. - That's right. I know it well.

1439
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,083
There are many places around here.

1440
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:09,564
- Good. Let's go there then. - Right.

1441
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:11,393
Gosh. It's pouring all of a sudden.

1442
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:12,694
- It's pouring? - Yes, it is.

1443
00:48:12,854 --> 00:48:13,894
Yeon Shik.

1444
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:15,824
Your hair might get wet.

1445
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:17,534
Gosh. Thank you.

1446
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:19,064
This is so nice of you.

1447
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,734
- Yeo Jeong, wait a minute. - Okay.

1448
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:22,534
Stay here.

1449
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:24,173
- I'll go for her. - Okay.

1450
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:25,174
All right.

1451
00:48:25,534 --> 00:48:27,450
- I'm okay because of my cap. - I was going to do it for you.

1452
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:28,873
What? No, it's fine.

1453
00:48:28,874 --> 00:48:30,173
- Let me do it for you. - Thank you.

1454
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:31,674
- You can give me this. - Okay.

1455
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:33,343
- Yeon Shik. - All right.

1456
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:34,384
Thank you.

1457
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:37,474
- Gosh. Thank you. - Fold it. Fold your umbrella.

1458
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,654
All right.

1459
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:44,493
Seriously. Since you're on a show,

1460
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:46,494
don't you think you should eat less, Yeo Jeong?

1461
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:49,423
You were talking to yourself?

1462
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:50,433
(Yeo Jeong was talking to herself.)

1463
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:51,694
- It was tasty. - Right.

1464
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:54,804
I was telling that to myself.

1465
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:57,464
It really is the rainy season.

1466
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,533
It's pouring today.

1467
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:00,804
Yes. It really is.

1468
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:02,773
- Jae Suk, I think you can... - What is it?

1469
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,173
Wear your rainboots now.

1470
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,684
- Gosh. I changed into sneakers. - You need them now.

1471
00:49:07,184 --> 00:49:08,913
- It's time to wear them. - Why did you change?

1472
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:10,513
- Goodness. - You need it now.

1473
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,184
It's pouring when I took off my rainboots.

1474
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,993
I like walking barefoot on a rainy day.

1475
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:18,323
- You like rainy days? - So...

1476
00:49:18,324 --> 00:49:19,753
- Yes. - Barefoot?

1477
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:21,523
- With slippers? - No, barefoot.

1478
00:49:21,524 --> 00:49:22,794
- Barefoot? - Yes. So...

1479
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:25,210
When it rains, I wear an umbrella and take off my shoes.

1480
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:28,033
And I walk barefoot while holding my shoes like this.

1481
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:29,874
- I wear an umbrella. - That's quite romantic.

1482
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,534
When I get home, my mom would say, "She's doing that again."

1483
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:34,144
Walking barefoot.

1484
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:36,004
I know what it is.

1485
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,874
I feel a sense of liberation when I do that.

1486
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:41,014
When I walk barefoot in rainy streets.

1487
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:44,114
- We're almost there. - Okay.

1488
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,883
So the next spot is here, right?

1489
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,283
- Yes. It's this place. - Okay.

1490
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:50,823
We should have something around here and go.

1491
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,654
- We should do that. - It's at 3pm.

1492
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,863
Actually, the area over there.

1493
00:49:55,864 --> 00:49:57,694
That's the area with many cafes.

1494
00:49:58,164 --> 00:49:59,234
This area is...

1495
00:49:59,494 --> 00:50:00,833
- There aren't many here. - Right.

1496
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,104
- There's one. - Over there.

1497
00:50:02,304 --> 00:50:03,934
- Let's just wait there. - Okay.

1498
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,234
- Let's just stay here. - Let's wait here.

1499
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,943
- Let's wait here until it's time. - Right.

1500
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:10,174
And there.

1501
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,843
- If you want some coffee, - Right.

1502
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:13,383
Let's get some from there.

1503
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:15,213
- Let's have them here. - While standing here.

1504
00:50:15,214 --> 00:50:17,913
- Yes. Standing here. - Or, we could go over there.

1505
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,483
- Okay. Let's go over there. - Under the rattan?

1506
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:20,723
- Okay. - That looks nice.

1507
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:23,044
- Let's cross the road then. - Jae Suk, take the umbrella.

1508
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:26,054
(He starts running right away.)

1509
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:29,893
We should do this as a game.

1510
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,454
- How? - To pick who'll buy the coffee.

1511
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:33,634
- All right. - That sounds good.

1512
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:34,763
It's okay, right?

1513
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,004
I feel excited all of a sudden.

1514
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,503
- Okay. - They look wet.

1515
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:40,703
The bench is wet.

1516
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,104
This is...

1517
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:43,943
- But still, we can take shelter. - We have no other option.

1518
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:45,374
- We can take shelter. - Right.

1519
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:47,444
- Good. - A game for coffee?

1520
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,283
Let's play a game now.

1521
00:50:49,284 --> 00:50:51,083
- It's an outdoor game. - Let's get the order.

1522
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:52,724
- Okay. - It could be coffee or anything.

1523
00:50:53,014 --> 00:50:54,084
What game will we play?

1524
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,854
This time, let's use a stopwatch.

1525
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,524
Let's try stopping the watch before ten seconds.

1526
00:51:00,194 --> 00:51:02,194
- Let's do a multiplication. - A multiplication?

1527
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:04,493
- For example... - It's 84.

1528
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,003
- Then, 8 times 4 is 32. - I see. So that's how you do it.

1529
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:09,164
The one with the smallest number loses?

1530
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:11,104
The one with the highest number? Which one?

1531
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,974
- The one with the lowest number. - Okay then.

1532
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:15,843
- All right. - You should go first.

1533
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:16,973
- I'll go first. - Okay.

1534
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,213
(Jae Suk will go first.)

1535
00:51:18,214 --> 00:51:19,844
- Ready. - Ready, go.

1536
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:23,124
(Jae Suk stops the watch.)

1537
00:51:24,654 --> 00:51:25,713
It's zero.

1538
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:26,853
(He gets a zero right away.)

1539
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:27,884
It's zero.

1540
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:29,983
My goodness.

1541
00:51:29,984 --> 00:51:31,694
- He's it. - I mean...

1542
00:51:31,824 --> 00:51:33,823
We don't know yet. We could get a zero too.

1543
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,093
(The cameraman is zooming in to tease Jae Suk.)

1544
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:36,594
But isn't it already decided?

1545
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,793
- Isn't that the worst result? - He's it.

1546
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:41,334
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1547
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:45,273
- There's going to be one person. - All right.

1548
00:51:45,274 --> 00:51:47,073
I got the hang of it after watching you do it.

1549
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,173
- We don't know yet. - You might get a zero too.

1550
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:50,573
- We don't know yet. - In five seconds.

1551
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,574
Okay.

1552
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,144
(It's a pass if he doesn't get a 0.)

1553
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:58,354
- It's 20. - He got 20.

1554
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:01,024
- Next is... - My gosh.

1555
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:04,094
- Ready, go. - That's unbelievable.

1556
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:07,624
- She got 2. - It's 2.

1557
00:52:08,164 --> 00:52:09,670
- If I don't get a zero... - It's Yeon Seok's turn.

1558
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,454
- Let's have the final match. - It can't be.

1559
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:13,534
Let's end it here.

1560
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:15,610
- A final match? - Let's have the final match.

1561
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,633
- Goodness. - Let's see how it goes.

1562
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,594
- I'm not sure about this. - He might get a zero.

1563
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:22,003
- I won't get a zero here. - You might get it.

1564
00:52:22,004 --> 00:52:23,004
- Ready, go. - Go.

1565
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:24,724
(The watch starts running.)

1566
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:26,644
- Please get a zero. - Press it.

1567
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,344
- Please get a zero. - Press it.

1568
00:52:31,954 --> 00:52:33,234
- Please get a zero. - Press it.

1569
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:35,589
(Yeon Seok gets 2 and 1. It's 2.)

1570
00:52:35,924 --> 00:52:37,023
He got a two.

1571
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:39,524
(Without a twist, Jae Suk lost in the end.)

1572
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:41,363
Gosh, this is the worst result.

1573
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:43,563
Let's have coffee that Jae Suk buys for us.

1574
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:45,264
- Thank you for the drink. - Okay.

1575
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:47,504
What would you like to have?

1576
00:52:48,134 --> 00:52:49,264
- Me? - Well...

1577
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:51,524
I'll have an iced Americano.

1578
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:53,034
- An iced Americano? - Yes.

1579
00:52:53,744 --> 00:52:56,344
I'll have a cappuccino.

1580
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:57,813
A hot cappuccino.

1581
00:52:57,814 --> 00:52:59,973
- What will you have? - Well... I'll have...

1582
00:52:59,974 --> 00:53:01,043
What was that?

1583
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,514
(She sounded like a global star.)

1584
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:07,754
- What will you have? - I'll have an iced vanilla latte.

1585
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:09,523
- An iced vanilla latte? - Yes.

1586
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:10,693
Thank you, Jae Suk.

1587
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:13,493
Iced vanilla latte, iced Americano, and a cappuccino.

1588
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:16,464
This is our chance to have coffee delivered by Jae Suk.

1589
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:18,934
Gosh, I was so unlucky.

1590
00:53:21,004 --> 00:53:23,104
I never win when I do something like this.

1591
00:53:23,874 --> 00:53:24,934
We have 8, 7 seconds left.

1592
00:53:25,004 --> 00:53:26,004
(He runs again.)

1593
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:28,573
Five, four, three...

1594
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:29,703
(He runs whenever he has a chance.)

1595
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:31,944
Look at him. He's running again.

1596
00:53:32,214 --> 00:53:33,444
Why does he run all the time?

1597
00:53:34,014 --> 00:53:35,113
Hello.

1598
00:53:35,114 --> 00:53:36,513
(He arrived at a cafe after running.)

1599
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:37,614
Let's see.

1600
00:53:38,284 --> 00:53:39,614
Iced vanilla latte?

1601
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:41,183
There's vanilla latte.

1602
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,754
(Jae Suk looks for the drinks that they ordered.)

1603
00:53:45,024 --> 00:53:46,254
There's no cappuccino.

1604
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,364
(Flustered)

1605
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:49,693
Hello.

1606
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:51,664
I'll have a cup of iced Americano.

1607
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:55,704
- I'll have one vanilla latte. - Okay.

1608
00:53:56,164 --> 00:53:59,104
And a cup of hot latte.

1609
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:00,804
A latte.

1610
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:03,614
He can have a latte.

1611
00:54:04,144 --> 00:54:05,644
How's the Mungyeong omija tea?

1612
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:07,243
Should I try it?

1613
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,684
I saw that on the menu.

1614
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:11,054
I'll have Mungyeong omija tea.

1615
00:54:11,154 --> 00:54:12,254
With ice. Good.

1616
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:15,484
(Yeon Seok has no idea.)

1617
00:54:16,784 --> 00:54:19,093
Gosh. It's so nice to be outside when it's raining.

1618
00:54:19,094 --> 00:54:21,464
- The rain is cool. - Yes. It's cool.

1619
00:54:21,864 --> 00:54:23,194
The rain is coming from the side.

1620
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,454
- I want to use mouthwash. - What?

1621
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:27,063
- Mouthwash? - Me too.

1622
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,333
Jung Seok, there's water over there.

1623
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:29,434
There are many options.

1624
00:54:30,474 --> 00:54:31,773
- Using rain as mouthwash? - That's...

1625
00:54:31,774 --> 00:54:32,974
Using the rain?

1626
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:35,374
To brush his teeth.

1627
00:54:35,904 --> 00:54:37,773
(Dumbfounded)

1628
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,473
- We're not in a jungle. - Why won't you say anything?

1629
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:40,483
Are we at a mountain village?

1630
00:54:40,484 --> 00:54:42,213
- I know. Are we in a jungle? - Are we at a mountain village?

1631
00:54:42,214 --> 00:54:43,813
- Rain as mouthwash. - That reminds me...

1632
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:44,983
of the things we did at the mountain village.

1633
00:54:44,984 --> 00:54:46,653
- You've never been to a jungle? - We're in a city now.

1634
00:54:46,654 --> 00:54:48,023
- No. - You've never been to it?

1635
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:50,223
- It's not easy to hang in there. - I think I saw a video of you.

1636
00:54:50,224 --> 00:54:53,124
- You were in a jungle. - I was holding an armadillo.

1637
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:54,563
- I screamed. - It was a famous video.

1638
00:54:54,564 --> 00:54:55,793
I'm famous.

1639
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,234
There was this famous video.

1640
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:00,233
Young kids don't know about my movies,

1641
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:01,263
but they know that video.

1642
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,463
- I was on "Law of the Jungle." - Right.

1643
00:55:02,464 --> 00:55:03,673
- On "Law of the Jungle." - The woman who screamed.

1644
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:06,403
- Yes. There was a famous video. - Yes. I was afraid of the animals,

1645
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:07,704
- so I screamed. - Right.

1646
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:08,944
Jae Suk is coming.

1647
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:10,373
He's not wearing an umbrella.

1648
00:55:10,374 --> 00:55:11,913
I should keep a record of this.

1649
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:13,143
Yes. Record it.

1650
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,344
I should do it like this.

1651
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:18,684
Jae Suk is delivering our coffee.

1652
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:20,953
Tell him this is a cappuccino.

1653
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:23,224
(Jae Suk tells him to keep it a secret.)

1654
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:25,694
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1655
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:28,423
- This is a vanilla latte. - Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

1656
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:30,094
This is for Yeon Shik.

1657
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:31,463
- For Yeon Shik. - It's cappuccino.

1658
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:32,563
Okay. Thank you.

1659
00:55:32,564 --> 00:55:33,704
- Thank you. - All right.

1660
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,103
Thank you.

1661
00:55:35,104 --> 00:55:37,633
- Jae Suk delivered coffee for us. - And this one is mine.

1662
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,203
- Thank you for the drink. - Please enjoy it.

1663
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:41,174
Thank you, Jae Suk.

1664
00:55:41,344 --> 00:55:44,074
What do you mean, Yeo Jeong? Compared to what you bought today...

1665
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,584
- It's nice, right? - It's good.

1666
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:51,254
(Chuckling)

1667
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,154
How's the cappuccino?

1668
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:55,483
It's so mild.

1669
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,953
(He says it's mild as he drinks latte.)

1670
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,193
Since it's from you...

1671
00:55:59,194 --> 00:56:00,363
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1672
00:56:00,364 --> 00:56:01,424
Please enjoy it.

1673
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:05,063
Why is it so tasty when we have this on the street?

1674
00:56:05,064 --> 00:56:06,194
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1675
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:08,814
- Because someone got it for you. - Is that so?

1676
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:11,104
My gosh.

1677
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,473
- Someone should buy it for you. - Right.

1678
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:14,543
The best drink is...

1679
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:15,773
- When Jae Suk buys it for you. - Of course.

1680
00:56:15,774 --> 00:56:16,774
Right.

1681
00:56:16,775 --> 00:56:18,173
- When he gets it by himself. - When he buys it for you.

1682
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,320
(The younger ones are excited since the coffee is from Jae Suk.)

1683
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:21,013
- It's tastier. - You love it so much.

1684
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:22,643
- He really enjoys it. - Right.

1685
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:23,684
Goodness.

1686
00:56:24,684 --> 00:56:25,854
It's so mild.

1687
00:56:27,324 --> 00:56:29,154
- Shall we go now? - It's about time we go.

1688
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:31,353
- It's not raining much now. - But still, it's raining.

1689
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,194
- You won't tell Yeon Seok about it? - What?

1690
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:35,423
What? That I didn't get a cappuccino for him?

1691
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:36,424
- No. - What?

1692
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:37,693
- He said he liked it. - It wasn't a cappuccino?

1693
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,463
I got a latte for him because there was no cappuccino.

1694
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:40,533
But he thinks it's cappuccino.

1695
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:41,863
I see.

1696
00:56:41,864 --> 00:56:43,533
Didn't he get a barista certificate?

1697
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:44,634
That's right.

1698
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,003
(Yeon Seok has a barista certificate.)

1699
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:47,803
He's enjoying it so much.

1700
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,203
(He has no idea about this.)

1701
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:50,790
- He doesn't know about it. - It's on SBS.

1702
00:56:50,814 --> 00:56:51,944
Is the cappuccino good?

1703
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:53,674
Of course, it's good.

1704
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,213
Somebody got this for me.

1705
00:56:56,214 --> 00:56:57,283
Good.

1706
00:56:57,284 --> 00:56:58,753
- What? What is it? - It's good that...

1707
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:00,213
you're enjoying what I got for you.

1708
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:01,324
Please enjoy it.

1709
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,684
Let's go.

1710
00:57:02,824 --> 00:57:04,323
Why do you keep giving me a thumbs-up?

1711
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:07,023
Well, it's because you said it was good.

1712
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,824
- It's because we feel happy. - That's right.

1713
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:11,193
- He's happy, and I'm happy too. - Right.

1714
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,434
(Everyone is happy in the end.)

1715
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:15,163
- My goodness, - Hello.

1716
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:19,073
- Hello. - Hi.

1717
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:20,374
- Hi. - Hi.

1718
00:57:20,874 --> 00:57:22,743
- Gosh, it's Cho Jung Seok. - Hello.

1719
00:57:22,744 --> 00:57:23,873
He said, "Gosh, it's Cho Jung Seok."

1720
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,344
Gosh, that was so cute.

1721
00:57:26,014 --> 00:57:27,844
These guys...

1722
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:31,253
must be going to some academies after school.

1723
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:32,983
- I know. Heading to academies. - Right.

1724
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:34,700
Right. They're on their way to their academies.

1725
00:57:34,724 --> 00:57:37,153
"Lee Hye Won and Cho Eun Gyo."

1726
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,253
"Before going to work, after going to work,"

1727
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:42,624
"and even after work, we're together 24 hours a day."

1728
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:45,304
"Mom is a thinking type, and the daughter is a feeling type."

1729
00:57:45,664 --> 00:57:49,004
"The way we talk and our taste in fashion are so different."

1730
00:57:49,264 --> 00:57:50,933
"We argue with each other every day,"

1731
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,043
"but we become a perfect team when we're together."

1732
00:57:54,044 --> 00:57:57,444
"Could you please cheer up our day?"

1733
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,743
- All right. - A mother and a daughter.

1734
00:57:58,744 --> 00:58:00,543
- They go to work together. - Right.

1735
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:01,643
Maybe they work at a cafe together.

1736
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,944
- I see. - That's possible.

1737
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,753
What? You were right.

1738
00:58:05,754 --> 00:58:07,253
- "Cheerleading?" - Goodness.

1739
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:08,584
Hello.

1740
00:58:08,854 --> 00:58:11,324
- We're at the right place. - Hello.

1741
00:58:12,094 --> 00:58:13,094
(The second spare time is at a cheerleading academy.)

1742
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:14,863
- It's an academy. - Hello.

1743
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,424
- So, a mother and daughter? - Hello.

1744
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:18,893
- You two resemble each other. - They do look alike.

1745
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:20,163
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Eun Gyo, the second Whenever Guests)

1746
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,264
Nice to meet you.

1747
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:24,073
It seems like this academy is quite new.

1748
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:25,303
Right. It hasn't been that long.

1749
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:27,973
It's been about a year and four months.

1750
00:58:27,974 --> 00:58:30,813
These days, there are many cheerleaders...

1751
00:58:30,814 --> 00:58:32,273
- who became popular. - That's right.

1752
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:34,544
In Korea, there are cheerleaders...

1753
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,083
at baseball or basketball games,

1754
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:39,813
and they come to most people's minds at first.

1755
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:40,923
But what we're doing...

1756
00:58:40,924 --> 00:58:42,983
- is called sports cheerleading. - Right.

1757
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:45,053
- They're different? - Right. They are different things.

1758
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,423
On the sign, it said, "Gymnastics."

1759
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:49,263
- Right. - Were you a gymnast?

1760
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:51,993
Yes. In 2022 and 2023,

1761
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,433
I was a member of the national cheerleading team.

1762
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:54,503
Is that so?

1763
00:58:54,504 --> 00:58:56,404
- Really? - Because her outfit...

1764
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:58,710
- Isn't that for national players? - You're right.

1765
00:58:58,734 --> 00:58:59,873
I see.

1766
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,643
How old were you when you were on the national team?

1767
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:03,003
- I was... - Were you 23?

1768
00:59:03,004 --> 00:59:04,413
I was about 23 or 24.

1769
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:05,613
You were 23 or 24?

1770
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:08,343
- You look like you're that age now. - I thought so too.

1771
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,853
I'm 26 in Korean age,

1772
00:59:10,854 --> 00:59:13,114
and I'm 24 in international age.

1773
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:15,224
- Well... - Goodness.

1774
00:59:16,084 --> 00:59:18,293
- You get to do that. Right. - Right.

1775
00:59:18,294 --> 00:59:20,493
- Age is confusing. - You're always 24 years old.

1776
00:59:20,494 --> 00:59:21,663
That's right.

1777
00:59:21,664 --> 00:59:24,733
Back then, we used a different age system.

1778
00:59:24,734 --> 00:59:26,763
When the new age system was adopted,

1779
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,064
I was 40 for a few years.

1780
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:31,603
- I was 39 for a few years, - He was...

1781
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:33,573
Since about three years ago, we've been arguing about...

1782
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:34,643
- the age system. - Right.

1783
00:59:34,644 --> 00:59:36,003
I think you're about the same age as me.

1784
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:37,314
Which year were you born in?

1785
00:59:37,544 --> 00:59:38,613
I was born in 1971.

1786
00:59:38,614 --> 00:59:40,274
Then you're a year older than me.

1787
00:59:41,114 --> 00:59:42,243
I shouldn't have said that.

1788
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:44,013
(She revealed her age unexpectedly.)

1789
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,954
- I wanted to be comforted. - It's okay.

1790
00:59:46,314 --> 00:59:48,234
If you want to be friends with me, I'll do that.

1791
00:59:49,324 --> 00:59:51,853
That's what we've been talking about on our way here.

1792
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:54,893
- We can be flexible. - Okay.

1793
00:59:54,894 --> 00:59:57,293
We'll do as you want. Right?

1794
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:59,334
- That's right. - Right.

1795
00:59:59,664 --> 01:00:02,704
By the way, you're cheerleading too?

1796
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:06,604
Actually, I was a cheerleading coach.

1797
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:10,073
I was a coach, and I worked as a judge...

1798
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:13,613
for a while, longer than being a coach.

1799
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,343
My daughter grew up as I was doing that.

1800
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:18,984
As she grew up, we talked about trying cheerleading,

1801
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:21,553
and she did it until she was on the national team.

1802
01:00:21,554 --> 01:00:24,953
And since I was still working in the field,

1803
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:28,123
I offered her to teach classes here with me.

1804
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,923
And actually, she's much better than me.

1805
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:31,663
So Eun Gyo,

1806
01:00:31,664 --> 01:00:34,333
you were affected by your mother when deciding your career.

1807
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:36,003
Yes. When I was this little,

1808
01:00:36,004 --> 01:00:38,073
when my mom practiced,

1809
01:00:38,074 --> 01:00:40,073
I would dance like this next to her in front of the mirror.

1810
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,243
We still have videos of me doing that.

1811
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:45,413
So I was affected by her a lot.

1812
01:00:45,414 --> 01:00:48,243
It's a bit embarrassing to say this in front of her,

1813
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,983
but she's the mentor of my life,

1814
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:51,483
and I think of her as my guide.

1815
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:53,813
Her mother must be so happy...

1816
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:55,723
- to hear this. - You must be so proud.

1817
01:00:55,724 --> 01:00:56,853
She must be so proud.

1818
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:58,093
(She feels shy because of her daughter's compliment.)

1819
01:00:58,094 --> 01:01:00,153
So we read the letter...

1820
01:01:00,154 --> 01:01:01,924
you wrote to us.

1821
01:01:02,424 --> 01:01:04,033
It said you went to work together.

1822
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,034
That's right.

1823
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:07,703
- For 24 hours a day... - We're always together.

1824
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:08,833
How is it?

1825
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:11,333
The pro of working together...

1826
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,773
is that mom is here.

1827
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:16,444
But the con of working together is the same.

1828
01:01:16,804 --> 01:01:18,513
- Of course. It must be... - Right.

1829
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:19,743
It's an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time.

1830
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:22,043
You have to be with you mother...

1831
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:23,443
even when you're at work.

1832
01:01:23,444 --> 01:01:25,113
- Of course, it would be nice. - Right.

1833
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,813
- Yes. - And...

1834
01:01:26,814 --> 01:01:29,284
- What are the shortcomings? - Shortcomings?

1835
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:32,253
- Tell them. - First, it's...

1836
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:34,863
If I describe myself with MBTI,

1837
01:01:34,864 --> 01:01:36,493
- I'm a feeling type. - I see.

1838
01:01:36,494 --> 01:01:38,963
- You could be emotional. - So when I talk,

1839
01:01:38,964 --> 01:01:41,763
I prefer using soft words.

1840
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,473
But my mom is from Gyeongsang Province.

1841
01:01:44,474 --> 01:01:47,404
And her words can be quite direct. So she is...

1842
01:01:47,744 --> 01:01:51,243
- She's a strict teacher. - I see.

1843
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:53,873
And she raised me strictly.

1844
01:01:53,874 --> 01:01:55,083
(Inhaling)

1845
01:01:55,084 --> 01:01:56,804
So that's what you wanted to say about her.

1846
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:58,954
- That's not true. - "She raised me strictly."

1847
01:01:59,484 --> 01:02:01,923
It seems like you have things to say too.

1848
01:02:01,924 --> 01:02:05,093
This is one of the things that leads to an argument.

1849
01:02:05,094 --> 01:02:07,423
But since I work with my family,

1850
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:08,963
there are many more good aspects.

1851
01:02:08,964 --> 01:02:11,433
- Of course. - Working in the same field...

1852
01:02:11,434 --> 01:02:13,464
and running a business with your family...

1853
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:16,263
Being able to spend time together like this...

1854
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:17,733
- is quite rare. - Right.

1855
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,974
Actually, this is the biggest reason I applied for the show.

1856
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,273
I won't be living like this...

1857
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:26,043
with mom forever.

1858
01:02:26,044 --> 01:02:29,443
We won't be doing business together for like 50 to 60 years.

1859
01:02:29,444 --> 01:02:31,113
If I get to see this video later,

1860
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,313
it would be a record of a precious memory.

1861
01:02:33,314 --> 01:02:34,723
- That's why you applied for it. - Right.

1862
01:02:34,724 --> 01:02:36,624
By the way, at this time around...

1863
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:39,253
Did the students go home after class?

1864
01:02:39,254 --> 01:02:42,764
No. I went to a school for classes in the morning.

1865
01:02:42,924 --> 01:02:45,663
This is the time when I prepare for the academy classes.

1866
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:47,463
- I see. - It's a spare time for that.

1867
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:48,603
(Looking around)

1868
01:02:48,604 --> 01:02:51,474
As I look around, this size of this place is huge.

1869
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,274
- It's quite a big place. - Yes.

1870
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,343
There are many children in this neighborhood.

1871
01:02:55,344 --> 01:02:57,143
You know, the number of children is decreasing.

1872
01:02:57,144 --> 01:02:59,373
- Right. - But in this neighborhood,

1873
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:01,114
the classrooms are overcrowding.

1874
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,313
- Is that so? - Yes.

1875
01:03:02,314 --> 01:03:03,314
- This area is like that. - Really?

1876
01:03:03,315 --> 01:03:05,113
- The school expanded. - That's how it is around here.

1877
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,283
- That's quite unusual these days. - Right.

1878
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,554
The number of classes are...

1879
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:10,283
- About 11 classes in each grade. - Right.

1880
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,993
- That's how it is. - There are 11 classes?

1881
01:03:11,994 --> 01:03:13,694
There are so many classes here.

1882
01:03:14,054 --> 01:03:15,994
So that's how it is.

1883
01:03:16,094 --> 01:03:18,194
- You can't stop smiling. - I know.

1884
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:20,263
I could feel that you were satisfied...

1885
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:22,003
- with the situation. - Right.

1886
01:03:22,004 --> 01:03:23,934
- Well, no. - "I'm glad I came to this place."

1887
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:26,980
"I had foresight when choosing the place for the academy."

1888
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:28,873
- So now... - This time...

1889
01:03:28,874 --> 01:03:30,913
- Let's have Jung Seok do it. - Okay.

1890
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:31,974
All right.

1891
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:33,714
Please give me two.

1892
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:34,884
Let's go.

1893
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:39,514
- It's 1. - He got 1.

1894
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,924
- That's okay. - That's good enough.

1895
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:44,854
- The prize. - Let's see the prize.

1896
01:03:45,094 --> 01:03:46,623
"The makeup completes the performance."

1897
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:49,023
"Help them change for their performances."

1898
01:03:49,024 --> 01:03:51,594
"Olive Young gift card for 300 dollars."

1899
01:03:51,764 --> 01:03:52,963
- For 300 dollars? - A gift card...

1900
01:03:52,964 --> 01:03:55,103
- for 300 dollars. - That sounds good.

1901
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:57,603
You can get anything at Olive Young.

1902
01:03:57,604 --> 01:03:59,203
- For your students, or... - It's not yours yet.

1903
01:03:59,204 --> 01:04:00,433
Not yet.

1904
01:04:00,434 --> 01:04:02,473
- We almost gave this to you. - Oh, right.

1905
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:04,073
- But we must succeed. - I was in a hurry.

1906
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,043
(A Close Call, Slipper Basketball)

1907
01:04:06,044 --> 01:04:07,143
(Stand on a BOSU ball.)

1908
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:09,413
(Throw the slipper on the yoga block.)

1909
01:04:09,414 --> 01:04:10,513
(Round 1)

1910
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,484
(Put 1 slipper on the block.)

1911
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:14,800
- We must do it on this, right? - We need to stand on it.

1912
01:04:14,824 --> 01:04:16,283
- We put a slipper on that block. - Right.

1913
01:04:16,284 --> 01:04:17,754
On that block.

1914
01:04:19,394 --> 01:04:21,293
It's not easy to aim at it.

1915
01:04:21,294 --> 01:04:23,164
- We throw it with our feet? - With our feet.

1916
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:24,593
Jae Suk, practice.

1917
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:25,954
(Jae Suk stands on the BOSU ball.)

1918
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:27,503
- A practice. - Goodness.

1919
01:04:27,504 --> 01:04:28,504
My goodness.

1920
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:29,863
- This isn't easy. - I know.

1921
01:04:29,864 --> 01:04:30,903
It's hard to just throw the slipper.

1922
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:32,133
Gosh, this isn't easy.

1923
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,804
I see.

1924
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:36,174
- Let's practice once. - Yes. You should do that.

1925
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:38,974
Gosh, this is...

1926
01:04:41,184 --> 01:04:42,184
Hold on.

1927
01:04:42,414 --> 01:04:45,314
Standing on it is already difficult.

1928
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:46,484
It's hard.

1929
01:04:46,485 --> 01:04:47,654
Oh, I got it.

1930
01:04:48,024 --> 01:04:49,054
Oh, I got it.

1931
01:04:49,884 --> 01:04:51,054
I should do it a bit weaker.

1932
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,123
My goodness.

1933
01:04:53,124 --> 01:04:54,994
All right. Goodness.

1934
01:04:56,764 --> 01:04:58,364
- Stand with both feet, and... - Okay.

1935
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:01,704
Gosh, that was too strong.

1936
01:05:01,834 --> 01:05:04,733
It gets stronger when you kick it while trying to balance.

1937
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,834
- Try it. - Should I?

1938
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:10,503
Maybe wearing both slippers could help balance on the ball.

1939
01:05:10,504 --> 01:05:12,344
(She's wearing slippers on both feet.)

1940
01:05:16,614 --> 01:05:18,314
It's better not to wear it.

1941
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:21,854
Yeo Jeong.

1942
01:05:21,954 --> 01:05:23,683
- It's better without it. - Things are...

1943
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:25,154
not going well for you, Yeo Jeong.

1944
01:05:25,994 --> 01:05:27,394
I really want to do this.

1945
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,193
Your posture is so nice when you're on the ball.

1946
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:32,293
- I know. - She's like a dancer.

1947
01:05:32,294 --> 01:05:33,963
Actually, at a dance academy,

1948
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,163
I had classes on BOSU balls.

1949
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:37,874
Yes. That's perfectly like dance.

1950
01:05:38,374 --> 01:05:39,404
All right.

1951
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:41,173
(It landed just in front of the mat.)

1952
01:05:41,174 --> 01:05:43,644
- Yeo Jeong, I think you can do it. - It would work, right?

1953
01:05:43,744 --> 01:05:45,243
Yeo Jeong did Pilates, so...

1954
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:46,813
- Right. - She can balance well.

1955
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:48,114
Gosh, this isn't easy.

1956
01:05:54,324 --> 01:05:56,023
(It's on the mat.)

1957
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:57,254
- Nice. - Goodness.

1958
01:05:57,484 --> 01:05:58,623
(Okay.)

1959
01:05:58,624 --> 01:06:00,224
- At his first try? - Gosh.

1960
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:01,994
- Nice. - Goodness.

1961
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:05,434
It was done so easily.

1962
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:06,764
(Expectations are growing.)

1963
01:06:06,765 --> 01:06:08,563
- It was done easily. - It's just 1 person for Round 1?

1964
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:09,963
- Nice. - One person?

1965
01:06:09,964 --> 01:06:11,903
- This is doable. - Just one person?

1966
01:06:11,904 --> 01:06:13,373
- Shall we go for it? - Let's go for it.

1967
01:06:13,374 --> 01:06:14,403
Let's do a cheer together.

1968
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:15,703
- Let's go! - Let's do this.

1969
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:17,203
- Let's go for it. - Okay.

1970
01:06:17,204 --> 01:06:18,590
- We have a good chance. - All right.

1971
01:06:18,614 --> 01:06:19,973
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1972
01:06:19,974 --> 01:06:21,014
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1973
01:06:21,484 --> 01:06:22,844
It's our first try.

1974
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:25,213
- Yeo Jeong. - Let's go!

1975
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:26,913
- Let's go! - Yeo Jeong did Pilates,

1976
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,224
so she has great balance.

1977
01:06:28,424 --> 01:06:30,884
(She gracefully gets ready.)

1978
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:39,634
(It lands right in front of her.)

1979
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:42,304
(Embarrassed)

1980
01:06:42,734 --> 01:06:43,854
She was the first one to go.

1981
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,033
- My gosh. - Give it a try, Jung Seok.

1982
01:06:46,034 --> 01:06:47,943
What's wrong with me today?

1983
01:06:47,944 --> 01:06:49,503
You're showing a lot today, Yeo Jeong.

1984
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:50,504
(First try, Yeo Jeong fails.)

1985
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:53,144
- You're showing a lot today. - Right.

1986
01:06:54,214 --> 01:06:55,543
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1987
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,714
(First try, Jung Seok)

1988
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,383
(It's another out-of-the-park home run.)

1989
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,723
- It was slightly too strong. - That was close.

1990
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:04,524
- I used too much power. - That was close.

1991
01:07:05,224 --> 01:07:06,224
Gosh.

1992
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:08,763
We manage to get it done during practice,

1993
01:07:08,764 --> 01:07:10,724
but it never happens during the actual game.

1994
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,863
Do it as if you're practicing.

1995
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:15,234
(As if you're practicing!)

1996
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,704
Right. As if I'm practicing.

1997
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:21,674
- He did it! - He did it!

1998
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:25,943
- Gosh! - Gosh!

1999
01:07:25,944 --> 01:07:27,273
(That was so close.)

2000
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:28,384
That was so close.

2001
01:07:29,414 --> 01:07:30,444
Gosh, that was so close.

2002
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,413
Gosh!

2003
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:35,453
- You can't take too long on top. - Let's go.

2004
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:37,383
You have to shoot in three seconds as soon as you get up.

2005
01:07:37,384 --> 01:07:38,393
You're right.

2006
01:07:38,394 --> 01:07:40,194
- It's like archery. - He's right about that.

2007
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:41,793
- In three seconds. - Make it quick.

2008
01:07:41,794 --> 01:07:42,794
Gosh, that was close.

2009
01:07:43,724 --> 01:07:45,394
You still have to have good balance.

2010
01:07:47,804 --> 01:07:50,604
- I didn't even go up yet. - I'm just saying.

2011
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,803
- Well... - I didn't even go up.

2012
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:56,043
It's not the three seconds that are important as soon as you go up.

2013
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:58,314
You're really strict with Yeon Seok.

2014
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,774
- I'm just saying. - I didn't even go up yet!

2015
01:08:01,084 --> 01:08:02,483
I'm just saying the obvious.

2016
01:08:02,484 --> 01:08:03,760
I'm telling him to keep his good balance.

2017
01:08:03,784 --> 01:08:05,453
- You're right about that. - Right.

2018
01:08:05,454 --> 01:08:07,053
- I will keep my balance. - Exactly.

2019
01:08:07,054 --> 01:08:08,084
Here I go.

2020
01:08:10,484 --> 01:08:13,294
One, two, three.

2021
01:08:13,994 --> 01:08:15,024
It's there!

2022
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:18,933
It's there!

2023
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:20,863
(It bounces off the block.)

2024
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:21,934
Gosh, that was close!

2025
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:23,504
That was a great attempt.

2026
01:08:24,474 --> 01:08:25,874
Gosh, it bounced off.

2027
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,534
- We failed with our first try. - Right.

2028
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:28,874
Our second try?

2029
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:30,943
- Go for it right away? - Here we go.

2030
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:31,944
Who will go first?
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2031
01:08:32,945 --> 01:08:34,043
- I'll go first. - Okay.

2032
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,114
Great.

2033
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:37,884
You should go second.

2034
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:39,283
(Second try, Jung Seok)

2035
01:08:39,284 --> 01:08:40,954
You can go on it right away.

2036
01:08:45,924 --> 01:08:46,924
(Second try, Jung Seok fails.)

2037
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,664
Your shots are a little too strong.

2038
01:08:49,364 --> 01:08:51,194
- Why are they strong? - Just by a little.

2039
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:52,994
Why are they strong?

2040
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:54,963
- Come on, Yeo Jeong. - Right.

2041
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,604
- Do it with confidence. - Okay.

2042
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:58,934
It must be because he's too strong.

2043
01:08:59,374 --> 01:09:02,174
(Second try, Yeo Jeong)

2044
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:04,844
She did it!

2045
01:09:06,944 --> 01:09:09,084
(She did it?)

2046
01:09:10,344 --> 01:09:11,554
She did it!

2047
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:15,483
She did it!

2048
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,453
(It's another failure after bouncing off.)

2049
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:18,553
Gosh!

2050
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,393
(Second try, Yeo Jeong fails.)

2051
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:21,494
That was close!

2052
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,064
But I got it now.

2053
01:09:23,294 --> 01:09:25,433
- I know how it works. - "I know how it works."

2054
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:26,593
I can do this.

2055
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:28,334
- We're almost there. - We can do this.

2056
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:30,164
I've found my aim.

2057
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:33,003
It's either you or me.

2058
01:09:33,004 --> 01:09:35,324
Either one of us should make it for things to go smoothly.

2059
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:37,814
This time, I'll go with a lower trajectory.

2060
01:09:38,914 --> 01:09:39,914
(Focusing)
All right.

2061
01:09:43,144 --> 01:09:44,884
- Hold on! - What was that?

2062
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:48,754
(Lower trajectory?)

2063
01:09:49,324 --> 01:09:50,353
(What was that?)

2064
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:51,394
Where did it go?

2065
01:09:51,824 --> 01:09:53,454
(It's here.)

2066
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:55,664
That was a humble attempt.

2067
01:09:56,424 --> 01:09:58,093
That was a humble attempt. I wasn't the only one who did that.

2068
01:09:58,094 --> 01:09:59,294
(Second try, Yeon Seok fails.)

2069
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:02,534
No. Jae Suk will make it.

2070
01:10:06,504 --> 01:10:08,873
- It can bounce on top like that. - Right.

2071
01:10:08,874 --> 01:10:11,213
Right. But I think it falls when it hits that part.

2072
01:10:11,214 --> 01:10:12,214
(They fail with their second try.)

2073
01:10:12,215 --> 01:10:14,513
- I should practice. - Try using less power.

2074
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:16,413
- How can I do that? - Right.

2075
01:10:16,414 --> 01:10:17,744
Don't use any unnecessary power.

2076
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:19,514
(Chuckling)

2077
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:23,783
The two of them really tell each other off.

2078
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:25,064
(They're fighting all day long.)

2079
01:10:26,624 --> 01:10:27,693
You did it! Gosh!

2080
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:28,793
(It bounces off again.)

2081
01:10:28,794 --> 01:10:30,023
It bounces off after hitting the block.

2082
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:31,024
It's so hard.

2083
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,334
Won't it bounce off even more then?

2084
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:36,533
I've done this with Tae Hyun before.

2085
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:37,633
You've done this before.

2086
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,903
- It has to be done casually. - Freely.

2087
01:10:39,904 --> 01:10:41,573
Shoot as soon as you get up.

2088
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:43,904
- Casually. - Here!

2089
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:50,114
Right.

2090
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:52,054
It has to be done casually.

2091
01:10:52,684 --> 01:10:55,423
- What happened? - Just like this with no pressure.

2092
01:10:55,424 --> 01:10:57,324
Just do it casually.

2093
01:10:57,484 --> 01:11:00,154
- Like this! - Jae Suk.

2094
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:01,763
We should use the coupon, Jae Suk.

2095
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:02,923
He just did it!

2096
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:03,994
I told you!

2097
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:05,993
- He should've gone for it. - He was practicing, right?

2098
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:08,303
- Gosh! - It always works during practice!

2099
01:11:08,304 --> 01:11:11,234
Jae Suk already did it three times.

2100
01:11:11,774 --> 01:11:14,204
(Genius during practice)

2101
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,343
- He was practicing, right? - Right.

2102
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:17,404
That's even more annoying!

2103
01:11:18,044 --> 01:11:19,543
That's even more annoying!

2104
01:11:19,544 --> 01:11:20,544
(He's about to go crazy.)
- Jae Suk! - Are you serious?

2105
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:23,244
Make it happen during the actual game!

2106
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:26,083
I'm finding myself to be even more annoying!

2107
01:11:26,084 --> 01:11:28,983
- My gosh. - It looks so easy during practice.

2108
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,154
Are you serious?

2109
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:31,924
Don't do it!

2110
01:11:32,424 --> 01:11:34,023
Do it during our try.

2111
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:35,823
- All right. - It's our third try.

2112
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,223
In 1, 2, 3.

2113
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:39,033
- Here we go! - Should I go first?

2114
01:11:39,034 --> 01:11:40,333
- You should go 1st. - You should go 1st.

2115
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:41,734
- Casually. - Do it casually.

2116
01:11:42,204 --> 01:11:43,564
I'll try not to feel any pressure.

2117
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:45,503
- Just like practice. - Don't feel any pressure.

2118
01:11:45,504 --> 01:11:46,674
It might happen like this.

2119
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:50,373
- Just like practice. - Even if we don't succeed,

2120
01:11:50,374 --> 01:11:52,143
- Right. - it's all good.

2121
01:11:52,144 --> 01:11:54,344
- You did it three times. - It's fine.

2122
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:55,844
- Go! - Okay!

2123
01:11:56,384 --> 01:11:57,514
- Go! - Okay!

2124
01:11:58,454 --> 01:11:59,454
(Jae Suk fails.)

2125
01:11:59,455 --> 01:12:01,683
That was close.

2126
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,084
(Third try, Jae Suk fails.)

2127
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:05,823
- It's okay. - It's the same for me.

2128
01:12:05,824 --> 01:12:06,853
Right.

2129
01:12:06,854 --> 01:12:09,063
- It's fine. - It's all good, even if I fail.

2130
01:12:09,064 --> 01:12:10,764
- Jung Seok. - Just do it casually.

2131
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:12,193
I'll do it without pressure.

2132
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,114
I'll do it comfortably without straining myself.

2133
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:16,064
I'll relax my shoulders too.

2134
01:12:17,104 --> 01:12:18,104
Go!

2135
01:12:21,444 --> 01:12:23,704
(It bounces off again.)

2136
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,413
That was close!

2137
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:29,214
(Third try, Jung Seok fails.)

2138
01:12:29,514 --> 01:12:30,514
I'll do the same.

2139
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,484
I'll just shoot it casually.

2140
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:35,754
(Even Yeo Jeong fails.)

2141
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:37,853
- We're in trouble. - Gosh.

2142
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,053
(Third try, Yeon Seok)

2143
01:12:40,054 --> 01:12:41,923
- Let's go, Yeon Seok. - Come on.

2144
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,593
I was going to do it casually,

2145
01:12:43,594 --> 01:12:44,834
but you all failed.

2146
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:47,134
(All of them failed.)

2147
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,763
No. I still have to do it casually.

2148
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,910
I can only do it during practice, and it's driving me crazy.

2149
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,303
Casually. Just let go as soon as I get up.

2150
01:12:54,304 --> 01:12:55,474
Just do it casually.

2151
01:12:56,074 --> 01:12:58,244
- Right. - Right.

2152
01:13:06,554 --> 01:13:09,084
(Excited)

2153
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,624
(It bounces off and goes out again.)

2154
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:19,994
That was so close.

2155
01:13:23,664 --> 01:13:25,233
- So that was the third try. - Gosh.

2156
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,274
(They fail the third try.)

2157
01:13:28,444 --> 01:13:29,944
It's the right distance though.

2158
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:32,973
- It bouncing off is the problem. - Right.

2159
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:34,273
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2160
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:35,283
(The bound is the biggest difficulty.)

2161
01:13:35,284 --> 01:13:36,514
This is the hardest mission.

2162
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,714
(She suddenly walks away.)

2163
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:48,623
(The mother and daughter start cheerleading.)

2164
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,694
Thank you. I think I can do it now.

2165
01:13:52,264 --> 01:13:53,693
(Cheering)

2166
01:13:53,694 --> 01:13:55,233
(Feeling embarrassed soon)

2167
01:13:55,234 --> 01:13:56,304
Let's go for it.

2168
01:13:56,704 --> 01:13:58,703
- We have to pass Round One. - Let's go.

2169
01:13:58,704 --> 01:13:59,803
- Hold on. - It's our fifth try.

2170
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:01,443
- I should... - If we fail again this time,

2171
01:14:01,444 --> 01:14:03,080
- we should use the chance. - We should use the chance.

2172
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:04,143
(Realizing something)

2173
01:14:04,144 --> 01:14:06,614
- What is it? - The bigger one feels softer.

2174
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:08,143
- We should use the bigger ones. - The smaller ones?

2175
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:10,114
The smaller one bounces off even more.

2176
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:12,813
This means the smaller ones have a higher chance of bouncing off.

2177
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:13,983
- Use the big one then. - Right.

2178
01:14:13,984 --> 01:14:15,153
You're asking us to use the bigger ones, right?

2179
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:17,484
Right. I think it'll be better to use the bigger ones.

2180
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:18,894
Right.

2181
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,794
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Here we go!

2182
01:14:20,894 --> 01:14:22,564
- I'll go first. - All right.

2183
01:14:22,994 --> 01:14:24,194
This is it.

2184
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:25,394
- This is better. - Is that one better?

2185
01:14:25,395 --> 01:14:27,664
This is bad. It's our fifth try already.

2186
01:14:28,034 --> 01:14:30,003
(Fifth try, Jae Suk)

2187
01:14:30,004 --> 01:14:31,033
He did it!

2188
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,573
(Fifth try, Jae Suk fails.)

2189
01:14:33,574 --> 01:14:34,873
Why did it go over this time?

2190
01:14:34,874 --> 01:14:35,874
(The face of someone who is only good during practice)

2191
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:36,944
Exactly. Why?

2192
01:14:37,544 --> 01:14:39,673
- I'll go second. - All right.

2193
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:41,683
- Okay. - Let's do it this time.

2194
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:42,913
(Fifth try, Jung Seok)

2195
01:14:42,914 --> 01:14:46,184
(The creator of the Big Shoe Theory)

2196
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:48,383
Make a bold attempt.

2197
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:49,384
(Focusing)

2198
01:14:50,924 --> 01:14:51,994
He did it!

2199
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:54,323
(He did it!)

2200
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:55,394
(He really did it!)

2201
01:14:56,564 --> 01:14:59,194
- He did it! - What?

2202
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,034
(It landed on top!)

2203
01:15:06,304 --> 01:15:08,504
(Cho Jung Seok makes it!)

2204
01:15:10,044 --> 01:15:12,274
(Screaming)

2205
01:15:13,114 --> 01:15:14,443
(That's my buddy.)

2206
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:15,543
Gosh!

2207
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:16,884
I knew you could do it.

2208
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:20,184
(His big shoe strategy worked perfectly.)

2209
01:15:20,914 --> 01:15:23,754
- We passed Round One! - Yes!

2210
01:15:24,624 --> 01:15:25,893
We did it.

2211
01:15:25,894 --> 01:15:27,794
That was the standard procedure.

2212
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:29,923
- Jung Seok did it for us. - Yes.

2213
01:15:29,924 --> 01:15:31,123
(He landed it on the block with the standard procedure.)

2214
01:15:31,124 --> 01:15:33,244
- You feel relieved, don't you? - I feel so relieved.

2215
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:35,963
- All right. - All right.

2216
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:38,004
- There are 6 tries left. - There are 6 tries left.

2217
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:40,333
Will you go or stop?

2218
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,044
One, two, three.

2219
01:15:42,744 --> 01:15:44,074
- Go! - Go.

2220
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:46,643
- That was expected. - Right.

2221
01:15:46,644 --> 01:15:49,044
All right. Let's check the second prize.

2222
01:15:50,214 --> 01:15:51,683
- What is it? - "A burst of energy!"

2223
01:15:51,684 --> 01:15:54,183
"After using 200 percent of your passion for classes,"

2224
01:15:54,184 --> 01:15:57,583
"fresh air is needed. Dyson air purifier."

2225
01:15:57,584 --> 01:15:58,794
(Round 2, Dyson air purifier)

2226
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,653
(Impressed)

2227
01:16:00,654 --> 01:16:02,764
- It would be perfect here. - Gosh.

2228
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:04,323
We need to get them this.

2229
01:16:04,324 --> 01:16:05,533
It's perfect here.

2230
01:16:05,534 --> 01:16:06,534
(Round 2)

2231
01:16:06,535 --> 01:16:08,904
(The BOSU ball will get smaller.)

2232
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:10,363
There's a ball smaller than this?

2233
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:11,434
Oh, my.

2234
01:16:12,274 --> 01:16:13,710
Oh, my. I've never seen this before.

2235
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,843
It's this small, and we need to balance on it.

2236
01:16:15,844 --> 01:16:18,043
We need to get up on it and balance ourselves.

2237
01:16:18,044 --> 01:16:19,413
Then it'd get difficult.

2238
01:16:19,414 --> 01:16:21,073
It's better than that being smaller.

2239
01:16:21,074 --> 01:16:22,260
- That's right. - It's a better option.

2240
01:16:22,284 --> 01:16:23,943
- It's better that the ball's small. - That's right.

2241
01:16:23,944 --> 01:16:25,664
Maybe that will get smaller in Round Three.

2242
01:16:25,984 --> 01:16:27,784
I think this is better.

2243
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:30,084
Jae Suk, it's not that slipper.

2244
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,053
It's not that slipper.

2245
01:16:33,054 --> 01:16:34,554
No wonder it felt light.

2246
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:36,364
You almost fooled us.

2247
01:16:36,994 --> 01:16:38,164
Gosh, Yeon Shik.

2248
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:40,334
- It's a practice. - Okay.

2249
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:44,634
- Gosh! - Oh, my!

2250
01:16:45,474 --> 01:16:46,504
- Gosh! - Oh, my!

2251
01:16:47,004 --> 01:16:48,574
But it was just a practice.

2252
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:50,673
Everyone does well during practice.

2253
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:51,914
- We got it. Now... - Okay.

2254
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,343
- Let's go for it. - Let's do it.

2255
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:56,444
- Let's cheer for Round Two. - Yes.

2256
01:16:56,714 --> 01:16:58,754
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

2257
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,183
- It's our 6th try. - Round 2.

2258
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:02,423
Yeo Jeong, you should go for it right away.

2259
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:04,854
- Shall I? - Remember the feeling.

2260
01:17:05,024 --> 01:17:06,354
- All right. - Here I go.

2261
01:17:06,494 --> 01:17:07,894
- Yeo Jeong will go for it. - Yes.

2262
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,194
Great.

2263
01:17:09,394 --> 01:17:11,074
She might succeed at once. You never know.

2264
01:17:13,164 --> 01:17:14,333
- She got it. - No.

2265
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:15,664
It was too short.

2266
01:17:15,904 --> 01:17:18,334
- She got it. - No. It was too short.

2267
01:17:19,504 --> 01:17:21,604
Gosh, what do I do?

2268
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,544
- We're in the same club. - Hey.

2269
01:17:24,044 --> 01:17:25,143
FC Bad Feet.

2270
01:17:25,144 --> 01:17:26,274
It was like she was dancing.

2271
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:30,313
- How shall I do it? - Yeon Shik,

2272
01:17:30,314 --> 01:17:31,614
you succeed once in a while.

2273
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,453
I think it's now.

2274
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:35,484
- It's now. I'll show you. - All right.

2275
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:37,454
- It's now. Yes. - Let's go for it.

2276
01:17:45,164 --> 01:17:46,464
- It landed? - That's not right.

2277
01:17:47,264 --> 01:17:48,634
Oh, no. That was so close.

2278
01:17:49,504 --> 01:17:51,463
- That was so close. - It hung on it.

2279
01:17:51,464 --> 01:17:53,834
(Third to go, Jae Suk, who's only good during practice)

2280
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:55,303
All right.

2281
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,774
(Determined)

2282
01:17:57,644 --> 01:17:59,673
(Jae Suk always succeeds during practice.)

2283
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:00,844
You can do it.

2284
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:05,514
Go!

2285
01:18:06,384 --> 01:18:08,014
(Failure)

2286
01:18:10,454 --> 01:18:11,484
That was really close.

2287
01:18:12,024 --> 01:18:13,054
That was close.

2288
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:15,463
(The last one to go, Jung Seok)

2289
01:18:15,464 --> 01:18:17,663
(Sixth try, Jung Seok)

2290
01:18:17,664 --> 01:18:19,334
- All right, Jung Seok. - Okay.

2291
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:21,333
All right.

2292
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:23,504
- Shoot boldly. - Okay.

2293
01:18:30,474 --> 01:18:31,543
You got it!

2294
01:18:31,544 --> 01:18:32,644
(It landed again!)

2295
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:35,043
You got it!

2296
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:36,944
(The standard of success)

2297
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:38,714
You got it!

2298
01:18:39,254 --> 01:18:40,653
(Spinning out of joy)

2299
01:18:40,654 --> 01:18:41,724
Yes!

2300
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,824
- Oh, my goodness! - My gosh!

2301
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:46,854
- I knew he'd make it. - My goodness!

2302
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:48,363
I knew it.

2303
01:18:48,364 --> 01:18:49,693
- You did it! - That was no joke.

2304
01:18:49,694 --> 01:18:51,493
- You did it. - I need to take this.

2305
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:53,563
It's this one.

2306
01:18:53,564 --> 01:18:55,764
- It was that one? - It's this one. I need to use this.

2307
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,733
- You did it. - It was that one.

2308
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:58,904
It was that one.

2309
01:18:59,104 --> 01:19:00,673
- You're the best. - Hey, Jung Seok.

2310
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:01,703
- Yes. - You did it.

2311
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,604
- Okay. - You did it.

2312
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:04,943
- Round Two. - Okay.

2313
01:19:04,944 --> 01:19:06,074
- Success. - Success.

2314
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:08,313
(Feeling proud)

2315
01:19:08,314 --> 01:19:11,683
We have four tries and the bonus coupon.

2316
01:19:11,684 --> 01:19:13,254
In total, we have five tries.

2317
01:19:13,554 --> 01:19:16,124
But it'll get more difficult.

2318
01:19:16,624 --> 01:19:18,794
Jung Seok is on a roll today.

2319
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:22,223
(Footwork that proves that he's on a roll)

2320
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,693
- Your footwork is great. - Take it...

2321
01:19:24,694 --> 01:19:26,263
Take it easy.

2322
01:19:26,264 --> 01:19:29,034
Jung Seok is on a roll right now.

2323
01:19:29,134 --> 01:19:30,304
- That's great. - He's...

2324
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:33,374
You can stop here, actually.

2325
01:19:33,574 --> 01:19:36,104
- Feel free to stop here. - But it's hard to stop here.

2326
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,880
- What should we do? - We need to keep going.

2327
01:19:37,904 --> 01:19:39,150
- What? - We need to keep going.

2328
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,414
Calm down.

2329
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:43,283
- You can stop here. - Yes, you can stop here.

2330
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:45,753
All right. What's your choice? In 1, 2, 3.

2331
01:19:45,754 --> 01:19:47,354
(What's their decision?)

2332
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:49,124
Gosh, hold on.

2333
01:19:49,254 --> 01:19:51,254
- You can discuss more. - Okay.

2334
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:53,223
It's not weird at all to stop here.

2335
01:19:53,224 --> 01:19:55,294
I think it'll get difficult.

2336
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,464
- Really? - Would you like to...

2337
01:19:58,064 --> 01:19:59,694
decide after seeing how it goes?

2338
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,633
- We can see beforehand, right? - You want to check our condition?

2339
01:20:02,634 --> 01:20:03,634
Yes.

2340
01:20:03,734 --> 01:20:05,334
Check our condition before deciding.

2341
01:20:06,104 --> 01:20:07,174
"Condition?"

2342
01:20:08,034 --> 01:20:09,603
He wants them to see our condition.

2343
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,244
- Is this an audition? - I know.

2344
01:20:11,814 --> 01:20:12,844
"Audition?"

2345
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:17,844
Check our condition.

2346
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:20,984
Check our condition.

2347
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,254
- Check our condition. - Your shots always make it.

2348
01:20:25,624 --> 01:20:26,653
This is it.

2349
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:27,654
(Stirred up)

2350
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:31,423
All right. Go or stop?

2351
01:20:31,424 --> 01:20:32,593
In 1, 2, 3.

2352
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,633
- Go! - Go!

2353
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:35,333
- How are you so good? - You always make it.

2354
01:20:35,334 --> 01:20:37,104
It's almost like your comfort slipper.

2355
01:20:37,864 --> 01:20:39,603
- He should go for it now. - He's on a roll.

2356
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:41,004
- That slipper. - He's on a roll.

2357
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:43,944
- Jung Seok is in great condition. - Let's go for it.

2358
01:20:44,774 --> 01:20:46,443
"Get off work early today."

2359
01:20:46,444 --> 01:20:47,943
- It's a really nice one. - "A reliable cleaning item..."

2360
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,344
"that will help you go home early."

2361
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:51,243
Roborock Robot Vacuum.

2362
01:20:51,244 --> 01:20:52,283
That's a good one.

2363
01:20:52,284 --> 01:20:53,724
The vacuum costs over 1,000 dollars.

2364
01:20:54,484 --> 01:20:57,023
- Gosh. - It's around 1,300 dollars.

2365
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:59,154
If we let this loose here...

2366
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:01,593
It's the perfect place for it.

2367
01:21:01,594 --> 01:21:03,063
- I know. - The vacuum...

2368
01:21:03,064 --> 01:21:04,784
- There are no obstacles. - There are none.

2369
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,110
- All right. How will this round go? - What will it be?

2370
01:21:07,134 --> 01:21:08,193
(Round 2)

2371
01:21:08,194 --> 01:21:09,734
(Landing 2 slippers)

2372
01:21:10,734 --> 01:21:12,294
- Two slippers? - That's the condition.

2373
01:21:12,774 --> 01:21:14,934
Wait a minute. Let's choose a different one.

2374
01:21:15,944 --> 01:21:17,343
Soft ones are...

2375
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:18,644
We need two people to land it?

2376
01:21:19,544 --> 01:21:20,674
Is there anything good?

2377
01:21:21,414 --> 01:21:22,543
What kind are you looking for?

2378
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,743
A soft one like this.

2379
01:21:23,744 --> 01:21:24,944
- A soft one? - Like this one.

2380
01:21:25,044 --> 01:21:26,364
- A hard one... - Let's use this.

2381
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:28,034
- You found it? - Yes, it's this one.

2382
01:21:28,854 --> 01:21:31,424
I see. I get the feel he's going for.

2383
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:33,224
It's soft.

2384
01:21:33,524 --> 01:21:35,363
I know. There's a softer one.

2385
01:21:35,364 --> 01:21:38,424
Right. A flimsy one that just drops?

2386
01:21:38,964 --> 01:21:39,994
Yes.

2387
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:41,193
The one that lacks resilience.

2388
01:21:41,194 --> 01:21:42,304
A flimsy one like this.

2389
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:43,933
- The one that lacks resilience. - There's a difference?

2390
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:45,063
Yes, there is.

2391
01:21:45,064 --> 01:21:46,433
(They're the same slippers, but there are subtle differences?)

2392
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,504
All right.

2393
01:21:50,344 --> 01:21:51,374
All right.

2394
01:21:52,144 --> 01:21:53,473
(The genius during practice succeeded again in the meantime.)

2395
01:21:53,474 --> 01:21:55,274
- You've succeeded so many times. - I mean...

2396
01:21:55,414 --> 01:21:56,820
- You did that earlier too. - I mean...

2397
01:21:56,844 --> 01:21:58,554
Just stop practicing.

2398
01:21:58,884 --> 01:22:01,554
You've succeeded so many times during practice.

2399
01:22:01,954 --> 01:22:03,723
I should change my name to Practice Yoo.

2400
01:22:03,724 --> 01:22:05,124
(Practice Yoo is brought up again.)

2401
01:22:05,494 --> 01:22:08,124
(Yeon Seok practices with a new slipper.)

2402
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:11,694
Is it the softer one?

2403
01:22:12,264 --> 01:22:13,493
(It landed!)

2404
01:22:13,494 --> 01:22:15,263
Right? You used the softer one, right?

2405
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,403
That's right. Softer ones work.

2406
01:22:16,404 --> 01:22:18,284
- We should use softer ones. - The flimsy ones.

2407
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,503
- Yes. - We got it.

2408
01:22:19,504 --> 01:22:21,344
- I found my comfort slipper too. - We got it.

2409
01:22:21,974 --> 01:22:23,003
- Let's see... - Shall we go for it?

2410
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,044
If we can succeed in Round Three after a long time.

2411
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:26,513
- I'm really desperate for it. - In 1, 2, 3.

2412
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:28,414
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2413
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,513
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2414
01:22:30,514 --> 01:22:32,253
- Shall I go first? - Yes, you should go.

2415
01:22:32,254 --> 01:22:34,213
- You should practice. - Jae Suk, please...

2416
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:35,414
Let's pretend it's a practice.

2417
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:37,104
- You should practice. - That's right.

2418
01:22:37,254 --> 01:22:38,924
You should practice first.

2419
01:22:39,224 --> 01:22:40,624
- Practice Yoo. - Practice Yoo.

2420
01:22:41,554 --> 01:22:43,164
- Practice. - But I'm going for it.

2421
01:22:43,824 --> 01:22:45,463
- No, you should practice. - We're just saying...

2422
01:22:45,464 --> 01:22:46,863
- We're just saying it's a practice. - Otherwise, you'll fail.

2423
01:22:46,864 --> 01:22:48,504
- It's a practice. - You should practice.

2424
01:22:48,534 --> 01:22:50,004
Oh, it's a practice. Got it.

2425
01:22:51,404 --> 01:22:52,533
I think it'll work.

2426
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:53,603
(He's brainwashed to believe that it's a practice.)

2427
01:22:53,604 --> 01:22:54,704
You're almost there.

2428
01:22:56,444 --> 01:22:57,574
I think it worked.

2429
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,414
(Failure)

2430
01:23:01,714 --> 01:23:03,184
- Gosh, that was close. - I know.

2431
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:05,914
Seriously... He's really good during practice.

2432
01:23:06,284 --> 01:23:07,383
Gosh!

2433
01:23:07,384 --> 01:23:08,823
(Seventh try, Jae Suk fails.)

2434
01:23:08,824 --> 01:23:10,723
(Seventh try, Yeo Jeong)

2435
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:11,884
I think I can do it.

2436
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,134
(She failed to adjust the range.)

2437
01:23:20,964 --> 01:23:22,064
It was too strong.

2438
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:25,164
- I'll go. - That's right.

2439
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:27,334
- Wait a minute. - You should go.

2440
01:23:27,534 --> 01:23:29,473
- Shall I go 1st? - Yes, you should go 1st.

2441
01:23:29,474 --> 01:23:31,643
- We need 1 success. - You should go 1st.

2442
01:23:31,644 --> 01:23:34,043
Am I like the one who always succeeds?

2443
01:23:34,044 --> 01:23:36,144
You're a player who always succeeds.

2444
01:23:36,784 --> 01:23:40,114
(Seventh try, Jung Seok)

2445
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,784
He got it.

2446
01:23:47,854 --> 01:23:49,224
(He made it again!)

2447
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:52,764
(Cho Jung Seok succeeds 3 times in a row.)

2448
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,163
(He's in super good condition.)

2449
01:23:58,164 --> 01:23:59,603
- You're the best. - Gosh, I can't believe it.

2450
01:23:59,604 --> 01:24:00,634
- Hey. - Gosh.

2451
01:24:02,844 --> 01:24:04,403
(Only Yeon Seok remains.)

2452
01:24:04,404 --> 01:24:06,574
Hey, please make it.

2453
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:08,290
- You're the best. - Gosh, I can't believe it.

2454
01:24:08,314 --> 01:24:09,643
- Hey. - Yeon Seok.

2455
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:11,444
- Yeon Seok. It's you now. - You're the best.

2456
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:13,613
- You can do it! - Yeon Seok, it's about time...

2457
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:15,184
you quit FC Bad Feet.

2458
01:24:15,454 --> 01:24:17,054
- We trust you. - This one is better.

2459
01:24:17,284 --> 01:24:18,524
This one is soft.

2460
01:24:19,894 --> 01:24:21,024
FC Bad Feet!

2461
01:24:21,324 --> 01:24:22,563
If it lands and makes it fall, that's a fail.

2462
01:24:22,564 --> 01:24:23,764
Of course.

2463
01:24:24,324 --> 01:24:26,334
- That won't happen. - FC Bad Feet.

2464
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:27,693
Let's do it.

2465
01:24:27,694 --> 01:24:29,810
(Yeon Seok has been bad at games that involved feet.)

2466
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:30,954
It's about time I succeeded.

2467
01:24:31,064 --> 01:24:32,903
Yes, it's about time you succeeded.

2468
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:34,073
It's about time.

2469
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:35,594
- It's about time I showed you. - Yes.

2470
01:24:37,044 --> 01:24:40,644
(Jung Seok miraculously created the chance for Round 3.)

2471
01:24:42,684 --> 01:24:43,884
You can do it.

2472
01:24:47,454 --> 01:24:48,514
He got it.

2473
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,254
He got it.

2474
01:24:50,624 --> 01:24:51,624
Wait.

2475
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,564
- He got it. - Wait.

2476
01:25:02,634 --> 01:25:05,064
(Yoo Yeon Seok did it!)

2477
01:25:06,604 --> 01:25:08,974
(Stomping out of joy)

2478
01:25:09,744 --> 01:25:11,474
- We did it! - Yeon Seok!

2479
01:25:13,114 --> 01:25:15,784
It landed on it!

2480
01:25:15,984 --> 01:25:18,483
Oh, my gosh. He did so well!

2481
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:19,783
Yeon Seok!

2482
01:25:19,784 --> 01:25:20,884
I knew it!

2483
01:25:21,714 --> 01:25:23,023
That was amazing.

2484
01:25:23,024 --> 01:25:24,224
So now,

2485
01:25:24,754 --> 01:25:27,254
Round Three is a success!

2486
01:25:28,994 --> 01:25:31,193
Thank you. Great job!

2487
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,863
- My gosh. - Hey, we...

2488
01:25:32,864 --> 01:25:34,363
- The soft ones. - The soft ones.

2489
01:25:34,364 --> 01:25:36,803
- The soft ones. - The soft ones are the best.

2490
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:38,244
(The soft slippers did a great job.)

2491
01:25:38,974 --> 01:25:40,104
I'm so glad!

2492
01:25:41,204 --> 01:25:42,643
Jung Seok, you should take this pair...

2493
01:25:42,644 --> 01:25:44,304
and wear them for movie screenings.

2494
01:25:45,644 --> 01:25:48,913
- They're lucky slippers. - Yes, they're lucky slippers.

2495
01:25:48,914 --> 01:25:50,444
Thank you so much.

2496
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:54,483
Today... Jung Seok.

2497
01:25:54,484 --> 01:25:55,953
Your performance was great.

2498
01:25:55,954 --> 01:25:57,283
Seriously.

2499
01:25:57,284 --> 01:25:59,123
- His performance... - I knew it.

2500
01:25:59,124 --> 01:26:00,823
- He's good at main games. - That's right.

2501
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:02,424
You're good during practice.

2502
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:03,824
(A perfect duo)

2503
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:04,893
The three gifts.

2504
01:26:04,894 --> 01:26:06,993
- A vacuum cleaner, an air purifier, - My goodness.

2505
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:08,633
And a gift card worth 300 dollars.

2506
01:26:08,634 --> 01:26:10,554
- We'll give them to you as a gift! - As a gift!

2507
01:26:11,164 --> 01:26:12,474
Thank you so much.

2508
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:14,433
We succeeded in giving out gifts,

2509
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:15,673
- so your movie... - That's right.

2510
01:26:15,674 --> 01:26:16,903
Will be successful too.

2511
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:19,213
- Exactly. - Thank you.

2512
01:26:19,214 --> 01:26:20,643
- I hope it will be. - I have a good feeling about it.

2513
01:26:20,644 --> 01:26:22,783
I came here, relying on Jung Seok.

2514
01:26:22,784 --> 01:26:24,344
And I think our movie will do well too.

2515
01:26:24,484 --> 01:26:26,113
(The "My Daughter Is a Zombie" cast has great teamwork.)

2516
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,583
You can walk around Pangyo honorably.

2517
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:29,783
He was amazing today.

2518
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:31,323
- I know. - My goodness.

2519
01:26:31,324 --> 01:26:32,853
Congratulations once again. Thank you.

2520
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,923
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2521
01:26:34,924 --> 01:26:36,023
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2522
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,223
We succeeded in Round Three after a long time.

2523
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:38,523
Oh, it's been a while since you succeeded in Round Three?

2524
01:26:38,524 --> 01:26:40,164
- It's been a while. - It's been a while.

2525
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:42,504
(The spare time we found after driving 300km from Seoul)

2526
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:43,903
(Gosh, it's hot!)

2527
01:26:43,904 --> 01:26:45,234
(It goes up to 40°C here.)

2528
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:47,004
(Whenever Possible in Daegu)

2529
01:26:47,274 --> 01:26:48,274
(The son of Daegu)

2530
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,174
(Kim Sung Kyun, the son of Daegu)

2531
01:26:50,344 --> 01:26:52,450
(Bong Sik, you're the youngest, so serve us soy sauce.)

2532
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:54,013
(Hyun Bong Sik, the youngest among them)

2533
01:26:54,014 --> 01:26:55,390
(What medicine is good for slow aging?)

2534
01:26:55,414 --> 01:26:56,934
(The youngest, Bong Sik, lives young.)

2535
01:26:57,544 --> 01:27:00,414
(He's nimble.)

2536
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:02,724
(He's perfectly aware of Gen MZ trends.)

2537
01:27:03,054 --> 01:27:05,184
(He's Gen MZ, but he's farsighted.)

2538
01:27:05,624 --> 01:27:07,824
(Before having abura ramen, how about buttering me up?)

2539
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:09,394
(Forced laughter)

2540
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:11,194
(He blocks out dad jokes.)

2541
01:27:11,524 --> 01:27:13,134
(The son of Daegu sets off.)

2542
01:27:15,704 --> 01:27:17,803
(Sung Kyun, who's more timid than he looks)

2543
01:27:17,804 --> 01:27:19,804
(Bong Sik, who's more meticulous than he looks)

2544
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:22,473
(Full of passion)

2545
01:27:22,474 --> 01:27:24,674
(A fulfilling day)

2546
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:27,874
(Whenever Possible)

2547
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:36,124
(Whenever Possible)
