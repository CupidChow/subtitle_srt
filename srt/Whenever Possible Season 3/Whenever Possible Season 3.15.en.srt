1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,900
(Whenever Possible)

2
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,135
(Today's spare time, Mount Nam)

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,030
Hey, I used to go to school around here.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,870
- Right. That was a long time ago. - What's this?

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,940
Goodness, I haven't been here in ages.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,000
Those days were fun.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,040
What's this? Is this some kind of snack?

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,470
It's not.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,110
- It looks like a cinnamon stick. - It's a cinnamon stick.

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,950
We might have ended up eating this stick if we weren't careful.

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,910
- You know? - Isn't it for the aroma?

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,250
This is so cinnamony.

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,680
(Who are they?)

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,980
What are we doing today? Gosh.

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,920
- I don't know anymore. - Anyway,

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,590
we'll eat and play games. That's all, right?

17
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,120
(Cha Tae Hyun, his third appearance in the show)

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,290
- The staff members are weird too. - Right.

19
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,300
I only said that in passing.

20
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,930
- Right. - "It doesn't matter."

21
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,000
"I should star in the show..."

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,630
- "with Hyuk next time." - You know what this feels like?

23
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,700
(His first appearance)

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,410
(They worked together to bring a miracle with the game.)

25
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,970
(He gave a dopamine rush to the viewers.)

26
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,640
(I told you Yeon Seok could do it!)

27
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,440
(His second appearance)

28
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,710
(Screaming)

29
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,210
(For the first time in the show's history,)

30
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,780
(they completed Round 3 within 3 tries.)

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,590
(Next time, I'll bring Hyuk with me.)

32
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,220
You know what? The bottom line is that I'm here because of you.

33
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,090
- How did this happen? - That's the thing.

34
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,560
- We must watch what we say. - Right.

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,030
- I had forgotten all about it. - Anyway...

36
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,730
When you promise something like that, I have to come.

37
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,670
So what's the mission? Just tell me that.

38
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,540
First of all, I'm good at Monopoly.

39
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,800
- I'm good at throwing dice. - That's irrelevant here.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,070
- Monopoly... - They had to hit something...

41
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,370
- with the ping pong ball. - Yes, that was the game.

42
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,410
By the way, I was here for the last episode of Season Two.

43
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,680
- Jong Kook and I... - You came with Jong Kook.

44
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,110
Jong Kook carried the game.

45
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,980
- Right. - So you must carry the games today.

46
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,020
But Jong Kook... Well...

47
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,420
Anyway, whoever messes it up...

48
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,590
will be ruined.

49
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,550
I was in good shape last year.

50
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,890
- But this year, - Yes?

51
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,320
I've been hitting the sandbag too much.

52
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,590
So I've had hand tremors.

53
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,360
That's my weakness. I hope you can be understanding. Okay?

54
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,800
Gosh, it has nothing to do with me.

55
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,530
You know what? We're guests here.

56
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,200
It's just that the MCs haven't arrived yet.

57
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,670
We're just guests for this episode.

58
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,070
Right. But how come we're early?

59
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,310
- We're not the MCs. - We shouldn't be here early.

60
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm sure Jae Suk will handle it.

61
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,710
Really?

62
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,810
(He's amazed by his friend's irresponsibility.)

63
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,210
- We can do whatever we want, right? - So this is what we can do.

64
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,380
- Let's do whatever we want. - Okay.

65
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,750
(He's bursting into laughter...)

66
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,590
(after sharing a wonderful tip.)

67
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,060
Why are they chatting without us?

68
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,490
- Gosh, hey. - Come on.

69
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,790
(The two MCs are flustered by the situation.)

70
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,960
- Hyuk. - My gosh. Seriously.

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Hyuk.

72
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,030
(They welcome the two MCs as if it's their home.)

73
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,130
- What? - What's this?

74
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,870
What took you so long?

75
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,140
Why did you come so early?

76
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,200
Gosh. You can't be here before us.

77
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,840
Why were you guys already chatting even before we got here?

78
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,540
You know what? I was dragged here because of him.

79
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,810
- Here's the thing about him. - It was sudden. Yes.

80
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,110
He's always here for the finale of our season.

81
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,250
You're always here for our last episode.

82
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,750
But it's not like you're the ending fairy or something.

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
They always invite me for the last episode,
which worries me.

84
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,690
Whenever you're on our show, our TV ratings go up.

85
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,490
- Jae Suk, that's not true. - You know?

86
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,530
That's a lot of pressure now.

87
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,830
You don't need to feel pressured.

88
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,460
If the last episode gets low TV ratings,

89
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,700
and the show doesn't get renewed, it will be my fault.

90
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,940
Gosh, that won't happen.

91
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,800
That's why I brought Hyuk with me.

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,140
- So you brought Hyuk? - Of course.

93
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,470
You brought Jong Kook last season.

94
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,770
- It's like... - First of all,

95
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,910
they're sure bets for high TV ratings.

96
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,280
- Right. - He's a sure bet.

97
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,610
Hyuk, you look good today.

98
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,650
- Right? - Yes.

99
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,850
Was there ever a time when Hyuk didn't look good?

100
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,950
Hyuk? There was a time when he looked really tired.

101
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,390
- Back then... - He kept saying he wasn't.

102
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,690
I know what you're talking about.

103
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,360
- He usually looks so drawn. - Yes.

104
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,460
For a good reason, though. He trains every morning.

105
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,090
Jae Suk, he does this every morning.

106
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,900
He puts on sand weights.

107
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,230
Does he think he's Rocky?

108
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,930
This is what he does. Jae Suk.

109
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,000
He covers up his mouth, so he can't breathe well.

110
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
He trains with a mask on?

111
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,640
Right. There's an exercise I do with a mask on.

112
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,270
He does that on purpose.

113
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,680
Hyuk went through an intense phase of boxing.

114
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,280
- It's not a phase. It's ongoing. - That was all you did.

115
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,880
He even competed professionally.

116
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,010
- Yes, I know that. - Right.

117
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,120
I just got the license.

118
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,020
- You got the license? - Yes.

119
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,950
Didn't they go with you to show their support?

120
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,690
- Right. - That day,

121
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,560
right before the fight, he was training.

122
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
- He kept shadow boxing. - I bet.

123
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,630
After seeing that, I said,

124
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,060
"You're not planning to look at your opponent?"

125
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,330
- See? That's your problem. - That's right.

126
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,330
- He just doesn't know anything. - He kept doing this.

127
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,070
- He doesn't know anything. - Right.

128
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,100
- Yes. - When shadow boxing,

129
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,340
you're up against yourself.

130
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,170
You don't have an opponent to fight.

131
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,980
You're up against yourself. So you shouldn't look ahead.

132
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,980
You should keep your head down.

133
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,040
"He's coming at me from the right. I should dodge it."

134
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,250
That's how you do it.

135
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,780
But you must've covered up your face too much.

136
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,150
I watched him do that for a good ten minutes.

137
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,020
- He never looked up even once. - My gosh. Hey.

138
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,120
When you're up against yourself, you must look within.

139
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,860
- For someone like Hyuk to shine, - Yes.

140
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,030
he has to develop his character for over 20 years. You know?

141
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,560
Only then will the viewers accept him.

142
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,330
Here's what I still remember.

143
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,470
No one knows about this.

144
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,270
- Only I know. - What is it?

145
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
People started to recognise me...

146
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,300
- from god's music video. - You were in it.

147
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,010
- People saw me... - Yes.

148
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,840
- play the harmonica in it. - Right.

149
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,510
And then the music video for "To Mother" began.

150
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,780
- You know? - Yes.

151
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,880
But that wasn't the original video.

152
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,050
- What was it then? - That wasn't the music video.

153
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,380
- What was it? - Let me tell you how it went.

154
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,750
- They fixed a camera here. - Okay.

155
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,120
After that,

156
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,790
I shadow boxed for four minutes.

157
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,930
- I'm serious. - Darn him and his shadow boxing.

158
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,290
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

159
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,500
- That's how it began. - Yes.

160
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,700
That's how your shadow boxing began.

161
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,470
For those three minutes, I tried to get angry...

162
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,570
at society.

163
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,640
They told me to explode about something in the scene.

164
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,910
They played the song. And I heard the melody.

165
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,470
I heard the lyrics.

166
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
"I was angry"

167
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,910
"I cried out of embarrassment"

168
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,410
- I shadow boxed while crying. - Gosh.

169
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,420
I mimicked ducking and so on.

170
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,320
They were checking the footage afterward.

171
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,190
They were like, "What is this?"

172
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,690
- That's... - I see.

173
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,860
(The shadow boxing version never saw the light of day.)

174
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,460
- It was never released? - It wasn't released?

175
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,060
- I can see why. - Back then, it was...

176
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,230
- That was too unconventional. - Yes.

177
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,230
- There had to be a story. - Right.

178
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,060
Back then, plot-oriented music videos were popular.

179
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,430
I'm curious about the video, though.

180
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,430
Right.

181
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,440
Anyway, you and Jong Kook guided him...

182
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,070
- into the variety show industry. - We helped him a lot.

183
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,910
I feel comfortable on variety shows thanks to them.

184
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,140
- You must be grateful... - Yes.

185
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,840
to hear that from Hyuk.

186
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,250
Tae Hyun transitioned over to our side afterward.

187
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,780
- Right. - Him?

188
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,880
- Well, I did. - Yes.

189
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,780
He has always been...

190
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,290
- a leader in our group. Yes. - It was him.

191
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,820
- I tried out everything first. - Yes.

192
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
- Right. - That's true.

193
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,320
When I thought it was good, I introduced it to them.

194
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,660
- He used to live in Ichon. - Yes.

195
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,930
- There's a movie theatre in Ichon. - Yes.

196
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,330
He was always at the theatre.

197
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,800
- He watched all the recent movies. - The one in Yongsan? Yes.

198
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,570
- Yes, Yongsan. - Now, I'm at the one in Apgujeong.

199
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,600
- That's amazing. - He was at the theatre.

200
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,940
- Movies these days... - You watch every movie there.

201
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,300
- He watches everything. - There aren't that many out now.

202
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,370
- That's fascinating. - He's...

203
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,970
- He watches everything. - He does.

204
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,910
When my drama premiered...

205
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,140
- Right. - It was the first episode.

206
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,110
- "Yeon Seok, this is good." - Right.

207
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,150
He texted me so.

208
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,680
Oh, right. A movie is coming out on September 10.

209
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,020
- What movie? - What?

210
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,820
"Homeward Bound?"

211
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,420
- "Homeward Bound?" - Yes.

212
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,190
Wait, are you in the movie?

213
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,490
No, I'm promoting it for Cha Ji Hyun.

214
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,790
For my brother.

215
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,600
- My brother produced it. - Right.

216
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,330
(Tae Hyun's brother produced "Homeward Bound.")

217
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,500
Your brother produced it?

218
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,930
- What is this? - Jae Suk.

219
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,770
Please don't edit it out. Let this part air.

220
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,500
Hey, you...

221
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,170
- Hey. - Wait. Your brother...

222
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,970
- Talk to the director, not me. - Jae Suk. Not a lot of movies...

223
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,880
- are released these days. - The movie industry is struggling.

224
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,910
- Right, it's struggling. - It's so hard to get to this point.

225
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,850
That's a great title too. "Homeward Bound."

226
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,120
- The movie is success-bound too. - Right.

227
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,120
- Yes, that's better. - The movie is success-bound.

228
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
- It's... - Yes.

229
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,350
By the way, what are you two doing?

230
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,090
Are you promoting the movie with the ping-pong method?

231
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,120
Do you need to promote anything?

232
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,690
Kyung Min is having a concert soon.

233
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,700
Forget about him.

234
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,730
- Hong Kyung Min? - Yes.

235
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,760
- Why not? - Why not him?

236
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,930
It's called Monthly Set list.

237
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,600
- He releases songs every month. - Right.

238
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,640
It's like Monthly Project Yoon Jong Shin.

239
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
- "Monthly Set list?" - Monthly Set list.

240
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,670
That's a great name.

241
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,080
And he has a concert every first Saturday of the month.

242
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,480
- Where? - This is the second concert.

243
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
See? No one knows.

244
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Let's hope it's success-bound too.

245
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,810
(Let's hope it's success-bound too.)

246
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,450
- I... - That's it.

247
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,080
- It should be success-bound. - Just like that?

248
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,290
I joined his concert as a guest twice.

249
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,820
- You joined as a guest? - Yes.

250
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,390
Did you sing onstage then?

251
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,490
- I sang a song. - Really?

252
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,660
- What did you sing? - You've never seen it.

253
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,930
Hey, the first guest of his concert...

254
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,660
couldn't sing on beat or in tune.

255
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,030
It's not that I couldn't sing on beat or in tune, you jerk.

256
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,670
- It was my tone. - Hey!

257
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,470
- Hyuk. - What do you mean?

258
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,040
We're not filming a YouTube channel.

259
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,610
- This will air on national TV. - I know that.

260
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,010
This isn't fair. You know?

261
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,310
If his tone was off, doesn't it mean...

262
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,010
- his tempo and pitch was off? - It wasn't the tempo or the pitch.

263
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,750
- Hyuk. - It was the vibe.

264
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
You can say, "You punk."

265
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,450
You punk.

266
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,350
You punk.

267
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,620
- Right. - That's...

268
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,250
Hey, he made his debut as a singer.

269
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,920
- I'm a rapper. - That's right.

270
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,020
- He's a rapper. - I'm a rapper.

271
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,430
My gosh. His performance as TJ was...

272
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,660
(The creator of the world's first ASMR rapping)

273
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,430
- I loved it. - Everyone here can sing.

274
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,700
- Yeon Seok... - My gosh.

275
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,900
- He's a great singer. - Yes.

276
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,100
Gosh, I'm not that good.

277
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,870
What do you mean? You're a great singer.

278
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
- Seriously. - He's great.

279
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,770
- He's a great singer. - Right.

280
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,410
I've been interested in singing lately.

281
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,910
- Really? - He's been taking lessons.

282
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,740
- You're interested in singing? - Yes, I am.

283
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,180
But here's the problem. He's the one who's interested.

284
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,080
But we can't be sure if other people will like that.

285
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
(Getting up)

286
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
- Hey. He drives me crazy. - There's still a problem.

287
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,150
- Stop annoying him. - Okay.

288
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,890
It's his tone. You know?

289
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,090
- You punk. - He might...

290
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,090
- He might be interested, - You punk.

291
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,120
but people lost interest.

292
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,830
- He's driving me crazy. - What happens then?

293
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,990
What happens then?

294
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,800
You know, now that Hyuk is here, I'm having an easy time today.

295
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,600
He's not annoying me.

296
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,970
He keeps annoying Hyuk instead.

297
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,400
- He keeps annoying Hyuk. - Yes.

298
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,770
- So this is... - He's taking a step back.

299
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,270
- Today, - He's taking a step back.

300
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,310
- I need to stay calm. - He's taking a step back.

301
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,810
- I need to put on my defence. - Yes.

302
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,950
Is it the sofa? You're drooping down a lot.

303
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,120
Are you in a cradle or what?

304
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,650
- The sofa itself caves in. - The sofa...

305
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,820
- Anyway, it's our last episode. - Yes, it is.

306
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,260
- We must succeed. - Time flies by.

307
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,760
Let's check where we're going today.

308
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,090
Let's check.

309
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,530
- Because it's our last episode, - It's long since it's our last one.

310
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,230
it's long. All right. The first Whenever Guests.

311
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,230
"Hong Jung Mi, Kim Jung In."

312
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,900
"We spent our Mondays together for 13 years."

313
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,470
"We know what we want..."

314
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,440
"just by looking at the tip of our toes alone."

315
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,210
- Every Monday for 13 years? - Really?

316
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,610
"When we're not together, we get anxious..."

317
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,210
"as if we're wearing socks with holes."

318
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,250
"When we're together,"

319
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,680
"we're confident as if we have new socks on."

320
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,420
"We'd like to invite the Fantastic Duo, Yoos,"

321
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,820
"to have a chat with another Fantastic Duo."

322
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
They spend every Monday together?

323
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,660
- But why Monday? - What do they do on Monday?

324
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,390
There's a drawing of socks on this.

325
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,730
- I see. It must be about socks. - There's a drawing of socks.

326
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,800
They mentioned "socks with holes" and "new socks."

327
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
How long does it take from here?

328
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,400
Hold on. Let me look it up.

329
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,670
"Sowol-ro."

330
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,510
"Sowol-ro?" Then it's Mount Nam.

331
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,540
- We're familiar with Mount Nam. - It's around our school.

332
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,980
- It's around our school. - We went to school around here.

333
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,380
- You went to the same college. - It's close to our school.

334
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,310
- What did you major in, Hyuk? - In Film.

335
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,480
You majored in Film.

336
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,720
- You majored in... Right? - TV and Entertainment.

337
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,020
You and Tae Hyun were in the same department.

338
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,420
- Yes. - He dropped out.

339
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,760
- A lot of people dropped out. - But I graduated.

340
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,560
Dong Hwi talked about your academic achievement...

341
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,290
on my YouTube channel too.

342
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,600
- You know what? He and... - He said he graduated.

343
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,570
Did you have to withdraw from school?

344
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
Were you that popular?

345
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,470
(Chuckling)

346
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,640
- You know what? Our school... - When did you go to school?

347
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,140
- had this system. - Listen.

348
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,110
- Hey. - You get an F with three absences.

349
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,410
Do you know what I still remember?

350
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,740
- Shouldn't we get going? - What?

351
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,810
- Let's go. - Where is it?

352
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,650
- When do we have to be there by? - We have to be there by 10am.

353
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,320
- Really? - It will take five minutes on foot.

354
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,550
- Five minutes? - Really?

355
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,350
- It's cool today. - We got lucky today.

356
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,220
- It's so cool today. - Gosh, if that weren't the case...

357
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,520
Right. We would've walked in the sun.

358
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,760
- Does it mean it's our lucky day? - Of course.

359
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,030
- What? - Is it our lucky day?

360
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,160
It's our lucky day.

361
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,900
- We usually walk in the sun. - Hyuk, come here.

362
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,900
Seriously. This could be our lucky day.

363
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Luck might be on our side.

364
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,170
(Like the cool weather, things might stay cool for them.)

365
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,040
It's slightly cooler and breezier around Mount Nam...

366
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,110
- than around the central area. - Right.

367
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,140
That's true.

368
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,580
My youngest is at school now.

369
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,780
Really? Should we go?

370
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,850
Should we? Should we go and make some noise?

371
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,850
- Make some noise, baby. - Gosh.

372
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,380
Your youngest is not that young anymore. Right?

373
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,250
I'm done giving her rides now.

374
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,590
This is my last year.

375
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,560
I have only three months left to go.

376
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,090
You'll be done giving them rides...

377
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,260
- Yes. - after three months?

378
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,260
- I didn't have to give her rides. - Okay.

379
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,460
She used to go to school with her older sister before.

380
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,770
- I see. With her sister? - Without her sister,

381
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,540
she must not want to take the bus alone. Maybe, it's a hassle.

382
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,070
Once I started to give her rides, it stuck.

383
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,270
But I have a lot of time in the morning.

384
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,340
Hold on.

385
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,380
Are we close?

386
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,780
Are we close?

387
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,580
- Wait. The building... - Did we pass it?

388
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,810
Is this the one?

389
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,280
- I see socks here. Yes, that's it. - This...

390
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,090
Yes, you're right.

391
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,750
- No. - This must be the building.

392
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,220
- This is the place. - I see. This is it.

393
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,430
Are you Jung Mi and Jung In?

394
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,790
- Yes. - Hello.

395
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,900
- What's this? - It's a sock store. We were right.

396
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,360
- Hello. - Is this a sock store?

397
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
- Yes. We sell socks here. - We were right.

398
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,270
- I see. Okay. - Nice to meet you.

399
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,740
(Today's first Whenever Guests, Hong Jung Mi and Kim Jung In)

400
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
This must be it.

401
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,840
- Gosh, there are so many socks. - We were right. It's a sock store.

402
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,940
- Yes, socks. - I've never been to a sock store.

403
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,540
(Various kinds of socks with trendy designs are found here.)

404
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,110
You know what? Socks these days...

405
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,850
- They complete the look. - Socks complete the look.

406
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,520
- Gosh, socks. - The elders should sit down first.

407
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,650
"Elders?"

408
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,520
Well, I was raised with manners.

409
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,890
- The elders should sit down first? - Yes.

410
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,690
Actually, I drove by this area often.

411
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,860
I didn't know this was a sock store.

412
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,700
Actually, we ran our store in Hapjeong for five years.

413
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,730
It's been four years since we moved here.

414
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,040
I would've assumed that...

415
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,140
- Hapjeong would be more suitable. - Right.

416
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,540
- Around Hongdae. - There must be more foot traffic.

417
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,840
Can I ask why you moved here?

418
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,150
We couldn't overcome the recession during COVID-19.

419
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,380
So we ended up in the middle of the mountain.

420
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,050
We had to consider rent...

421
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,520
- and utility fees. - That's understandable.

422
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,450
We came up to the mountain to cut costs.

423
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,620
You don't seem too happy about it.

424
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,790
- So... - I'm so nervous right now.

425
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,530
I can't do this.

426
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,430
She's so cheerful.

427
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,730
(Jung Mi's energy level is on another level.)

428
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,900
Didn't you just say you were raised with manners?

429
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,570
- Pardon my loud voice. - Yes.

430
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
- I'm sorry. - How long...
have you been working together?

431
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,810
I launched my brand 15 years ago.

432
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,640
She's been working with me for 13 years.

433
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,010
- For 13 years? - Is she your 1st employee?

434
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,510
- Is she your 1st employee? - She's 1 of my 1st employees.

435
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,420
You guys weren't friends before?

436
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,250
No. I ran the store by myself...

437
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,050
- for about two years. - I see.

438
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,390
My friends helped me out back then.

439
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,860
One of my best friends who helped me out the most...

440
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,430
got pregnant, so she couldn't help me anymore.

441
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,500
She told me that her sister had been going to the Han River...

442
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,100
and eating ramyeon there because she couldn't find a job.

443
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
She asked me if her sister could come instead.

444
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,270
- I'm that sister. - Yes.

445
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,170
- She's your friend's sister. - So... Yes.

446
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,640
I said that would be great.

447
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,910
That's how she ended up working for me.

448
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,040
It's not easy to work with the same person for 13 years.

449
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,580
- Right. - It's not easy.

450
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,710
- It's not easy. - It's not.

451
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,480
Jung In. What kind of career did you have...

452
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,690
- before working here? - I had all kinds of jobs before.

453
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,220
I once worked at a urology clinic.

454
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,760
- I had all kinds of jobs. - You worked in many industries.

455
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,720
- But I wasn't the right fit. - Did it not work out for you?

456
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,290
I spent two years, trying to figure out what to do.

457
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,330
But in the end, you settled down here.

458
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,500
- You settled down here. - Yes, right.

459
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,760
This career was the right fit for me.

460
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,630
Working as a merchandiser suited me.

461
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,240
I have to meet people and show them our products.

462
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,400
We also have brainstorming sessions...

463
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,510
to make good products. It's really fun.

464
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,570
I like working in sales.

465
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,940
Jung Mi was expecting answers like,

466
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,510
"I love working with Jung Mi."

467
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,250
- I see. My gosh. - I think she was expecting that.

468
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,850
- "When will she talk about me?" - Of course. I mean...

469
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,150
- "When will she talk about me?" - I was waiting for that.

470
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,350
- I'm flustered. But it's okay. - I'm sorry.

471
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,720
She's a great boss.

472
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,820
Otherwise, I wouldn't work for her...

473
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,920
- for 13 years. - Right.

474
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,790
Anyway, I'm glad that we kept going.

475
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,430
- See? Right. - We get to be on TV.

476
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,000
Aren't you glad you got a job here?

477
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,060
Not anyone...

478
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,330
- I'm glad we kept going. - Who could meet them like this?

479
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,470
- This must be why we kept going. - They're positive.

480
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,170
- The fact that we're on TV... - Gosh, great.

481
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,870
- and meeting these stars... - By the way...

482
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,470
- You have great chemistry together. - Right.

483
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,940
- You design the socks too, right? - That's correct.

484
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,180
- I design all the socks. - How did you come...

485
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,210
- to design socks in the beginning? - Right.

486
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,750
Actually, I used to work at a company that made clothes.

487
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,850
Personally, putting on a new pair of socks...

488
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,290
has always been a meaningful and fun activity.

489
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,860
- So... Yes. Putting on new socks... - You like putting on new socks?

490
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,260
- helped me get through Monday. - I see.

491
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,270
I thought, "If I quit my job,"

492
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,470
"I'll set up a sock company, no matter what."

493
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,370
I decided to make socks...

494
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,740
based on my experience. And I've been doing it for a long time.

495
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,980
- It is quite meaningful. - Yes, indeed.

496
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,710
What made you decide to write to our show?

497
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,780
- We come to work by 10am. - Okay.

498
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,650
Then we open the store for customers at noon.

499
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,120
During those two hours, we talk about what to get for lunch.

500
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,860
We play games or sing songs.

501
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,990
- We have fun in the morning. Yes. - I see. During this spare time?

502
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,090
- You run your own variety show. - Right.

503
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,460
I've always wanted work to be something I'd enjoy.

504
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,970
Did you two talk about what to get for lunch today?

505
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,000
We were going to meet Almighty Yoo...

506
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,540
- and our handsome actor. - And today is our payday.

507
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,840
- Yes. Today is payday. - I see.

508
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,610
- We're going to get a tasty meal. - Yes, it's today.

509
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,440
- Today is your payday? - Yes.

510
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,180
Their facial expressions were visibly different...

511
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,950
when payday was mentioned.

512
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,280
Right.

513
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,750
- Jung Mi... - I'm sorry.

514
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,720
- had this look. - You have to pay her today.

515
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,290
- Right. For me... - She has to pay.

516
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,320
- Yes. - Right.

517
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,960
Did you decide on how to spend your paycheck?

518
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,490
- I'm going to get married soon. - Really?

519
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,530
I have a lot of fixed expenses now.

520
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,430
- But... - The money just comes and goes.

521
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,530
- It only stays for a bit. - Yes.

522
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,040
- Briefly. - Do seasons affect the sales?

523
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,370
I'm sure there's a high season for socks too.

524
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,740
Summer is our slowest season.

525
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,710
- Right. They don't wear socks. - People wear flip-flops instead.

526
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,840
- They wear sandals and flip-flops. - That's right.

527
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,910
People give out socks as presents...

528
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,480
- in November and December. - That's a good season for socks.

529
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,020
- People have to wear socks... - Right.

530
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,350
- in winter. - That's right.

531
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,920
- So we like winter. - I see.

532
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,150
There must be peak and off seasons.

533
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,550
- Even for socks. - There's a huge gap.

534
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,120
- I see. - It must be a huge gap.

535
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,030
You know what? I wouldn't care much about socks.

536
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,990
You guys are such good listeners.

537
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,100
But I would appreciate socks the most in winter...

538
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,430
when filming historical dramas.

539
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,440
- My feet get cold in those shoes. - Right. Your feet...

540
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,410
- Right. - Depending on the socks you put on,

541
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,540
- It makes a different, right? - it makes a difference.

542
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,040
- People layer up many pairs. - They do.

543
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,410
There's a certain balance to it.

544
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,180
- I see. - There is.

545
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,950
- And I know the secret about socks. - I see.

546
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,650
"I see."

547
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,450
(They respond actively when it's about socks.)

548
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,590
- You guys are easy to read. - Yes.

549
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
They're like an audience.

550
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,030
All right. Now that we're here, let's begin.

551
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
This is our last episode...

552
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,830
- for the season. - Let's play games.

553
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,630
- This is our last shoot. - Yes.

554
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,530
- Today is your last shoot? - Yes, it is.

555
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,670
- What an honour. - Yes.

556
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,340
Lately, we've been in a slump.

557
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,170
- We hit a slump. - So we couldn't give away presents.

558
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,910
- We don't need the presents. - Yes.

559
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,110
- We met you. - But we should still try.

560
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,540
- Meeting you guys is enough. - Today will be a good day.

561
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,710
Hyuk.

562
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,280
- You do it. - Yes.

563
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,880
- It's for the bonus coupons. - Yes.

564
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,990
- Gosh. - My gosh.

565
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,120
(They obtain 2 coupons.)

566
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,760
- We got two. - Gosh.

567
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,960
- See? - I believed in you.

568
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,760
- Today is a good day. - That's great.

569
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,460
- Today is going well for us. - All right.

570
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,730
- You're the best. - Today will be a special one.

571
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,770
Great.

572
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,970
- Let's check the prize first. - All right.

573
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,270
- Should I open it first? - Yes.

574
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,110
"The biggest joy of my day is..."

575
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,510
"trying out a popular restaurant around the store with my employees."

576
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,240
"Support fund for lunch."

577
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,840
- "Three hundred dollars." - "Three hundred dollars."

578
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,510
Cash?

579
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,810
Gosh, today...

580
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,120
(Here are the Shin Saimdang bills.)

581
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,280
- You can get ribs. - Gosh.

582
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,290
- Right here. She's here. - This must be my birthday today.

583
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,250
(Sock In the Hamper)

584
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,720
(There will be 4 laundry hampers.)

585
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,590
(They must throw and get the sock into the hamper.)

586
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,260
- We get a hamper each? - One each.

587
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,530
- One each. - Right?

588
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,060
We get one each.

589
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,700
- All of us have to succeed? - All of you must succeed.

590
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
- On the same try? - This is...

591
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,430
They're in different size.

592
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,040
So that one is easy, but it will be hard with that one.

593
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,270
- The first one won't be that hard. - Really?

594
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,740
If this is Round One, then after this,

595
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,780
- the hampers will get smaller. - You should practice with that.

596
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,980
- I'll take the biggest one. - Okay.

597
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,010
We might be able to do this.

598
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,380
Getting it done on the same try will be tough.

599
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,720
We might have a shot at this.

600
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
(Goal)

601
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,790
- Great. That's good. - This is...

602
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,860
This is good.

603
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,190
- Hyuk, you can see things... - Great.

604
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,360
without looking up.

605
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,630
- You should go for the small one. - My hands...

606
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,560
- Come on, Hyuk. - They're shaking now.

607
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,000
But still. You can see things without looking up.

608
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,470
- Then... - Go for the small one.

609
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,540
- This one. - Great.

610
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,640
I can do this one.

611
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,470
In the end... Hold on.

612
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,270
The smallest one is the problem.

613
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,540
So all of us... I see.

614
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,980
- All of us must succeed? - Yes.

615
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,010
For all four?

616
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,210
I can't seem to get the hang of it.

617
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,220
- We might be able to do this. - Come on.

618
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,520
Getting it done on the same try will be tough.

619
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,590
- We might have a shot at this. - The smallest one is the problem.

620
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,020
(Getting the sock in the 4th hamper is not easy.)

621
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,220
We can roll it tightly.

622
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,690
Hey, I can't do it. My hands are shaking too much.

623
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,160
The smallest one is the problem.

624
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,230
(The evidence of their failed attempts)

625
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,360
- Let me see. - That's the problem.

626
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,300
Whoever can get the sock in the smallest hamper...

627
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,330
- should take it. - Yes.

628
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,270
- You did it. - It's working.

629
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,340
We just need to...

630
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,270
- We must do it on the same try? - The smallest one is the problem.

631
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,470
(Goal)

632
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,070
(Goal)

633
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,640
You're good at this.

634
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,240
- Great. - Okay. I'll take this one.

635
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,880
- Will you take it? - I'll take it.

636
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,050
- I'll do it. - Will you take the last one?

637
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,420
Okay. Tae Hyun, today is your day.

638
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,650
- Let's do this. - We can go for it now.

639
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,120
- Okay. - I've been tossing socks...

640
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,590
in the hamper for a long time.

641
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,390
My skills will finally come in handy today.

642
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,790
- I did that a lot too. No joke. - I used to get scolded for it.

643
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,960
- Let's do it. - Here goes our try number one.

644
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,830
- All right. Let's do a group cheer. - A group cheer.

645
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,060
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

646
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,270
- Let's go. - Let's go.

647
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,270
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

648
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,700
All right. Naturally, should I go first?

649
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,570
- I'll go 2nd. - I'll go 3rd.

650
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,870
Wait. We must succeed. Right?

651
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,340
We must succeed. We're going for it.

652
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,080
I don't need to overthink it. Hold on. I shouldn't have...

653
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,280
- Hey, this is... - I got nervous...

654
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
since it's the real thing.

655
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,750
- Well, I can just do it. It's easy. - Relax.

656
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,980
- Just stick to my practice. - Throw it.

657
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,550
You failed.

658
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,050
- Just stick to my practice. - Throw it.

659
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,860
You failed.

660
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,730
Gosh, this...

661
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,500
You know what? It's understandable, though.

662
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,170
What happens then? Is it over?

663
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,200
- It's over. - It's over.

664
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
- It is? - Yeon Seok.

665
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,370
How could you...

666
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,410
(Easily tossing into the hamper)

667
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,270
It's over just like that?

668
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,840
Yeon Seok.

669
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,180
(Walking on eggshells)

670
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,980
I told you that you couldn't put it in the big one...

671
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,610
- while focusing on the little one. - I never imagined that.

672
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,420
I never knew.

673
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,020
- This isn't easy. - Hyuk, you go first.

674
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,120
- You go first. - But this...

675
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,260
Move over.

676
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,990
I let my guard down.

677
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,860
Yes, this is...

678
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,530
We still need to be careful.

679
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,160
- Exactly. We need to be careful. - I let my guard down.

680
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,000
Don't practice.

681
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,430
- Let's go. - Okay.

682
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,800
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Good luck.

683
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,470
Try number two.

684
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,810
We need to make it this time.

685
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,580
It's not even that hard.

686
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,280
(Try number two, Hyuk)

687
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,350
Failure.

688
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,780
(What?)

689
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,980
What...

690
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,850
(Hyuk?)

691
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,820
So, it does happen.

692
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,290
That's not it.

693
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,730
What are you doing?

694
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,660
It makes you a traitor.

695
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,830
Well done.

696
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,970
When you actually play...

697
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,030
(Keeping a distance from the traitor)

698
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,700
(Flustered)

699
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,870
- This is... - Quit fooling around.

700
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,040
- What did you do? - I mean...

701
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
But...

702
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,310
Round One isn't so easy.

703
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,710
Now, it works.

704
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,140
We can't do this.

705
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,810
- We seriously have to make it. - It's time.

706
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,250
In 1, 2, 3.

707
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,350
- Here we go! - Good luck!

708
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,380
All right.

709
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,420
- Wait. You're going, right? - Yes.

710
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,820
- Here we go. - Here we go.

711
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,120
Try number three.

712
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,020
That was close.

713
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
Try number three.

714
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,760
(It hits the rim and barely makes it in.)

715
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,090
Why does he make it so close?

716
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,500
You almost failed just now.

717
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,230
That's not it. I have to throw it this way.

718
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,400
I need to throw it straight.

719
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,970
You need to follow your character.

720
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,840
(The first player passed.)

721
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,270
There's no way.

722
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,570
It's simple.

723
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,480
- Okay. - All right.

724
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,880
Don't fool around.

725
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,650
(Try number three, Jae Suk)

726
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,250
(He passed the 3rd hamper.)

727
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,550
- Okay. - All right.

728
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,490
(Tae Hyun is the last one.)

729
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,360
Get ready to celebrate.

730
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,660
(Try number three, Tae Hyun)

731
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,690
(Celebration on standby)

732
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
(Tae Hyun succeeds.)

733
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,240
We did it.

734
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,080
(It's in!)

735
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,150
We did it.

736
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,380
(Round 1, success)

737
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,620
- Great. - Amazing.

738
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,990
- All right. - All right.

739
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,090
You won 300 dollars for meals!

740
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,990
(They won 300 dollars for company meals.)

741
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,260
- We had to pass this time. - It should have ended sooner.

742
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,100
- Yes. - But we let our guard down.

743
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,860
It shouldn't have taken us three attempts.

744
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,600
- All right. - Round Two will be tough.

745
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,840
Round Two.

746
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,000
You need to decide whether to go or stop.

747
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,370
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

748
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,640
- Go! - Okay.

749
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,240
- Round Two. - It's doable.

750
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,080
- What is it? - Oh, my.

751
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,050
"A heartfelt gift from the CEO."

752
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,150
"For the bride-to-be this September,"

753
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,890
"LG's Code Zero Robot Vacuum Cleaner."

754
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,990
A robot vacuum cleaner!

755
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,020
- In September. - There it is.

756
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,490
- A robot vacuum cleaner. - Goodness.

757
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,590
We have to win this one.

758
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,330
That's the present for Round Two?

759
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,800
(A robot vacuum cleaner from LG for the bride-to-be)

760
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,170
- Round 3 must be insane. - Don't think about Round 3.

761
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,830
Let's aim for that now.

762
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,140
(Round 2)

763
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,470
(The hampers shrink.)

764
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,680
One in each?

765
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,340
They get even smaller.

766
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,010
That one's the problem.

767
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,410
It is.

768
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,020
Still, we have...

769
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,180
(Trying hamper number 4)

770
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,190
Hyuk isn't as good as I thought.

771
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,960
Hyuk, just practice this one.

772
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,100
Practice that one.

773
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,730
Hyuk.

774
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,330
- I think my hands are trembling. - Like this.

775
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,930
He can't even put one in.

776
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,600
Try that one.

777
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,110
- Yes. It's better. - Throw it harder than you think.

778
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,210
We got it.

779
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,680
(Goal)

780
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,880
(Tae Hyun mastered the 4th one.)

781
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
(Goal)

782
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,380
- We got it. - They're good.

783
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,420
- They all succeeded. - As long as Tae Hyun succeeds.

784
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,220
So, it's Round 2.

785
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,990
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

786
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,650
- Okay. - Okay.

787
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,820
- This is nothing. - Yes.

788
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,930
I won't fail.

789
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,690
(Try number four, Yeon Seok)

790
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,730
I need to play it safe.

791
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,030
Play it safe.

792
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,000
(Relieved)

793
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,340
(Try number four, Hyuk)

794
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,700
- Okay. - Good.

795
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,870
- This is the real deal. - Throw it harder than you think.

796
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,210
- Okay. - Let's see.

797
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,480
This isn't easy.

798
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,140
It's so small.

799
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,680
(Try number four, Jae Suk)

800
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,950
It's so small.

801
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,920
It's fine. It happens.

802
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,490
- Okay. - I told you so.

803
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,520
This is the real deal.

804
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,790
Tae Hyun didn't even get to throw it.

805
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,630
Get a grip.

806
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,430
This isn't the time.

807
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,670
- Let's use a coupon. - Let's do that.

808
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,400
- Let's use it. - Yes.

809
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,470
We'll use a coupon.

810
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,740
- Shall we go? - Yes.

811
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,570
- Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3.

812
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,610
- Here we go! - Here we go!

813
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,670
Good luck.

814
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,210
Oh, no.

815
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,980
(They fail the coupon round.)

816
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,480
Let's use one more coupon.

817
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,510
- Right away. - Right away.

818
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,550
- Here we go! - Here we go!

819
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,320
- Good luck. - Good luck.

820
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,750
(The second coupon to turn things around)

821
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,820
Oh, no.

822
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,990
- Sorry. - It's okay.

823
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,360
- I'm sorry! - It's fine.

824
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,290
- That's fine. - It's fine.

825
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,060
It's really tough.

826
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,500
(They get more worried as they lose the coupons.)

827
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,100
It's so tricky.

828
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,330
- We did well. - You hold it in your hand,

829
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,600
and it eases your mind.

830
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,270
(He starts obsessing over the socks.)

831
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,310
I've been holding it the whole time.

832
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,770
- The grip gives you comfort. - I'm...

833
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,880
With this in one hand?

834
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,780
- Oh, I get what you mean. - Right?

835
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,150
Holding it comforts you.

836
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,180
Okay.

837
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,880
- This is try number six. - Yes.

838
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,290
In 1, 2, 3.

839
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,390
- Here we go! - Here we go!

840
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,750
All right.

841
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,520
(The 1st player who can't miss)

842
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,360
- This... - No mistakes.

843
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,490
Of course.

844
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,960
Good.

845
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,430
(Try number six, Yeon Seok)

846
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,940
(Try number six, Jae Suk)

847
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,240
- Okay. - Great.

848
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,410
(Try number six, Hyuk)

849
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,680
(He's on a roll with a sock in his hand.)

850
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,540
(Try number six, Tae Hyun)

851
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,380
- Good. - All right.

852
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,150
- Do it, Tae Hyun. - You've got this.

853
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,620
- Gosh. - You can do it.

854
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,280
- Oh, my gosh. - Let's do it.

855
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,320
- I never knew it'd come to this. - He's really good.

856
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,390
I never knew.

857
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,860
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

858
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,060
(Try number six, Tae Hyun)

859
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,760
He's really good.

860
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,400
Tae Hyun is the leader, so he has to be good.

861
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,170
You can do this.

862
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,770
Let's win the robot vacuum cleaner.

863
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,080
(Try number six is a failure.)

864
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,680
It's tricky.

865
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,480
- It's tricky. - It's okay.

866
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,920
- But we're almost there. - It was pretty good.

867
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,590
- It's really hard. - We got the hang of it.

868
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,190
- That was pretty good. - You guys are doing great.

869
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,920
- We did well. - We'll make it now.

870
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,890
- We're going to do it. - Yes.

871
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,290
Tae Hyun, do you need practice?

872
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,490
Ma'am, can I take a pair?

873
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,960
- Sure. - Just a pair.

874
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,260
- Of course. - Their socks?

875
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,300
I need more lucky charms.

876
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,100
- This won't do. - You'll wear them?

877
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,400
- You're wearing them? - What's he doing?

878
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,100
- This is... - You're not throwing it?

879
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,070
- It requires more than a man's... - You need to buy those.

880
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,470
- You have to purchase them. - No.

881
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,210
- We have to. - I think...

882
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,940
- He's wearing them right now. - this is...

883
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,980
(Obsessed with superstitions)

884
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
This is...

885
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,650
The colour suits you.

886
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,920
- I need a talisman or something. - Talisman?

887
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
- Great. Monday lucky charms. - Monday.

888
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,220
Monday lucky charms.

889
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,320
(He wore the lucky charms.)

890
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,360
I'm feeling it.

891
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,090
- Let's go. - Monday lucky charms.

892
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,290
Try number seven.

893
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,860
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Here we go!

894
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,960
- Let's pass Round Two. - I won't make any mistakes.

895
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,000
I'll support the team without any mistakes.

896
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,640
(Try number seven, Yeon Seok)

897
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,970
- Gosh. - All right.

898
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,310
(Try number seven, Jae Suk)

899
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,640
- Okay! - Good.

900
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,180
Great.

901
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,710
(Try number seven, Hyuk)

902
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,220
- Great. Good luck. - I almost missed.

903
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Let's go.

904
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,420
(The lucky charms' turn)

905
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,920
(Try number seven, Tae Hyun)

906
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,700
(Try number seven, Tae Hyun)

907
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,100
(The power of lucky charms!)

908
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,440
(The lucky charms worked magic.)

909
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,910
(And Tae Hyun's surprising concentration)

910
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,350
- Great. Good luck. - I almost missed.

911
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,380
All right.

912
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,290
(They passed Round 2!)

913
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,220
- Yes! - Yes!

914
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,460
How is this so fun?

915
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,990
- Now... - You're the best.

916
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,490
The issue is...

917
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,130
whether you'll go for Round Three or stop.

918
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,370
- You can decide. - This one is...

919
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,800
- All right. Think it through. - After this,

920
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,970
the hampers may get even smaller.

921
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,000
You can stop.

922
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,840
Whatever the outcome,

923
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
they'll all be presents for her wedding.

924
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,140
- But I think... - I'll let her decide.

925
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't think it's too bad to stop.

926
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,710
You know,

927
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,450
someone from above told me that this was the end.

928
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,820
Monday gave me enough chances.

929
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,920
- Anyway, it's up to her to decide. - Yes.

930
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,090
In 1, 2, 3.

931
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,830
- Go. - Oh, gosh.

932
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,930
Oh, gosh.

933
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,860
You can do this.

934
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,400
Let's find out.

935
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,440
You just went against the divine will.

936
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,270
What's the present?

937
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,270
(Revealing the present for Round 3)

938
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,540
"A friendship token for us, who tear with each other's glance."

939
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,040
"Tiffany and Co. matching bracelets."

940
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,980
- That's expensive. - This deserves a go.

941
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,310
Gosh.

942
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,680
- It's something shiny! - Tiffany?

943
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,620
This deserves a chance.

944
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,350
That mint-coloured box...

945
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,320
- That's so... - I've never seen this before.

946
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,620
People love...

947
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,330
this box.

948
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,460
(A friendship token, Tiffany and Co. matching bracelets)

949
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,030
This is incredible. Take them out.

950
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,300
Okay.

951
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,900
It's so pretty!

952
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,240
- It's beautiful. - It is.

953
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,270
It's literally a gem!

954
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,780
- This is a huge opportunity. - Bracelets.

955
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,110
This is a big deal.

956
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,180
Oh, my gosh.

957
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,880
All right.

958
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,150
See you in a bit.

959
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,720
- We hope you do. - We hope so.

960
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,720
- See you in a bit. - Please win!

961
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,790
We can see it!

962
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,160
(Round 3)

963
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
(They're all small hampers.)

964
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,190
I knew it.

965
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,260
This is...

966
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,030
That's way too hard.

967
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,600
Isn't that too difficult?

968
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,570
That doesn't seem so easy.

969
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,570
This is...

970
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,640
(All four hampers are tiny.)

971
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,270
The grip is...

972
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,510
- We can do it while squatting. - All four of us...

973
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,380
- All four of us have to succeed. - That's hard.

974
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,410
It's not easy.

975
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,450
We have to practice a lot.

976
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,580
- This needs... - We have to find a way.

977
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,620
All four of us?

978
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,990
That was good, Jae Suk.

979
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,450
But all four of us have to make it.

980
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,820
That's good. But still...

981
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,090
Still, we have a shot at this.

982
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,060
When you get nervous in the actual game...

983
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,330
- Good! - Great.

984
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,360
- A little bit... - Good!

985
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
- You're all making it. - They're good.

986
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I have a 100 percent accuracy rate, right?

987
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,070
(He's been succeeding for sure during practice.)

988
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,200
But in the actual game...

989
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
Jae Suk always makes it during practice.

990
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,670
The problem is the actual game.

991
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,070
- You have a shot at this. - Good.

992
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,640
Great. Shall we begin?

993
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,910
In what order should we go?

994
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,050
- Don't change it? - The same order.

995
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,810
I'm so nervous.

996
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,050
- "Breakfast at Tiffany's." - Try number eight.

997
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,050
- Let's do a chant. - Let's do a chant first.

998
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,950
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

999
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,950
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1000
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,260
- I'm going first, right? - Just like you practised.

1001
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,290
Just like I practised.

1002
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,890
Tiffany.

1003
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,760
- I can do it. - Empty your thoughts.

1004
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,760
(Try number eight, Jae Suk)

1005
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,930
Oh, gosh.

1006
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,700
(Failure)

1007
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,940
- Who cares about practice? - It's okay.

1008
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,570
It happens.

1009
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,110
- Yes. - It's always tough...

1010
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,410
to go first.

1011
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,410
- It happens to people. - Overcome it.

1012
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,580
The first and last ones are under huge pressure.

1013
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,650
- Yes. - That's true.

1014
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm missing all of a sudden.

1015
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,490
He's missing all of them.

1016
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,320
- He can't do it. - Guys.

1017
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,290
Can someone else go first?

1018
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,630
- We'll find a way. - Gosh.

1019
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,830
- Yes. - Yes.

1020
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Okay.

1021
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,570
Yes, I'm feeling it.

1022
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,570
Zero in.

1023
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,900
- We're getting more accurate. - Yes.

1024
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,140
This is good. We are.

1025
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,540
This is great.

1026
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,840
- Very good. - Good.

1027
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,870
Nice.

1028
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,540
I should throw it like this.

1029
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
(Yeon Seok found a new way to throw it.)

1030
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,580
- Great. - Like playing ping pong.

1031
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,310
We got it.

1032
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,180
You've zeroed in.

1033
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,080
- We should go now. - That's the spot.

1034
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,250
You're accurate now, so you go first.

1035
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,320
- Yes, you go first. - Yes.

1036
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
- What? - The order...

1037
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,820
- But... - I was doing fine with this one.

1038
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,360
- Don't change the order. - Just go.

1039
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,960
- Don't switch places. - Stay where you are.

1040
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,230
All right. Try number nine, right?

1041
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,460
- Stay where you are. - In 1, 2, 3.

1042
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1043
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,900
You should go first.

1044
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,530
- Okay. - You've got this.

1045
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,600
Empty your thoughts.

1046
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,440
- This is nothing. - Take it easy.

1047
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Just like I've been doing.

1048
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,140
(Try number nine, Yeon Seok)

1049
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,010
- Just like I've been doing. - Indeed.

1050
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,440
You've been zeroed.

1051
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,380
(Try number nine, Yeon Seok)

1052
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,580
(They failed try number nine.)

1053
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,250
This is...

1054
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,890
It's tough.

1055
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,990
It's fine.

1056
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,390
- It's all right. - It's all right.

1057
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,820
It's all right.

1058
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
(Exclaiming)

1059
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,060
It's your last chance.

1060
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,900
(They have one last chance.)

1061
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,000
(Exhaling sharply)

1062
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,570
This is...

1063
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,800
- No pressure. - Okay.

1064
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,070
- We're fine. - We are fine.

1065
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,910
- Please, no pressure. - No pressure.

1066
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,840
- Still, we want to succeed. - Just toss it.

1067
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,870
Oh, no.

1068
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,410
You can still make it.

1069
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,850
Let's give it a go.

1070
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Yes.

1071
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,380
- Tae Hyun. - Hang on.

1072
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,620
Will you start us off?

1073
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,520
- Me? - Start us off.

1074
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,420
If you can't start...

1075
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,930
You're the most accurate.

1076
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,630
- I'll go first. - Yes, start us off.

1077
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,030
We might all make it in one go.

1078
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,440
- It's so nerve-racking. - Right?

1079
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,540
I'm even more nervous.

1080
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,640
(Watching it makes them more nervous.)

1081
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,170
Let's do a chant. It's our last chance.

1082
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,440
- All right. - It's okay if you fail.

1083
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,640
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1084
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1085
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,710
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1086
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,910
- What's the order? This way? - Here we go.

1087
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,910
In this order?

1088
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,280
(Last try, Tae Hyun)

1089
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
(Please make it.)

1090
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm going.

1091
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,830
(Last try, Tae Hyun)

1092
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,890
Monday!

1093
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,660
- Tae Hyun is so good. - He's the best at this.

1094
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,000
- Gosh. - Hyuk.

1095
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,630
(Last try, Hyuk)

1096
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,870
- You're so... - Monday!

1097
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,670
He's the best at this.

1098
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,940
Hyuk.

1099
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,770
(You can do this, Hyuk.)

1100
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,340
Hyuk.

1101
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,680
Hyuk.

1102
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,950
(Last try, Hyuk)

1103
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Failure.

1104
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,220
(They failed.)

1105
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,920
But this is...

1106
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,820
Goodness.

1107
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,000
Failure.

1108
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,270
(He couldn't overcome his slump.)

1109
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,640
They're taking all of them away?

1110
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,780
(Taking the presents)

1111
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,610
Bye.

1112
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,280
I feel like a traitor.

1113
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,880
(Traitor)

1114
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,450
- It's all good. We had fun. - Totally.

1115
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,260
- We could have... - Three losses since last week.

1116
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,060
had more fun too.

1117
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,660
It's tricky.

1118
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,100
- It was a difficult one. - I'm so upset.

1119
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,430
We should at least...

1120
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,000
Thank you.

1121
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,100
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1122
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,040
- Sorry. - No, it was fun.

1123
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,240
- We had so much fun. - What a bummer.

1124
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,910
- No, it's been so fun. - Thanks to you.

1125
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,910
Thank you for that.

1126
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,540
We should have won those for your wedding.

1127
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,950
It's all right.

1128
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,250
This moment was a wedding gift for me.

1129
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,380
We had so much fun.

1130
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,550
Sadly, we couldn't win the presents,

1131
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,290
but we could spend time with the four of them,

1132
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,390
and we had loads of fun.

1133
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,390
I'll try giving her the presents that she lost.

1134
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,360
I'll try that.

1135
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,200
- Keep your promise. It's on TV. - I will.

1136
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,530
I announce it in front of the whole country!

1137
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,540
Whenever possible, make Mondays happy!

1138
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,840
This feels bizarre.

1139
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,910
(They feel too bad to leave.)

1140
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,740
The tension is insane.

1141
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
I feel bitter.

1142
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,310
I feel weirder...

1143
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,250
- because it ended in my turn. - After a failure...

1144
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
Gosh.

1145
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,050
Why did you invite me here?

1146
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,450
You only gave me bitterness.

1147
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,990
- It's bitter, right? - This...

1148
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,390
But it's our last day.

1149
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,060
It's at 12:30pm, so we have an hour and a half.

1150
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,360
- What do we do? - Should we...

1151
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,900
go to one of the restaurants they recommended?

1152
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,030
Which one?

1153
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,500
We need to have lunch soon.

1154
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
(They recommended some restaurants afterward.)

1155
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,410
There's a place called Chicken Jinmi that sells chicken bone soup.

1156
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,380
If you like naengmyeon, there's...

1157
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,080
- a Pyongyang naengmyeon place. - Pyongyang naengmyeon?

1158
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,150
And there's a place that serves Chinese home meals.

1159
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,320
It's like a boxed lunch you get in China.

1160
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,650
- That's what they sell. - There's such a place?

1161
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,350
Yes. It's very delicious.

1162
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,990
You guys can decide. I'll go wherever.

1163
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,220
You want naengmyeon, don't you?

1164
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,720
No, I'm fine with whatever. Even this place.

1165
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,390
- Really? - One of them is Chicken Jinmi.

1166
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,500
You don't really like chicken, right?

1167
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,500
Among the three of them.

1168
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
- I had chicken yesterday. - I thought so.

1169
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,200
- You're right. - It was written all over his face.

1170
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
No to chicken bone soup.

1171
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,640
But I'll tag along if you guys want chicken soup.

1172
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,540
- Should we try the Chinese food? - Sure.

1173
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,240
- Let's go. - I'm curious.

1174
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,280
Okay.

1175
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,250
It's ten minutes on foot.

1176
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,220
- Which way? - We go this way...

1177
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,950
- That way? - Shouldn't we cross?

1178
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,790
My steps feel heavy.

1179
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,850
(The first spare time keeps occurring to them.)

1180
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,960
Why do we keep failing...

1181
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,460
- in the last one? - We can't seem to win.

1182
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,690
In the past, we still succeeded...

1183
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,160
even when it was difficult.

1184
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,600
We did.

1185
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,960
We still have one last spare time left,

1186
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,300
so let's hold on to our hope.

1187
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,800
The last one is the finale of the season.

1188
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm sure things will work out.

1189
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,070
We need to make it work.

1190
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,340
Even if it means throwing a temper tantrum.

1191
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,510
Yes, let's win.

1192
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,480
Tae Hyun was doing so well.

1193
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
- Right. - Right.

1194
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,610
I was hoping it wouldn't be those four hampers.

1195
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,650
Right.

1196
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,220
I never expected them to give us four tiny ones.

1197
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,150
This is the third season, and you didn't see that coming?

1198
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,050
You should have predicted that.

1199
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,590
- But... - We should have stopped.

1200
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,660
It's not that far.

1201
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,790
I haven't been to Namdaemun Market in so long.

1202
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,930
- This place reminds me... - We once came here for sunglasses.

1203
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,970
Did we?

1204
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,000
They all look like good restaurants.

1205
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,040
I can already tell.

1206
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,540
I see it.

1207
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,700
Where? Here it is!

1208
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,310
What's the name?

1209
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,440
- There's an aura. - This looks amazing.

1210
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
- Is this it? - This is it.

1211
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,810
It is. Fried noodles! I know what that is.

1212
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,450
I like the vibe.

1213
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,320
It's obviously a good restaurant.

1214
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,190
- Welcome! - Hello.

1215
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,690
Hi. Can we eat here?

1216
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,890
- Yes. - We can?

1217
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,260
- Take a seat. - Thank you.

1218
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,460
- Hello. - Hello.

1219
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,800
It's nice to be welcomed.

1220
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,500
(They're seated with a warm welcome.)

1221
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,300
The fried noodles are delicious.

1222
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
- Is that so? - Yes.

1223
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,440
- Fried noodles. - Let's take a look.

1224
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,710
Fried noodles are the best.

1225
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,540
They have a lot on their menu.

1226
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,340
My gosh.

1227
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,480
- So this place serves many dishes. - It's an authentic place.

1228
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,620
I think we can all share the dishes.

1229
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,480
Order everything you want.

1230
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,050
Seriously.

1231
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,760
Shall we have fried eggplants?

1232
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,220
One fried eggplants.

1233
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,630
- Let's order fried tomato and eggs. - Let's have that.

1234
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,630
Didn't you say...

1235
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,760
- you'll order fried noodles? - Right. Fried noodles.

1236
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,060
- Add one fried noodles. - Order that too.

1237
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,170
- Shall we have some fritters? - Let's order this too.

1238
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,400
Chinese spicy rice noodles and mala rice noodles.

1239
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,640
Mala rice noodles.

1240
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,840
- We have them with rice, right? - Right.

1241
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,910
- Okay. - All right.

1242
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,910
- That sounds good. - Let's cheer up.

1243
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,380
- All of a sudden? - Let's do well now.

1244
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,650
Seriously. Let's do it right this time.

1245
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,710
We need to reflect on ourselves.

1246
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,520
- By the way... - Earlier...

1247
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,050
I saw her face who was getting married soon.

1248
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,420
I can't forget her face.

1249
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,090
You know what I mean, right?

1250
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,860
I don't think Hyuk is that good at playing games.

1251
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,630
I like to be honest.

1252
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,160
- Then are we... - But that's...

1253
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,370
- I mean... - This isn't...

1254
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,470
What do you mean? Are we unethical or what?

1255
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,400
I don't want to win a luck.

1256
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,770
I like to put in efforts and be honest.

1257
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,710
- We put in our efforts too. - I mean...

1258
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,010
But Jae Suk also has a fighting spirit.

1259
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,410
- Yes, I do. - He does.

1260
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,680
Honestly, I also thought that...

1261
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,910
- she should go for it. - Of course.

1262
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,280
And she said, "Go."

1263
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,750
Gosh, it's here.

1264
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,320
(The dishes they ordered appear at the moment.)

1265
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,920
- It looks tasty. - It's Chinese homemade food.

1266
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,590
Kids would love this too.

1267
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,430
- Gosh. It looks tasty. - Yes, it does.

1268
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,530
It's not that strong.

1269
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,700
I make these for my children often.

1270
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,400
(Exclaiming)

1271
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,270
(This is amazing.)

1272
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
This is so tasty.
(Tae Hyun tries the fried eggplant.)

1273
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
(Exclaiming.)

1274
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,940
Gosh, it's tasty.

1275
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,610
- Fried eggplant? - Yes.

1276
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,470
- Gosh, it's good. - Yes.

1277
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,340
It's tasty.

1278
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
- I get why they recommended. - It's good.

1279
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,520
You know, in Chinese movies, they eat like this.

1280
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,750
Right. Tony Leung eats like that.

1281
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,150
It makes you enjoy it more.

1282
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,960
You should use the thick chopsticks.

1283
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,990
- Right. - Yes.

1284
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,390
- You need chopsticks for these. - That'd be better.

1285
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,530
Wearing inners.

1286
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,400
(The vibe of the old Hong Kong movies)

1287
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,770
- Wearing inners only. - Right.

1288
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,400
I used to watch Hong Kong movies a lot.

1289
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,500
- Right. - Yes, we did.

1290
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,970
You know. We talked about it too.

1291
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,370
When I watched the old Hong Kong movies,

1292
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,710
when there were scenes where people eat, I wondered,

1293
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,410
"I wonder what that tastes like."

1294
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,450
(They were curious about the foods in the Hong Kong movies.)

1295
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,780
We were all curious about it.

1296
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,250
And now, people from all around the world...

1297
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,420
are watching Korean dramas and movies.

1298
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,620
- And the food becomes popular too. - Right.

1299
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,060
They say people line up in front of Korean restaurants.

1300
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,760
These days, I think it's crazy in a good way.

1301
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:02,230
Think about "KPop Demon Hunters" becoming a global hit.

1302
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,340
Right.

1303
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,870
I have to say Korean culture is amazing.

1304
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,110
All seven songs from that movie is on the Billboard chart.

1305
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,680
It's on the Billboard chart.

1306
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,010
- It's amazing. - They're ranked high.

1307
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,780
My daughter is eight years old.

1308
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,080
So she really wanted to watch it.

1309
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,450
She asked me when it'd be released.

1310
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,820
We watched the teaser together.

1311
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,620
Because it was up, so we watched it.

1312
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,930
I thought they came up with a unique story.

1313
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,290
- Right. - Yes.

1314
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,830
They are K-pop stars.

1315
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,130
I think that the success of it is just amazing.

1316
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,000
But on the other side, I think to myself,

1317
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,540
"Gosh, what should I do?"

1318
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,470
We have various thoughts about it.

1319
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,340
This is what it felt like when I talked with my daughter.

1320
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,580
"Gosh. What should I do to win that?"

1321
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,750
That was the first thought.

1322
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,220
My daughter is also interested in working in this field.

1323
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,190
She said that there could be so many new chances.

1324
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,790
So we had different thoughts,

1325
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,920
and it was interesting.

1326
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,690
The fried eggplant is...

1327
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,990
- Right. - Thank you.

1328
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:02,860
It's the fried noodles.

1329
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,560
Great.

1330
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
(Smoky Chinese fried noodles)

1331
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,870
So this is the fritters.

1332
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,630
It smells so good.

1333
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,140
Gosh, what's this?

1334
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,240
(Mala misen is Chinese rice noodles.)

1335
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,910
It's rice noodles, but it looks like jjambbong.

1336
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,670
Isn't the soup a bit sour?

1337
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,380
- It's mala soup. - So this is rice noodles.

1338
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,780
(The table is filled with Chinese homemade dishes.)

1339
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,380
- All right. - People love mala these days.

1340
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,980
- There's mala tteobokki too. - Right.

1341
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,650
Ji Ho loves it.

1342
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,820
I'm not sure if we deserve these tasty foods.

1343
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,620
You do.

1344
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,560
- I'll enjoy it then. - You're okay with it.

1345
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,360
- You were the best among us. - You did great.

1346
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,800
I should just die.

1347
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,840
Why would I eat?

1348
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,040
They're telling me to stop eating.

1349
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,670
(They can't say anything and just laugh.)

1350
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,840
No one's denying it.

1351
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,680
No one tells him to enjoy the food.

1352
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,410
(Feeling bitter)

1353
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,690
Back in the days, I only had jjajangmyeon or jjamppong.

1354
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,150
Gosh, it's tasty.

1355
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,490
This is new.

1356
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,020
I know. It feels like...

1357
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,060
- I'm in China now. - Right.

1358
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,090
As if I'm in Hong Kong.

1359
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,460
(Taking a bite)

1360
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,430
- Good. - Good.

1361
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,000
(These old guys feel good after eating tasty food.)

1362
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,400
- I had rice earlier. - I see.

1363
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,170
Hyuk, do you watch what you eat?

1364
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,780
- I don't do that. - He doesn't need to.

1365
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,680
- Why? - He works out too much.

1366
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,780
If I were to build my body, I should watch what I eat.

1367
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,750
But I just enjoy working out.

1368
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,720
I like working out while sweating and all.

1369
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,290
When I see his action scenes...

1370
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,830
I get surprised when I watch them on TV.

1371
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,430
(In his realistic action scenes,)

1372
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:54,070
(we can see how hard he worked out for it.)

1373
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,310
- Right. - Yes.

1374
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,810
When there's an action scene,

1375
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,850
- you plan it with the action team. - Yes.

1376
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,980
- We work together. - Right.

1377
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,180
In general, the action team director plans the action scene.

1378
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,250
But he's good enough to be a director himself.

1379
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,290
I was once in a drama called "Thank You."

1380
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,390
I was a doctor.

1381
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,960
I'm a doctor with a rebellious character.

1382
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,490
Just like all my other characters.

1383
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,030
The action team director brought eight people for the scene.

1384
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,400
I asked him to bring 16, and I took down all of them.

1385
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,970
- But you're a doctor. - I know.

1386
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,300
Back then, I had no idea what I was doing.

1387
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,370
(The energetic doctor)

1388
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:29,880
But now, I know that it should go along with the character.

1389
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,040
- Right. - You think like that now.

1390
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,180
And that's right.

1391
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,080
- I see. - I don't feel that way now.

1392
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,750
When he was in "The Slave Hunters,"

1393
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,050
if you look closely, he does Jeet Kune Do.

1394
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,090
- Jeet Kune Do in that period? - But it existed.

1395
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,820
It can be explained logically.

1396
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,560
- Jeet Kune Do in the Chosun era? - Think about it.

1397
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,160
Jeet Kune Do is from Wing Chun by Yip Man.

1398
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,060
And Wing Chun was made by this woman called Wing Chun...

1399
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,570
who lived in the Chosun era.

1400
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,270
- And you considered all that? - Yes, I did.

1401
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,270
Because that is...

1402
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,070
Since the times when there were the Tang and Qing dynasty...

1403
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,410
Even before that, since the Goguryeo period,

1404
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,410
we had exchanges with them.

1405
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,710
You know what the Silk Road is, right?

1406
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,850
- You punk. - Say "You, my friend."

1407
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,080
- "You, my friend." - "You, my friend."

1408
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,420
Sorry, Jae Suk. I just became so angry inside.

1409
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,730
You know what I mean, right? Anyway...

1410
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,530
He just makes people go crazy.

1411
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,900
(This guy who makes people crazy just happy.)

1412
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,030
- And he's my friend. - I know.

1413
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,740
- It's been 30 years now. - This is what I think.

1414
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,170
You and Jong Kook were the only ones who could hold out.

1415
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,510
(Tae Hyun just laughs.)

1416
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,310
- Now... - We should leave now.

1417
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,480
We need to pay for it. We should play a game to...

1418
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,310
- Of course, we should. - Paying for lunch is nothing.

1419
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,610
I'll pay for it.

1420
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,050
If you're going to pay for it, would you pay for everyone here?

1421
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,490
I have to pay for everyone here?

1422
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,190
Well, then it's different.

1423
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,620
- Do you want to play a game then? - I...

1424
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,990
I thought we were just paying for this table.

1425
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,060
I thought of a few games.

1426
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,870
- What kind of games? - Since you said...

1427
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,870
you've become interested in music...

1428
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,140
How about we play absolute pitch game?

1429
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,810
Absolute pitch? Gosh, I'm absolute.

1430
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,840
- Really? - How do we do it?

1431
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,840
With a piano,

1432
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,580
one who gets it right wins. The one left will pay.

1433
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,280
He will play a note, and we'll say what it is.

1434
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,520
It's fair.

1435
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,650
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

1436
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,790
Ready, start.

1437
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,620
I got it.

1438
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,490
(Jae Suk raised his hand first.)

1439
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:26,660
- Sol. - Wrong.

1440
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,830
- I got it. - Fa.

1441
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:28,960
Okay. I'm out.

1442
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,160
Okay. I'm out.

1443
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,930
- This is... - Play it.

1444
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,300
- I'll play it. - I waited too long.

1445
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,600
Ready.

1446
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,940
I got it.

1447
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,970
What is it?

1448
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,110
- Mi. - Okay.

1449
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,210
Okay.

1450
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,580
Okay. Now the two of you.

1451
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,810
You need to do it again.

1452
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,150
- All right. - Okay.

1453
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,320
The absolute pitch.

1454
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,850
(Only Hyuk and Yeon Seok are left.)

1455
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,230
- Ti. - Okay.

1456
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,730
(Yeon Seok is correct.)

1457
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,830
Okay.

1458
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,730
I...

1459
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,970
I was going to pay for it anyway.

1460
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,040
- I was going to pay for it. - Go pay for it.

1461
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,840
- But... - It's just...

1462
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,110
It's just that I wanted to know what game it was.

1463
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,710
- My gosh. - I had a nice meal.

1464
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,110
We didn't order that much anyway.

1465
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,280
- Thank you, Hyuk. - All right.

1466
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,380
Let's go.

1467
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,480
- Do you need the receipt? - No, thank you.

1468
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,850
- Thank you. Goodbye. - Thank you.

1469
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,920
- Thank you, ma'am. - Sure.

1470
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,850
I think we need to take a taxi from here.

1471
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,420
Shall we? Let's take the taxi.

1472
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,120
- Hyuk, thank you for the food. - Thank you, Hyuk.

1473
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,730
Goodness.

1474
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,960
This time, let's...

1475
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,730
Let's do a good job this time.

1476
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,000
- We'll do it well this time. - Let's do it well.

1477
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,400
Let's not feel too much pressure.

1478
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,570
We had a filling meal.

1479
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,840
- There it comes. - That one.

1480
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,170
- That one. - Shall we get in?

1481
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,240
I know what it is.

1482
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,380
- Gosh, I'm full now. - We had a lot.

1483
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,450
- We did have a lot. - Goodness.

1484
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,720
When I went to Seoul Institute of Arts, I...

1485
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,250
Oh, right. This place was...

1486
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,420
The two and a half years when I went to Seoul Institute of Arts...

1487
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,220
- I had the most fun. - It was fun.

1488
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,030
- Right. - It was so fun going to school.

1489
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,230
Right, when I was attending school...

1490
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,060
- It felt comfortable around here. - There were many things there.

1491
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,170
- I had so much fun. - I came from Busan and went to...

1492
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,940
- Right. - Myeongdong for the first time.

1493
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,040
The first song I heard there was Jong Kook's song.

1494
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,040
- Really? - Turbo's song.

1495
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,070
He was amazing back then.

1496
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,470
- Right. He was the best. - Yes.

1497
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,410
So I did

1498
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,480
It was this song.

1499
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,280
But that's too deep for Jong Kook's voice.

1500
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,020
So I did

1501
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,390
(Jong Kook hates Jae Suk's voice mimic the most.)

1502
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,920
Gosh, he's been...

1503
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
- working for a long time. - Jong Kook.

1504
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,630
And you know what? Jong Kook is...

1505
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,660
- Mr. Smiley these days. - Right.

1506
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,500
- Back in the days... - He wasn't that big in the past.

1507
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,730
- Right. - He wasn't that big.

1508
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:47,830
- He was slim. - Yes.

1509
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,340
Jong Kook was so sharp.

1510
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,040
By the way, if you think about it,

1511
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,310
you all have been working since the 90s.

1512
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:58,810
I have to say...

1513
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,410
- they're just amazing. - This isn't an easy thing to do.

1514
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,920
I can still remember the moment I read my first script.

1515
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,620
I remember how the air felt at the moment.

1516
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,120
Well, I don't remember that.

1517
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,290
- I was going to SBS... - How did you feel?

1518
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:13,360
early in the morning, in winter, to attend the script reading.

1519
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,230
- The air felt so cold. - I see.

1520
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,260
(Early in the cold winter morning in 1997)

1521
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,500
Ji Sub and I were the youngest ones.

1522
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,100
We both made our debut in that drama.

1523
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,370
(He made his drama debut in "Model" in 1997.)

1524
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,110
(Ji Sub was 21, and Hyuk was 22.)

1525
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,010
(Young Hyuk, who was in his 20s.)

1526
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,810
They were all senior actors.

1527
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,550
- You must've been so nervous. - All of them were my seniors.

1528
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,680
Script reading makes you so nervous.

1529
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,650
- I was doing my lines, - That's so hard.

1530
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,390
- but I got so nervous. - Of course.

1531
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:41,990
When I made my debut,

1532
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,690
I wasn't someone who attended the script reading.

1533
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,590
One that I had an actual role was "Our Sunny Days of Youth."

1534
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,560
I played this guy who followed Do Yeon.

1535
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,100
- "Our Sunny Days of Youth." - Right.

1536
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,600
That's such an old drama. My gosh.

1537
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:54,570
You know what? They play this song in variety shows.

1538
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,170
(This music is popular as it was played on variety shows.)

1539
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,270
- Right. - It was from that drama.

1540
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,740
- It's from its soundtrack? - It's that one, right?

1541
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,210
A role following the female lead...

1542
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,340
is a nice role.

1543
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,680
It was a small role that appears short.

1544
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,850
But it must've been okay after shooting some scenes.

1545
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,650
- I was on it for about ten times. - Of course.

1546
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,390
You need to get it...

1547
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,720
- when you have the chance. - Right.

1548
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,660
- You must do that. - He didn't just tag along.

1549
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,660
He must've thought a lot...
- while shooting the scenes. - Of course.

1550
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,860
Let me tell you what he's like.

1551
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,430
I met him for the first time in a drama called "Into the Sunlight."

1552
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:26,970
(They met for the 1st time in a drama 26 years ago.)

1553
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,970
(Both of them were 24 years old.)

1554
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,540
My gosh. What do I do?

1555
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,140
He is... Seriously.

1556
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,010
He pretends like he didn't think about it much.

1557
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,040
It seems like...

1558
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,640
- he just does as it goes, - Right.

1559
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,980
- but people like him... - Seriously.

1560
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,010
- They think a lot. - Of course.

1561
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,720
But they never show that to people.

1562
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,520
"Me? I didn't do anything."

1563
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,690
It's like getting a perfect score without studying.

1564
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,420
When he releases a song, it tops the chart.

1565
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,360
He's just amazing.

1566
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,930
- The whole nation was his fan. - Right.

1567
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,000
If you think about it, the mid-90s...

1568
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,370
was the Renaissance.

1569
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,700
- Seriously. There were... - You're using big words today.

1570
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,940
Analogue and digital combined together.

1571
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,310
There was also vintage. Everything was mixed up.

1572
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,710
So they said neanthropic.

1573
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,280
- That's how it felt. - It felt like that.

1574
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,650
"Love of New People."

1575
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,350
That song was released with that background.

1576
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,420
(This guy is excited.)

1577
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,120
In between the New Generation and Generation X.

1578
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,620
Is that the song?

1579
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,060
(The neanthropic people are excited.)

1580
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,630
- But you know, we are... - That flutter in your heart

1581
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,960
- If you're looking for it - If you're looking for it

1582
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,400
(Laughing)

1583
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,530
(They arrived at the destination while chatting.)

1584
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,600
- What was that? - Goodness.

1585
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,300
It's the National Theatre of Korea.

1586
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,970
- It's here, sir. Daloreum Theatre. - Daloreum Theatre.

1587
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,270
Yes. You can go straight.

1588
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,440
- Go straight? - Yes.

1589
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,210
Let's find the second Whenever Guest.

1590
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,280
It's from Song Ji Young.

1591
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,440
"Ramyeon has been prohibited for 15 years."

1592
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,310
"Watching my diet is a must."

1593
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,120
"I run 10km around Mount Nam every day at 6am."

1594
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,350
"From 10am to 5pm,"

1595
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,590
"I dance for seven hours as an aerobic exercise."

1596
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,190
Gosh, what does this person do?

1597
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,990
"I love to work out, and I must get sweat..."

1598
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,390
"even when there's a heat wave or a heavy rain."

1599
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,770
"I move my body every second when I have white cloth and music."

1600
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,500
"Please visit my playground."

1601
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,670
"White cloth and body?"

1602
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,770
This person does aerobic exercise by dancing.

1603
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,740
How can this person work out all day?

1604
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:19,710
This theatre is really old.

1605
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,080
I think it was built in the 1960s or the 1970s.

1606
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,990
Gosh. We talked about the old times a lot with Hyuk.

1607
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,090
I think the dressing room is that way.

1608
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,120
That's it.

1609
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,030
Yeon Seok, have you played here before?

1610
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,630
I've been to this place to play.

1611
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,200
- Gosh. - Yeon Shik knows well.

1612
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,360
Have I performed here before?

1613
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,270
I like these kinds of things.

1614
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,000
- The old buildings. - This vibe.

1615
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,140
You know what I mean, right?

1616
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,200
- That material. - Right.

1617
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,610
The materials used in old buildings. I really like it.

1618
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,440
The dressing room and practice room.

1619
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,440
It's the fourth floor of that building.

1620
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,380
I love this.

1621
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,180
- What do you mean? - The walls.

1622
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,550
The old materials used in old buildings.

1623
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,720
You have no idea.

1624
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,320
- Hyuk, you know it, right? - Of course.

1625
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,030
He has no idea.

1626
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,560
- The fourth floor. - The elevator is there.

1627
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,960
- Practice room on the fourth floor. - It must be here.

1628
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,230
- "Let Me In." - You haven't performed here?

1629
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,140
I never performed here.

1630
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,100
- But I came to watch... - Last time,

1631
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,570
we came to watch...

1632
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,170
- Hwang Jung Min's play. - That was here.

1633
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,980
- At the Haeorum Grand Theatre. - Right.

1634
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,980
"Don't rest."

1635
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,010
- "Don't rest?" - Yes.

1636
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,880
- What was the name? - It's Song Ji Young.

1637
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,150
- What? I hear something. - I hear something.

1638
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,220
- It's here. - Right.

1639
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,550
- I think we're at the right place. - I think so.

1640
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,520
What? There are so many people here.

1641
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,590
It's not just one person?

1642
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,260
- There are many people here. - Goodness.

1643
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,360
Is Ji Young here?

1644
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,360
- It's me. - Hello.

1645
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,730
(They are at the practice room of the National Dance Company.)

1646
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,170
- Goodness. - So you were practising.

1647
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,240
Hello. My gosh.

1648
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,810
- It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1649
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,940
(Whenever Guest is with her colleagues.)

1650
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,580
- Are you Ji Young? - Yes, I am.

1651
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,610
Hello.

1652
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,310
- Gosh, they look so cool. - My goodness.

1653
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,210
- Hi, Ji Young. - We were practising.

1654
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,720
- Hi. - They're so cool.

1655
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,580
(Song Ji Young, the Second Whenever Guest)

1656
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,950
(Kim Eun I, Cho Seung Yeol, Kang Dae Hyun)

1657
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,590
Are you the members of the National Dance Company?

1658
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,260
Yes. We're the members of the National Dance Company...

1659
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,790
under the National Theatre of Korea.

1660
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,460
So you're the members of the National Dance Company.

1661
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,960
It's really hard to join the National Dance Company.

1662
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,800
- Of course. - They're the best.

1663
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,160
Gosh. Seriously.

1664
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:28,310
(The National Dance Company was established in 1962.)

1665
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,410
(Ji Young, the Whenever Guest)

1666
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,010
Gosh, this place is huge.

1667
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,120
- You're public officials, right? - As same as the public officials.

1668
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,520
Yes. We're public officials in special services.

1669
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,450
- In special services? Of course. - Yes. In special services.

1670
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,590
Isn't this place the best one in Korea?

1671
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,290
- It's really hard to join them. - It's the best.

1672
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,390
When it's national... He's the national host.

1673
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,300
- Hey. It's different for me. - He's the national host.

1674
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,860
- He needs a badge for it. - I am...

1675
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
They belong to the nation, Korea.

1676
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,140
But he belongs to the TV stations.

1677
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,170
(The dancers belong to the nation, and Jae Suk belongs to the station.)

1678
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,770
But he's the national host.

1679
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,210
Right.

1680
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,210
So, how long has it been since you joined the company?

1681
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,380
It's been about 15, 16 years.

1682
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,510
They are my senior and junior dancers.

1683
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,580
She's you're senior, and they're your juniors.

1684
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,780
How long has it been for you?

1685
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,890
It's been 24 years here.

1686
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:17,760
- You've been here for 24 years? - Yes.

1687
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,360
- Goodness. - I joined after finishing college.

1688
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,590
- Right away? - I joined right away.

1689
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,060
Can anyone dance for that long?

1690
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,800
Everyone does well to maintain their figures.

1691
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,960
- They manage themselves well. - Right.

1692
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,270
That's amazing.

1693
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,770
Then, I have a question.

1694
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,370
When you eat, where do you go?

1695
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,970
- There's a cafeteria. - So there is one.

1696
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,640
But the dancers...

1697
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,380
- don't eat much for lunch. - They don't eat much.

1698
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,450
- You have a different diet? - Right.

1699
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,010
If someone gains weight easily,

1700
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,650
- they just have coffee for lunch. - Gosh.

1701
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,150
- And if... - Just a cup of coffee?

1702
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,550
- Yes. - That's possible.

1703
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,850
So you don't usually have lunch.

1704
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:52,590
These two people are the ones who skip meals a lot.

1705
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,130
Right. Men could be different.

1706
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,230
They come to work early and exercise.

1707
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,400
- They don't have lunch. - Right.

1708
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,430
- Do you run to work every day then? - Yes.

1709
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,100
No. I come here by car.

1710
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,770
- I park my car here. - Then she runs.

1711
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,170
- You run after that? - Then you run?

1712
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,510
Yes. I run for about 10km, climbing up and down the hills.

1713
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,540
The trails around here are amazing.

1714
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,250
I see. But it's not easy to do that every day.

1715
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,280
(They exercise together.)

1716
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:19,550
You need to be light to be a member of the dance company.

1717
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,720
If I keep on doing what I've been doing...

1718
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,920
- That's not enough. - Right.

1719
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,360
(The run Mount Nam for 10km every day.)

1720
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,990
This is because...

1721
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,630
- When you get old, - Right.

1722
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,460
there must be a lot for you to do to maintain your physical ability.

1723
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,530
Nothing is just given.

1724
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,600
- Why are you massaging your legs? - She's in pain.

1725
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,770
- I got cramps. - You got cramps?

1726
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,510
I wanted to stretch my legs.

1727
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,540
I see. Sitting like that is...

1728
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,280
- Sitting like this is hard for you. - I see.

1729
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,880
- I noticed that everyone... - You can see that over there.

1730
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,980
- I see. - Sitting in one position is...

1731
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,780
- Sitting in one position is hard. - That must be hard for them.

1732
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,320
Right. They usually don't sit like that.

1733
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,490
It must be hard for them now.

1734
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,720
But we can't sit like this on a show.

1735
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:59,890
We'll be criticized.

1736
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,330
But men can't sit like that easily.

1737
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,700
Right. That's not easy.

1738
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,660
- He's the master of yoga. - Right.

1739
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,230
- That's right. - Is that so?

1740
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,800
- Yes. - Could you show us a bit?

1741
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,840
- Do it right away. - Do it.

1742
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,140
(This is easy.)

1743
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,370
- Goodness. - He did it right away.

1744
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,840
- That's so cool. - My gosh.

1745
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,180
Goodness.

1746
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,480
(He finished it, showing his clumsy side.)

1747
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,450
- His face got so red. - My gosh.

1748
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,580
Goodness.

1749
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,820
You all must have your own talents.

1750
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,220
What can you do?

1751
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,820
Could you show us some moves...

1752
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,990
- from your performances? - Right.

1753
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,360
Could you show us, Ji Young?

1754
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,260
(It's Ji Young's turn.)

1755
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,330
Come this way.

1756
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,460
(Show us.)

1757
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,470
Then...

1758
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,300
I'll show you a bit as a warm-up.

1759
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,400
- Don't get hurt, okay? - Okay.

1760
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,340
- Seriously. It's amazing. - Goodness.

1761
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,340
It feels different from the beginning.

1762
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,520
Look how she turns around.

1763
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,950
(Amazed)

1764
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,390
- It's powerful. - It's so powerful.

1765
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,910
- Gosh! - Gosh!

1766
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,880
- Yes. - That was wonderful.

1767
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,940
(That was cool.)

1768
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,010
- Gosh. - That really was wonderful.

1769
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,910
As it was the Korean traditional dance,

1770
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,180
I expected calm moves,

1771
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,380
- but they were very powerful. - Gosh.

1772
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,920
Would you like to see some shadow boxing?

1773
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,950
(In return, would you like to see some shadow boxing?)

1774
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,290
That would be great. You can use this.

1775
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:37,660
- Step forward! - Right.

1776
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,520
- We should do something too. - Do it for her, Hyuk.

1777
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,530
- In return. - What?

1778
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,290
- Why do that? - Give us some music!

1779
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,160
- Do some shadow boxing. - Use the same song.

1780
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,300
- Do some shadow boxing. - That sounds great.

1781
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,500
She performed for us.

1782
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,800
Start by getting up.

1783
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,830
- Go for it. - Go.

1784
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,000
- That will be perfect. - That's nice.

1785
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,540
- Make it look impressive. - Instead of shadow boxing,

1786
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,040
I'll perform Jeet Kune Do.

1787
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,840
(He responds with Jeet Kune Do.)

1788
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:57,610
That's impressive!

1789
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,810
(Startled)

1790
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,880
(Jeet Kune Do! How do I look?)

1791
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,950
That's impressive!

1792
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,390
Gosh.

1793
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,950
(Slipping)

1794
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,060
Nice!

1795
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:13,420
(The ending was perfect too.)

1796
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,130
- Come this way. - He's really good at it.

1797
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,590
You've still got it.

1798
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,230
- He did Jeet Kune Do for us. - It was similar.

1799
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,200
But even when you did Jeet Kune Do,

1800
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,570
you didn't look ahead.

1801
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,570
You must open the eyes of your heart.

1802
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,770
You must do it with your heart.

1803
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,270
- Well... - His skills were amazing.

1804
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:28,970
- His skills were amazing. - It was impressive.

1805
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,210
He did it for a long time.

1806
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,980
What made you apply to our show?

1807
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,980
(The reason for applying to Whenever Possible)

1808
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,710
Meeting you...

1809
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,750
- was an item on my bucket list. - Really?

1810
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,090
How is meeting Jae Suk an item on your bucket list?

1811
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,660
I think he's the ideal model of who I want to live like.

1812
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,720
- Really? - Well...

1813
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,800
Looking at his life from when he was young and up until now,

1814
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,630
I feel like he stayed strong, had sincerity, and was consistent.

1815
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:57,130
Is it okay to have an ugly face?

1816
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,500
What are you saying?

1817
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,670
- Ideal model. Not an ideal type. - What?

1818
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,970
"Is it okay to have an ugly face?"

1819
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,010
What does that even mean?

1820
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,580
- Is a face like this okay? - Gosh.

1821
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,750
I didn't say anything.

1822
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,580
I didn't say anything.

1823
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:10,980
I didn't agree with what he said.

1824
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,450
You must like unique faces.

1825
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,820
But to be honest,

1826
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,490
this is the last mission of this season.

1827
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:20,160
- Really? - We will be taking a break.

1828
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,160
We really hope that we can have a great result today.

1829
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,400
She wants to earn some hopeful energy today.

1830
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,500
Let's make it happen.

1831
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,030
- All right. Go for it. - I'm going.

1832
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,170
(Rolling the bonus coupon dice)

1833
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,230
Let's go!

1834
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,970
(Just don't be 0.)

1835
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,480
- Please. - Please.

1836
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,210
- That's fine. - Once isn't that bad.

1837
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,410
- That's not bad. - Right.

1838
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,580
There's only one side with two.

1839
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,320
Ji Young will pick the present for Round One.

1840
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,150
"Running before getting to work and dancing at work."

1841
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,590
"Your muscles need some time to rest."

1842
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,390
"The Banyan Tree Spa Package."

1843
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,890
It's right in front.

1844
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:56,190
- Right. - Right.

1845
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,500
- It's right in front. - It's right in front.

1846
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,660
Banyan Tree Club.

1847
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,960
(Your muscles need some time to rest.)

1848
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,000
(Banyan Tree Spa Package)

1849
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,230
This is amazing. It's a really nice hotel.

1850
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,570
Gosh. All right then.

1851
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,540
- Please! - Please!

1852
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,670
- Let's go! - Let's finish well.

1853
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,740
(It's time to give presents to the National Dance Company members.)

1854
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,240
- Gosh, hello. - Hello.

1855
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
- They are the junior members. - I see.

1856
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,280
- The junior members. - Right.

1857
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,780
- We should get a good result. - We should do well.

1858
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,480
Right? What is our mission?

1859
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,520
(Table Tennis Ball Drum Fanning)

1860
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,790
(Hit the table tennis ball with a fan...)

1861
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,960
(and bring down the sogo.)

1862
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,560
(Total of 10 table tennis balls)

1863
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,390
(Time limit of 30 seconds)

1864
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,260
The sogo has to be brought down?

1865
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,830
The one over there?

1866
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,400
With the table tennis ball?

1867
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,930
The ball is hit with the fan.

1868
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,500
Hold on.

1869
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
With table tennis balls,

1870
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,910
- Gosh, table tennis balls? - we were quite...

1871
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:43,240
- Like this? - This was the last mission...

1872
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,240
- with Tae Hyun and Jong Kook. - Right.

1873
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,610
We did well last time.

1874
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,780
(The last mission of the previous season)

1875
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,020
(After passing Round 1 on their 1st try,)

1876
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,350
- Go! - Focus.

1877
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,350
(they passed Round 2 on their 2nd try.)

1878
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,420
(And on top of that...)

1879
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,120
What is going on?

1880
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,660
(They passed Round 3 on their 3rd try.)

1881
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,200
We passed Round 3 in just 3 tries!

1882
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,100
(A miracle made by table tennis)

1883
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,400
We did well last time.

1884
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,840
It's a relief that you two are good at this.

1885
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,040
I'm bad at this.

1886
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,670
But we're not using rackets.

1887
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,610
- How will we hit that with this? - This is hard.

1888
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:19,710
- This is hard. - It's hard.

1889
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,310
It's so funny how they're using fans.

1890
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:22,750
(A mission that perfectly suits the National Dance Company of Korea)

1891
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:23,880
- How should this be done? - Let's go.

1892
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,920
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1893
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,350
- How will we hit that with this? - This is hard.

1894
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,820
- Gosh. - These aren't even actual rackets.

1895
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,790
- I can't believe these people. - The shots aren't that strong.

1896
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,560
It won't bounce off the fan.

1897
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,360
This is too hard.

1898
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:41,100
- Gosh. - Hurray!

1899
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,830
- Hurray! - Hurray!

1900
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:43,870
- "Hurray?" - "Hurray!

1901
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,900
You all have unique reactions.

1902
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,670
- Hold on. - Just give us real rackets.

1903
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,080
- This is hard. - What can we do with these?

1904
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,680
Gosh, I think I have a talent for this.

1905
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,710
(He has the strength.)

1906
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,050
(It misses to its left.)

1907
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,180
- Just like that. - I should hit it from here.

1908
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,120
- It moves to the right. - This is hard.

1909
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,160
This is hard.

1910
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,960
(Table tennis with a fan isn't easy to do.)

1911
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,760
(Looking carefully)

1912
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,660
(He checks the rebound.)

1913
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,130
(Working on his wrist snap)

1914
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,970
The ball goes like this.

1915
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,240
(Swing simulation)

1916
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,540
Like this.

1917
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,570
- No one has done it yet. - Right.

1918
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,180
How did they come up with a game like this?

1919
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,340
It might not have to be that strong.

1920
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,780
Right.

1921
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,650
- Okay. - Just like that.

1922
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:32,750
Hitting it like that...

1923
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,490
Just like that. Hitting it like that...

1924
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,620
- Nice. - So that's how it should be done.

1925
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,790
Okay. We got it.

1926
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,590
So that's how it should be done.

1927
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,490
- Nice! - Okay. We got it.

1928
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,530
- We have someone who can do it! - Nice one, Yeon Shik.

1929
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm talented when it comes to these sorts of things.

1930
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,830
- Yeon Shik has got it. - We have one that can do it!

1931
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:50,000
- It doesn't have to be strong. - Make an arc.

1932
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,370
- There should be an arc. - Making an arc would be better.

1933
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,640
- Shall we go for it? - Let's go for it.

1934
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,240
- Let's give it a try. - All right.

1935
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:56,740
- Let's go! - Let's do a cheer together first.

1936
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,380
Hurray.

1937
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,980
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1938
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,080
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1939
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,850
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

1940
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,280
Let's go by 2, 2, 3, 3 at first with the number of balls.

1941
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,180
- Let's go by 2, 2, 3, 3. - We'll get 2 balls, right?

1942
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,390
I'll get two balls too.

1943
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:09,390
(Number of balls: 3, 3, 2, 2)

1944
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,490
- You have 30 seconds. - We have 30 seconds.

1945
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:13,090
- We have 30 seconds? - It's 30 seconds?

1946
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,960
- We get 10 balls and 30 seconds? - This is our 1st try.

1947
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,360
Get ready.

1948
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:18,900
Getting 30 seconds is quite long.

1949
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,100
- Get ready. - Here we go.

1950
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,370
The next person should go quickly.

1951
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,140
- That was close. - Okay.

1952
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,310
(After Tae Hyun, it's Hyuk's turn with 2 balls.)

1953
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,380
Just one!

1954
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,050
(Next is Jae Suk with 3 balls.)

1955
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,790
- How many seconds do we have left? - The second shot was really close.

1956
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,720
- That's enough time. - Right.

1957
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,600
(It fell down!)

1958
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,840
(They make it on their very first try!)

1959
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,110
(Treating well)

1960
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:02,410
Give him some water.

1961
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,240
- Nice one. - Give him some water.

1962
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,310
(A clean shot from the upper body genius!)

1963
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:11,680
- Nice one! - Nice!

1964
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,050
(Table Tennis King, Yeon Shik)

1965
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,050
Nice one!

1966
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,850
- You're on fire. - All right.

1967
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,620
- We pass Round One! - Yes!

1968
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,620
Gosh, does this make sense?

1969
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,960
(Deja vu from the previous season)

1970
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
- We did it. - Gosh.

1971
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,700
Round One...

1972
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,560
- Yes. - For the Banyan Tree Spa.

1973
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,700
Congratulations!

1974
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,500
(They secure the Banyan Tree Spa tickets.)

1975
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,470
- You've secured the tickets. - All right. It's go or stop.

1976
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:33,940
- Round Two. - We will obviously...

1977
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,810
- It's obvious. - choose to go.

1978
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:36,840
- Right. - Yes.

1979
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,540
- Let's check the next prize. - Okay.

1980
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,450
- We passed right away. - We passed Round One quickly.

1981
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,350
Gosh, Jeju Island round-trip tickets!

1982
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,720
(An explosive reaction)

1983
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,550
"The K-eldest daughter and her parents."

1984
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,190
"Quality time of the family of three."

1985
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,090
- "Jeju Island round-trip tickets." - Gosh!

1986
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,790
- My gosh. - That's just amazing.

1987
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:54,430
My gosh. That kind of prize...

1988
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,360
- attracts so much pressure. - Gosh, they're actual tickets.

1989
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,300
(What is Round 2's mission for the plane tickets?)

1990
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,400
They're actual tickets.

1991
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,230
(Round 2)

1992
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,200
(Putting down two sogos)

1993
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,940
There are two now?

1994
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:10,570
But...

1995
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:11,910
- It could be easier. - Right.

1996
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,140
- Both can fall at once. - That can happen.

1997
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,150
They're placed like that?

1998
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,820
- I think this could feel easier. - I need to hit it a bit higher.

1999
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,420
The other one could fall as one falls down.

2000
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,590
- Right. - They're close to each other.

2001
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,650
(He practices right away.)

2002
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:26,360
- Gosh! - There you go.

2003
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:28,190
(There you go!)

2004
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:31,930
(Smashing down in a straight line!)

2005
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,660
- That could be better. - What a strong smash!

2006
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,900
What a man.

2007
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,540
(Two sogos are brought down in a flash.)

2008
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,970
Right. We got this.

2009
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,810
- We got this. - See that?

2010
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:45,810
That felt nice.

2011
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:47,710
- Let's go for it. - Okay.

2012
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:49,750
Let's go by 2, 2, 3, 3 this time.

2013
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,020
- We'll go by 2, 2, 3, 3? - Okay.

2014
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,250
- I'll take two, obviously. - Right. Let's go!

2015
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,890
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2016
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,720
- I won't make it anyway. - This is our second try.

2017
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,220
(They start with Tae Hyun who has 2 balls.)

2018
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,890
- Here we go! - Get ready.

2019
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,060
Hurry.

2020
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,100
(Next up is Jae Suk with 2 balls.)

2021
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,930
Gosh.

2022
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,270
- Gosh! - Hurry up and move away.

2023
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,340
(Two balls were wasted into the air.)

2024
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:16,970
- Gosh. - All right!

2025
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:17,980
(Next is the straightforward guy, Hyuk, with 3 balls.)

2026
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:19,510
(Slipping)

2027
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:22,750
Let's go!

2028
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,520
What happened all of a sudden?

2029
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
(There are three balls left.)

2030
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,290
(Yeon Shik brought it down again!)

2031
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,890
Please!

2032
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,960
- Please! - He's going to do it.

2033
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,260
- Hold on! - He's going to do it.

2034
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:42,370
(It's the last ball now!)

2035
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,000
- It's the last ball! - Please!

2036
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,440
- You did really well. - Hey.

2037
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,510
You're the ace between us.

2038
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:52,810
- He's the true ace. - We should...

2039
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,110
- give him 4 balls. - Let's give him 4 balls.

2040
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,780
- Let's give him 4 balls. - Let's give him 4 balls.

2041
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,220
- We'll give them 4 and 3. - Let's give him 4 balls.

2042
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:00,980
- So Yeon Seok will get 4. - It's 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2043
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,390
- Okay. - It's 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2044
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:03,450
- It's 1, 2, 3, and 4. - Let's go.

2045
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,660
- Please! - All right.

2046
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,660
The 3 of us should just put 1 down.

2047
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,830
- Just one. - Just between ourselves.

2048
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:09,590
Let's just do it between ourselves.

2049
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,100
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

2050
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,500
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

2051
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,360
- It's our fourth try. - All right.

2052
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,200
- Here we go. - We should get just one.

2053
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,070
- Ready. - Go, Tae Hyun.

2054
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,540
All right.

2055
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,370
It's okay.

2056
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,980
- It's good we gave him 1. - Try 1 more.

2057
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,040
He only hit one ball.

2058
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,980
Just give it a try.

2059
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,850
- Nice. - I did it.

2060
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,120
- Nice. - I did it.

2061
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,150
- I knocked one over. - Go, Jae Suk.

2062
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,290
All right.

2063
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,450
- Gosh. - Please.

2064
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:38,690
- Nice. - I knocked one over.

2065
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:40,290
- I knocked one over. - This is good.

2066
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:41,760
- One more. - That was good.

2067
01:10:42,461 --> 01:10:43,990
(Number of balls left: 5)

2068
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,530
It's okay. That was good.

2069
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,000
(Yeon Seok's turn)

2070
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,400
Take your time. You only have to knock one over.

2071
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,200
- Hurray. - Let's go.

2072
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,070
- Take your time. - Wait a minute.

2073
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:56,940
- Take your time. - It's okay. Take your time.

2074
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,110
- Take your time. - We have plenty of time.

2075
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:59,310
We have plenty of time.

2076
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,150
- In 5, 4, 3... - We have time.

2077
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,420
- It's okay. - That wasn't bad.

2078
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,050
- It wasn't bad. - No, wait.

2079
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,860
- Look. - We shouldn't be disappointed yet.

2080
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,390
- We're doing well. - We...

2081
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:16,330
The 3 of us just have to knock 1 over.

2082
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:18,600
- That's right. - It's perfect.

2083
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,530
Let's each take 1, 2, 3, and 4 balls.

2084
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,300
- We take 1, 2, and 3? - Yes. 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2085
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,900
I'll change my strategy.

2086
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,940
(Pushing with a backhand)

2087
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,640
- Gosh. - You're doing great right now.

2088
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,980
- I got it. - He's got it.

2089
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,380
- I got it. - He's really good.

2090
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,150
- He can do it. - That's right.

2091
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,220
That's right.

2092
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,890
- This is better for me. - That is better.

2093
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,190
You have a higher chance with your backhand.

2094
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:45,690
- He found a way to do it. - This is more accurate.

2095
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,790
- That's better. - How is he doing that?

2096
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,360
- That's it. - That's it.

2097
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,260
I think we can succeed this time.

2098
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,030
I have a good feeling we'll succeed this time.

2099
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,900
It's our sixth try. Let's do the bonus round if we fail.

2100
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,970
(They are on try number six.)

2101
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,900
- Should I go 1st? - Yes, you go 1st.

2102
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,040
Yes, just end it from the start.

2103
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,040
Yes, do that.

2104
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,570
- You guys knock 1 over later. - I'll give you 2.

2105
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,540
- We'll each take 2. - I'll take 3.

2106
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,040
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2107
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,640
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

2108
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,740
Let's go.

2109
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,880
Ready.

2110
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:14,720
(Number of balls left: 10)

2111
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,520
(Flustered)

2112
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,320
- Relax. - Wait.

2113
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,660
It's okay. Relax.

2114
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,160
- That's right. - Wait.

2115
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,800
It's okay. Relax.

2116
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,470
You get anxious when you go first.

2117
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,130
Tae Hyun. Okay.

2118
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,900
(Number of balls left: 7)

2119
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,100
Tae Hyun. Okay.

2120
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,210
(Number of balls left: 6)

2121
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:40,980
(Number of balls left: 5)

2122
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,080
No.

2123
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:44,510
No.

2124
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,990
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2125
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:50,520
- Go. - Let's go.

2126
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
Go.

2127
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,190
He did it.

2128
01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:00,360
(Hyuk did it!)

2129
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,100
- You did it. - We did it.

2130
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,470
Do you know how uncomfortable I felt being treated like a traitor?

2131
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:10,070
Good job.

2132
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,480
(After hitting one,)

2133
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,080
He did it.

2134
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,950
(he knocked the other one over right away!)

2135
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,650
That was great.

2136
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,250
- That was great. - You did it.

2137
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,320
(Hyuk did it all.)

2138
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,750
- You did it. - Nice.

2139
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,590
- Round Two, success. - Success.

2140
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,060
(They clear Round 2!)

2141
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,590
(She gets the hotel spa voucher and plane tickets.)

2142
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,430
Go home now.

2143
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,430
Don't do this.

2144
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,470
- Don't do this. - Come on.

2145
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,570
- You shouldn't do that. - But...

2146
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:39,770
- We lost everything by doing this. - He's right.

2147
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:42,340
- We have four tries left. - Don't do it.

2148
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,310
- And a free chance. - We also have a bonus chance.

2149
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,480
- That's five tries left. - What did we talk about at lunch?

2150
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,150
We agreed not to do this.

2151
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,350
Ji Young will make the choice.

2152
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,880
- If we continue... - Only she can decide.

2153
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,750
We failed four times in a row when we continued.

2154
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,190
They got the hang of it now.

2155
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,990
- You think so? - That isn't true.

2156
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:01,890
It was pure luck, not our skills.

2157
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,130
Go or stop?

2158
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,730
- In 1, 2, 3. - Be objective.

2159
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:06,800
Ji Young.

2160
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,830
Trust them.

2161
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,230
- Go. - All right.

2162
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,370
We should continue.

2163
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,070
- Yes. - We should continue.

2164
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:15,540
- What are you talking about? - I think we should continue.

2165
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,610
I don't know.

2166
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,840
- I did my part. - We should continue.

2167
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,980
Let's continue happily.

2168
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,180
- You can do this. - Let's go.

2169
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,980
- This is for Round Three. - You know what?

2170
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,820
I know for a fact you'll all be blown away...

2171
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,790
when you see the prize.

2172
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,590
I don't know what it is, but take a look at it.

2173
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,320
- It's a huge prize for sure. - I don't know what it is.

2174
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,560
All right.

2175
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,960
- Gosh. - See? She's blown away.

2176
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,830
- What is it? - "For the running crew..."

2177
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:41,130
"of the National Dance Company of Korea that runs around..."

2178
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:43,270
"Mount Nam all year, we have six pairs of HOKA sneakers."

2179
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,440
- Unbelievable. - Awesome.

2180
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,570
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

2181
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:50,070
- We need this. - Six pairs of these...

2182
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,740
cost around 1,500 dollars.

2183
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,280
(A gift worth more than 1,500 dollars)

2184
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,110
- This is a popular model. - It must be high quality.

2185
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,510
It really is high quality.

2186
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,750
- Hold on. Now, - Yes.

2187
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,650
the game will become more difficult.

2188
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,350
What is our mission for Round Three?

2189
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:03,450
(What is the mission for Round 3, the grand finale?)

2190
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:04,690
(Round 3)

2191
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,190
(The target becomes smaller.)

2192
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,230
- What? - Is that it?

2193
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:10,290
I don't think that'll fall over even if we hit it.

2194
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,760
Is that a scroll?

2195
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,060
It's a scroll.

2196
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,230
That's absurd.

2197
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,470
It's too thin.

2198
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,000
This is impossible.

2199
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:18,970
We shouldn't put too much thought into it.

2200
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,540
The ball might bounce off this,

2201
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,710
You have to practice to succeed.

2202
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:24,040
hit the back, and hit the scroll.

2203
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,940
He's become a chatterbox after succeeding once.

2204
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,010
(Side effect of success: He becomes a chatterbox.)

2205
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,210
- You know what I mean, right? - He's become confident.

2206
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,450
- He got a taste of success. - That's understandable.

2207
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,680
- Let's go. - Confidence.

2208
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,180
This is difficult.

2209
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,950
- It won't be easy. - No, it won't.

2210
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,250
(The ball flies through the scrolls.)

2211
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:38,960
Then I'll hit it this way.

2212
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,860
- Gosh. - Where should we aim?

2213
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,290
- See? - This way.

2214
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,630
It's...

2215
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,130
Maybe this isn't it.

2216
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,830
- He can do it. - Gosh.

2217
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:51,070
That won't fall over without pressure.

2218
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:52,500
- It was too weak. - We need to apply pressure.

2219
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,540
Yes, since it's sturdy.

2220
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,540
- How will they hit that? - This is very difficult.

2221
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,810
- We shouldn't have continued. - We should've listened to Tae Hyun.

2222
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,880
I don't want to play.

2223
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,910
- He isn't playing. - Hey.

2224
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,050
We have the energy of Mount Nam.

2225
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,950
- "The energy of Mount Nam." - Mount Nam.

2226
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,320
- Awesome. - He's really good.

2227
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,050
- He's so good. - He's so good.

2228
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:11,020
- I got goosebumps. - He's really good.

2229
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,960
I'm aiming in the right direction.

2230
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,190
- Bounce it off the table. - It's hard to hit it with the ball.

2231
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,560
I don't think this is humanly possible.

2232
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,870
- I'll aim slightly higher. - Where are you going, Tae Hyun?

2233
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,870
Can I put this on?

2234
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,200
- Yes. - Yes.

2235
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,470
- I need the energy of Mount Nam. - Are you a master of some sort?

2236
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:32,610
- You need to wear a hat. - This is better.

2237
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:33,840
(He shows up in a jangsam.)

2238
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,580
He looks like some kind of master.

2239
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,620
- I shot ki blasts in the past. - Don't get tangled in it.

2240
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,450
I've shot ki blasts.

2241
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,320
- Let's go. - All right.

2242
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,820
- Are we trying? - Let's bring our hands in.

2243
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,660
- Everyone. - Everyone, gather around.

2244
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:47,190
- I'm nervous. - Fan master.

2245
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,530
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - Here we go.

2246
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:50,860
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2247
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,360
I'm sure Tae Hyun will succeed.

2248
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,400
- With the energy of the jangsam. - Yes.

2249
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,330
Let's go.

2250
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:57,530
Hit both at once.

2251
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,100
Ready.

2252
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,070
(Number of balls left: 10)

2253
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,370
(Number of balls left: 9)

2254
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,210
- The energy of the jangsam. - I can barely see his arms.

2255
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,650
It'll work later.

2256
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,110
(He leaves, flapping his arms.)

2257
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,380
(Number of balls left: 8)

2258
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,120
(It's Hyuk's turn with 3 balls.)

2259
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:17,390
(Number of balls left: 7)

2260
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,460
No.

2261
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:19,820
Hyuk.

2262
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,660
- Yes. - Please, just one.

2263
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,030
(Number of balls left: 6)

2264
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,630
- Yes. - He got one.

2265
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:25,830
- He got one. - You can do this.

2266
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:26,900
- All right. - You can do this.

2267
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,530
The energy just has to go to any one of us.

2268
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,070
- You can do this. - You can do this.

2269
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,570
The energy just has to go to any one of us.

2270
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,000
- Jae Suk. - The energy of the jangsam.

2271
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,270
The energy can go to anyone.

2272
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,910
(Number of balls left: 3)

2273
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,040
Here he goes.

2274
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,610
We're on Round Three. Please hit it.

2275
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:43,750
(The last ball!)

2276
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,020
Take your time.

2277
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,520
(Number of balls left: 1)

2278
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,330
(The seventh try ends in failure.)

2279
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,230
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2280
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,360
- It's okay. - I think we can succeed.

2281
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,830
- I think they'll succeed. - It's okay.

2282
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:03,100
- Let's use the free chance. - Let's use the free chance.

2283
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,170
- The free chance. - The free chance.

2284
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:05,540
I think Ji Young should try now.

2285
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,800
We should use the free chance.

2286
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,640
- Why don't you practice? - Give it a try.

2287
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,740
- You can do it. - You're athletic.

2288
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,580
- Give it a try. - Good luck.

2289
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,780
Who is sitting this one out?

2290
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,750
- She hasn't chosen yet. - I'll sit this one out.

2291
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:18,320
- The master? - Yes, the master won't play.

2292
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,020
- You're doing great. - Try it.

2293
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,550
- Good energy. - Get rid of it.

2294
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,250
- Let's go. - Gosh.

2295
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,620
That's good.

2296
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,290
- Nice. - That's good.

2297
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,290
That's dangerous.

2298
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,800
(One fell over,)

2299
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,800
(and the bounce knocked the other one over.)

2300
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,100
(What in the world happened?)

2301
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,600
That means both fell over, right?

2302
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,670
That would be awesome.

2303
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,300
That's what you have to do.

2304
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,270
- You're strong. - She's strong.

2305
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,670
- She's strong. - She's strong.

2306
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,610
- We got this. - Let's give this a try.

2307
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,610
- We got this. - Let's go.

2308
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:48,910
- We got this. - We can do this.

2309
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,850
- Yes, we got this. - We got this.

2310
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,080
Go, Ji Young.

2311
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,620
- Ji Young, you go 1st. - Take 3 balls.

2312
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:54,720
- I hit 3 balls? - Yes, 3.

2313
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,550
- You got this 100 percent. - Let's go.

2314
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,890
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2315
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,190
- It's over now. - Let's see.

2316
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,230
The master is cheering for you.

2317
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:03,790
It might end right away.

2318
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,830
I think Ji Young will end it right away.

2319
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,270
Ready.

2320
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:09,730
(Dancing)

2321
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,830
She can't concentrate.

2322
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:11,900
Do it over there.

2323
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,070
Wait, Tae Hyun. Can you stand behind her?

2324
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:15,210
Seriously.

2325
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:18,040
What is with you?

2326
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,840
- What is with you? - It's okay.

2327
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:21,340
He got rid of all our misfortune.

2328
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,080
- Nice. We got this. - Okay.

2329
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,350
- Send her energy. - You'll succeed right now.

2330
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,320
- Send her energy. - All right.

2331
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,050
- We got this. - Okay.

2332
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,420
(Number of balls left: 10)

2333
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,060
(Number of balls left: 9)

2334
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,790
- Please. - It's okay.

2335
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:35,860
Just hit one.

2336
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,330
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2337
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:39,900
- Move over. - I have a good feeling.

2338
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,970
He's good.

2339
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,000
Let's go.

2340
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,430
(Number of balls left: 6)

2341
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,500
Six!

2342
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,740
- Six! - He's going to do it.

2343
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:49,710
- You did it. Good. - Let's go.

2344
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,140
- Please let it work. - Please.

2345
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,680
(Number of balls left: 4)

2346
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:54,410
Ten seconds left.

2347
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,550
- Go, Yeon Seok. - Relax.

2348
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,110
Go, Yeon Seok.

2349
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:59,450
(Number of balls left: 2)

2350
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,680
(Number of balls left: 1)

2351
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,450
Four, three...

2352
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:03,990
(Number of balls left: 1)

2353
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,590
(The bonus round ends in failure.)

2354
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:08,590
- It's too hard. - That's too bad.

2355
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:10,230
- We have three tries left. - It's okay.

2356
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,260
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2357
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,600
- Hyuk. - It was...

2358
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,970
It was our chance to succeed.

2359
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:16,900
I think our chances are slimmer with me.

2360
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,140
- Do we have tries 8, 9, 10 left? - Yes.

2361
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:22,070
- We have 3 tries left? - It's 3 more tries.

2362
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,110
- We have 3 tries left. - Tries 8, 9, and 10.

2363
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:26,080
Wait a minute.

2364
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:29,880
(The practice genius is in hardcore training mode.)

2365
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,350
- He's so good. - Yes.

2366
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,420
- I did well during practice, right? - Yes, you did.

2367
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,390
- You were amazing. - Only during practice.

2368
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:38,290
- This is worth a try. - You're right.

2369
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:39,320
- Let's go. - It's worth a try.

2370
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,360
- We aren't completely lost. - Right.

2371
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,030
- Let's gather around. - All right.

2372
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:44,060
- Come on. - We got this.

2373
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:45,300
This is try number 6. In 1, 2, 3.

2374
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,260
- Here we go. - Let's go.

2375
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,070
Please let us get the sneakers.

2376
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:50,300
- The matching sneakers. - That sounds good.

2377
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,570
- Let's all go up Mount Nam. - I think we should.

2378
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:53,700
Let's go up holding hands.

2379
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,140
- Yes, let's do that. - I love it.

2380
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,240
How many should we each take?

2381
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,810
(They are already on try number eight.)

2382
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:58,880
All right.

2383
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:00,540
Gosh.

2384
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,280
- Ready. - Here we go.

2385
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,310
Set.

2386
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,180
(Number of balls left: 10)

2387
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:09,490
(Number of balls left: 9)

2388
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,690
(Number of balls left: 8)

2389
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:11,760
Too bad.

2390
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,120
I'm not here to do this.

2391
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,360
(Number of balls left: 8)

2392
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,690
I'm not here to do this.

2393
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,530
(Number of balls left: 7)

2394
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:22,230
(Number of balls left: 6)

2395
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:23,370
Here it comes.

2396
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,700
Here it comes.

2397
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,100
(Number of balls left: 6)

2398
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,610
(Number of balls left: 5)

2399
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:29,610
Knock it over.

2400
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:30,670
- Nice. - Nice.

2401
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,510
(Number of balls left: 3)

2402
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,510
(Three people fail in a flash.)

2403
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,880
Let's show them a miracle. Take your time.

2404
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,190
- You did it. - Gosh.

2405
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:45,520
(Number of balls left: 2)

2406
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,960
- Miracle. - Five,

2407
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,590
- four, three... - Take your time.

2408
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:53,660
(Try number eight ends in failure.)

2409
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,740
(They only have two tries left.)

2410
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,940
We have to succeed this time.

2411
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:03,010
We have to do it this time.

2412
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:04,710
We have to get it this time.

2413
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,840
We'll get too nervous on our last try.

2414
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:09,550
Do you have anything else?

2415
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:11,250
Is there anything more I can wear?

2416
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,750
- Give him a sword. - You have swords?

2417
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,190
- Yes, over there. - Take a sword.

2418
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,190
- They have swords. - Okay.

2419
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,660
- Dance with the swords. - This is good.

2420
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,760
I'm good with swords.

2421
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,830
Yes, you're right.

2422
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:25,360
Switch with me as soon as you're done playing.

2423
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,360
I'll be waiting and hand you the sword.

2424
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,270
- This is good. - He is ready.

2425
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,570
He's become a different person.

2426
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,370
Excuse me.

2427
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:40,040
Where are you from?

2428
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,680
They've become weird.

2429
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:45,450
(The pressure made the members of the Dragon Club weird.)

2430
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,050
We got this.

2431
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,720
It's over now.

2432
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,220
- All right. - All right.

2433
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,390
This is try number nine.

2434
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:53,420
Gosh.

2435
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,060
Wait. What should we do?

2436
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,630
(The reason Jae Suk and Yeon Seok are nervous)

2437
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,500
(The guest they visited earlier)

2438
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,930
(Fail)

2439
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,730
(Last week)

2440
01:23:02,730 --> 01:23:05,370
(Fail)

2441
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:07,340
(Another fail)

2442
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,640
(Two weeks ago)

2443
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,740
(Fail)

2444
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,810
(They failed 4 times in a row.)

2445
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,410
We seriously need this.

2446
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,580
(They can't end with a fail.)

2447
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,750
- Let's go. - I need the help of any deity.

2448
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,920
Let's go.

2449
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,250
Let's go.

2450
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,450
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2451
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:26,020
- We have two tries left. - Go.

2452
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,290
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

2453
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:30,430
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2454
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,730
- Okay, we got this. - Ready.

2455
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,960
- Set. - Okay.

2456
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:36,100
(Number of balls left: 10)

2457
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,130
We have to try.

2458
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:41,200
(Number of balls left: 9)

2459
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,170
(Number of balls left: 8)

2460
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:46,140
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2461
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,780
(Number of balls left: 8)

2462
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,410
(Number of balls left: 7)

2463
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,550
(Number of balls left: 6)

2464
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:51,680
This is driving me crazy.

2465
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,520
(Starting to cast a spell)

2466
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,320
(Hyuk has to knock one over.)

2467
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,390
(Number of balls left: 6)

2468
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:02,930
(Number of balls left: 5)

2469
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:05,630
- Gosh. - Please knock one over.

2470
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,060
(Even Hyuk fails.)

2471
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:08,930
This can't be happening.

2472
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:10,700
(Yeon Seok is the last one up.)

2473
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,640
Quickly pick up the sword.

2474
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,370
(Number of balls left: 3)

2475
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,080
Show us a miracle. Take your time.

2476
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,740
(Number of balls left: 2)

2477
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,910
You have five seconds left.

2478
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,910
- Four, three... - He did it.

2479
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:27,120
(He knocked one over!)

2480
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,380
- He did it. - Three...

2481
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:31,750
- Three... - Yes.

2482
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:34,790
- We did it. - We did it.

2483
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:40,060
(How did this happen?)

2484
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:42,630
- Yes. - We did it.

2485
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,370
- Four... - He did it.

2486
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:50,370
(He miraculously took out 2 with 1 ball!)

2487
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:55,110
(Yeon Seok flies up.)

2488
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,380
- That was awesome. - Yes.

2489
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:05,020
See, I told you it'd work!

2490
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,560
- I told you. - Yeon Seok.

2491
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,060
(Their earnest desire becomes reality.)

2492
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,930
- Yeon Seok. - We did it.

2493
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:13,860
- Hyuk. - I knew this worked.

2494
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,430
(A miracle achieved with the energy of Mount Nam)

2495
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:19,970
- It worked. - We did it.

2496
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:23,140
- You did it, Yeon Seok. - Yes.

2497
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,210
(Yoo One Shot's one last shot!)

2498
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:26,280
- Goodness. - Gosh.

2499
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,310
That was a good ending.

2500
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,580
We would've been in trouble if we hadn't succeeded.

2501
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,250
- That was amazing. - Seriously.

2502
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,820
I got goosebumps.

2503
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,220
- Unbelievable. - Amazing.

2504
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:36,720
We would've been in trouble if we hadn't succeeded.

2505
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,360
- Seriously. - You're right.

2506
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,320
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2507
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,560
- It was the sword. - That's right.

2508
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,130
- It was the sword. - Gosh.

2509
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,760
With this,

2510
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,300
you win the prizes for all three rounds.

2511
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,530
(Hotel spa voucher, plane tickets, and running shoes)

2512
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,070
We kept going for this happy ending.

2513
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:56,310
Yeon Shik did it.

2514
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:58,570
- Gosh. - That was amazing.

2515
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:01,610
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2516
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:04,010
- That was amazing. - It wasn't easy.

2517
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,520
- It's a relief. - It's such a relief.

2518
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,790
I'm so glad we ended this season on a happy note.

2519
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:09,950
- Good job. - Good job.

2520
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,920
- We were in a bit of a slump. - That's right.

2521
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,460
But this was a thrilling end to the season.

2522
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,730
- I feel so good about it. - It's nice.

2523
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,360
Thanks to this guy,

2524
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:21,360
you were able to end the season right.

2525
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,600
- I loved it. - I loved it.

2526
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,370
- I also received positive energy. - That's right.

2527
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:25,940
This was a great ending.

2528
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,900
I don't think you'll have any problems in Season Four.

2529
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,010
All right.

2530
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:30,970
Tae Hyun seems to always be at the final episode of each season.

2531
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:32,010
Yes, he is.

2532
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,410
It's become official.

2533
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:35,580
See you next year.

2534
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,750
(He promises to be at the end of Season 4 as well!)

2535
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,520
We'd like to thank all our viewers who showed us love and support.

2536
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,850
We'll take a short break away from the extreme heat.

2537
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,350
- Yes, a short spare time. - Right,

2538
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:45,690
along with our production crew.

2539
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:48,930
Please look forward to our next season...

2540
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:51,030
- of Whenever Possible. - Yes.

2541
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:53,260
Thank you once again to all of our viewers.

2542
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2543
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,530
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2544
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,970
(Thanks to everyone who was a part of it.)

2545
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:01,470
- All right. - Thank you.

2546
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,140
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2547
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,410
Yeon Shik.

2548
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:06,280
(See you again when there is a cool breeze.)

2549
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,980
I was so nervous.

2550
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,750
(Whenever Possible)

2551
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:16,890
(We will be back with Season 4)
