00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,300
Thanks for not killing me.

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,090
Get some rest.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,680
It's been a long day.

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,720
Cut it out.

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,900
Let's head home together after work.

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,240
I...

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,520
Don't apologize.

10
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,000
My relationship with her is complicated.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,880
I can't give you...

12
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880

I owe you.

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Just give me time.

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
So I can

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,640
sort it out.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
You can go.

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,560
I need

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
some alone time.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,080
Every time

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
I think of her dating Xu Zheqing

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,360
with the same face as Wen Hao's,

26
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,960
it makes me sick.

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,840
I found out

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,080
Wen Xi was in Country M three years ago.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,640
So Xu Zheqing's been into her

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,320
for that long.

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
He even asked me

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,240
to keep her identity a secret for now.

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,200
But

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
she will cause trouble
for us eventually.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,360
I suggest

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
we make a backup plan.

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,120
We'll see

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
