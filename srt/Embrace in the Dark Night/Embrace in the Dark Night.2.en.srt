You should never

196
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,910
develop any feelings for me.

197
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,110
Xu Zheqing is one of us now.

198
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,270
No need to watch him.

199
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,830
Let him move around freely.

200
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,670
- Got it.
- Got it.

201
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,110
But there's something
I don't understand.

202
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,430
In just two days,

203
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,430
Xu Zheqing

204
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,190
has become so protective of her.

205
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,590
Maybe

206
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,750
the girl paid him.

207
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,070
If Wen Xi escapes

208
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,030
and tells the cops about us...

209
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,030
I will test him.
