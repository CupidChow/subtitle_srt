[Episode 6]

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,940
V might be one of the people
closest to my sister

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,020
at work.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,180
Zitong's inquiry just came in.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,300
Meeting in ten minutes.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:34,980
Hey,

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,620
Wen Hao,

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,620
have you really lost your memory?

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,300
It's Yuan Kai.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,500
We used to be in the same group.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,540
Xu Xiaoqi and Qin Qin

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,740
are in another group.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,540
Qiao Fei is our leader.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,860
The meeting will be about

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,980
the project of Zitong

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,980
from six months ago.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,740
Do you remember it?

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,620
There were issues
with the liquidation data.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,620
We might be held accountable.

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,740
But I clearly remember

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,020
that Xu Xiaoqi's group

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,180
did

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,660
the final review.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,020
Are you guys just sitting around?

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,100
If so,

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,820
help Qin Qin and me with our tasks.

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,180
We'll swap.

29
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,460
You handle this,

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,020
and we'll do the review.

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,820
Have you no shame?

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,980
They will definitely blame us,

33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,260
so we need to insist they did it.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,260
What did Yuan Kai say to you?

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,740
Nothing important.

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,180
Is he harassing you again?

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,900
Again?

38
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,260
The night of the review, he got handsy.

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,100
We saw it.

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,060
Wen Hao,

41
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
come to my place after work.

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,420
Are you guys just sitting around?

43
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,940
If so, help Qin Qin
and me with our tasks.

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,860
You can handle the review alone.

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,820
We'll borrow Wen Hao.

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,940
Have you no shame?

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,100
So,

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,100
you didn't take the review sheet?

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,780
Yuan Kai is still

50
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,940
targeting her.

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,780
The Finance Department people
all stick to their cliques.

52
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,260
Did my sister offend
one of these factions?

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,780
It seems that I need

54
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,140

He hung up quickly.

61
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,260
Is he suspicious of me?

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,500
You can fool others,

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,820
but not me.

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,940
I was right.

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,140
He still suspects me.

Any thoughts?

Acting like she owns the place.

81
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,940
That's Wen Hao from Finance.

82
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,700
Welcome back, Wen Hao.

83
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,900
Let's get to business.

84
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,820
Who was responsible for the review

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,140
of the Zitong project?

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,420
The review

87
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,740
was assigned to Yuan Kai and Wen Hao.

88
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,340
Yes,

89
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,820
that's how it was initially arranged,

90
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,740
but then some issues came up.

91
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,260
Wen Hao, do you remember?

92
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,180
He harassed me before

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,060
and when I rejected him,
he held a grudge

94
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,740
and shifted the blame
for a project onto me.

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
If Yuan Kai succeeds this time,

96
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,580
Xiaoqi will lose her job.

97
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,740
So,

98
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,420
Wen Hao,

99
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,140
we need to be brave.

100
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,940
Later,

101
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
you must admit

102
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,500
Group A did the review.

103
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
I'll back you up

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,180
and prove you didn't do it,

105
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,740
instead, you were with us that night.

106
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,260
Yes.

107
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,820
That night,

108
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,620
Xu Xiaoqi and Qin Qin
came to me and Yuan Kai,

109
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,740
and asked

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,940
one of us to help them.

111
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,820
Who did you take?

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,060
We took...

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,940
Yuan Kai.

114
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,300
So, you did the final review.

115
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,700
I fell right into their trap.

116
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,860
Ms. Qiao,

117
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,060
Mr. Chen from Zitong

118
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,620
called again.

119
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,620
Have you found the person
responsible for the project?

120
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,180
It was Wen Hao.

121
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,500
Let her explain

122
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,940
to Mr. Chen.

123
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,140
After all, she's good at handling men.

124
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,940
What do you mean?

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,740
The photo is in the group chat.

126
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,260
Don't play innocent.

127
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,260
This is Wen Hao's privacy.

128
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
We should respect it,

129
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,020
right?

130
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,020
This wasn't at her home.

131
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,700
It was in G.E.'s elevator.

132
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Ms. Qiao,

133
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,740
what do you think?

134
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,260
Your love life is your business.

135
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,820
But be mindful

136
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,580
of the impact at work.

137
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,660
Ms. Qiao,

138
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,420
I...

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,180
According to the rule,
the more expensive the suit

140
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,180
the uglier the guy.

141
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
He's probably an old, ugly and bald guy.

142
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,820
We all know how a girl ends up

143
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,020
with that kind of guy.

144
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,020
That's insightful.

145
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,620
There's more.

146
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,020
He's probably cheating you
out of your money and looks?

147
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,300
This brooch looks so cheap.

148
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,260
Probably wholesale online.

149
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,940
Wait,

150
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,820
this brooch looks familiar.

151
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,700
That's right.

152
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,380
The guy in the photo

153
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,060
is me.

154
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,060
I bought it from a designer brand
in France.

155
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,020
Not a big brand indeed.

156
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,380
I... I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

157
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,260
And...

158
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,620
I'll take good care of my hair

159
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,500
to not be bald.

160
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
That's not what we meant.

161
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,420
This morning,

162
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,580
the elevator was crowded.

163
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,620
Wen...

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,260
Hao

165
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,180
bumped into me.

166
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
But she has already apologized.

167
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,500
Ms. Qiao,

168
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,820
as for Wen Hao's issue,

169
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,580
I'll leave it to you.

170
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,060
Zitong doesn't want to assign blame.

171
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,820
Just correct the mistake.

172
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,860
What you did just now

173
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,980
was overreacting.

174
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,540
Alright.

175
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,260
Back to work.

176
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,500
If Wen Hao leaves Finance,

177
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,140
you'll get what you want.

178
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,620
I was too naive.

179
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,900
I underestimated
how complicated Finance is.

180
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
On my first day...

181
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,540
Sorry, Hao.

182
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,620
Did I scare you?

183
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,740
Did I hurt you?

184
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,900
He is Ling Yuan,

185
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,500
my sister's secret lover.

186
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm just so happy to see you

187
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,500
after so long.

188
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,220
Where have you been these six months?

189
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,140
Mr. Ling,

190
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,020
are we close?

191
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,100
I lost some memory in a car accident,

192
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,620
so I...

193
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,020
So,

194
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,980
you forgot about us?

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,620
You scared me.

196
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,740
I... I need time to process this.

197
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,660
Alright.

198
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,340
Bye-bye.

199
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Wait.

200
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,860
I need to fix this awkward situation
with Ling Yuan

201
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
before he figures out who I really am.

202
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:04,980
Hey.

203
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,140
Got time

204
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,940
for dinner tonight?

205
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,460
You set me up
and shifted the blame onto me.

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,780
Is that not enough?

207
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,700
What else do you have in mind?

208
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,980
I was just telling the truth.

209
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,860
If you believe Xu Xiaoqi,

210
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,740
that's your choice.

211
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,500
And I've got

212
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,220
no reason to cross them.

213
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,820
Unless...

214
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,460
Unless you're with me.

215
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,500
I'll protect you

216
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
and stand up to Xu Xiaoqi and her group.

217
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,460
You? They'd eat you alive.

218
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,020
Stay away.

219
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
Wen Hao. Wen Hao.

220
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
Listen to me.

221
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,340
My boyfriend is here.

222
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,540
Back off.

223
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,460
Sorry that I...

224
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,540
No problem.

225
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,900
I'll pretend
to be your boyfriend for now.

226
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,740
This is just temporary.

227
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Don't take it seriously.

228
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,740
Thanks.

229
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,500
Bye.

230
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Now that you're in my car,

231
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,740
you think I'll just

232
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,540
let you go?

233
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,980
You're a respectable person.

234
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,620
Quit joking.

235
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,020
A respectable man can also
be hiding a beast inside.

236
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,740
The more it is suppressed,

237
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,900
the wilder it gets.

238
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,740
Don't try anything,

239
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
or I'll expose you at work.

240
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,460
The passenger door is jammed.

241
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,620
You can't open it from inside.

242
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,500
The finance team

243
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,020
doesn't seem to like you.

244
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,260
Want me to help you

245
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,260
find another job?

246
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,460
No, thanks.

247
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm here to work,

248
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,340
not to socialize.

249
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
If you need anything,

250
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm here.

251
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,980
Ms. Qiao said

252
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,660
this document needs
to be delivered to Zitong by 5 PM.

253
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,020
Traffic might be bad on Friday.

254
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,500
I better go now.

255
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,860
I thought she would

256
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,340
take the sleeping pill

257
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
and miss the delivery.

258
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,460
But she left so early.

259
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
What if she falls asleep while driving?

260
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,620
What's wrong?

261
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,340
You look worried.

262
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,860
Wen Hao took my cup by mistake.

263
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,260
It had a sleeping pill in it,

264
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,740
and she just drove off

265
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,020
to deliver a document.

266
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
What are you doing here?

267
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,780
Wasn't I on my way

268
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,220
to deliver the document?

269
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,980
It's already delivered.

270
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,660
You drank Xu Xiaoqi's water
with a sleeping pill.

271
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,860
You almost had an accident,

272
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,340
but I got there in time.

273
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,100
Thanks.

274
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,220
It's my luck

275
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,140
that you were there.

276
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,260
That's not luck.

277
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,580
I've been watching over you.

278
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,860
When you remember me, I...

279
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm not the person you knew.

280
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,660
Okay.

281
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,860
Call it my obsession.

282
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,660
But do let me know

283
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,140
when you remember me.

284
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,460
Hello, Mr. Ling.

285
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,620
Now?

286
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,580
But I...

287
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,340
Is it urgent?

288
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,980
Thanks for today.

289
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,740
Isn't this where
Ling Yuan sometimes stays?

290
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,580
Inviting her here

291
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,340
can't be for work.

292
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,620
Not like me,

293
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,380
I've lost contact with my girlfriend
for six months.

294
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,860
Is his missing girlfriend...?

295
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,220
This hotel...

296
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,140
