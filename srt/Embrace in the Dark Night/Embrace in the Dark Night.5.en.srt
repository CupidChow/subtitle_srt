192
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,980
Are you sure Wen Hao lost her memory?

193
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Six months ago,

194
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,380
she stole our top-secret information.

195
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,140
Huimei checked her report

196
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,660
and did a psychological evaluation.

197
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,860
She doesn't

198
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,740
seem to be faking it.

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Still, she's a ticking time bomb.

200
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,740
If she remembers,

201
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,860
we'll be done for.

202
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,620
Don't worry.

203
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,260
I have it all under control.

204
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,380
I have the right person

205
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,020
to deal with her.

206
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,140
