00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,020
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,720
I've thought about it.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
My answer is still the same.
Get rid of Wen Xi.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,440
If you agree,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,640
I might give you a chance to meet me.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,320
Let's meet tomorrow.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,740
[Wen Hao: Let's meet tomorrow.]

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,560
[Ling Yuan]
Okay.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,320
You are here.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,520
You almost made me doubt

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,240
whether the person
I saw last night was V.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
Still keeping up the act?

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,560
Aren't you tired?

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,480
Not at all.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm having fun.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,040
Or do you think

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
this suits my current role?

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,040
This is how you
tricked my sister, right?

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,000
We were in love.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
There was no deception.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,640
It's just us here now.

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Who are you trying to fool?

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,120
Fool?

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Aren't you

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,920
the one

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,200
pretending to be Wen Hao?

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,120
Fine.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
I won't expose you for now.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
After all, you are Wen Hao's sister.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
So, whatever your hidden reasons

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
or goals are,

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,280
I'll forgive

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
and protect you.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,280
Next time we meet,

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,760
there's no need to bring a recorder.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
No need to be so guarded.

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,560
Hope you can always

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,640
stay this calm and composed.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
Don't let me catch you slipping.

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,040
Oh, by the way,

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
you haven't told Xu Zheqing, right?

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,000
Tell him what?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Do me a favor.

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,680
Don't tell him I'm V.

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
Aren't you guys on the same team?

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Yes,

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
but not entirely.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
I've kept him at arm's length,

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,440
not letting him near G.E.'s core.

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Is he not qualified

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,240
to do dirty work for you?

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,000
You justice warriors have such clear,

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,160
naive eyes.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,280
Foolish.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
When I first met Xu Zheqing,

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
he was just like you.

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,080
In his eyes,

59
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
I was an innocent little brother

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
who needed protection.

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
To be honest,

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,120
I quite liked

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,400
that version of myself in his eyes.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,840
So, when he accepted

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
V's irresistible offer,

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
I felt a bit sad.

67
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
He lost the foolishness.

68
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
But you missed his innocence.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,400
Making a pure person dirty

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,160
gives me a greater sense
of accomplishment.

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
What can I do?

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
I won't let you ruin him.

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,120
I always thought

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Xu Zheqing's infatuation was one-sided.

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,440
Turns out you both are into each other.

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
Even if he betrays you,

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
you won't abandon him, right?

78
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,080
Fine.

79
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,240
I was considering

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
how to persuade you not to tell him.

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Now, it's simple.

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
If you blab,

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,560
I won't hesitate
to involve him in dirty work.

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
Like, say,

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
killing someone.

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Lunatic.

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Don't film me.

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
I look awful right now.

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,280
You are so annoying.

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,920
Don't film me.

91
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,000
I look awful right now.

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,120
Let's interview Ms. Wen.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,160
Why are you crying over a TV show?

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,040
Don't you think
the villains in dramas are terrible?

95
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
Destroying families for profit.

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
If I were the protagonist,

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,920
I'd destroy him

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
at all costs.

99
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,680
You didn't destroy me.

100
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,720
If you do that,

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,160
I'll make sure

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,160
you never find me.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm mad now.

104
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,240
I bought dinner.

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,920
Get up.

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,600
The floor is cold.

107
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,160
What's wrong?

108
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm lucky to have met you.

109
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm so lucky.

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Not luck.

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,280
I've been watching over you.

112
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
I keep my promises.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,360
Only once,

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,160
I didn't.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,720
Making a pure person dirty

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,680
gives me a greater sense
of accomplishment.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,160
People in different camps,

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
no matter how deep the feelings,

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,280
will drift further apart.

120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,920
Right?

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,800
What's wrong?

122
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,920
Stand by me,

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,240
okay?

124
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Okay.

125
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
My face is covered with snot and tears.

126
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,840
[Get rid of Wen Xi]
I won't let anyone

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,360
[Get rid of Wen Xi]
hurt Wen Xi.

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
I took a few days off.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
After breakfast,

130
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll take you on a vacation

131
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,520
to relax.

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,520
Rest here.

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
I'll check us in.

134
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,200
Alright.

135
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
Don't be upset.

136
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,640
You guys are here, too?

137
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,360
What a coincidence.

138
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,360
What's going on

139
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,480
with you two?

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,640
Don't mind him.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
He's sulking

142
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,240
over me helping you last time.

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,240
What's up?

144
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,520
Give me your phone.

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,260
[Ren]

146
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,860
[Fei]

147
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
Your phone is not broken.

148
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Why haven't I received your apology?

149
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,640
I never apologize to men.

150
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,640
Looks like

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
you're not coming

152
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
on our planned vacation.

153
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,000
So smug before,

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,240
but still came along.

155
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,120
Last time was my fault.

156
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,600
I just want an apology.

157
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
I wanted Qiao Fei to apologize.

159
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,880
You guys are vacationing, too?

160
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
This hotel has a tennis court.

161
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
Since we're here to relax,

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,640
let's check it out.

163
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
Sure.

164
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,840
You're on my team.

165
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,720
Well,

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
how about we bet?

167
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
Losers agree to one condition

168
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
from the winners.

169
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,840
Deal.

170
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,360
No problem.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
Later, just be easy on Ren

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
and let him win.

173
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,080
Then ask Qiao Fei to apologize to him.

174
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,880
Again.

175
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,880
Mr. Xu,

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
do you know how to play?

177
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,080
Now, I do.

178
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Just warming up.

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,600
One more point and we win.

180
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,320
Come on.

181
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
What's going on?

182
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Weren't you supposed to go easy?

183
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,720
Boss,

184
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
did I do something wrong?

185
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,600
No.

186
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,360
Just not great

187
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
at ball control yet.

188
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
You lost.

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,720
Is this how you solve my problems?

190
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,520
A bet's a bet.

191
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Last time's issue

192
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,480
is settled.

193
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,360
No.

194
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,120
I still need an apology.

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,880
And...

196
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,320
You look so cute when you're mad.

197
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,440
What's the matter with you?

198
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,240
You switched sides last minute.

When I get jealous,

200
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,760
even I get scared of myself.

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,360
Childish.

202
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,440
Fine.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
After a whole afternoon of tennis,

204
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm exhausted.

205
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
No excuses

206
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,200
to dodge the punishment.

207
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,960
What punishment?

208
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
You know what I want.
