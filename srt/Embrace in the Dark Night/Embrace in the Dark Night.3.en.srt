00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,910
You want me to train with you?

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
I'll show you a few moves.

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,020
Get down.

6
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,500
If I come down, you'll just trip me.

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,430
Looks like Zheqing and his girl
are showing off again.

8
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,110
You're the best looking.

9
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,240
Daddy,

10
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,890
let him be my bodyguard.

11
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,270
Zheqing,

12
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
this is my daughter Jia Ni.

13
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,680
Keep her safe.

14
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,470
No problem.

15
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
If you don't mind her

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,600
being around.

17
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,940
Why don't you

18
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,100
help me pick?

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,580
Sure.

20
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,400
Take your time.

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,060
Miss.

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,610
This dress would look great on you.

23
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,830
Want to try it on?

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I...

25
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,720
This is my assistant, Ren.

26
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
He's here to help you escape.

27
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,160
Go.

28
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,330
What about you?

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,600
Just go.

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
We'll go together.

31
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,570
I'll distract Jia Ni

32
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,890
to buy you more time.

33
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,890
Trust me.

34
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,550
Go.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
This dress suits you better.

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,080
Where's your girl?

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,480
You took her money

38
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,810
and let her go.

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Am I right?

40
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,350
My dad's coming.

41
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,510
You should

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,570
try to please me

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,450
if you

44
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,490
want to live.

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,940
Deal?

46
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,600
Boss,

47
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,040
the girl escaped.

48
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,310
If Xu Zheqing messes with me,

49
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,530
take him out.

50
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,580
Your taste is spot on.

51
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,390
So,

52
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,770
to be my man, what do you think?

53
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,770
I told you,

54
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,440
I'm really

55
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,950
not interested.

56
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,940
Zheqing,

57
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,220
where's your girl?

58
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,090
Do I

59
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,430
look good?

60
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,650
They're really bold.

61
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,740
Is he really that into her?

62
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,430
No need to spy on him anymore.

63
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,690
To be safe,

64
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,510
wouldn't it be better

65
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,320
if he became

66
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,560
your son-in-law?

67
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,430
Do you really like that guy?

68
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,520
I...

69
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,160
Why did you come back?

70
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,630
I couldn't leave you behind.

71
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,290
You...

72
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Are you

73
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,160
catching feelings for me?

74
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,860
Don't flatter yourself.

75
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,330
In the future,

76
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,490
stop being such a fool.

77
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,860
Hey!

78
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,300
Hurry up.

79
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,970
We have a party tonight.

80
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,400
The guys are waiting.

81
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,470
Zheqing,

82
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,560
Jiang,

83
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,090
you two have a drink.

84
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,270
From now on,

85
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,610
you're brothers working together.

86
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,940
This one's for you.

87
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,810
Cheers,

88
