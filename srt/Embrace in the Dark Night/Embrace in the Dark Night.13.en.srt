How'd it end up with you?

195
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Thanks for not handing me over

196
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,520
to security last night.

197
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
It would've been hard to explain.

198
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,440
I wanted to thank you

199
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
but didn't know what you like,

200
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,600
so I bought everything

201
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,640
I could think of.

202
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
Silly.

203
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
You helped me, too.

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
You blush so easily.

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,760
Your girlfriend

206
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,960
never teased you about it?

207
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
I don't have a girlfriend.

208
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,120
Fei,

209
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,880
I don't know how to date.

210
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,000
Maybe,

211
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
you could

212
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,720
teach me

213
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
as thanks?

214
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,600
Your phone.

215
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,720
I'll text you

216
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,480
the time and place.

217
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
Our company has been
having big problems lately.

218
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
The good thing is,

219
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Chairman Ling is coming back.

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
[Monitoring]

221
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,840
With him here,

222
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,480
everything will be sorted out.

223
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,360
And the files

224
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,240
from 2018 to 2021

225
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,720
are piling up like garbage.

226
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,600
When you clean them up on Friday,

227
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
move them to the storage.

228
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,120
