Is this really a good idea?

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,250
Spending the night at Kurosawa's place.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,290
What should I do?

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,700
I suddenly feel scared once we arrived at his door.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,640
After accidentally reading his mind...

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,640
Is it good to be so lucky in the early morning?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,920
My heart is beating so fast!

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,190
And saw that kind of stuff...

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,190
What does Kurosawa want from me?

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,310
Wait! Is he going to assault me?

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,340
No, no, no, not like that.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,270
It's so rude to think of him like this.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,290
Adachi?

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,520
Welcome.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,190
It's a bit messy though.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,840
Dazzling!

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,090
What's in his mind exactly?

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,240
But, I can still read his mind.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,380
I'll get through this.

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,200
Adachi?

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,490

It's not messed at all.

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,600
The interior design is so aligned!

39
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,940
Indirect lighting!

40
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,840
And, uh, plants!

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,390
What's going on with this room,
feels like he's a popular man!

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,140
Eh?

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,020
Ah, sorry. I'll tidy them up.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,090
I enjoyed them a lot yesterday.

45
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,490
Me too.

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,740
I mean, both of them.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,830
Really?

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,460
That limited snack, I'll buy two when they're out.

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,490
I also like "Ragna Crimson". It's full of passion.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,440
Exactly!

51
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,140
It's action scene and mind battle are so intriguing.

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,460
Plus Crimson's evil personality...

53
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,690
Is just right.

54
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,460
I see.

55
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,340
You are also a fan of Ragna?

56
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,990
I'm quite surprised.

57
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,540
What?

58
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,480
Ah, nothing.

59
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,920
Surprised that I share the same interests
with this popular guy.

60
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,460
I thought we have zero in common at first.

61
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,210
The bath is ready.

62
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,220
You can take the bath first.

63
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,620
Here, you can wear these.

64
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,510
What, what are these.

65
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,820
The textile feels great.

66
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,610
I feel that too.

67
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,490
Will this be too much for me?

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,220
Bought it for thinking it matches him,

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
didn't expect to see him wearing it in real life.

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,790
It's too good to be true...

71
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,760
I, I don't want to wear it...

72
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,390
God, why he knows my size so well.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,990
I mean, thanks for letting me take the bath first.

74
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,340
Kurosawa?

75
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,820
Sure, now it's my turn.

76
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,840
Take your time.

77
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,820
Completely have no idea
what to do after reading his mind!

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,700
True, I won't remain virginity for 30 years
if I knew that.

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,790
Now things come to this, the only way is...

80
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,790
Already asleep?

81
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,060
Sorry. I faked that.

82
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,860
You must be tired.

83
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,420
Wait. Wait. What.

84
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,600
Why are you coming this way?!

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,170
Too close!

86
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,640
No, no, no, no, no!

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,690
What a thrill.

88
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,120
Sorry for thinking
you're going to assault me, Kurosawa!

89
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,010
Though, Why is my heart beating so fast?

90
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,800
If I keep thinking these, then...

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,260
I cannot sleep.

92
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,020
His sleeping face was too much for me.

93
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,720
What smells so good.

94
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,300
Energetic morning person.

95
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,770
Morning.

96
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,190
M... morning.

97
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
Did you sleep well?

98
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,760
Yeah, sure.

99
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,540
This mat is five-time better than mine.

100
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Five times? Really?

101
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,320
Do you eat breakfast?

102
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:22,910
Yes.

103
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,690
Want your omelette sweet or salty?

104
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,860
...Sweet.

105
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,610
Will do.

106
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,320
Tastes great!

107
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,520
Like those people have in fancy hotels!

108
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,990
You're exaggerating.

109
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,890
Here, gimme your bowl.

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,410
Thanks.

111
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,610
Seems like Adachi favors Japanese style food.

112
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,970
Just matches my research.

113
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,400
What research?

114
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,360
I'm glad you like this meal.

115
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,400
It's stunning you have such a complicated breakfast.

116
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,170
I'll just have those convenience store stuff for meals.

117
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,590
How about you come and eat
at my place from today?

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,410
No, I mean, it's not...polite.

119
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,470
Just a joke.

120
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,520
You just take everything for true.

121
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,290
It's hot!

122
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,040
Take your time.

123
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm done. I'm thinking too much to act normal.

124
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,120
Now that it has come to this,

125
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,560
(Keep Loving Under May's Thunderstorm)
Now that it has come to this,

126
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,960
(Keep Loving Under May's Thunderstorm)

127
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,530
(Keep Loving Under May's Thunderstorm)
I have to consult him!

128
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,790
I have to consult him!

129
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,540
To sum up,

130
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,560
Cause you remained a virgin till 30,

131
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,310
you became a mind-reading wizard.

132
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,660
Then accidentally knew your male coworker
had feelings for you.

133
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,520
Is your job that exhausting?

134
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,110
What?

135
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,160
If you need a shrink, just tell me.

136
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,820
It's not like that,
stressed out and having mental problem stuff.

137
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,090
Having the ability to read people's minds, right?

138
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,430
I know you don't buy it.

139
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,090
But I'm really confused right now

140
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,400
Also this morning...

141
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,930
Let me adjust your tie.

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,820
Adachi, slept like an angel yesterday.

143
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,060
I should've taken a photo.

144
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,740
Wait. It's not so right in doing that.

145
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,470
I'll return this to you once I washed it.

146
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,090
Come on, no worries.

147
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,560
It's a pity to wash off!

148
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,440
Pity?!

149
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,600
You're always welcome to stay overnight at my place.

150
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,200
Things like this keep coming to me.

151
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,170
I don't know how to face him.

152
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,960
Calm down.

153
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,260
Let's suppose what you said is true.

154
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,200
But why you came to me?

155
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,860
That's because
Tsuge is experienced in love topics?

156
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm not that experienced...

157
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,110
You have to be,
for publishing that much of romance novels.

158
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,090
Like ''Keep Loving Under May's Thunderstorm''

159
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,230
''The Blue Room of Separation'',
I cried a lot reading them

160
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,090
Stop calling these titles in public.

161
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
Please! Tell me what should I do now.

162
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,590
I don't know either.

163
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,490
You are the only one on my list, please

164
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,240
Just tell me what's the right move.

165
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,460
Well, do nothing for now?

166
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,990
What?!

167
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,510
I don't know your worries exactly.

168
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,440
But you should figure out your feelings about him,

169
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,200
and how do you picture this relationship first.

170
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,060
I see.

171
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,090
My feelings.

172
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,010
Though, my advice is,

173
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,610
don't be dazzled by love.

174
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,010
If you feel lonely, keep a cat.

175
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,190
How's Udon?

176
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,420
Want to see some pictures?

177
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,410
Grows so fast.

178
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,090
I acted like I know about relationships.

179
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,440
I never thought
that virgin Adachi come for love consulting.

180
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,040
I'm also a virgin, though.

181
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,890
What???

182
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,460
You? Still a virgin?

183
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,540
What's wrong?

184
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,740
I went to him for advice.

185
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,690
But results in knowing his big secret.

186
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,010
If it's Fujisaki who has feelings for me,

187
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,930
maybe I won't be worrying like this.

188
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,660
No, I'll still have tons of worries.

189
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,540
For I know nothing about love.

190
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,160
Adachi.

191
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,460
About the data you sorted for me.

192
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,540
Is there a problem?

193
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,210
Nothing to worry about, but still...

194
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,540
Did you sort them by yourself?

195
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,490
Actually, I had Kurosawa's help.

196
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,260
I thought so, I knew it.

197
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,690
It was too good to be your work.

198
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,690
Here, Kurosawa, come here.

199
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,240
Please, don't call him here yet.

200
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,310
I haven't got my answer.

201
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,760
Seems like you helped our Adachi a lot.

202
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,690
Those datas went through your hands
got flying colors.

203
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,290
Mr. Kurosawa, you helped them with that?

204
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,960
You're already a busy man.

205
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,520
I didn't do much of the work.

206
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,930
Adachi, did you say thanks to him?

207
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,060
Well, I...

208
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,840
You can ask him for buying you a meal.

209
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,190
Don't give him ideas!

210
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,370
I really just did a tiny work.

211
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Right?

212
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,220
But to be honest, you helped me a lot.

213
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,160
You see? He's just so unreliable at work.

214
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,200
Looking forward to your work on Asukita corp's files.

215
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,510
I'll try my best.

216
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,110
I,

217
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,390
trust in his competence in the workplace.

218
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,090
You do?

219
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,360
Adachi will finish every work with his full heart.

220
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,290
I, I see.

221
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,710
As his leader,
aren't you the one who knows him best?

222
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,490
So, if you want to show your gratitude,

223
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,890
show it to Adachi.

224
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,740
I should get going.

225
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,090
Sure, goodbye.

226
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,600
-Bye.
-Bye.

227
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,060
Mr. Kurosawa, that was so cool.

228
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,790
That's nothing.

229
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,090
Please help me like that sometimes.

230
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,290
Such a nice colleague.

231
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,660
True, he's really a nice person.

232
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,890
Brilliant in work, great personality.

233
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,770
Makes people happy just chatting with him.

234
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,440
That's without argument.

235
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,840
Still.

236
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
That's also the reason

237
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,410
that I don't know what I should do.

238
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,510
Should I just, as Tsuge said do nothing?

239
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,590
After all, he didn't reveal his feelings to me.

240
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,690
I should pretend to be totally ignorant
about the whole thing.

241
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,610
He is just a colleague
who shares the same interest with me.

242
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,740
Yeah, maybe that's the better way.

243
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Hi.

244
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,370
Still up to work?

245
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,810
Nope, I'm wrapping things up and heading home.

246
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,470
I see.

247
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,790
I hope he didn't buy those buying meal stuff.

248
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,190
Maybe I should at least say thanks.

249
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,710
Here.

250
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
What?

251
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,860
You are responsible for the Asukita files, right?

252
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,410
These are the files I have.

253
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,520
You can have them.

254
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,640
For me?

255
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,770
Of course.

256
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,460
I should help you since we're colleagues.

257
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,920
Colleagues?

258
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,310
Yeah.

259
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
Sure, of course.

260
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,790
We are nothing but colleagues.

261
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,910
Since he said so,

262
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,510
that will do for me.

263
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,490
Sorry.

264
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,890
Easy.

265
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,240
I added page numbers on them.

266
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,360
Just hold that.

267
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,940
OK.

268
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,090
He took the files!

269
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,820
So glad I could help him.

270
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,400
I should have helped him more.

271
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,170
In any form,

272
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,090
I just want to see him,

273
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,820
to hear his voice,

274
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,760
further, to see his smile.

275
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,820
But that's it.

276
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,090
Anything else would be asking too much of him.

277
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,990
As long as I can be there for him,

278
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,360
I don't mind if we can only be coworkers.

279
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,490
Finish.

280
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,990
Kurosawa.

281
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,200
What's wrong?

282
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,190
Kurosawa.

283
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,890
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,400
You don't have to be sorry like this.

285
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,970
Here.

286
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,260
So, see you tomorrow.

287
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,420
I am the worst.

288
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,620
Do nothing?

289
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,570
I was tuned in to my own needs
and didn't care about his feelings.

290
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:22,890
Kurosawa is always so nice to me,
and thinking for me.

291
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,920
He's serious

292
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,290
about me.

293
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,740
As long as I can be there for him,

294
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,690
I don't mind if we can only be coworkers.

295
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,860
He even said things like that.

296
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,490
But I keep ignoring his emotions.

297
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,490
Do nothing about this?

298
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,760
I just can't.

299
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,040
Adachi?

300
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,260
Do you...

301
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,440
Sure.

302
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,590
Wanna grab something to eat with me?

303
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,810

I'm so happy, am I in heaven?

316
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,570
(Preview)
What?

317
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,840
(Tsuge's first crush)
I'm so happy you're being loved meow.

318
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,320
(Tsuge's first crush)
Awww.

319
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,380
Number 3 and 6. You have to kiss!

320
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,770
This will be my first kiss.

321
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,490
(Adachi and Kurosawa's fast-tracking intimacy?)
This will be my first kiss.

322
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,570
(Adachi and Kurosawa's fast-tracking intimacy?)
Sorry that I fell for you.

323
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,420
(Adachi and Kurosawa's fast-tracking intimacy?)
