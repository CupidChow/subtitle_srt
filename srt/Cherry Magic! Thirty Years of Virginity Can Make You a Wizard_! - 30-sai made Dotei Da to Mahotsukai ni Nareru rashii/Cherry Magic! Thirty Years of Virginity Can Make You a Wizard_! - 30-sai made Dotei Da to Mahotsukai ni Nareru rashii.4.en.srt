I didn't hate,

=Episode 4=

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,050
your kiss.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,470
Do you understand

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,700
what does that mean?

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,650
What?

8
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,820
Ah. Excuse me.

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,250
Hello. Tsuge?

10
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,200
What happened?

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,670
My world has been upside down.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,750
What?

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,320
In fact, just now...

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,620
Uh.

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,770
T... Tsuge?

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,870
Sorry that I doubted you.

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,470
Whaaat?

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,970
Finished?

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,900
Ah, there you are!

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,300
Momose said that we could change the place now.

21
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,900
Right. Adachi, this is medicine for the stomach.

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,700
Ah. Thanks.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,500
We should go back.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,320
Right.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,000
Good. Let's go to the afterparty!

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,050
Maybe I was way too excited.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,420
Ah.

28
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,250
Thanks for the water.

29
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,970
Then, the next time, gently, carefully,

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,300
Even for a bit, want you to have feelings for me.

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,620
Good Morning!

32
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,500
Since he said "next time gently",

33
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,450
it's been two weeks.

34
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,600
I tried my best not to be alone with him

35
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,950
for two weeks.

36
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,970
To be honest, it makes me so nervous,

37
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,950
that he tries to further our relationship.

38
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you know

39
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,670
what does that mean?

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,700
No,

41
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,070
I could not understand it at all!

42
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,450
It felt like he became so serious all of a sudden,

43
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,520
and tried to break into my heart.

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,820
At that time, if no one came to stop us.

45
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,020
We would...

46
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,800
I have to calm down.

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,550
OK, let me sort it out.

48
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,550
I've been able to read people's minds
since I turned 30.

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,100
Fine, I've already accepted this.

50
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,170
How-e-ver!

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,600
This guy is actually a good person.

52
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,370
I'm so happy you're being loved meow.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Awww.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,890
What do you mean by Awww? Awww??

55
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,930
He's also a man, and,

56
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,930
he's that kind of shallow party animal
which I hate most!

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Need to talk with Adachi.

58
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, I can't!

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,350
He must've found out when I called him yesterday.

60
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,920
If I tell him the truth now...

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
In fact...

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,720
Huh? You are a virgin, too?

63
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,270
You did pretend to be a love master, didn't you?

64
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,450
If he thinks me like that.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,370
I, I, I can not!

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,450
I don't need this magic power at all!

67
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,120
Not at all!

Rokkaku?

83
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,020
Are you ready?

84
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,950
Please give me a second.

85
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,550
-Let's go.
-OK.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,370
Goodbye.

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,300
Eh?

88
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,100
What are you doing?

89
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,500
Stomachache?

90
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,620
I am ashamed.

91
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,800
Are you cold? How about some hot drinks?

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,120
I wanted to know more about him.

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,350
But I ran away again.

94
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,100
Huh.

95
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,270
What a coincidence.

96
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,600
Right.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,550
What happened to you?

98
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,070
Not a big deal, though.

99
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,020
My mom is coming to my place
from the countryside.

100
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,420
Eh?

101
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,250
I am a little worried about that.

102
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,650
Okay...

103
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,380
A little surprised.

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,450
Fujisaki looks like a family girl.

105
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,200
I just assumed
that she kept a good relationship with her family.

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,700
Sorry, difficult to respond, right?

107
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,870
Ah. It's fine.

108
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,320
I totally understand that.

109
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,050
I know they are worried about me,
but really annoying.

110
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,520
Yes.

111
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,570
Do you have a boyfriend?
Why don't you get married?

112
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,150
Even ask me to have a baby in the end.

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Exactly.

114
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,550
Aaah. Too difficult.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,390
I have no idea how to respond to a topic like that.

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,020
My families are also living in the countryside.

117
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,400
May they'll make me go on a blind date someday.

118
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,350
I've already experienced that.

119
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,950
Wow. Really?

120
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,820
Why not take a fake boyfriend
to get your family off your back?

121
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,800
Right. Adachi.

122
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,370
You can be her fake boyfriend.

123
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,020
I don't think so...

124
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,860
Then your mother will be satisfied.

125
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,320
Yea. Definitely.

126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,120
And it's not bad
if he really becomes your boyfriend, right?

127
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,070
Eh, but...

128
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,970
What do you think? Isn't it a good idea?

129
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay. If one day I have to do that,

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,550
maybe I will ask you for the favor.

131
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,650
What?

132
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,970
That's right.

133
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Fujisaki and Adachi.

134
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,970
Can you run some errands for me later?

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,700
Yes. Got it.

136
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,250
Thanks.

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,970
What was that?

138
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,400
Whaaat?

139
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,200
Awwww.

140
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,220
Which one?

141
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,150
It must be me who misunderstood

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,750
the things she just said.

143
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,850
I'll have this one, please.

144
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,420
OK. It's 1500 yen.

145
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,650
-This is 500 yen.
-Thank you.

146
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,500
Please wait for a moment.

147
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,400
Adachi, sorry.

148
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,250
Eh?

149
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,750
I won't ask you to pretend to be my boyfriend.

150
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,750
Ah. Never mind.

151
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,120
It was so close.

152
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,220
Good that I didn't misunderstand.

153
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,220
Did it make you feel uncomfortable?

154
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,650
No.

155
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,270
I just thought
that everyone liked to talk about relationships.

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,920
It's not the whole part of our lives,

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,350
or I can say,

158
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,850
though I am single, I can still enjoy my life.

159
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,120
I see.

160
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,000
Thanks for your waiting.

161
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,620
Thank you.

162
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,420
You can give that to me.

163
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,290
Really? Thanks.

164
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,550
I like Adachi, really.

165
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
What?

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,550
She just said like me?

167
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,550
OK. That's all. Let's go.

168
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,150
OK.

169
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,650
Am I this popular recently?

170
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,070
That Fujisaki,

171
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,400
likes me?

172
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,720
Honestly, I feel so happy.

173
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,300
But, wait.

174
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,900
It's a little different than I expected.

175
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,350
Being liked by a cute girl like her,

176
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,520
shouldn't I be, like, more excited...?

177
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,750
Ouch!

178
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,300
Oh, pretty girl.

179
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,320
Girl, you bumped into my shoulder
and it's a little hurt.

180
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Ew, indecent.

181
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,150
Just a glance tells you they are rogues.

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,950
I'm sorry, are you alright?

183
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,650
Nah, no, no, no.

184
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,670
Is this the right way to apologize?

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,020
I can't. So scaring.

186
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,920
But...

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,770
Just be a good girl and hang out with us, OK?

188
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,550
Come on, come on.

189
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,520
Wait, wait a minute!

190
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,770
She said sorry, didn't she?

191
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,200
Adachi.

192
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,050
Huh? Who are you?

193
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,150
She, she might be careless.

194
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,490
But, it was you guys who bumped into her first...

195
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,560
What? Did you mean we should apologize?

196
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,520
Adachi, are you okay?

197
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,470
I was not supposed to push myself too hard.

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,570
I mean,

199
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,220
wrong on both sides...

200
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,070
Huh?

201
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,270
No...

202
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,720
Huh? Both sides? What the...

203
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,750
Excuse me.

204
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,150
Don't touch him!

205
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,150
Oooouch!

206
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,850
Did my coworker make any trouble for you?

207
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,320
Come on, let's go!

208
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,230
Are you OK?

209
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,420
It's lucky that they left.

210
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,220
Sorry, I caused you trouble.

211
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,550
It's not your fault.

212
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
Just an unexpected disaster.

213
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,090
Adachi, are you okay?

214
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,550
Yes.

215
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,350
Your hair is a mess.

216
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,320
It's so great that you are safe.

217
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,950
If anything happens to you,

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,400
I...

219
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,420
Were you going back to the office?

220
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,720
Let's go.

221
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,620
Let me help you.

222
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,850
Thank you.

223
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,360
It's the moment

224
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,750
that makes me notice the gap between us.

225
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,270
I was trying to help,

226
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,270
but messed up in the end.

227
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,820
While Kurosawa takes action quickly,

228
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,300
and succeeds in everything.

229
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,350
How can I say.

230
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,620
We are totally different.

231
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,100
That's the reason I always feel scared.

232
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,300
If I know him more,
I will be more disappointed with myself.

233
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,900
Because Kurosawa,

234
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,020
is so different from me.

235
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,550
He is perfect, and has a lot of things,

236
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,000
which I never had.

237
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,600
Like him, really.

238
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,420
Aaaah! I forgot about this problem!

239
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,720
Fujisaki, really likes me?

240
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,400
Yes, I'm sure.

241
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,000
Kurosawa likes Adachi.

242
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,670
Em? Eh?

243
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,320
Fujisaki noticed Kurosawa's feelings for me?

244
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,620
I hope Adachi can be happy.

245
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,900
Even if it's Kurosawa,

246
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,970
he can choose either be with him or not.

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,670
Em? What does that mean...

248
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,450
I like Adachi.

249
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,670
I like the way he said

250
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,850
relationships are not the whole part of our lives.

251
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,620
If I tell him
that I have no interest in the relationships,

252
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,970
he will simply say, oh.

253
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,250
And won't be shocked at all. I think.

254
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,300
Ah. Anyway, I don't care about what others think.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,560
After all, I'm always pretending
to like everyone else.

256
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,770
Good afternoon.

257
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,500
Fujisaki.

258
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,320
Always smiling, being considerate.

259
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,850
I just thought she was so smart.

260
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,550
But,

261
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,620
maybe her smile is just a shell to protect herself.

262
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,370
It took so long.
Mr. Miube might be upset.

263
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,620
It seems like,

264
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,570
I can do nothing to help her.

265
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,000
Ouch!

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,780
What's wrong?

267
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,700
No...

268
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,850
Adachi, your hand.

269
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,400
Eh?

270
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,200
There's no need to...

271
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,320
No, must disinfect it.

272
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,350
Thanks.

273
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,970
For all the things.

274
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,850
(First-aid kit)

275
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,750
It's fine. Give me your hand.

276
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,200
His smile and tenderness are so perfect

277
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,970
that makes me a little upset.

278
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,520
If I were him,
I would never be disappointed in myself.

279
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,850
I messed up.

280
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,850
What?

281
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,820
He must think I'm annoying.

282
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,400
Force him to get disinfected.

283
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,900
And tried to play the hero.

284
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,170
But my body went faster than my mind.

285
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,620
I just couldn't keep calm when it's about Adachi.

286
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,620
But, it's better to do something I can,

287
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,500
than doing nothing.

288
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,300
Will he be attracted by a man like me?

289
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,950
Then it's done.

290
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,520
I gotta go.

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,100
Kurosawa.

292
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,320
Thank you.

293
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,900
I really appreciate it.

294
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,900
The treatment,

295
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,600
and that thing happened earlier.

296
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,370
Not a big deal.

297
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,150
I just thought he was so perfect,

298
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,200
it turned out that he worried and got upset,

299
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,000
just like me.

300
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,450
Which means, maybe I can do something, too.

301
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,770
Adachi, how is your hand?

302
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,020
It's fine.

303
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,000
Good.

304
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,470
Fujisaki.

305
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,050
Um?

306
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,900
I'd like

307
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,070
to meet with

308
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,720
your mother.

309
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,200
I said you don't have to pretend to be my boyfriend.

310
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,670
That's not what I mean.

311
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,850
I've seen you working so hard,

312
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,600
and being so happy everyday, so don't worry.

313
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,100
That's what I want to tell your mother.

314
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,450
Ah, sorry. I'm talking nonsense.

315
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,590
Ouch.

316
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,320
Nope.

317
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,520
Thank you.

318
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,920
Maybe I will ask you to do that someday.

319
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,520
Mr. Miube assigned another task,

320
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,900
could you help me?

321
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,190
Of course. Anything.

322
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,950
Really?

323
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Yes.

324
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,170
Then can I ask you to do everything?

326
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,500
(1500 Pieces of Advice about Love)
I still think

327
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,120
I don't need this magic power.

328
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,840
But,

329
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,750
every time I touched someone,

330
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,600
I wanted to give consideration
to that person's feelings.

331
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,550
It's might be a good chance

332
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,920
to let myself take a step forward.

333
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,650
What happened?

334
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,950
It looks like Kurosawa messed something up.

335
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,200
What?

336
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,850
I am so sorry.

337
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,770
Sorry.

338
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,820
Oh, no.

339
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,700
He was such a gentle person.

340
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,100
It's my first time to see him so angry.
