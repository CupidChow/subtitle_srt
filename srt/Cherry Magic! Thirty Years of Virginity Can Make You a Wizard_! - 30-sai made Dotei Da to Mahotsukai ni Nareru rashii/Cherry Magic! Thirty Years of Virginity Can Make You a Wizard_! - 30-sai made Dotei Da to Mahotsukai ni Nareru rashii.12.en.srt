=Final Episode=

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,570
My routine

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,950
has completely gone back to
what it used to be.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,520
Doing the same things

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,700
each and every day.

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,500
Should we

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,820
just end here?

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,490
Have barely

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,500
talked with Kurosawa after that.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,420
Let's go.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,250
Aye.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,970
-We'll head out now.
-Safe trip.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,050
-Off we go.
-Have a good one.

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,150
But it comes as no surprise.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,190
I

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,720
have hurt him so badly.

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,170
I'm sorry,

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,320
Kurosawa.

=Cherry Magic!
Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!=

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,820
Adachi.

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,200
It's about time to move on.

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,250
Ah?

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,150
Passing the preliminary round
is very impressive already.

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,960
Ah.

38
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,450
I don't care about that anymore.

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,650
Why is that?

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,100
Anyhow,

41
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,250
I'll be back to my old self.

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,750
Good work.

43
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,870
You too.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,090
Is there something wrong
between you and Kurosawa?

45
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,900
I see.

46
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,920
Eh?

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,920
Both you and Kurosawa

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,450
are very easy to read.

49
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,470
Miss Fujisaki.

50
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,300
Aye?

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,490
May I please take a little bit of your time?

52
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,370
Sure.

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,000
If it were for dinner,

54
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,370
which of these places is more suitable
for a casual conversation?

55
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,600
Ummm...

56
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,000
How about this one?

57
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,670
But, Adachi would be nervous
in any of these places, right?

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,720
Eh?

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,770
Ah?

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,770
I've got to hand it to you.

61
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,320
For a date?

62
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,720
Right.

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,400
We have decided to see fireworks on Christmas.

64
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,470
You are right.

65
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,150
Adachi indeed doesn't like this kind of places.

66
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,850
It's very thoughtful of you.

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,420
I promised him the best first date.

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,700
Must keep my word.

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,600
Aye.

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,820
I'm sorry. I'm being nosy.

71
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,120
Ah, it's nothing.

72
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,160
Recently,

73
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,120
I started study labour
and social security laws.

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,450
Eh?

75
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,820
As a matter of fact,
I've always been interested in it.

76
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,770
And lately I thought, why not give it a try?

77
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,870
Because I saw the fresh Adachi.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,850
Because of me?

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,070
Right.

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,570
Whether or not to stay with someone

81
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,400
and whether or not to be in a relationship.

82
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,970
Though any of the above is personal choices,

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,520
no matter which way you go,

84
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,100
you must like the self who made the choice.

85
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,850
Otherwise,

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,370
your answer would be unacceptable
to the other party.

87
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,100
Sorry, I'm being nosy again.

88
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,320
Not at all.

89
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,370
Thank you.

90
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,950
Aye.

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,420
Miss Fujisaki.

92
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,470
What's up?

93
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,700
Any plans for Christmas?

94
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll probably have some cakes
while watching movie.

95
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,750
Is that so?

96
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,570
I was going to watch fireworks
but the fireworks were cancelled.

97
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,000
Eh?

98
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,820
So you indeed had plans to see the fireworks, too?

99
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,750
I had requested for PTO in advance for the date

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,200
on Christmas Day.

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,700
(Christmas Fireworks Cancelled
over Safety Reasons)

102
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,050
Though I don't have a date anymore,
I didn't go to the office neither.

103
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,120
Because no matter
whether I see Kurosawa there or not,

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,970
it'd be really awkward.

105
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,000
Could it be...

106
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,600
Merry Christmas.

107
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,620
Tsuge.

108
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,520
What should we order?

109
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,300
Cake? Roasted chicken?

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,950
And they have Christmas special, too.

111
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,820
Is this okay?

112
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,620
Today is Christmas Day
and you are here dining with me.

113
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,490
Eh?

114
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,200
Are you guys still fighting?

115
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm not so stonehearted
that I'd ignore my friend in crisis.

116
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,450
I've heard it from Minato.

117
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,450
Your junior fellow is really worried about you.

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,900
He said the tension between the two seniors
is palpable.

119
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,750
Rokkaku…

120
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,020
So, what happened?

121
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,250
If I may say so

122
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,070
a lot has happened.

123
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,020
Then tell me all about it.

124
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,240
So in the end

125
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,770
without the magic power

126
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,170
I...

127
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,350
You are truly a big idiot.

128
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,070
The day before yesterday,

129
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,320
I got down on my knees to apologize
for the second time in my life.

130
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,370
Eh?

131
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,770
I'm really sorry for what happened before.

132
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,850
There it is. A kneeling apology.

133
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:03,420
Because I'm more afraid of losing you
than my pointless pride.

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,170
I'm sorry, too.

135
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,000
I laughed because I was blushing.

136
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,620
Eh?

137
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,250
Tsuge who gave me the present was adorable.

138
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,320
I was so happy,

139
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,270
thinking, I like you, a lot.

140
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,550
Even if there is no magic,

141
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,220
you'll be able to read each other's minds.

142
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,150
When there are misunderstandings,
you talk things out.

143
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,200
In this way, you get to know each other.

144
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,830
Ah.

145
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,150
But Kurosawa and I have already...

146
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,470
You should

147
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,500
read your own mind with heart.

148
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,220
Your heart has nothing to do with magic.

149
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,640
In the end,

150
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,520
it is up to you to decide what to do.

151
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,700
I will lend you my car.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,070
Go!

153
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,600
Ah, Miss Fujisaki.

154
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,970
Did Kurosawa come to work today?

155
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,600
Ah, he has the day off.

156
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,450
Is that so? Thank you.

157
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,970
Adachi?

158
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,250
Before the age of 30, I have never thought that

159
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,360
in my ordinary life,

160
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,120
I mean,

161
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,900
it's me

162
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,550
whom would be endowed with such magic.

163
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,570
Behind me, one who always wants to quail.

164
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,720
Sorry, I'm being nosy again.

165
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,150
Go!

166
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,270
I've got so many people

167
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,700
supporting and cheering for me.

168
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,900
(Building Anton)

169
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,750
(Building Anton)
The rooftop of Building Anton.

170
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,170
(Building Anton)
This is the place.

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,320
Kurosawa.

172
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,650
Kurosawa!

173
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,420
Why would he be here...

174
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,620
(Kurosawa Yuichi)

175
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,800
Adachi?

176
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,750
Kurosawa!

177
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,000
The fireworks

178
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,970
were already cancelled.

179
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,170
I knew.

180
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,150
Sorry.

181
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,230
Are you really bothered by

182
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,650
this promise?

183
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,660
Adachi.

184
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,470
-I...
-I can't take it anymore.

185
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,700
Spliting with Kurosawa

186
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,320
was my own choice.

187
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,670
And I regret it to death.

188
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,950
I know that I am

189
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,970
willful and overbearing.

190
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,740
But,

191
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,820
I really want to be with Kurosawa.

192
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,120
Even when the magic is gone,

193
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,120
when there are many misunderstandings,

194
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,290
by then,

195
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,350
I will still try my best to understand you.

196
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,920
It turns out, I really like...

197
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,190
I'm fond of you,

198
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,670
Adachi.

199
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,120
When I heard

200
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,030
your incredible story,

201
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,750
there was a reason why I took it so easily.

202
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,400
Why is that so?

203
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,470
It was because

204
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,950
you could read my mind

205
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,650
that we got together.

206
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,780
So I am grateful for this power.

207
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,470
However,

208
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,220
my love for you

209
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,400
has nothing to do with magic.

210
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,510
I can't take my eyes off you.

211
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,770
With or without magic,

212
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
Adachi is Adachi.

213
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,300
Speaking of which,

214
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,600
you've read my mind, haven't you?

215
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,120
I

216
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,850
cannot be without Adachi,

217
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,070
either.

218
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,150
Aye.

219
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,200
I thought, if by some miracle,

220
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,910
you'd show up here.

221
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,080
Then I'll give this to you.

222
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,870
This is?

223
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,610
Because

224
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,670
if these were rings,

225
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,020
you'd be too shy to wear it, wouldn't you?

226
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Please be with me

227
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,800
always and forever.

228
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,820
Yes.

229
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,250
Are those... fireworks?

230
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,020
Yea.

231
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,750
Did you arrange that?

232
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,750
No, I didn't.

233
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,600
Miss Fujisaki is so interesting.

234
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,650
All the sudden wanted to let off some fireworks.

235
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,520
You came without asking why,
aren't you also interesting?

236
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,420
Because this is a good thing.

237
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,820
Maybe those who see the fireworks
will feel a little happiness.

238
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,420
Right.

239
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,500
Okay.

240
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,270
Light it up?

241
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,250
Yes.

242
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,150
Can we?

243
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,520
Even without the magic.

244
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,420
Yes.

245
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,010
As long as you are by my side,

246
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,420
I don't need any magic.

247
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,120
Wow, so high!

248
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,020
Incredible.

249
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,350
Merry Christmas.

250
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,300
Why are you laughing?

251
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,450
Nothing. Just because...

252
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,570
Because of what?

253
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,950
Because,

254
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,000
normally people would say good morning.

255
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,420
Good morning.

256
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,450
That's it!

257
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,650
Just like that, I am no longer a wizard.

258
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,720
I became an ordinary 30 year-old man.

264
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't do that. It's embarrassing.

265
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,270
Why?

266
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,200
Now you must be thinking, you really adore me.

Correct.

268

Good for you.

Ah?

270

I can tell by the look on your face.
