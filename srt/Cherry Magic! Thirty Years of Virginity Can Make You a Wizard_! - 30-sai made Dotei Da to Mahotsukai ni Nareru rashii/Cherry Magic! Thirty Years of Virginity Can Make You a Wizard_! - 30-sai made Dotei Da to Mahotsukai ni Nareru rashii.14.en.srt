He must be

172
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,430
very mad at me now...

173
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:26,400
Right?

174
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:28,850
Udon?

175
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,800
What should I do now?

178
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,625
That's right.

179
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:10,150
It's okay to make mistakes,
but we need to talk over it.

180
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,598
Okay.

181
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,300
Ouch!

182
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:19,362
Shit!

183
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,762
Well, I guess

184
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,425
I have no choice but...

185
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:47,020
That's the last one for today...

(Tsuge Masato)

187
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:59,575
I'm really sorry about that.

188
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,975
It's fine.

189
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,225
Are you angry?

190
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,825
You didn't reply my messages...

191
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,025
I've just been busy with practice.

192
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:09,525
I see.

193
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,607
Well...

194
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,000
Online shopping is so helpful.

195
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,900
I've just run out of tissues.

196
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:35,100
I still have work to do, so...

197
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,275
Wait...wait a sec!

198
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,575
I wanna show you something.

199
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:43,125
Em?

200
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,025
I took these photos the other day.

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,475
I think they are quite good

202
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,162
so I wanna show you.

203
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,300
Nice photos, aren't they?

204
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,454
That's

205
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,625
how I look when I'm dancing.

206
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,150
You don't usually check your photos?

207
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,750
I'm just a background dancer.

208
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,550
Only those lead dancers
can have photos like these.

209
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,350
I don't know much about dance...

210
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,043
but the first time I saw your dance

211
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,157
I was so moved.

212
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,225
Your dance is awesome.

213
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,025
Did I say something wrong?

214
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,500
I've been so jealous

215
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,250
of you.

216
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,350
Eh?

217
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,062
I went

218
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,650
audition of a major company

219
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,225
and made it to the final round.

220
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,600
That's awesome!

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,875
It's not a big deal.

222
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:19,600
Many people made it to the final round.

223
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:24,375
And even if I got the offer,
I don't know if I can make my debut.

224
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,075
You've realized your dream

225
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,400
and gained recognition from other people.

226
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,625
But I...

227
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:40,900
That's why

228
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,975
you've been acting weird these days?

229
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:47,825
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:55,950
Actually...

231
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,700
there's something I didn't told you.

232
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,062
The day...

233
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,100
I went to see your practice

234
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,600
was for gathering inspirations.

235
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,275
Gather inspirations?

236
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:14,325
Yes.

237
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:18,050
I was asked if I'd like to write a sequel of

238
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,600
"The Golden Cat Dancing in the Moonlit Night".

239
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,450
And the character in the novel...

240
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,175
(Golden Cat Dancing in the Moonlit Night)

241
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:31,150
(Golden Cat Dancing in the Moonlit Night)
is based on you.

242
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,450
(Golden Cat Dancing in the Moonlit Night)

243
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,125
It took some time to find.

244
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,825
Sorry I was late.

245
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,825
Well, no. Thank you.

246
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:10,050
I'm so happy you're being loved meow.

247
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,550
Awww.

248
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:13,675
What?

249
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:19,050
I will never look down on you!

250
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,200
Never laugh at you!

251
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,875
Well, well.

252
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,825
You were, way too cool just now.

253
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,825
I am so sorry!!!

254
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,325
I

255
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,950
have feelings for you.

256
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,350
It's getting so strong that I can't help.

257
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:54,525
I like you an awful lot!!!

258
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,575
I also really like you.

259
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,550
If I hadn't watched your dance,

260
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,800
I wouldn't have been able to write that novel.

261
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,275
That is to say,

262
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,975
I won this award

263
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,000
all because of you.

264
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,900
How many people entered the final round.

265
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,725
Whether you can make your debut.

266
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,700
They don't matter at all.

267
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,850
I just

268
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,725
love your dance.

269
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,175
I will

270
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:51,950
try my best.

271
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,475
So please

272
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,025
write the best sequel.

273
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,325
I will.

274
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,700
Oh, by the way,

275
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:20,300
you look pretty great without glasses.

276
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,650
Thanks.

277
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
So, I'll see you soon, Udon.

278
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,550
I can't stand it anymore.

279
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,025
I won't let you go home today.

280
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,625
