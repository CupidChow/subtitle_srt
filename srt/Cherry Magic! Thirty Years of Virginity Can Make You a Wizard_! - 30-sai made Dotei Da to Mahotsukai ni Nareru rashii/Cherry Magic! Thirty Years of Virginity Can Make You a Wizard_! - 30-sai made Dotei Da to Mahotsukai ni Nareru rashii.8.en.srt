=Episode 8=

2
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:06,250
Adachi.

3
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:10,750
Thanks for sorting out the data.

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:12,850
Ah, yeah.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,575
Huh? What's wrong?

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:24,825
Hey!

7
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:28,200
Adachi?

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,600
Hey.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,925
It's so nerve-wracking.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,100
I want to act naturally in the office,

11
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:43,425
but I can't with all these going on.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,490
Does that mean...

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,150
I can go to your place?

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,450
Well, um, I um...kinda want to eat.

15
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:05,500
My bad. Sorry for teasing you.

16
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,225
I'm going home today.

17
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,975
-O... okay.
-Yeah.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,450
I'll lose my mind if I stay longer with you.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,900
Aaah.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,950
He also called out of blue this morning.

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,350
I thought it was a dream

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,250
that you also have feelings for me.
So I'm calling to confirm.

23
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,075
And stuffs like that!!!

24
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,900
Everything he said is making me restless.
My heart is going to burst.

25
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:52,250
Were you just thinking about me?

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,950
Ah, no. Well, um...

27
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,775
Yeah.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,050
Really? I'm over the moon.

29
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,125
What's up?

30
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, are you available tomorrow?

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes, I am?

32
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,725
Then, let's go out together.

33
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,500
What?

34
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,225
Do you have plans?

35
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,850
No, no.

36
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

37
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,850
What?

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
You should look forward to tomorrow.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will make it a perfect day.

40
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,225
Everything's so cool about him. Ah.

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,025
Is that...

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,650
the so-called date?

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,650
God, there's a lot to think about
when being in a relationship!

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,700
Kurosawa is here!

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,525
What?

46
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,575
Adachi...

47
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:20,775
Tsuge?

48
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,275
Too... too close.

49
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:26,525
I can't do this anymore.

50
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,475
Hey, what's the matter?

51
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,925
Did you get stuck writing the novel?

52
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:34,450
No, not that.

53
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:35,550
What?

54
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:42,800
Who is this smart boy?

55
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,750
Actually, I am...

56
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,600
What?

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,775
What?

58
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,500
Whaaat...

59
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,775
What? Ah, no, it's not what you think!

60
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,300

=Cherry Magic!
Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!=

75
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
Sorry for being unmannered.

76
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,225
Not at all. I'm also sorry for panicking.

77
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:24,773
Allow me to introduce Tsuge.

78
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,750
He is a friend of mine since college.

79
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
Nice to meet you.

80
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,675
Nice to meet you, too.

81
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,025
And this is Kurosawa. He is my...

82
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:38,550
M, my... what should I say?

83
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:43,925
Boy, boyfriend? But...

84
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,300
I am his colleague, Kurosawa Yuichi.
We have been quite close.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,450
He is being so thoughtful...

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,300
Kurosawa...

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,275
Ah, Kurosawa?

88
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

89
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,950
Ah, I have heard a lot about you from Adachi.

90
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,700
What did you say about me?

91
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,075
Well, all kinds of things...

92
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,750
Well, I'm going to leave you two alone.

93
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:25,650
What?

94
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:29,325
Sorry that I came without asking.

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,100
Ah, wait!

96
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,975
You came because something happened, right?

97
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:36,400
Yeah, well...

98
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:40,575
I also wanted to talk to you about the magic.

99
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,975
Sorry that I didn't take you seriously before.

100
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,350
Don't mind.

101
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,212
As you expect, I am also a vir...

102
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,221
A virgin. I knew. Sorry about that.

103
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:55,350
Whaaaat?!

104
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you two alright?

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,150
Ah, yeah. Nothing's wrong.

106
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,175
Tsuge.

107
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,025
Can I bother you for a bit?

108
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:16,900
Sure.

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,575
I got to know a young man recently.

110
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,869
Have you been a good boy, huh?

111
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:30,875
So cute!

112
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:31,800
What?

113
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,121
Ah, nothing.

114
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,325
I haven't seen you for so long.

115
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,650
Aah...maybe.

116
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,700
The contest is around the corner,
so I'm not working a lot.

117
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,450
Contest? Ah, for dancing?

118
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,550
What? Have I ever said anything about dancing?

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,575
Ah, no.

120
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,275
I happened to see you practicing.

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,425
It would be nice if you have talked to me.

122
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:01,350
Well, I didn't want to interrupt.

123
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,750
Not at all. I won't mind.

124
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,375
It would be nice
if he could come to watch more closely.

125
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,850
Then, then can I see you dance next time?

126
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:17,750
Well, of course.

127
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,850
So eventually I promised to watch him practice today.

128
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,975
Ah, I see.

129
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,800
What? Is there anything wrong with that?

130
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:36,300
We don't seem fit in a group of dancers
who practice on the street.

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,575
Just thinking about that...Aaah!

132
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:43,150
But I can't break my promise.

133
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,675
What should I do? Adachi!

134
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,700
Arghh...

135
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,425
Should we go together?

136
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:55,525
What?

137
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,575
(Adachi)
Kurosawa, I'm so sorry about this.

138
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:18,260
(Adachi)
You must have made a lot of plans for today.

139
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,900
(Kurosawa)
No need to apologize.

140
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,320
(Kurosawa)
It's enough to be by your side.

141
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,575
(Kurosawa)
Let's save the fun for later.

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
(Kurosawa)
We'll always be together from now on.

143
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:52,150
Ah, sorry.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,525
I'm alright.

145
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,950
My boyfriend.

146
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,475
What?

147
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,625
Kurosawa Yuichi.

148
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:09,425
You are just by my side.

149
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,225
My shy angel.

150
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,950
A poem?

151
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,175
This is our date,

152
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,575
can not await,

153
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,150
heartbeat at a high rate.

154
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,675
By the side of Adachi,

155
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
A happy life with me.

156
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,975
Ah, sorry. Nothing.

157
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,650
What a small world!

158
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,925
So your friend knows my buddy from the dance club?

159
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,950
Yeah, that's how it works.

160
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,250
What a coincidence.

161
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,050
Yeah it is.

162
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:01,975
He would often deliver packages to my place.

163
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,775
Wow.

164
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,975
He... My name is Minato.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,125
I see.

166
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,950
That's a great name.

167
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,920
You didn't even know his name?

168
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
That's hilarious!

169
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,800
You brought some friends along?

170
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:22,450
Yes.

171
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,800
Is everyone in your dance group here now?

172
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, all here.

173
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,250
Got it.

174
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,375
Um.

175
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,600
I'll go get some refreshments for you guys.

176
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,850
We will go with you then.

177
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,550
Yeah.

178
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,925
Can you get me something cold please?

179
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:47,825
Sure.

180
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:50,875
Thanks, see ya later!

181
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,300
(Lured by your steam.)

182
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:04,150
Tsuge has a crush on Minato, doesn't he?

183
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,550
Yeah, you think so too?

184
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,850
The way he looks at Minato with that twinkle in his eyes.

185
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:16,300
A popular guy like you is perceptive indeed.

186
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,700
What's that?

187
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,730
Never mind.

188
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,500
Kurosawa, can you read people's minds?

189
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,125
No way!

190
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,950
If only I could, I'd fulfill more of Adachi's wishes.

191
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,925
Let's go.

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,975
Okay.

193
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,407
That's amazing!

194
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,700
Wow.

195
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,675
Nice moves!

196
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,925
Give me a smile.

197
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah!

198
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,925
I'm so glad I chose to work.

199
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:08,025
What?

200
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,850
This is never gonna work.

201
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,625
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,700
Minato!

203
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,200
Great!

204
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,575
Let's go!

205
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,800
Ay!

206
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,975
Bye now.

207
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,515
Hold it, Minato!

208
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:28,949
Oh no?!

209
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:29,850
Minato!

210
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,050
Did you come just to be sarcastic?

211
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,282
Stop it!

212
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,325
I'm just telling the truth.

213
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,848
No matter how hard you try, it's no use.

214
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:38,625
Keita!

215
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,200
Now let go of me!

216
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,550
You okay?

217
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,225
-Alright, calm down now.
-What, old-timer!

218
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,025
Old...

219
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,425
You must know the level you are at right,

220
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,650
Just face it, you will never catch a break!

221
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:53,250
-Hey!
-Minato!

222
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,125
Stop!

223
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Drink this, and cool your head.

224
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,775
Huh?

225
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,275
Get off my back.

226
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,200
Hey, Keita, wait!

227
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,300
Man.

228
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,800
Excuse me.

229
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:31,825
You didn't have to barge in like that.

230
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,350
Oh, I see.

231
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:42,975
Eh, wait up.

232
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,675
Tsuge,

233
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:12,725
I got a read of Minato's mind just now.

234
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,350
Why are you laughing?

235
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:21,225
I'm the only one giving it my all, that's pathetic.

236
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,700
Why are you telling me this?

237
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:31,050
You like him, don't you?

238
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,875
I understand that you might
take a step back if you get rejected.

239
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,800
I was just like that,

240
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,100
before.

241
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,325
Tsuge! You see...

242
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:14,875
Kurosawa and I...

243
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:20,300
are in a relationship, yes!

244
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:23,475
Ah?

245
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:25,350
That's why...

246
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,750
That's why...No, that would be weird.

247
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,250
Anyway,

248
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,270
go for it!

249
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,425
Tsuge!

250
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,600
So, what was that?

251
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,200
Sorry, all of a sudden...

252
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,000
A shock like that, my,

253
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,775
my heart is going to burst.

254
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,550
Minato!

255
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,150
Tsuge?

256
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,175
I've always wanted to be a novelist.

257
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:59,275
I was cocky because I already
had an editor during college,

258
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:03,160
so I wrote and wrote without finding a job,
but never won any prizes.

259
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
The fear of wasting all my years,

260
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,825
doubting my own talent,

261
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,925
feeling detached from society,
I know all of that.

262
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:11,879
And...

263
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:19,175
There's always someone making fun of you
for trying your best.

264
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:26,300
Those who don't have dreams,
or have lost theirs can be as mean as they want,

265
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,725
it's actually easier
and doesn't hurt to be the butt of the joke.

266
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:35,625
But,

267
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,750
I will never look down on you!

268
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,250
Never laugh at you!

269
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:46,785
So,

270
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,075
believe in yourself.

271
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,150
That's all.

272
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,150
Well, well.

273
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,275
You were, way too cool just now.

274
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,225
Uh?

275
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,475
Thank you.

276
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,112
Minato,

277
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,725
I...

278
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,400
Sorry!

279
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:35,175
Those two are gone for the day.

280
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,550
Oh, what about Kurosawa and Adachi?
They left already?

281
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,575
I'm leaving.

282
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,475
Eh?

283
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:58,000
It's really cool, having dreams or goals.

284
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,450
But you were also pretty cool back there.

285
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,875
What?

286
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,000
You gave Tsuge a boost, didn't you?

287
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,575
No, that was nothing.

288
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:20,425
Dreams, goals, you might find them unexpectedly too.

289
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,650
Let's take all our time.

290
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,775
Step by step,

291
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,950
and enjoy every first experience, right?

292
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,675
Yeah.

293
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,500
There's a lot to think about
when you are in a relationship with someone.

294
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,625
But this feeling, is not at all.

295
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:18,790
Love him.

296
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,075
So cute.

297
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,700
Love him, love him, I love him!

298
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,000
Um, but, that's still embarrassing!

299
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,450
I can't...

300
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:53,825
Can't contain the sound of my heart.

301
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's it.

302
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:11,300
If Minato is gone, I'll just go home and go to bed.

303
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,950
But if he's still practicing, I will...

304
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,425
He's there!

305
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:34,625
Minato!

306
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,750

This must be the happiness aura at full capacity.

318
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,125
(Tsuge and Minato misaligned)
Why are you hurting Minato?

319
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,050
(Tsuge and Minato misaligned)
That's it.

320
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,990
(Tsuge and Minato misaligned)
It's my fault!!

321
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,850
(One another's deepening feelings)
Making me like you more and more,

322
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,475
(One another's deepening feelings)
what am I supposed to do?

323
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,470
(One another's deepening feelings)
