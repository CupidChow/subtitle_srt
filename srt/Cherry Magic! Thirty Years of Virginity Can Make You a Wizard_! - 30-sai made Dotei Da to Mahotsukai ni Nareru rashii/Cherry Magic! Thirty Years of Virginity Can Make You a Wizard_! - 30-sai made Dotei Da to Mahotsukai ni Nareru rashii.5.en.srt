Have we done something wrong?

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,270
Have we done something wrong?

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,030
Mr. Hashimoto,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,950
I apologize if I've done anything wrong.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,600
Mr. Hashimoto seems very angry.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,900
If he cancels the contract

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,590
Kurosawa might get fired.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,470
Kurosawa...

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,840
Adachi?

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,610
I'll bring it to him.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,130
Eh? But...

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,350
Just give it to me.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,470
Just read Mr. Hashimoto's mind

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,590
and figure out why he's angry...

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,780
Don't hesitate!

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,510
Just think of how much Kurosawa has helped me!

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,060
These are the files I have.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,690
You can have it.

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,520
I trust in his competence in the workplace.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,570
Don't touch him!

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,750
Excuse me.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,240
Now it is my turn to...

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Excuse me.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
It's hot!

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,370
Eh?

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,220
I said HOT!

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Sorry!

29
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,950
Failed.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,690
Well then...

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Shit! Well, how about...

32
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,480
Would you like...

33
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,950
Seriously?

34
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,040
It's impossible.

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,530
Excuse me.

36
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,290
It's impossible

37
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,950
for me to help Kurosawa.

38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,820
Wait.

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,850
Your pen.

40
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,120
Now!

41
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,520
Thank you very much!

42
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,370
Sorry, I'll get it for you right away.

43
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,140
Mont Blanc!

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,590
That's why he was so upset?

45
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,420
What kind of adult can act like that

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,270
just because of a piece of Mont Blanc?

47
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,870
Speaking of that,
we did serve Mont Blanc every time he came.

48
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

49
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,820
Sorry.

50
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,340
Anyway, I prefer the Baumkuchen.

51
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,450
Tastes great.

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,700
Okay.

53
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,150
Kurosawa, you did a great job!

54
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,650
Why are you still standing here? Have a seat.

55
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,230
Thank you very much.

56
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,250
It's so great to have you in charge!

57
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,800
I was so relieved after having the Mont Blanc.

58
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,490
And thanks for the gift.

59
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
This way, please.

60
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,590
Well, see you next time!

61
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,270
We're looking forward to seeing you.

62
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,510
Adachi!

63
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,520
Mr. Hashimoto left in a good mood.

64
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,680
That's great.

65
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,680
He said he was relieved
after having the Mont Blanc.

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,950
What does that mean?

67
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,730
It's like his mascot.

68
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,700
Mascot?

69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,570
Yes.

70
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,760
There's once he had the Mont Blanc

71
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,500
and his new product launched successfully.

72
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,800
So since then,

73
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,300
he decided to have a Mont Blanc
for every meeting.

74
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,680
I didn't know it at all.

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,470
How did you know that?

76
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,850
I heard it from the manager before,

77
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,300
and it came to my mind at that moment.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,450
I see.

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,650
You really helped me a lot.

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,820
Let me treat you to dinner next time.

81
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,900
Oh, no worries.

82
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,050
Thank you a lot.

83
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
Thank you.

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,140
I am so relieved.

85
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,300
"Thank you a lot."

86
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,990
Adachi, can I use the copy...

87
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,620
Of course.

88
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,970
Even I was able to help Kurosawa.

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,350
Which means, it's about to arrive.

107
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,830
Udon, how are you?

108
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,370
Woah!

109
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,320
Udon, Udon.

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,520
God, since he came,
my heart beats faster and faster.

111
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,560
Is this...

112
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,070
the so-called crush?

113
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,040
Udon.

114
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,070
Anything wrong? Udon.

115
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,850

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,250

What are you smiling about?

Come on! Act normally!

119
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,250
Come back Tsuge Masato!

120
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,870
Excuse me...

121
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,450
Are you in pain?

122
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,650
Ah, no.

123
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,920
I was just working my pecs.

124
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,170
Then don't scare him.

125
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,970
Udon will be scared.

126
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,600
Sorry.

127
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,020
Don't make me worry about you, idiot.

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,030
Ahhhhh.

129
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,340
You okay? What happened?

130
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,170
There's rubbish on the floor.

131
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,520
I think I've really changed a bit.

(Thank you! -- from Kurosawa)

133
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,620
Is it all because of the magic?

134
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,630
Or...

135
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,990
Okay.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,050
Are you hungry?

137
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,370
You must be hungry!

138
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,950
Uh.

139
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,100
Here you are, the deluxe Makuuchi bento.

140
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,290
Thank you.

141
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,120
I just followed him here, don't know why.

142
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,090
Well, let's eat.

143
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,100
Bon appetit.

144
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,620
But, why?

145
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,640
Just wondering why you treat me
with such an expensive bento.

146
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,570
Just want to thank you for helping me.

147
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,170
Last time we went out
to celebrate my first contract.

148
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,500
I want some medicine for the stomach.

149
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,030
Is there any store nearby?

150
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,740
You said that for me, right?

151
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,420
Today Mr. Hashimoto gave me the clue.

152
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,520
You saw his need instantly
and acquired what he was looking for.

153
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,320
That thing, too...

154
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,320
There're so many smokers in that room.

155
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,270
It's so gross. I don't wanna go back at all.

156
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,800
You noticed that I wanted to get fresh air, so you...

157
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,070
You're overthinking!

158
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,920
That was just a coincidence.

159
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,620
You don't have to hide it anymore.

160
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,150
I've already known.

161
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,190
Already known?

162
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,640
That's right, Adachi.

163
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,390
I know you are...

164
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,870
No way... He finds out my magic?

165
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,490
Such a considerate person.

166
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,240
What?

167
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,750
You sense the emotions of others
and care for them.

168
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,070
You're such an admirable person!

169
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,300
I shouldn't be so nervous.

170
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,470
It's not such a big deal.

171
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,320
Few people can do it.

172
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,440
I want to learn from you.

173
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,560
Teach me please!

174
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,670
I said it's not a big deal.

175
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,270
I'm serious, I really respect you.

176
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,000
Please take these.

177
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,120
There's no need.

178
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,170
You don't have to...

179
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,560
Just a token of my appreciation.

180
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,750
I don't need medicine for the stomach.

181
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,520
I really respect you.

182
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,070
The most considerate person.

183
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,610
I never thought I'd be able to influence anyone.

184
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,370
Never thought I'd be this happy

185
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,700
for being recognized by other people.

186
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,980
It's all

187
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,520
thanks to this magic power.

188
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,650
But...

189
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,740
The reason for being able to take a step forward is...

190
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,970
In fact, you're a really kind, and gentle person.

191
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,020
Glad I could help.

192
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,570
It's better to do something than do nothing.

193
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,470
...that I knew

194
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,590
Kurosawa's feelings for me.

195
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,170
It's raining.

196
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,450
Adachi!

197
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,700
You'll get wet, let me walk you home.

198
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,180
It's fine. I'll run to the station.

199
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,840
I'm not gonna let someone I respect get cold.

200
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,420
What are you talking about?

201
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,520
I said, wait!

202
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,180
Can I stay at your place, just for tonight?

203
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,090
And I said no. Go stay at your boyfriend's place.

204
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,190
Kurosawa?

205
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,580
I don't want to see him anymore.

206
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,320
Just for tonight, okay?

207
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,640
Please, Yuichi.

208
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,850
She's his ex-girlfriend, right?

209
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,590
What?

210
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,150
They were together.

211
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,220
I saw it.

212
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,450
She's definitely his ex.

213
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,250
Can you stop doing that?

214
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,830
Very good looking couple,
they're perfect for each other.

215
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,940
Yea...You're right.

216
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,860
Thank you, bye.

217
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,420
Just one night, I mean it.

218
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,790
Yuichi, you are really nice to me.

219
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,250
And that's why...

220
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,590
I love you.

221
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,940
Do you know

222
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,390
what does that mean?

223
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,390
Of course.

224
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,920
Ahhhhhhhhh!!

225
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,770
It was a dream?

226
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,020
So cold!

227
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Kurosawa's ex is such a beautiful lady.

228
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,950
Good morning.

229
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,720
She's exactly the perfect match

230
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,790
for Kurosawa.

231
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,950
(Energy drink)

232
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,770
If so,

233
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,550
then we are

234
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,570
just colleagues.

235
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,950
Kurosawa.

236
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,190
Please check this proposal.

237
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,370
Hold on a sec.

238
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,300
Okay.

239
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,340
I've tried my best.

240
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,840
Woah, this looks great.

241
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,150
Thanks!

242
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,690
It's better this way, right?

243
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,840
But...

244
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,370
why is it so bothering me?

245
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,170
So tired.

246
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,750
I should go home.

247
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
See you tomorrow.

248
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,440
Bye.

249
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,990
Bye. Oh.

250
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
Remember the dinner I mentioned...

251
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,370
You alright?

252
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm in a rush.

253
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,490
It's better this way.

254
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,140
We're just colleagues after all.

255
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,070
Adachi!

256
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
Let me send you home.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,700
You don't feel good, right?

258
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,070
I go grab a taxi. Wait here.

259
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,170
No worries.

260
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,820
I can go home on my own.

261
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,510
But what if you faint on the way home...

262
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,460
I said I'm good!

263
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,240
Why are you so angry?

264
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,730
I'm not.

265
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,040
Why am I so angry?

266
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,150
I'm good, really.

267
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You don't seem good at all.

268
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,420
Now I know why I am so bothered

269
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,100
after seeing he's with his ex.

270
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,570
I was afraid

271
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,090
that he's gonna change his mind.

272
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,370
Gotcha!

273
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,510
Ex-girlfriend?

274
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,570
Why are you here?

275
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,620
You didn't answer my call, that's why.

276
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,290
What?

277
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,850
Would you mind?

278
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,840
What, what are you doing?

279
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,270
Don't mind me.

280
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,520
Start the car, please.

281
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,260
It's definitely gonna be a rough ride.
