=Episode 3=

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,830
Doing nothing about this?

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,300
I just can't.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,730
Adachi?

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,320
Do you...

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,220
Huh.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,800
Wanna grab somthing to eat with me?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,050
What?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,850
No response?

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,980
Are you alright?

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,120
Yeah, I'm alright.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,380
You had plan tonight?

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,950
Let's reschedule then.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,250
No, not at all.

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,650
It's the first time you asked me.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,860
So I was a bit surprised.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,830
I'm so happy, am I in heaven?

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,000
Ah, I see.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,950
What?

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,120
It was so close...

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,130
I was about to run away again.

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,430
Well, then, where should we go?

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,430

=Cherry Magic!
Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!=

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,350
My courageous effort that happens
once in a blue moon,

39
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,350
Everyone! Are you having fun?

40
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,920
was shattered by this man's appearance.

41
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,450
Ah, you're here.

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,380
Great! Kurosawa, you're still here.

43
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,700
What happened?

44
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,500
I just got my first contract signed!

45
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,680
Whaaat?

46
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,830
Well done!

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,620
Thanks for your advice.

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,550
Nah, you worked really hard for this.

49
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,650
Congrats!

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,600
Thanks!

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,800
The director said
we should go drinking and celebrate it.

52
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,920
What?

53
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,400
What?

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,800
Shall we go?

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,150
Then I ended here.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Wow, you're good at this.

57
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,200
Thank you.

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,750
We are relying on you for more contracts.

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,820
You have my words. I am Kurosawa Junior.

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,500
Stop saying that.

61
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,430
Well, even if we went to dinner like that,

62
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,300
it's not likely we can have a good talk.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm never quite determined enough.

64
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,490
I need to find my way to face him.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
(Sake)

66
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,920
Well well well.

67
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,750
Adachi, you're not drinking?

68
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,990
Would you like some beer?

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,620
-How about you, Fujisaki?
-I am good.

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,750
I see.

71
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,030
Wow. You're drinking hard.

72
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,850
Let's spare no beer in this restaurant today!

73
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,280
Yaaay, Cheers!

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,580
I am not so good at getting hyped in this way.

75
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,430
Rokkaku.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,540
The director is leaving now.

77
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,200
Can you see him off?

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,220
I see. On my way.

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,930
Sorry. That kid is a bit too frisky.

80
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm alright.

81
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,100
The director has left us money for the dessert.

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,750
Order whatever you like.

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,420
Ah. Good.

84
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,330
Thank you.

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,900
Ah, it's so painful.

86
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,730
I should be dating with Adachi by now.

87
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,030
Dating!?

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,920
Are you alright?

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,800
Yeah, sorry.

90
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,100
Did I make him misunderstand?

91
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,330
The dinner thing,

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,430
are we just gonna pretend it never happened?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,050
No, as long as I bring it up.

94
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,980
Hey, Adachi...

95
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,090
Excuse me, I'm off to the Gents.

96
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,700
I fled from him...

97
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,000
What am I doing? What do I want?

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,450
(I don't understand myself.)

99
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,000
(I don't understand myself.)
I don't understand myself.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,660
(I don't understand myself.)

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,220
He got stuck again.

102
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,650
This is Mikeneko Express.

103
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,280
Thank you.

104
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Sign, please.

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,200
It's him again.

106
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,180
The delivery guy has been coming to my house recently.

107
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,480
The young people recently are just

108
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,330
indifferent coakbrains.

109
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,930
Wait? Just one parcel?

110
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,480
I've also selected the delivery time for another.

111
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll check that later.

112
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,980
Just sign there.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,750
Shouldn't he say "please".

114
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,320
Such a troublesome person.

115
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,450
I know you're always at home.

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,500
I bet he just doesn't want to be waken up by delivery.

117
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,830
Thank you.

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,100
What was that?

119
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,350
It's a bit late but,

120
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,100
happy birthday!

121
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,350
Now we are all in our 30s.

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,100
What? Did I become a wizard too?

123
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,650
Well, Adachi?

124
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,850
What's wrong?

125
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,300
Are you drunk?

126
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,800
Ah, no.

127
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,200
The night is still young.

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,990
Let's have so much fun tonight.

129
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,650
Oh, you are so stiff.

130
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,700
Shit, did he notice I was hiding?

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,980
Well, let's go back.

132
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,650
Hiding? Hiding from what?

133
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,850
There're so many smokers in that room.

134
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,550
It's so gross. Don't wanna go back at all.

135
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,730
But this gathering is for me.

136
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,730
And everyone's here for me.

137
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,430
I have to put up with this.

138
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,400
Maybe he is a good guy?

139
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,430
Something on my back?

140
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,620
No, nothing.

141
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,880
True.

142
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,800
That room is quite stifling.

143
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,400
Hey.

144
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,400
I need some medicine for the stomach.

145
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,020
Is there any store nearby?

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,900
Yeah.

147
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,720
Can you take me there?

148
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,650
I'll go buy for you.

149
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,430
Can you?

150
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,550
Of course! Just wait for me!

151
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,330
I'm back right away.

152
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,880
Thank you.

153
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,900
No problem.

154
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,230
I thought he should breathe some fresh air.

155
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,800
This guy is a really good person.

156
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,300
(Virginity magic)

157
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm confused by the unexpected things, though.

158
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,900
You can't judge people by their appearance.

159
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,900
It took some time to find.

160
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,880
Sorry I was late.

161
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,950
Well, no. Thank you.

162
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,650
Ah, this cat.

163
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,660
Do you know about Udon?

164
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,790
Udon?

165
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,130
His name.

166
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,470
He was in a box for udon when I picked him up.

167
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,330
What a random name.

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,230
What?

169
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,750
No, I'm sorry.

170
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
But that's true.
I decided to take him home quite accidentally.

171
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,190
And I did pick a random name for him.

172
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,800
He was the cat in a park nearby, right?

173
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,700
Yeah, that's where I found him.

174
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,920
I knew it.

175
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,680
I was so worried that he was gone.

176
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,380
Great that he's still alive.

177
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,000
This guy is actually a good person.

178
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,860
He has got so many things for the cat.

179
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,580
I'm so happy you're being loved meow.

180
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,600
Awww.

181
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,500
What?

182
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,450
Well, then. Thank you.

183
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,900
Whaaaaat?

184
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,850
Adachi is back!

185
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,230
Sit down, sit down. Come on.

186
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,880
What's this?

187
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,050
It's the king's game.

188
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,920
What?

189
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,350
Which one? Take one.

190
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,200
Who's the king? Oh, it's me!

191
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,530
What should I do?

192
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,800
Well, number 3 and 6.

193
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,700
You have to kiss!

194
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,700
Number 3?

195
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,100
Kurosawa is number 3.

196
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,550
Adachi, aren't you 6?

197
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,580
No, no, we are both men.

198
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,760
Adachi, you're being so lame.

199
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,730
I'm not lame.

200
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,390
This will be my first kiss.

201
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,550
And it will be with...

202
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,150
Did you all drink too much?

203
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,050
Yeah, right.

204
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,550
You have to listen to the king.

205
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,300
You have to!

206
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,430
Yeah, but...

207
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,160
Come on, kiss!

208
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,300
You won't lose anything.

209
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,520
Come on. Come on. Come on.

210
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,400
Kiss, please! Kiss, please!

211
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,940
Let's do this. It's just a game.

212
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,860
What?

213
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,500
On the forehead?

214
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,050
I'm going to make a call.

215
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,220
Are you angry?

216
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,720
No, I'm not.

217
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,020
But don't do this anymore, okay?

218
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,920
Kurosawa?

219
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,450
What happened? Why the long faces?

220
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,480
We were playing the king's game,

221
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,060
and it just got weird.

222
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,330
It's such an old-fashioned and terrible game.

223
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,880
What?

224
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,230
Ah, I'm hungry.

225
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,720
Fujisaki, do you want fried chicken?

226
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,430
Fried chicken!

227
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,380
I've improved my opinion of you.

228
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,680
Sorry.

229
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,150
Adachi, is this the medicine you wanted?

230
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,580
Adachi?

231
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,500
Kurosawa?

232
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,700
Well, are you alright?

233
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,330
Ahh, I think I drank too much.

234
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,280
Here.

235
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,350
Thank you.

236
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,600
The others were being so mean.

237
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,950
Asking men to kiss each other...

238
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,580
Touching Adachi like that

239
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,930
doesn't make me happy.

240
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Well,

241
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,200
But if I said I was not even a little bit happy.

242
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,470
It would be a lie.

243
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,500
But,

244
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,920
Adachi,

245
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,850
he was so afraid.

246
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,500
Of course, he would be.

247
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,880
No normal man likes that.

248
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,650
Kissing a man.

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,880
Right?

250
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,320
Sorry,

251
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,330
that I fell for you.

252
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,100
Well.

253
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,330
It's time to go back and call it a day.

254
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,430
Hey.

255
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,180
I didn't... hate it.

256
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,600
Adachi?

257
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,190
That's true.

258
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,860
I didn't hate it.

259
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,800
Sorry.

260
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,750
But don't do this anymore, okay?

261
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,730
Right?

262
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,270
Sorry,

263
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,750
that I fell for you.

264
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,280
I don't want him

265
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,200
to feel that way.

266
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,770
Well.

267
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,750
I mean.

268
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,970
Actually,

269
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,730
I've never kissed anyone before.

270
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,150
Don't make fun of me.

271
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,060
I didn't.

272
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,020
Just as you can see, I'm not popular at all.

273
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,750
I have never been in a relationship
with anyone either.

274
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,400
So I got very nervous.

275
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,620
And was a bit scared.

276
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,370
So, anyway,

277
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,150
you don't need to self-question

278
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,550
or feel bad about yourself.

279
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,080
I see.

280
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
Then it's even better.

281
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,830
Since I didn't take your first kiss.

282
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,100
No, no, not that.

283
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,280
I mean...

284
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,300
That....

285
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,730
Well, that...

286
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,000
I wanna say...

287
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,300
I didn't hate

288
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,250
your kiss.

289
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,430
I could just do nothing.

290
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,850
But I couldn't.

291
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,750
Though I've not figured out what this feeling is.

292
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,130
Maybe,

293
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,980
I,

294
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,150
just,

295
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,430
want to,

296
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,250
know more about him.

297
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,300
Do you know

298
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,120
what does that mean?

299
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,430

Gently, carefully.

Even for a bit,

316

(Kurosawa starts to take action)
want you to have feelings for me.

Sorry that I doubted you.

318
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,270
Don't touch him!

I like Adachi, really.
