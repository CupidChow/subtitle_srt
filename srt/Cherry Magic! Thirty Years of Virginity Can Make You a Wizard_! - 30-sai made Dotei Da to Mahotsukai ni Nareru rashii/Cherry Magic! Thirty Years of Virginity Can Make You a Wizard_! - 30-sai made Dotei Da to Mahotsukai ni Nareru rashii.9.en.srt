Alright, here's your food.

Here.

00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,025
Okay. Let's eat.

5
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:09,625
Okay.

6
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:12,725
Bon appetite.

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,775
So good!

8
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:22,625
-Really?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,737
I wasn't sure because I cooked in a hurry.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,725
You should open a restaurant.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,575
Stop flattering me.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
I'm not. It's really delicious.

13
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,175
I am more than content just to see you happy.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,875
O, okay.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,750
Ah,

00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,400
you've got an indentation on your face.

17
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:56,525
You slept on the remote control yesterday, right?

18
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,300
Ah, you must be kidding me.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,925
Did you take a picture?

20
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,750
You did, right? Delete it!

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,500
No.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,150
Delete it!

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,700
I said no.

24
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,350
Yay, I got a rare picture of Adachi!

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm gonna make it the wallpaper
and admire this days and nights.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,800
It's our 9th day together.

27

Sometimes, I am a bit lost,

28
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,100
but days like this aren't bad.

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,343
Are you taking a video?

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,575
It must be. I heard you pressed the button.

31
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,775
What?

32
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,600
-You are recording.
-No, I'm not.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,021
Delete it!

34
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,675
Wait, stop it.

35
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:55,675
What what?

36
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:57,475
Why are you doing this? Stop it.

37
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,925
Aaah.

38

What?

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,850
Well, you are so motivated recently.

No, no. I'm not into competitions.

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,175
I hurt Minato?

152
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,875
Aren't you avoiding him?

153
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,475
And it's because he is gay, right?

154
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,400
What do you mean?

155
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,800
Well,

156
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,450
Keita said he wants to get back together with me.

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,875
And he forcibly kissed me after I refused him.

158
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,350
Then Tsuge saw all these?

159
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,375
Yeah.

160
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,675
Did he say anything?

161
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:13,776
No...

162
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,875
but he seems to be avoiding me.

163
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

164
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,818
I think he is keeping away from me,

165
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,100
after knowing that I am gay.

166
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,500
How could he...

167
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,437
It's okay.

168
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,450
I will change my delivery area…

169
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,079
So, can I ask you

170
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,725
to tell Tsuge about this?

171
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,975
He said he won't get close to you anymore,
so don't worry.

172
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,700
You also told Minato to keep dancing, right?

173
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,775
Tsuge really understands me.

174
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:11,325
He said he will support me.

175
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,850
That made me so happy.

176
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,998
It's my first time seeing him

177
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,675
talking about someone like that.

178
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,050
But,

179
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,625
why are you avoiding him
for such an absurd reason?

180
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,975
Are you going to keep doing this?

181
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,325
That's not true!

182
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,150
Like it is with Tsuge,
things also get over my capacity easily.

183
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,675
And we might hide in our shells sometimes.

184
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:56,825
But Tsuge will never avoid anyone

185
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,725
just for that reason!

186
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,425
Right? Tsuge?

187
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,601
That's not completely true.

188
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,375
I have been staying away from Minato.

189
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,825
But it's not because

190
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,450
he is gay.

191
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,950
Thank you.

192
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,600
I can't believe he is taking it like this...

193
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,900
It's all because I am such a coward...

194
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,900
It's all my fault!!!

195
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,475
Tsuge?

196
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,150
I am so sorry!!!

197
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,250
I don't want to

198
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:25,675
get hurt so I pretend I was not home.

199
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,825
I am avoiding you because

200
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,900
I was shocked,

201
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:43,150
to see someone I like being kissed.

202
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,150
I

203
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,800
have feelings for you.

204
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,950
It's getting so strong that I can't help.

205
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:10,200
I like you an awful lot!!!

206
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,075
You're adorable, Tsuge.

207
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,025
I also like you a lot.

208
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,500
Tsuge?

209
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:52,925
Tsuge, are you alright! Tsuge!

210
00:16:56,825 --> 00:17:00,075
It would be great
if Tsuge could come out of his shell.

211
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:01,950
What?

212
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,625
You said that.

213
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,375
He is just hiding in his shell
because he can't process it.

214
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,600
But he won't be avoiding someone
because of things like that.

215
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,775
Ah yeah.

216
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,375
I kind of envy him.

217
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,375
Why?

218
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,698
Cause the Adachi speaking up for him,

219
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,375
was really cool.

220
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,950
Ah, right.

221
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,450
Here.

222
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,675
Maybe you don't need this,

223
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:48,075
but you seemed intrigued.

224
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,800
(Competition Sign-up forms)

225
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:04,400
Why don't you give it a go?

226
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,475
I will support you whole-heartedly.

227
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,275
Kurosawa.

228
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,525
I, I think I'm gonna try.

229
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,075
You said that I was so cool.

230
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,025
If so, I think it was probably...

231
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,700
Well, actually.

232
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,625
It must be because of you.

233
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:44,600
That's why I feel

234
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,625
I can take up more challenge now.

235
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,175
Wait Kurosawa, people are watching.

236
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,550
Aah, this is cheating.

237
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:09,243
My feelings for you

238
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:11,925
is getting even more overwhelming.

239
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:17,350
Ah, I think

240
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,400
I really like him.

241
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:35,999
Well,

242
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,225
I can't believe this.

243
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,700
What?

244
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,525
I didn't expect that you also like me.

245
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:56,727
Actually,

246
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,450
in 30 years time,

247
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,425
it's my first experience with love.

248
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,125
I am not so used to things like this...

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,870
I can't believe

250
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:14,650
you also have feelings for me.

251
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:15,825
Say no more.

252
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:21,843
At first,

253
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:25,275
I just thought he was nice.

254
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,249
But,

255
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,900
I got to know him.

256
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,890
He's so bad with words

257
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,550
and so clumsy.

258
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,050
I just can't stop thinking about him.

259
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,100
When I noticed,

260
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,525
I've fallen in love.

261
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,000
Minato.

262
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
It's okay.

263
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,750
I'll be gentle.

264
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:03,600
Okay.

265
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,074
I, Tsuge Masato,

266
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,750
lost my magic on this very night.

267
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,200
Adachi.

268
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,650
Oh, Good morning.

269
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:57,125
Sorry about yesterday!

270
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:57,925
What?

271
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:00,450
Oh, not at all.

272
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,975
I was too emotional.

273
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,775
Minato is such an important friend for you.

274
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,550
He is the star of hope in our dance club.

275
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,725
The star of hope.

276
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,787
Yes.

277
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,250
He has all our support.

278
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,175
