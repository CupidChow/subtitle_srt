2
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,560
Before the age of 30,

3
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,560
(I have never thought that)

4
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,470
in my ordinary life,

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,650
I mean, it's me,

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,550
whom would be endowed with such magic.

7
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,560
And FYI,

8
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,620
this is the day before my 30's birthday.

9
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,950
Mr. Kurosawa.

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,150
Here is the info on our new product release.

11
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,600
Can you please review it for me?

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,520
Sure.

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,020
I am really sorry.

14
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,350
What the heck am I doing?

15
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,720
Hey, Adachi.

16
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,400
Yes?

17
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,200
You said you have never been
in a relationship before.

18
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,320
Is that true?

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,570
Why the sudden interest, eh?

20
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,050
Is it true though?

21
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,270
Well...

22
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,130
That is right.

23
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,500
Then... Adachi is a virgin, huh?!

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,320
Keep your voice down.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,300
Hmmm... really... ohhh...

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,820
I think this counts as sexual harassment, huh?

27
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,650
So, how old are you now?

28
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,170
I am turning 30 tomorrow.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,320
Seriously?!

30
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,200
Hey, Fujisaki.

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,560
Tomorrow is this guy's birthday.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,650
Is that so? Happy birthday.

33
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,650
Thank you very much.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,350
So how do you like Fujisaki?

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,350
Why are you asking?

36
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,570
According to my sources, she is still single.

37
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,370
Oh.

38
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,550
Do you wanna me to be the matchmaker?

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,450
That won't be necessary.

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,670
You need to have a sense of urgency!

41
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,320
Don't you know?

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,250
Thirty years of virginity

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,570
can make you a wizard!

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,100
Wizard?

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,950
You still believe in such urban legend?

46
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,450
Not really.

47
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,670
But if it were true, wouldn't it be interesting?

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Yea yea... I hear you... just mind your business.

49
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,020
Okay.

50
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,320
It is not like that I wanna be a virgin.

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,170
I have fallen for someone before.

52
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,670
Fujisaki is a fine lady.

53
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,950
But that's all there is

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,250
to it.

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,720
I am never gonna make a move on her.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,470
Not to mention the things
that would happen if all goes well.

57
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,870
It's awkward just to think about it.

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,350
And I cannot stay in the office afterward.

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,120
Kurosawa, you like wine, right?

60
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,700
Right.

61
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,100
Then why don't we go out for dinner together next time?

62
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,950
Then how about I go ask the director
for a networking event?

63
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,250
Huh? But I was thinking us three go together.

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,270
Kurosawa Yuichi.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,350
Awards.

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,370
No.1 for 5 consecutive years in the sales department.

67
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,850
Boss's favorite and popular among the girls.

68
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,820
A young man who is refreshing and perfect.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Was in the swimming, or soccer,
maybe baseball team in college.

70
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,450
I don't remember the specifics.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,500
Anyway, I heard
he did great in the national championships.

72
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,400
Except for the fact
that we were the same class in the office,

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,370
and both being males,
we have nothing in common.

74
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,720
Job well done.

75
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,270
Thank you.

76
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,450
That smile is dazzling!

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,450
No, nothing.

78
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,590
Kurosawa

79
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,670
Computer problem.
Can you please take a look for me?

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,170
Which one?

81
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,950
If only I had one of his characteristics...

82
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,800
I don't know how to do the input.
I want to type this info in.

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,350
Uh, I see.

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,220
Never mind.

85
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,450
I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles.

86
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,920
(The Real Rice Ball)
Welcome.

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,900
(The Real Rice Ball)
A bento box.

88
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,450
(The Real Rice Ball)
One bento box. Yes.

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,850
But if at least

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,220
I could know that there is someone

91
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,700
who has a secret crush on me...

92
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,350
Thank you for your business.

93
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,800
Forget it.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
I sound like an idiot.

95
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,100
Goodbye, me in my 20s.

96
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,970
Good morning, me in my 30s.

97
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,400
(Happy birthday. - from Masato Tsuge.)
Two birthday notes from my mom and Tsuge.

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
(Happy birthday. Take care of yourself. - from Mom)
Two birthday notes from my mom and Tsuge.

99
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,800
(Thanks, Tsuge, and good luck with your work.)
That concludes my birthday celebration.

100
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,550
Welcome.

101
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,690
(Tuna Mayo Karaage Mayo)

102
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,000
(The Real Rice Ball)
That will be 280 yen.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,320
Day in the 30s is no different than days in the 20s.

104
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,950
We have here 500 yen.

105
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,920
There it is! Double mayo!

106
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,470
And here is your change of 220 yen.

107
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,050
Aren't you tired of eating the same thing every day?

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,700
Eh?

109
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,070
No, nothing.

110
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,970
Have a good one.

111
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,670
This is taking forever.

112
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,120
I'm starving.

113
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,250
That guy is probably gonna get fired.

114
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,650
Don't wanna go to work.

115
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,070
What are you staring at?

116
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,000
Eh?

117
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,420
What the heck is going on here?

118
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,700
What the heck?

119
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,020
Are you okay?

120
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,850
Drunk in the morning? Give me a break.

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,020
Eh?

122
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,300
Get out of my way.

123
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,030
That's annoying.

124
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,070
Watch out.

125
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,850
What is happening?

126
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,620
Gooooooood morning.

127
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,500
Enjoy your 30s.

128
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,270
Right.

129
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,920
Oh my, already looking dull, and it's still morning.

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,470
Good morning.

131
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,800
...Could it be... I...

132
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,700
The joke went straight over his head.

133
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,850
But Adachi is a good person though.

134
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,870
Even if he doesn't want to,
he'll still help if I ask.

135
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,970
Seriously?

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,550
Hmm? What's going on,

137
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,930
Wizard?

138
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,350
Eh?

00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,550

158
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,920
(One week after my birthday)

159
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,750
(Okaka Onigiri Rice Balls)
I have surprised myself with my adaptability.

160
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,420
(Okaka Onigiri Rice Balls)

161
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,920
Use mobile payments.

162
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,770
Get up early and avoid the morning traffic.

163
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,250
And there is almost no one
would have to touch me anymore.

164
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,070
It doesn't matter if it is magical or delusional,

165
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,770
my day is still the same.

166
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,650
If the urban legend is true,

167
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,670
this power should go away

168
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,520
when I am no longer a virgin.

169
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,920
Please, after you.

170
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,520
Thanks.

171
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,240
Please, after you.

172
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,300
But that is nearly impossible for me right now.

173
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,270
Good morning.

174
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,820
Hi.

175
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,820
You are early today.

176
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,650
Ah, I guess so.

177
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,820
The elevator just left.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,720
You wanna take the stairs?

179
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,970
Huh? Our office is on the 10th floor.

180
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
It's a good workout, though.

181
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,940
Dazzling!

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,020
Thanks.

183
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,620
Good morning.

184
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,550
This guy must have lost his virginity in his teens.

185
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,320
A McDreamy like him must have been enjoying his life.

186
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,370
Good morning.

187
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,550
Oh crap!

188
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,320
Lucky me.

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,950
Didn't expect to see you so early in the morning.

190
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,700
Eh?

191
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,820
I will probably look suspicious if I look too much.

192
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,150
Wow, this guy has a crush on someone in the company?

193
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,800
Oh, bed head again.

194
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,720
Bedhead hair?

195
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,750
Which one?

196
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,350
Who is the lucky one to be liked by Kurosawa?

197
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,070
Excuse me. I'm getting out on this floor.

198
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm sorry. You okay?

199
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Uh-huh.

200
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,700
God... this is so close!

201
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,250
Eh?

202
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,850
Is it good to be so lucky in the early morning?

203
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,520
My heart is beating so fast!

204
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,470
I hope Adachi doesn't hear my heartbeat.

205
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,000
Eh?

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,550
Have a great day!

207
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,350
Okay.

208
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,150
Eh?

209
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,120
It was me?

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,670
Till now, I have been thinking,

211
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,070
this mind-reading thing is all in my head.

212
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,400
Otherwise, it would be really unorthodox.

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,660
Kurosawa...

214
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,230
There's no way he'd secretly like me.

215
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,070
Boss, I'm pretty sure it's due next week...

216
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,150
Eh?

217
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,920
I'll need it tomorrow morning. Thanks.

218
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,350
Yes, sir!

219
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,200
She is gonna be real mad at me...

220
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,920
Yumi,

221
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I have to work overtime on our anniversary...

222
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,030
Oh, no.

223
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,150
Adachi...

224
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,350
Uh, um...

225
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,670
I can help you with it if you want to?

226
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,550
Thank you very much.

227
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,450
As always.

228
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,970
Much appreciated.

229
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,850
Ahhhh, never gonna be able to finish this on time.

230
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,320
Ended up doing his work after all.

231
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,900
You're still here?

232
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,650
Kurosawa...

233
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,750
Here you go.

234
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,450
Bought by the junior but had too many.

235
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,430
Actually, I bought it just for you.

236
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,250
Don't panic. This must be all in my head.

237
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,320
Just end the conversation normally
and go back to work.

238
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,130
That's it.

239
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,170
Thank you.

240
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,200
See you tomorrow.

241
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,450
Sajima Stationery?

242
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,350
Ah, I was asked to put together
a list of past transactions.

243
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,320
Isn't it better to have more data,
not just the past five years?

244
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,200
No, but...

245
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,620
I will help you.

246
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,770
I'll get the files.

247
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,020
Ended up being alone together,
just the two of us.

248
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,200
But this guy is indeed great at his job.

249
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,570
Not just what he says but also what he does,
are different.

250
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,800
What's the matter?

251
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,420
No... nothing...

252
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,750
I was just thinking, Kurosawa is brilliant.

253
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,350
What are you talking about?

254
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,920
Because you are great at your work.

255
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,600
And everybody finds you trustworthy and reliable.

256
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,900
All these nice words, all of the sudden.

257
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,620
Here, focus on the job.

258
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,070
Oh, right, sorry.

259
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,950
Where were we?

260
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,920
Yea... it is right here, I think.

261
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,170
Oh, not good.

262
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,000
Hmm? What is he talking about?

263
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,250
I've noticed it before,

264
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,200
Adachi smells really good.

265
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,620
Shampoo? Softener?

266
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,150
What did he use?

267
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,650
Alright, I'll look it up at the drug store next time.

268
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,920
That's the next one, right?

269
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,420
Uh, that's right.

270
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,240
And…

271
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,870
The mole at the nape of his neck is so alluring.

272
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,620
Ah, I can take it no more.

273
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,070
I wonder if I'm the only one who noticed.

274
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh no, oh no! The mole at the nape of his neck.

275
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,720
The mole!!!

276
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,900
Excuse me.

277
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,090
I need to use the restroom.

278
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,950
Oh, okay.

279
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,870
There really is a mole there.

280
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,370
I didn't even know...

281
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,370
So I wasn't imagining all of these.

282
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,570
That means,

283
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,400
his feelings for me

284
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,950
are real.

285
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,420
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,950
I can't comprehend the situation.

287
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,100
The temperature dropped all of a sudden.

288
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,600
Wanna run away. I want to go home and sleep.

289
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,000
Adachi?

290
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,650
But why does he like me anyway?

291
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,450
Did he work too hard and got brain damage...

292
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,500
Are you okay?

293
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,860
Yea, I am fine.

294
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,020
It's really getting cold.

295
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,400
You can borrow it.

296
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
You should keep it for yourself.

297
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,120
If you catch a cold, everyone would be worried.

298
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
I'll be just fine.

299
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,820
Enough said.

300
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,550
Adachi, your self-esteem is too low.

301
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,920
Always stand in the corner trying to read the room.

302
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,150
Give precedence to others for elevator rides every morning.

303
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,200
Never complain even when forced to do other's work.

304
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,550
In fact, you are a really kind, and gentle person.

305
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,930
Always take work seriously.

306
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,920
And those are the things

307
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,280
that make me...

308
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,140
OK.

309
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,850
I'm sorry that I thought you were crazy.

310
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,320
It suits you.

311
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,520
I never thought

312
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,500
that anyone would ever look at me like this.

313
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,370
I feel like I might cry a little.

314
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,220
See you tomorrow.

315
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,150
Adachi?

316
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,450
What?

317
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,400
Is the subway still running?

318
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,350
Ahhhh, I don't think so.

319
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,700
I thought so.

320
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,650
But it is okay.

321
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,190
I will stay at a cafe for the night.

322
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,950
Thanks for being here today.

323
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,500
Goodbye.

324
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,920
Wait a minute.

325
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,650
Or stay at my place for the night?

326
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,350
Eh?

327
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,320
Come and stay with me.

328
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,520
It's only a taxi ride away.

329
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,200
Oh, um...

330
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,920
You would be really tired
if couldn't get any sleep, right?

331
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,100
But wouldn't it be too much for you...

332
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,520
Not at all.

333
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,750
I'd feel a lot more at ease if you do.

334
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,450
- But…
- It's decided then.

335
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,650
Come on. Let's go.

336
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,450
Adachi?

337
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,850
Eh?

338
