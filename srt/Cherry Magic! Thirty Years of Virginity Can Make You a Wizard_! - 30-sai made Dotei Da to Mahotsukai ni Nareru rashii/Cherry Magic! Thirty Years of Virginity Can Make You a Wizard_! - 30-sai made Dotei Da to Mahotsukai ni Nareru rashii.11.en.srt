2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,820
What should I do?

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,650
Did I just say fireworks?

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,450
Was it then...

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,470
For a moment I thought Adachi read my mind.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,650
Was it then I should tell him about the magic?

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,300
Thanks for waiting.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,170
What's wrong?

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,970
I gave Minato the bike as a gift yesterday.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,870
I did say

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,100
it would be nice if we could exercise more.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,470
What? What's wrong?

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,670
Well,

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,020
I was actually thinking about hybrid bikes.

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,650
I didn't know

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,550
you have such a corky personality.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,450
Is it weird to make mistakes?

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,470
What?

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,950
I haven't written anything since yesterday.

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,620
I'll have to pause my novel series
if I can't deal with this!

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,370
Excuse me.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,800
Calm down.

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,950
Why don't you apologize?

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,350
I don't know how.

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,120
What?

26
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,500
I forgot

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,320
how difficult it is to sense the others' feeling.

28
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,570
Until now, I could just touch him.

29
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,750
Adachi,

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,470
Do you understand what I am trying to say?

31
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,150
Umm well,

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,470
that I should cherish the magic?

33
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,520
Wrong!

34
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,750
Do not rely on the magic too much!

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,520
It will eventually be gone.

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,770
If you don't do something on your own,

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,320
The same thing will happen to you.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,150
On my own...

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,550
It is like what Tsuge said.

40
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,670
I've noticed,

41
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,150
before I knew it,

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,470
I am already relying on the magic.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,370
This can't be good...right?

44
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,270
Okay.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,650
Try not to touch anyone.

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,580
Don't read anyone's mind.

47
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,120
Use your own ability.

48

66

Kurosawa, your way of celebration is so wild.

67
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,820
What?

68
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,200
You passed the first round of the competition!

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,020
What?

70
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,120
Someone from the Planning Department told me!

71
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,070
What?

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,950
That's something, Adachi!

73
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,550
R, really?

74
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,820
Your design might eventually
become an actual product.

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,470
You're too impatient.

76
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,070
Ah.

77
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,420
Isn't the second round presentation?

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
Please be careful.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,370
What? Be careful?

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,620
Director Terashima
from the Department of Planning and Development

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,820
is super terrifying.

82
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,020
That's enough.

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,550
If she said that,

84
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,370
it means you're all over.

85
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,970
What?

86
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,370
What? That's frightening.

87
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,900
Well, but being afraid can't help.

88
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,300
Make up your mind and go for it!

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,850
Don't you dare say that.

90
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,020
You just made me afraid.

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000
Adachi?

92
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,300
It's special training from tonight.

93
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,350
What?

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,120
The trick for presentation is
to ease the burden of the listeners.

95
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,650
Start with your conclusion.

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,670
It is a must to give a preview of what you'll say.

97
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,720
A preview?

98
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,220
I am going to talk about
three points of this product.

99
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,500
Say something like this first.

100
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,650
So the listeners will think

101
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,970
your speech is easy to understand.

102
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,620
That's very helpful!

103
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,170
We have a week till your presentation.
Let's prepare well.

104
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,850
Sorry about this.

105
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,950
I know you're also tired.

106
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,700
Not at all.

107
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,320
I hope you can pass the competition.

108
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,650
Also, it is for the fun later.

109

111
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,770
I'm not tired at all
because amazing things await ahead.

112
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,100
You always say that...

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,250
What?

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,070
Nothing.

115
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,570
I'll also work hard

116
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,500
to enjoy our da, date.

117
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,420
What? Can you say that again?

118
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,670
You must have heard that!

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,350
-Say that again.
-I said no.

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,460
-Again.
-No.

121
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,290
Please.

122
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,470

How to sell it specifically?

128
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,070
Layout the words succinctly.

129
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Pay attention to the images
as much as you can.

130
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,840
Right.

131

To begin with,

135
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,220
I'd like to talk about
the three points of my clip.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,970
Firstly, it is a new tool
for communication in offices.

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,370
Secondly, it has rich characteristics.

-Yeah.

-Let's practice till you're fluent.
-Yeah, right.

144
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,920
I did it!

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,100
Kurosawa

174
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,650
seemed really happy.

175
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,720
Alright.

176
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,000
I have to get a good result first.

177
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,350
Good morning, Director Terashima.

178
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,070
Morning.

179
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,650
She is Ms. Terashima?

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,600
Not intriguing.

181
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,220
Huh?

182
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,950
None of the designs is intriguing.

183
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
Ah, hell no.

184
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,950
I'm reading her mind.

185
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,300
They are just so peacockish.

186
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,700
None paid attention to

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
the actual function or the feelings of the users.

188
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,920
I have to stop this.

189
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,470
I have tried so hard to not use the magic.

190
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,200
I shouldn't have started the competition.

191
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,320
I just wanted to give some pressure to
the newcomers of our department.

192
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,750
This won't do it.

193
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
It's everything I like.

194
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,320
(Believe in yourself)

195
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,150
Bon appetite.

196
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,900
Thank you for this opportunity.

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,270
Calm down.

198
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,950
First I have to make the preview.

199
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,400
To begin with,

200
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,150
the clips I designed...

201
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,220
It's kinda boring.

202
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,350
What?

203
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,000
Why did you choose clips?

204
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,350
Well, about that.

205
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,220
Please look at page 3...

206
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,320
That's enough.

207
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,550
What?

208
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,770
Thank you for your time.

209
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,520
Is this all?

210
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,250
They said there's no time for someone
without a vision.

211
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,100
You can leave now.

212
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,350
(Design for Competition: Emoji Clips)
Kurosawa

213
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,650
spent so much time practising with me.

214
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,770
Hey.

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,700
Re...

216
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,420
Recently, the stationaries
are only paying attention to the look.

217
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,670
So I designed this with its function
and the feelings of the users in mind.

218
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,350
Go on.

219
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,950
This is cheating.

220
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,350
I eventually used the information

221
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,550
I got from the magic to get her interest.

222
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,570
Adachi.

223
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,570
I was going to pick you up.

224
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,750
What a coincidence to meet you here.

225
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,250
Right.

226
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,850
What's wrong?

227
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,550
Well.

228
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,020
Let's go.

229
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,350
You!

230
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,620
Ah, Ms. Terashima.

231
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,100
It's great to see you.

232
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,120
Well, are you two friends?

233
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,820
Yes.

234
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,700
Adachi.

235
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,850
It's a pity,

236
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,700
but your design is eliminated.

237
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,920
I see.

238
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,320
But

239
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,620
your idea for stationery is not bad.

240
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,400
That's all from me. Thanks for the hard work.

241
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,470
That's amazing, Adachi.

242
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,170
What?

243
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,100
Ms. Terashima rarely praises someone.

244
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,320
It's the magic that's amazing.

245
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,470
Kurosawa.

246
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,970
What?

248
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,000
Everyone was so supportive.

249
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,350
No, you shouldn't be apologizing.

250
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,620
You should be celebrating.

251
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,650
Should I?

252
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,600
Well.

253
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's go.

254
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,170
I've got to tell him
it's enough that he went for it.

255
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,450
Hope he is more confident now,

256
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,870
and that he won't think little of himself anymore.

257
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,600
It's enough if he could be happy.

258
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,370
What?

259
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,300
Ah, nothing.

260
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,370
If I knew this,

261
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,550
It would be much better
if I have quitted earlier.

262
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,250
I've decided to work hard for it,

263
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,520
but I cheated.

264
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,670
In the end,

265
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,120
I just realized I've got no talent at all.

266
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,150
Are candles too much?

267
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,250
Ah, well, isn't it nice?

268
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,170
Alright.

269
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,750
Let's start eating before it gets cold.

270
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,420
Yeah.

271
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,050
Cheers.

272
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,100
Adachi doesn't seem happy.

273
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,150
Should I talk about the date?

274
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,750
I have found a place

275
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,550
to watch the fireworks alone with him.

276
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,600
(Building Anton)
The rooftop of Building Anton.

277
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,620
I asked someone I know to rent it for me.

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,950
Nah, I want to surprise him.

279
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Sorry.

280
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,600
The surprise is over.

281
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,100
Or should I say something to light it up?

282
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,070
Something like "Can I have some reward?".

283
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,500
What do you want for the reward?

284
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,920
Did I say that?

285
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,020
Ah, no.

286
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,620
If the magic

287
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,970
is gone,

288
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,070
I wouldn't need to worry about this.

289
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,870
Kurosawa.

290
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,800
Yeah?

291
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,350
I,

292
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,270
I don't really know.

293
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,020
That...

294
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,500
Yeah.

295
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,100
If the magic

296
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,820
is gone...

297
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,050
C, can you tell me how?

298
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,150
I see.

299
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,200
This is so sudden.

300
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,850
So cute.

301
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,270
But

302
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,450
it's not like him.

303
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,220
He must have

304
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,420
really made up his mind for me.

305
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,870
It's not like that.

306
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,020
He is so thoughtful.

307
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,070
I can't be happier.

308
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm not being thoughtful.

309
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,950
I knew all your thoughts

310
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,650
and I have used it!

311
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,920
Ah, so, sorry.

312
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,150
Did I push too far?

313
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,620
No, no!

314
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,770
What?

315
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,720
I...

316
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,900
I have to tell you something!

317
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,320
Adachi?

318
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,570
I can read people's mind if I touch them!

319
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,450
It happened after my 30th birthday.

320
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,570
It is said that if you're still a virgin
you'll have magic, right?

321
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,050
It's true!

322
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,820
About the surprise,

323
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,900
I knew it all.

324
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,700
It's on the rooftop of Building Anton, right?

325
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,920
And you just worried that I was behaving weird.

326
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,650
Sorry.

327
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,520
Sorry for keeping this a secret.

328
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm the worst.

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,650
But I am not lying.

330
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,370
Adachi!

331
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,070
Calm down.

332
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't think you're lying.

333
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,850
You're being very serious.

334
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,200
You can't be lying.

335
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,270
That's not all.

336
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,620
What?

337
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,470
I am afraid

338
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,420
that I'll lose the magic.

339
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,950
If I lost the magic,

340
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,220
our relationship might not go well.

341
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,700
Isn't this weird?

342
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,770
I don't deserve

343
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400
to be with you!

344
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,800
I don't know what to do.

345
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,250
