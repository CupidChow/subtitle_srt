2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,220
I,

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,230
I have feelings for you.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,420
Just a few weeks ago,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,820
I thought it's enough

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,620
just to be by your side.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,500
But now,

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,570
I started to crave for more.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,620
I don't wanna be

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,990
a colleague

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,570
or just a friend anymore.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,170
It's the first time

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,900
I felt something so strong.

14
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,620
Sorry, let's pretend nothing has happened.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,270
I'll forget all this.

16
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,950
What?

17
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,400
I just had to let it out.

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,220
Sorry for being so selfish.

19
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,470
Let's just be the way we were

20
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,150
the next time we meet.

21
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,370
Ah.

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,670
I shouldn't let him go.

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,220
But,

24
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,020
what should I do after I stop him?

25
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,570
Ah, I have no idea.

40
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,550
Kurosawa seems to be on a business trip to Osaka.

41
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,320
Ah, really?

42
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,240
That's why it's such a depressing day.

43
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,430
I don't feel like doing anything

44
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,950
without seeing that bright smile.

45
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,500
Yeah right.

46
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
Good morning.

47
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,950
I realized it long ago,

48
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,870
that I have got the look.

49
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,310
Kurosawa, I have feelings for you.

50
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,340
I have feelings for you.

51
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,400
Why?

52
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,750
Well...

53
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,420
But....

54
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,750
Please take the elevator to the 6th floor.

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,170
Thank you.

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,020
I hate it that they only saw my appearance.

57
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,550
That person is so good-looking!

58
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,270
But,

59
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,900
I know I can't complain about it.

60
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,470
Let's go for lunch together.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,250
I just pretend that I don't care.

62
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,850
(Office Bag)
The new office design with big space

63
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,350
(Office Bag)
has gained popularity.

64
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,150
Please take a look at the handout.

65
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,850
It was when I just started working.

66
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,950
Right.

67
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,470
Kurosawa.

68
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,950
Yes?

69
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,070
Ms Mastuura, the CEO,
has just invited us for dinner.

70
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,020
Can you come?

71
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,600
Yes, sure.

72
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,170
Great!

73
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,450
She likes good-looking boys.
Now we've got someone for her.

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,670
Hey, you!

75
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,120
What?

76
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,620
The more boys the better. You should come.

77
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,400
Ummmm.

78
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,650
Adachi was a colleague of mine.

79
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,370
No.

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,270
He was just a boring colleague of mine.

81
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,250
So glad to finally meet you.

82
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,400
I've heard so much about this pretty boy.

83
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,070
I'm not sure if I'm what you said, but

84
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,300
Ms Matsuura, you're also

85
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,250
like what the rumour said.

86
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Well well,

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,650
you're just made to come by your supervisor.

88
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,720
-No.
-That's not true.

89
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,150
I am a big fan of your leather bag series.

90
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,070
I also bought your most recent design.

91
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,350
Really?

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,000
I really looked forward to talking to you.

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,300
Isn't he nice?

94
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,100
Thank you.

95
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,420
Everyone, empty your glass.

96
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,870
Of course, I'm enjoying it.

97
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,970
Hey you, with the dark face.

98
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,600
You weren't drinking at all.

99
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,750
Ah, sorry.

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm not good with alcohol.

101
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,250
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,970
Drink up. You're a man.

103
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,700
Ah, then I will have it for him!

104
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,050
Bravo! Bravo!

105
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,600
It tastes really good.

106
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,920
Aww so cute. Are you drunk?

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,020
You're good at this. How impressive.

108
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,700
Sorry about that.

109
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,220
Hey.

110
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,220
Do you want to go somewhere for a rest?

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
What?

112
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,500
Sorry that I brought you into this.

113
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,400
Ah, no.

114
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Ms Matsuura was so angry.

115
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,800
Kurosawa didn't need to react like that...

116
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,470
He's too carried away to make mistakes like this.

117
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,550
He should stick with his pretty face.

118
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,520
Yeah, he's only got that face.

119
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,420
But he doesn't know that.

120
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,270
Exactly.

121
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,870
Shall we just wait at the entrance?

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,370
Why should I be shocked?

123
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,920
I should just accept myself the way I am.

124
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,000
It's the reason the others

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,100
would need me.

126
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't like being told

127
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,720
that I have only got my face.

128
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,450
I tried to do everything perfectly.

129
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,550
No matter it is the job or human relations.

130
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,620
But...

131
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,920
What?

132
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,470
Are, are you alright?

133
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,150
Adachi?

134
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,020
No need to rush.

135
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,650
Lie down for a bit.

136
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,120
What have I been doing?

137
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,270
What?

138
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,320
I was taken there to please Ms Mastuura.

139
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,600
But I made her angry,

140
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,370
and wasn't useful at all...

141
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,850
Why am I saying this to this guy?

142
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,200
Right, now he doesn't know what to say.

143
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,050
That's not true.

144
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,770
What?

145
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,800
You did so much research on her and her company.

146
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,570
You even memorized all the products.

147
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,500
You drunk the wine for me.

148
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,250
You are more than what you think, Kurosawa.

149
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,650
Really?

150
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,950
Why are you laughing?

151
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,600
Nah.

152
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,570
You just always seem so perfect.

153
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,470
I've never seen you like this.

154
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,250
It feels nice.

155
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,420
What are you talking about

156
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,770
My heart was pounding.

157
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,850
And I was about to cry.

158
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,600
Hey.

159
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,750
Rest for a bit.

160
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,120
It's the first time

161
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,950
that I felt someone has touched my heart.

162
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,370
(Office bag designed to fit)
This is the new design from Toyokawa.

163
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,570
Please have a look.

164
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,470
I didn't take any time to fall for him.

165
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,300
Good morning.

166
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,650
Good morning.

167
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,420
Good morning.

168
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,050
He gets that messy hair from time to time.

169
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,750
He's so careless about personal things.

170
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,550
-Ah, yeah.
-Can you?

171
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,250
Yes.

172
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,770
But he does his work well.

173
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,750
He never says no to others' request.

174
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,620
He doesn't have any look on his face.

175
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,670
But when he smiles, the world is lightened up.

176
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,220
He likes neat girls.

177
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,970
When it started

178
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,250
I have known it.

179
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,900
One day,

180
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,870
I will have to end all this feeling.

181
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,320
Forget it now.

182
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,470
Let's just be the way we were

183
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,920
the next time we meet.

184
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Kurosawa said that.

185
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,800
But,

186
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,920
what was the way we were?

187
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,170
I can't help thinking about

188
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,720
what happened between us.

189
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,670
In fact, you are a really kind, and gentle person.

190
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,170
And those are the things

191
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,650
that make me...

192
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,770
Anything else would be asking too much of him.

193
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,320
As long as I can be there for him

194
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,870
I don’t mind if we can only be coworkers.

195
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,320
Sorry

196
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,220
that I fell for you.

197
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,750
But

198
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,350
it's better to do something I can

199
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,000
than doing nothing.

200
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,500
You don't seem good at all.

201
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,670
Cause you are

202
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,300
the most special one to me.

203
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,670
All about him,

204
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,270
everyting.

205
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,250
Every single bit of him.

206
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,350
Everything about him.

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,800
I won't let go.

208
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,000
Adachi!

209
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,550
Listen to me.

210
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,570
-The director just...
-Excuse me.

211
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,870
I am leaving early today.

212
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,750
Adachi?

213
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,370
I'm always searching for him

214
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,200
without noticing.

215
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
I've been thinking about him.

216
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,470
Came to think about it.

217
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,520
He is all over my head.

218
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,120
That's right.

219
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,270
I am...

220
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,170
Kurosawa!

221
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,870
Adachi

222
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,350
What's wrong?

223
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,750
Great

224
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,470
that I found you.

225
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,170
What happened?

226
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,600
Sorry!

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,050
Yesterday I was...

228
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,470
No.

229
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,320
About what happened until now,

230
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm so sorry!

231
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,460
I

232
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,600
get afraid easily.

233
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,270
So many times

234
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,270
I just escaped and hurt you.

235
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,370
Also that we are

236
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,400
both men.

237
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,490
And it is easier to remain colleagues.

238
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah.

239
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,370
I understand.

240
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,800
No, just listen!

241
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,720
When I am with you

242
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,700
I get surprised sometimes,

243
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,650
but I am always smiling.

244
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,670
It feels great to be with you.

245
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,820
It's not bad

246
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,250
to feel this way.

247
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,920
No.

248
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,720
Put all that aside.

249
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,620
I am...

250
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,800
I am

251
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,170
in love with you.

252
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,070
Sorry that it came too late.

253
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,770
But this is my feeling.

254
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,300
Really? Can I?

255
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,500
What?

256
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,670
I won't let you go,

257
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,400
even if you want to escape again.

258
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,420
Sure.

259
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Sure huh?

260
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,170
His heart is beating so fast.

261
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,020
It's telling me Kurosawa's thoughts

262
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,920
that is beyond words.

263
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,650
Maybe I

264
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,670
got the magic

265
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,470
just to touch his heart.

266
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,150
Don't be so nervous.

267
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,500
What?

268
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,550
I'm getting this

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,600
from you.

270
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,950
Do you also get nervous?

271
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,500
Of course.

272
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,300
Didn't you hear my heartbeat?

273
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,000
I heard it.

274
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,600
Sure you did.

275
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,070
Ah.

276
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,750
Well.

277
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,200
What should we do now?

278
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,100
What?

279
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,520
Should we get dinner together?

280
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,950
No, or...

281
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,120
Or?

282
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,320
Do you mean

283
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,550
we can go to your place?

284
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,770

Let's take all our time.
