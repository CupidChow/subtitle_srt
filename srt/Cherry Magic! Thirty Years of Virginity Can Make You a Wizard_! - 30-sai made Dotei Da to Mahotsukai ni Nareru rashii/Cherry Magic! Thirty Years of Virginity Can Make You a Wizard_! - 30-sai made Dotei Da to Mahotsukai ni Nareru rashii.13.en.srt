he might not accept.

49

You're back.

51

60

to give you this.

Right then.

65

See you.

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,075
Ah, Adachi!

67
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,200
Here.

68
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,125

69
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:25,275

70
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:28,000
But I got it just for Adachi.

71
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,600
Could I?

72
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,551
Sure.

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,525
I don't like sweet things.

74
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you!

75
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,600

-A...
-Adachi.

82
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:39,229
Can I have a minute?

83
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,850
Just a bit. Yeah. Sorry.

84
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,300
-What's the matter?
- Sorry to bother.

85
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,725
I don't know...

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,875
how to do this.

87
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,400
How to do this?

88
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,325
Yeah.

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,975
Let's make it a surprise.

90
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,950

No, it can't be.

100
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,050
Then who could it be...

101
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,500
No way...

102

Welcome back.

120

I couldn't concentrate on work at all.

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,175
Who can it be?

122
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,650
Who gave Adachi the true love chocolates?

123
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,665
Ah!

124
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,225
It's so painful.

125
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,450
I would rather not to have this day.

129
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,475
Could I have this?

130
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,475
Of course, I made this for you.

131
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,975
I'm really overwhelmed!

132
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,025
I have never received this
from anyone except my mom.

133
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,350
I'll try it now.

134
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,675
It's not a bad day.

135
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,225
Ah. Try mine as well.

136
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:17,450
Yeah!

137
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,250
You said you don't like sweets.

138
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,325
So gave it a lot of thoughts and made this.

139
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,675
Let me try.

140
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,300

Stop it. Don't force yourself.

00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:11,650
I have two seniors that I really respect.

173
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,075
Rokkaku.

174
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,050
Yes.

175
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,450
Aren't you going to Tsukumo Trading?

176
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Go after you have read these.

177
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,300
(Year 2017)
You're the best, Kurosawa!

178
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,725
Thank you.

179
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,400
Kurosawa.

180
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,450
The first one is him.

181
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,318
Thank you.

182
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:31,796
-He is the top of the sales department.
-Thank you for the handouts.

183
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:34,525
-Kurosawa is awesome from the inside out.
-Not at all.

184
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,550
And the other one is...

185
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,450
Adachi!

186
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,475
Do you think this looks alright?

187
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,850
Huh? What is this?

188
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,925
And also, why me?

189
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,450
Haven't I said this?

190
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,925
The CEO here is so hard to please.

191
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,700
I need your advice.

192
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:02,850
Okay?

193
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,325
Well then.

194
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you!

195
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,150
This is the other one, Adachi.

196
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,525
He is low-profile but super considerate.

197
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,325
This pen! It is the same one with Kurosawa.

198
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,600
Ah, well, that...

199
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,800
I saw Adachi's and bought one.

200
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,050
Kurosawa.

201
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:31,000
It's really easy to use.

202
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,275
Right? Adachi?

203
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:33,975
Ah, yeah.

204
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,150
I see.

205
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:40,150
Right. About the handouts
for the sales meeting next week.

206
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,525
-Can we talk about this?
-Yeah, sure.

207
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:43,700
These two are

208
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,700
totally different from inside out.

209
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:49,775
But they got so close lately.

210
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,825
Ah, there you are!

211
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,025
They were also together then.

212
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,975
Ah, there you are!

213
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,325
That time as well.

214
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,175
What a small world!

215
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,775
Also, at that time.

216
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:14,925
At that time they were like...

217
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:17,311
You came to the office together this morning,
right?

218
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,793
It was a coincidence...

219
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:22,506
I am staying at Adachi's place for a few days.

220
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:24,500
It sounds so fun!

221
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,100
Can I go to your place too?

222
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,875
They can't just be ordinary colleagues.

223
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,687
Could it be

224
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,850
that they are...

225
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,775
Alright! In this case.

226
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:52,400
It's time to start the special mission
to find out the truth!

227
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,025
So it's for the meeting with Tsukumo Trading?

228
00:13:57,175 --> 00:13:57,975
Yeah.

229
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,500
And I am not sure which place to choose.

230
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,825
Here and here.

231
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,575
Which one do you think is better?

232
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,325
I don't really know about this...

233
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,650
Can you go with me next time?

234
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,750
It's kinda hard to go alone.

235
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,900
Yeah. That's fine by me.

236
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,250
Thanks!

237
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,125
I'll come along.

238
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,650
I know what their boss would like.

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,775
I'll also come and help out.

240
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,625
Thank you.

241
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,425
No problem.

242
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,650
Ah, tuna mayonnaise? Can I?

243
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:47,625
Of course.

244
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,900
Thank you.

245
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:50,925
Yay.

246
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:58,475
(Nutrition Drink)
Here.

247
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:00,875
Is it for me?

248
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:01,600
Yeah.

249
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,425
You've helped me so much.

250
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:07,175
Thank you.

251
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,250
So close, Rokkaku.

252
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,900
Adachi prefers this kind.

253
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,175
Ah, well. Right.

254
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:19,625
Hmmm.

255
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,825
Wh, what? That face...

256
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,251
Rokkaku.

257
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:29,659
As a salesman, you need to
precisely detect others' preference.

258
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,450
Remember.

259
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,500
Yes!

260
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,025
You made a grammar mistake here.

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,675
Ah, yeah I did.

262
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,225
Also, I have rephrased it here.

263
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,075
That's so helpful.

264
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,800
You are the right person to ask.

265
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,025
Do it by yourself next time.

266
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:54,600
What?

267
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,280
Don't say that. It's hurtful.

268
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,450
Why?

269
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,675
Huh? Ah, excuse me.

270
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,525
Hello.

271
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,800
If you have time to mess around, do your work.

272
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,250
What!!!

273
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,125
Adachi!

274
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,625
Thank you!

275
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,550
It is just as I thought.

276
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,750
(ME ADACHI KUROSAWA)

277
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
(ME ADACHI)
If I am with Adachi,

278
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,850
(KUROSAWA 100%)
Kurosawa will 100% show up.

279
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,375
That is to say,

280
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,050
Kurosawa always notices it when I'm with Adachi.

281
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,575
Ah. Why haven't I noticed this!

282
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,100
Just as I thought,

283
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,575
Kurosawa and Adachi are...

284
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,025
Ah, there you are!

285
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,600
Ah, there you are!

286
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:41,650
As a salesman, you need to
precisely detect others' preference.

287
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,750
I'll also come and help out.

288
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,700
They are working together,

289
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:00,850
To make me a good salesman!

290
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,750
Oh my, aren't I super lucky?

291
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,300
What are you grinning at?

292
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,350
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,550
Oh no.

294
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,650
I forgot I'm in a meeting.

295
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:21,150
That's all for the product display next season.

296
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Excuse me.

297
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,325
What about attracting new customers?

298
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,100
Then.

299
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,350
Let's put this at the cosmetic area.
