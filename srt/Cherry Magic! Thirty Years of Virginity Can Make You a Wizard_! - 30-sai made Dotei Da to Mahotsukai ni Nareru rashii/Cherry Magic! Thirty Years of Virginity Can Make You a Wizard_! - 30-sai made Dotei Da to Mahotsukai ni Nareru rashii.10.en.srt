It's so nice to have someone to greet

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,270
It's so nice to have someone to greet

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,275
days and nights.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,125
I'm happy for you, Tsuge.

5
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:17,550
Well, my room is getting crowded though,

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,150
since items are doubling.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, I'm happy for you.

8
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:32,250
Ah, I'm also going to buy a bike.

9
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,253
Actually, Minato said

10
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:40,375
that he wants to have a hobby he can enjoy with me.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,225
Really? I'm happy for you.

12
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,425
I'm really not a cycling kind of person.

13
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:51,300
But Minato said he really wanted to try with me.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,125
He always says adorable things.

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,600
Yep, right.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,625
-So happy for you.
-Don't you have anything else to say?

17
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:00,425
What?

18
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:03,800
You kept repeating that since a while ago.

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,300
Ah, sorry.

20
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,825
I was all about the competition.

21
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:09,575
(Design for stationary)

22
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:10,850
(Design for stationary)
Competition?

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,675
Yeah.

24
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,850
Thought I could give it a try.

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,987
I see.

26
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,375
Challenges make you go higher.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,125
You have all my support, Adachi.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,450
Thanks.

29
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:26,450
Since you're busy,

30
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,725
let me get to the point then.

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,575
Was all that not your point?

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,250
Adachi, I have

33
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,575
lost my magic.

34
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:39,025
Really?

35
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:40,275
Yeah.

36
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,600
The rumor is true.

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,425
So it is real.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,100
You will also lose your magic one day.
So don't worry.

39
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:53,975
Well, yeah.

40
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:58,350
Allow me to say something as your senior.

41
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,475
What?

42
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,475
People always use the word “lose”.

43
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:05,590
But you won't lose anything.

44
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,218
It's okay.

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,875
It's not that terrifying.

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,175
Even if you

47
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,425
said that...

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,175
You have applied for an entry already?

49
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,273
Yeah.

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I have to really go for it from now on!

51
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:33,975
Well then, we have to put our date aside for now.

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,700
What?

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,200
You have to focus on the competition, right?

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,300
I don't want to get in your way as well.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,023
Well, but...

56
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:43,075
I told you.

57
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,750
I'm the kind of person who saves the fun for later.

58
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,279
Then,

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,025
I'll also try my best to make it fun.

60
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:00,725
What?

61
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,000
What!

62
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,750
For the fun I've saved up,
I'm looking forward to the reward.

63
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,550
Reward?

64
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:27,875
He must mean that thing...

65
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,075
But I'm not ready by heart.

66
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:37,375
But if it is Kurosawa, I won't mind.

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,650
Why are you being so bashful!

68
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,950
I have to focus now!

69
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,700
Ah...But...

70
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,350
No, no. I have to work hard!

71
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,800

I've only got 3 days left.

Don't panic.

You've still got 3 days.

90
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,625
Exactly, work until you could satisfy.

91
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,300
Okay.

92
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:18,882
Ah.

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,550
Hey.

94
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,850
What do you think of this?

00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,525
Wow! It's not bad, right?

98
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,275
I also think it's interesting.

99
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,175
Really?

100
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,700
It's kinda ordinary.

101
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,675
Rokkaku!

102
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:47,950
That's not polite!

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,025
What? Was it not?

104
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,600
Is it ordinary?

105
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:56,300
I knew it.

106
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,175
Don't overthink?

107
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,625
Sometimes,

108
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,100
you'll have an inspiration out of nowhere.

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,025
Yeah.

110
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,975
This doesn't seem right.

111
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,300
Aah...

112
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,975
I'll leave it here.

113
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,350
Thanks...

114
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,825
Sorry about this.

115
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,575
You rarely have a day-off, but I...

116
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,025
But I'm just happy to be by your side.

117
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,350
I'll rest for a bit.

118
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,850
By the way, Rokkaku said yesterday.

119
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,712
Kurosawa!

120
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:11,850
What?

121
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,875
I'll work hard!

122
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,225
What happened?

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
I feel so motivated seeing Adachi like this!

124
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:23,525
He said he'll also work harder like Adachi.

125
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,550
Hmm.

126
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:30,700
What's wrong?

127
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,137
I'm glad to know, but,

128
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,350
I'm feeling the pressure on me.

129
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,975
Actually, yesterday before work ended...

130
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:44,400
See you tomorrow.

131
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:52,975
What?

132
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,800
Good luck with the competition.

133
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,050
Thanks.

134
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,075
See you.

135
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,225
See you tomorrow.

136
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,150
Adachi.

137
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:09,400
Ah, yeah.

138
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,500
I'll do the rest. You can go home now.

139
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,175
What? But.

140
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:17,550
See you tomorrow.

141
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,775
Don't you have to prepare for the competition?

142
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,175
Just go home now.

143
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,650
Urabe said that?

144
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,550
Well, ummm, yeah he did.

145
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,150
Fujisaki and Urabe

146
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,975
are both supporting you.

147
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,459
That's true, but

148
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,025
what if I can't live up to everyone's expectation?

149
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,475
You are a big deal, Kurosawa.

150
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,425
You can always live up to people's expectations.

151
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,300
Do you want to go out for a bit?

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,975
What?

153
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,500
Let's do some exercise for future dates.

154
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,750
Don't you think we are out of place?

155
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:40,575
Adachi.

156
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,275
Ah, again!

157
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:45,607
Look.

158
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,368
Look at this.

159
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,711
You're so mean.

160
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,530
Can I make it my wallpaper?

161
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,100
No.

162
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,175
Definitely not.

163
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:58,071
I'm gonna do that.

164
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:58,975
Why?

165
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,083
Ah this one, left, left.

166
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,510
There, there.

167
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,860
Adachi, there, there. That small one.

168
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,930
So good!

169
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,400
So good!

170
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,860
You got it on your face.

171
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:16,625
That matches you well.

172
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,750
That matches you too.

173
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,900
It's a hippo.

174
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,525
Well, it's cute.

175
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,950
-Very cute.
-You're doing this again!

176
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,535
Is that a video?

177
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,125
You found out.

178
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,350
Delete it!

179
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,785
No, no.

180
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,950
It's a hippo. Stop it.

181
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,175
Are you more relaxed now?

182
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,275
Yeah.

183
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:46,875
Thanks to you, I'm so refreshed now.

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,700
Thanks a lot.

185
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,725
I also had fun

186
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,550
practicing dating with you.

187
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,950
But isn't this just a typical date?

188
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:57,175
No, it's just an exercise.

189
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,975
What?

190
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,950
I want to make our date more special.

191
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,312
Because...

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,850
That is going to be your first date, isn't it?

193
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,800
Wow, a pirate ship!

194
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,325
Fabulous.

195
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,625
I have always wanted to ride one.

196
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,350
Shall we?

197
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,375
Aye!

198
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,500
-This is fun.
-A lot of fun.

199
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:54,625
The view is amazingly beautiful.

200

Are you okay?

201
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,426
Um... Yea...

202

Thank you.

203

I didn't know I would get so dizzy.

Killed the mood at the very end.

206
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,350
Kurosawa is probably disappointed, too.

207
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:37,275
Ruined our mock date which didn't come easy.

208
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,475
But... But I had a great time today.

209
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's do it again next time.

210
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

211
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,875
Is he... is he really upset?

212
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,800
No, Kurosawa is not that kind of person.

213
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,750
Must be that he is exhausted.

214
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,825
Kurosawa is tired too, aren't you?

215
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,200
I am okay.

216
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,690
Eh eh eh eh eh eh?

217
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,400
So he is actually mad?

218
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,000
I am doomed.

219
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,450
Don't know what he is thinking.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,214
Ah-hah.

Meant to cheer him up.
How could it turn out to be this way?

224
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,925
Didn't even notice that Adachi was feeling sick.

225
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,275
As much as I love the side of him
that is hard working,

226
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,268
when Adachi is with me,

227
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,975

Actually,

273
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,700
I have realized that

274
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,615
a while back

275
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,412
when I was with you

276
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,175
on the mock date.

277
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,450
I realized that it is important
to communicate your feelings

278
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,300
to the people who are important to you.

279
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,937
Because if you don't do so,

280
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,200
it may also put the other person at unease.

281
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,525
Right.

282
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:20,025
I

283
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,650
want to do things with Kurosawa
that make both of us happy.

284
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:30,200
Not that you habitually trying to make me happy.

285
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,285
If you are unhappy,

286
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,100
I'll also find dating is meaningless.

287
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,477
When you are with me,

288
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,428
I wish you are

289
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,025

290

291
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,175
Is that the reason

292
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,575
why you brought me
to the bookstore and the restaurant?

293
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:04,750
Disappointed?

294

No.

It's fun anywhere.

296
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,100
As long as I am with you.

297
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,900
In that case,

298
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:27,100
I must communicate what I am feeling as well.

299
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,325
You said it before, didn't you?

300
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,725
That I always meet everyone's expectation perfectly.

301
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,625
Right.

302
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,110
I have always tried to

303
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:45,350
figure out people's needs before taking actions.

304
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,750
Thinking if I could meet the needs of others perfectly,

305
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,450
it would allow them to see the real me.

306
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,260
So

307
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,900
I've grown accustomed to treat you the same way...

308
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,118
I am sorry.

309
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,207
Wound up making you worry about me.

310
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,275
No, not at all.

311
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,875
I am the one who has always been
obstinate and self-willed.

312
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:18,987
Once in a while,

313
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,900
you can be a little self-interested to me, too.

314

As much as l like the perfect Kurosawa,

when you are with me,

316
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:34,675
I wish you can be a little more relaxed.

317
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,485
But

318
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,900
I don't want you to find me annoying.

319
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,320
I won't get annoyed by you.

320
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:45,450
For real?

321
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,850
Of course.

322
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,100
Not gonna get scared if I burned a patty?

323
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:50,825
Knowing how to do it is impressive enough.

324
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:52,775
What about snoring too loud?

325
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,825
I snore loudly too.

326
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,075
What about showing nose hairs in the morning?

327
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,099
Absolutely no...

328
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:00,275
Umm... that's a little bit...

329
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,525
What are you doing?
It was a serious conversation.

330
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:07,275
Sorry. Sorry.

331
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,439
It was a great place.

332
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,025
Everything was delicious.

333
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,300
Awesome.

334
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,100
It's hard to get into that place
in December when it's overcrowded.

335
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,073

December?

337

Ah, that is right.

340
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:05,625
On Christmas Eve,

341
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:09,820
I'm gonna plan out a firework viewing
to make the first time the best time.

00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,150
I didn't know there's gonna be firework
on Christmas Eve.

343
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,325
Eh?

344
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,450
Eh?

345
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,750
Did I just say fireworks?

346
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,075
Oh no, I just spaced out!

347
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:25,750
Ah, yea, you did, you did.

348
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,175
What am I doing!

349
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,450
Supposed to be a surprise for you.

350
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:39,070
What should I do?

351
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,375
It's all my fault.

352
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,300
I haven't really thought about it until now, though.

353
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,650
But probably no one would want all their inner voice heard.

354
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,675
Can I keep it a secret as this goes on?

355
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,500
About that, I...

356
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,000
You had me worried there for a second.

357
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:03,875
For a moment I thought Adachi read my mind.

358
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,750
If my mind was read, I...

359
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:18,800
My... where is my phone?

360
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,250
That is right.

361
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:25,900
Even if it is Kurosawa,

362
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,675
if he finds out about the magic,

363
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:30,829
we certainly

364
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,690
can't be like this way anymore...

(Preview / Decided to seal the magic)
Do not rely on the magic too much!

376
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,500
(Decided to seal the magic)
No more mind reading, just myself.

Didn't know you have such corky personality.

380

I... there is something I have to tell you!
