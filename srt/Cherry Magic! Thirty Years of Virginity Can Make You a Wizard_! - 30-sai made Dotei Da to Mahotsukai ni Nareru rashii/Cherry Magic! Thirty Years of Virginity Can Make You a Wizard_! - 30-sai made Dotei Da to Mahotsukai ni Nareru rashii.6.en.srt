2
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,210
Why are you coming with us?

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,920
(30 minutes ago)
Why are you coming with us?

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,900
(30 minutes ago)

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,600
(30 minutes ago)
Cause I'm also staying at your place tonight.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Stop being so selfish!

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,070
Well, I'll get out of the car.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,660
Come on, you're sick now!

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,880
What?

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm sending Adachi home.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,570
So go back to your boyfriend's place.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,410
No.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,200
Stop acting like a child, sister.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,520
Sister?

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,600
Adachi, sorry for wasting your time
when you're uncomfortable.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,260
Ah, never mind.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,250
It's his sister.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,050
Adachi, are you living on your own?

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,620
Ah, yes.

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,860
Then, can Yuichi stay at your place to look after you?

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,480
What?

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,210
Sorry, my sister was too childish.

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,950
It's fine.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,050
Are you cold?

25
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,100
Go to bed...

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,150
Ku... Kurosawa?

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,650
Why is my heart beating so fast?

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,730
Isn't he sick now?

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,000
The only thing I should do
is taking care of him!

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,280
Maybe you have a fever.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,350
I go get the thermometer.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Excuse me.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,670
He's a nice guy indeed.

34
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,850
Then, why was I so scared?

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,120
Morning.

36
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,740
How are you feeling?

37
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,540
I think I'm feeling much better.

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,090
Great.

39
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,150
I will use your kitchen,
hope you won't mind

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,750
Wait, though my memories are blurred...

41
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,570
Thank you.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,970
Thanks for taking care of me.

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,300
I said it's not a big deal.

44
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,520
I made porridge, but can you eat now?

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,970
Yes.

46
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,590
Looks so delicious!

47
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,820
And, today I'll come back to my place.

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,730
Actually

49
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,020
you can stay here as long as you want.

50
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,720
Eh?

51
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,030
Cause, it seems like your sister has no place to go.

52
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,600
So, I want to thank you for looking after me.

53
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,350
I see.

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,670
Then, I guess I'll stay a little bit longer.

55
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,500
OK.

56
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Here.

57
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,620
Thanks.

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,450
Eh?

60
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,620
Ah, it spilled out.

61
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,240
The beginning of our sweet life!

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Careful not to be burned.

63
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,900

5 mins and 20 secs left.

79
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,550
It's my first time getting so nervous
about being off work.

80
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,920
On a day like this,
he just doesn't give me any extra work.

81
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,230
OK.

82
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,640
Thanks for cleaning it up.

83
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,740
Aaaah, what should I do?

84
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,460
What happened? Your hair is a mess.

85
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,940
Thanks.

86
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,800
OK.

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,730
Eh?

88
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,740
Why is Kurosawa here?

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,820
What time do you get off? Let's go home together.

90
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,330
He's waiting for me!

91
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,850
Give me a little more time, please.

92
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,480
Oh, Adachi here you are.

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,230
Where are you going with all these files?

94
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,050
Nope...

95
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Adachi! There you are.

96
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,530
Yea. The meeting just ended.

97
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,250
I see.

98
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,000
Rokkaku!

99
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,100
Kurosawa and Adachi, you're really close friends.

100
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,600
You came to the office together this morning, right?

101
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,930
He saw us?

102
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,250
It was a coincidence...

103
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,750
I am staying at Adachi's place for a few days.

104
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,200
What? Just say it so easily?

105
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,900
It sounds so fun!

106
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,280
Can I go to your place too?

107
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,400
Eh?

108
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,100
Let me join you.

109
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,900
We're also good friends, right?

110
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,920
But think about that.

111
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,600
Won't it be annoying
if too many people go to his place?

112
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,470
If Rokkaku comes, it means...

113
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,650
OK.

114
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,730
What?

115
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,050
Really?

116
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,730
Yes.

117
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll definitely let you have fun!

118
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,880
Great!

119
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,050
What should we eat?

120
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,630
Anything will do for me.

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,780
Then I can avoid "our sweet life", for now.

122
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,050
Something refreshing, like hot pot?

123
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,950
Sounds fine.

124
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,830
-I have a lot of video games.
-Sounds good.

125

The one who said that

127
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,900
was it Nietzsche? Or Shakespeare?

128
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,850
Anyway, it seems I'm not an exception.

Here is your parcel. Sign please.

Thank you. Have a nice day.

136
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,600
He's not the only delivery person.

137
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,600

I brought your parcel.

143

And I packaged them into one box.

144
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
-One box?
-Yes.

145

Thank you.

146
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,380

Did he change the delivery area?

149
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,780
Or it's not his working hours?

150
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,230
It can't be...

151
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,600
I knew you had a crush on me.

152
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,400

OK. Adachi, ah.

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,900
Aaaah.

160
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,650
Oh, it's so soft inside.

161

Good.

162
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,300
Well, not bad.

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,030
It's my turn.

171
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,430
OK.

172
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,630
Kurosawa?

173
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,180
OK, enjoy.

174
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,900
Looks so great!

175
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,380
Is this Ahijo?

176
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,450
Hope you will like them.

177
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,450
Bon appetit.

178
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,430
So tasty!

179
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,080
The plate.

180
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,930
OK.

181
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,750
He's feeling like a taste of something
other than sauce.

182
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,600
About Adachi, I know everything!

183
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,920
Eh?

184
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,670
And his "tasty" is all mine!

185
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,170
Th... thanks.

186
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,750
But, was I being too childish?

187
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,240
Rokkaku, want more?

188
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,850
Thanks!

189
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,300
Being jealous of Rokkaku

190
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,630
and also of Fujisaki in the workplace.

191
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,900
I shouldn't be like that.

192
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,650
This explains

193
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,270
why he acted like that...

194
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,570
Kurosawa is quite cute.

195
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,250
By the way, I noticed that a while ago.

196
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,230
Aren't there too many stationeries
at Adachi's home?

197
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,830
Ah, well.

198
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,770
You caught that.

199
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,930
I have a really keen sense
of smell about things like that.

200
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,530
When I was in college,

201
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,850
the fellow in the club
added porn site into the favorites

202
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,200
I found it out immediately.

203
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,680
That's totally a different thing.

204
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,430
You're right.

205
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,530
What club were you in?

206
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,500
Dance club.

207
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,760
Look.

208
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,080
Wow.

209
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,130
Seems like you were pretty serious about it.

210
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,220
Yes.

211
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,790
You don't dance now?

212
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,100
No.

213
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,030
The best dancer in that club
is still holding onto it though.

214
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,950
It's important to learn to give up, isn't it?

215
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,530
Look, this one.

216
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,870
Why did I bring up the topic of giving up?

217
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,650
Lame.

218
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,320
Well, it's simply because I had no gift for that.

219
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,900
-The best dancer…
-That's also great.

220
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,070
Aren't you trying to be the best one
in the Sales Department now?

221
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,900
Finding a new dream, and trying your best for it.

222
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,480
I think it's super cool.

223
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,380
People like me, don't have any gift or dream.

224
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,050
Just being alive but not living.

225
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,350
Yes.

226
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,520
How I envy you.

227
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,770
Thank you.

228
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,870
Right.

229
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
Why not put in spicy sauce and play roulette?

230
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,480
Actually, I also bought a habanero!

231
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,620
Noisy Rokkaku!

232
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,170
Em?

233
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,530
Envy Rokkaku, seriously?

234
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,270
Eh?

235
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,450
Why are you so unconfident?

236
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,550
Just stop saying, "people like me"!

237
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,470
Cause you are

238
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,850
the most special one to me.

239
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,520
Oh my.

240
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,700
What was he doing?

241
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,270
What was I doing?

242
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,170
Kurosawa?

243
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,920
Aaaah noisy!

244
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,600
Leaving home without any words?

245
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,500
That's not like him.

246
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,550
(Thanks for concern)
(You got up so early! At least tell me before you leave.)

247
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,300
(Thanks for concern)
The message was read but not responded.

248
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,000
(Thanks for concern)
(You got up so early! At least tell me before you leave.)

249
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,270
Must be the thing happened last night.

250
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,150
What was I doing?

251
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,600
Is he feeling bad because of me?

252
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,270
What time do you get off?
Let's go home together.

253
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,720
Well, I was thinking too much.

254
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,400
The ahijo you made yesterday, was really tasty.

255
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,220
Though it can't compete with the porriadge
you made another day.

256
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,730
For me,

257
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,640
this is the first time I've had someone
other than my family

258
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,600
make porridge for me when I have a cold.

259
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,170
I was so moved...

260
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,700
Em?

261
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,350
What, Kurosawa?

262
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,520
Is that a bit of an exaggeration?

263
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,970
Nope.

264
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,770
I see.

265
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,220
I might burden people with things like.

266
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,050
What? Adachi didn't have any girlfriend before?

267
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,800
That's what I heard.

268
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
-I see.
-Really?

269
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,000
It might be a burden.

270
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,370
That's too mean.

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,650
Most people my age, had been
looked after by their lovers, right?

272
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,900
Kurosawa?

273
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,020
The one who can be your lover, is so lucky.

274
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,100
Eh?

275
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,570
Dating, having dinner together

276
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
holding your hands.

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,050
That person will have all of your first times, right?

278
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,550
That person must be very happy.

279
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,800
If it was me, I'd be thrilled.

280
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,820
I don't need to stay at your place anymore.

281
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,420
-But your sister…
-I can't stand being with you like this anymore.

282
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,870
What?

283
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,850
I,

284
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,170

(Preview)
I didn't take any time to fall for him.

296
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,010
(Kurosawa makes his mind)
I have known it.

297
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,880
(Kurosawa makes his mind)
One day, I will have to end all this feeling.

298
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,130
(Adachi gives his answer)
I can't help thinking about it.

299
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,330
(Adachi gives his answer)
All about him, everything!

300
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,970
(Adachi gives his answer)
