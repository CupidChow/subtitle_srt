Hi, everyone!

Today we've come to this coffee shop called HWC Roasters.

This is the shop manager of HWC Roasters, Yan Zhao Gang.

You have no idea how ridiculous it was yesterday.

Of course.

He hasn't explained it to me at all since yesterday.

64

Are you speaking in his favor? All men are the same.

Where's Cheng Luo? I want her to be the judge.

I seriously think the fact that Jin Yu Zhen made that damn Single Rule…

84

I think he must be mentally ill.

85
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,859
Usually, people become mentally ill

86
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,609
due to something that happened in the past

87
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,999
or hidden secrets.

88
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,149
So if we find out about it,

89
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,709
we will have bargaining chips.

90
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,850
The best person for this job is...

91
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,919
But I don't want to live with him. Why me?

92
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,739
You're the closest to him.

93
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:32,479
Listen to me. No matter how reserved someone is, they'll loosen up at some point.

94
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,259
That's why, as long as you don't move out,

95
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,839
you can keep monitoring him after work. Then—

Then... Then...

97
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:42,039
There's nothing you can do about things from the past.

98
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,679
If he's in an on-again, off-again relationship, then we can sit back and enjoy the show.

99
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:48,069
But isn't it a waste of time if we end up finding nothing at all?

100

If you were hungry, and there was a table full of delicious food right in front of you,

166
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,220
- would you wait until the food cools down before eating?
- What?

167
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,619
Of course not. I eat hot food for sure.

168
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:15,219
Exactly. If we didn't advertise now,

169
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:16,990
the food would cool down.

170
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,939
But we have many materials with nickel.

171
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,789
Time is really tight if you want everything gone by the end of this month.

172
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,369
It's hard for you to immediately come up with ideas when you lack experience.

173
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,960
- I think you—
- Don't stick your nose in my business!

174
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,699
Oh,

175
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,279
Wu Si Qi has just qualified as a lecturer, right?

176
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,359
So what?

177
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,529
He has achieved it without even finishing school, not bad at all.

178
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,949
Let him start gaining hands-on experience.

179
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:47,079
Arrange for him to take the design studio's classes when time permits.

180
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,170
Use up the raw materials simultaneously.

181
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,960
Then... I will go back and work.

182
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,250
You can do it.

183
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,289
Hi, we are from Jingcherng Metalwork and Design.

184
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:27,389
This is our latest project, where we use only titanium-based hypoallergenic metals.

185
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:30,479
We have a course where you can make accessories out of metal wire.

186
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,279
I think it's especially suitable for you both.

187
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,779
If you're interested, you can come over here and fill out an application form.

188
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,679
Hi, Sir. We are from Jingcherng Metalwork and Design.

203
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Wang Jing, this time our ores may...

204
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
Wang Jing.

205
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,000
This time our ores...

206
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,620
Bai Xiao Qian.

207
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,700
Senior.

208
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,980
It has been so long since I last saw you.

209
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,439
When did you come back?

210
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:27,909
At the end of last year. You know, because of the pandemic.

211
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,369
I did hear news of you from time to time.

212
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:31,739
But...

213
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:35,230
where did you go these past two, three years?

214
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,810
Senior, you're still the same. You haven't changed much.

215
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,329
As for you, you've changed a lot.

216
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,670
Really?

217
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,169
People from the craft workshop often eat here.

218
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,299
But...

219
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:58,859
the "Director Jin" that they describe

220
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:02,520
is very different from the one I know.

221
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,339
You finished work already.

222
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,330
Why don't you head home and rest?

223
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,210
Today... I want to go home later.

224
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,600
Let me know if you want to eat something.

225
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,980
He moved out quickly.

226
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,350
What are you looking at?

227
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
- Why are you still here?
- Why not?

228
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,069
Didn't you ask me to give you one day to move out?

229
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,309
So... are you kicking me out now?

230
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,220
Weren't you the one insisting on moving out?

231
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,959
But on second thought,

232
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,009
if I move out right now,

233
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,679
isn't that exactly what you want?

234
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,949
I'm the most experienced employee of the craft workshop, after all.

235
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,009
It is also my right to live here, isn't it?

236
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,340
Didn't you say so yourself?

237
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,399
- What are you doing?
- This is mine.

238
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,710
It doesn't hurt to let me borrow it to dry myself with.

239
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,800
Use this instead.

240
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,450
Are you a pervert?

241
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,419
I'm not leaving anyway.

242
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,180
I will keep an eye on you.

243
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,490
- Your food is ready.
- Thank you.

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,020
Is your class finished?

245
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,360
Yes.

246
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,049
I haven't seen this dish before.

247
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:31,340
Of course. It is the chef's special.

248
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,140
Do you want one?

249
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,280
I want two.

250
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,090
It isn't a good idea to eat that much.

251
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,820
Are you that stressed lately?

252
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm so stressed that I'm questioning my life.

253
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,360
This dish is absolutely delicious.

254
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
You can cook this at home.

255
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,150
There are more ingredients in the shop than in my home.

256
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,970
I will try my best.

257
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,210
Did you invite Si Qi to your place?

258
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,970
Yes, he's a little tenant.

259
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,490
Is Wu Si Qi staying at your house?

260
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,460
That night, he was crying alone in the park.

261
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,519
After figuring out what happened, I told him

262
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,759
to move in with me. No big deal.

263
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,539
Did you cry? Did you dare to cry?

264
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:33,870
Why don't you look at who I live with? I should be the one crying.

265
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,580
I really want to move out, too.

266
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,360
Sorry, there are no rooms left.

267
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,969
Yeah. You also have a mission.

268
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:50,009
If you move in with us, Big Sis Qian will...

269
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,829
I surely will.

270
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,910
Focus on your food.

271
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,880
Just a minute. The food will be ready soon.

272
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,530
Do you happen to be heading home, too?

273
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,920
Yes.

274
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,020
What's with all these knives?

275
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,989
The third Home-sharing Rule says

276
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:43,129
the kitchen is first come, first served.

277
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:44,860
Sorry.

278
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,770
I'm full.

279
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,560
What's wrong?

280
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,380
What are you doing?

281
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,870
Stay still.

282
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,560
The wound is so small.

283
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,250
I got hurt, not you.

284
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,069
I can take care of this myself.

285
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:30,140
I know how to handle knife wounds better than you do.

286
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,300
Aren't you curious to know why I wear gloves?

287
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,690
What... What will you do?

288
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,499
Because this way, I won't leave any fingerprints.

289
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,440
You pervert!

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,819
So do you live with a perverted killer now?

291
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:08,239
Are you doubting me now?

292
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm looking at it as a crime solver.

293
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,019
What are you laughing at?

294
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,330
Are you smirking, too?

295
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,000
Did you do the inventory count of the materials that contain or are plated with nickel?

296
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,420
Of course.

297
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,700
One more thing. Come with me.

298
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,149
The purchase and compilation of minerals should be made in the last week of this month.

299
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,199
That's how we stock up on materials for spring.

300
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,430
Why isn't there any progress at all?

301
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,070
Wang Jing is the one who is in charge of this.

302
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,599
He's still not back to himself.

303
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,150
The reason is...

304
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,199
Didn't Bai Xiao Qian help Wang Jing out?

305
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,919
They're not on speaking terms.

306
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,940
As for the reason...

307
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,179
Fine.

308
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,209
Wu Si Qi is just getting on track so we will talk about him later.

309
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,700
What about you?

310
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:15,899
You're too focused on helping Wang Jing out

311
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,539
to handle the companies that have cooperated with us.

312
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,779
We've lost almost all the orders to our competitors.

313
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm not to blame, am I?

314
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,410
Forget it.

315
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,010
I'll come up with ways to get more orders.

316
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,669
Director, you seem very confident in yourself.

317
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,059
Do you dare to make a bet?

318
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,680
- I don't get it.
- You and me.

319
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,400
Let's make a bet. Do you dare?

320
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,030
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

321
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,090

00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,059
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

328
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,609
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

329
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,929
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

330
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,919
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

331
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,969
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

332
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,729
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

333
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:34,769
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

334
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:38,699
♫ Are irresistible ♫

335
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,739
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

336
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:45,819
♫ I do, do, do. We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

337
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:48,379
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

338
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,609
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

339
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:55,249
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

340
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,989
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh ♫

341
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:58,930
Then what do you want?

342
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,440
To eat you up.
