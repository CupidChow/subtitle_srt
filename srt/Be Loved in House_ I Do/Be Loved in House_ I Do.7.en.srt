165
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,659
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

166
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,799
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

167
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,469
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

168
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,539
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

169
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,460
♫ Are irresistible ♫

170
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,469
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

171
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,200
♫ I do, do, do ♫

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,660
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

173
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,059
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

174
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:55,399
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

175
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,909
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

176
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:04,729
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh. Every best moment ♫

177
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,449
Here you are.

178
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,030
Thank you.

179
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,690
Thank you.

180
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,840
Should I get you a beer instead?

181
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,300
Is it about work?

182
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,880
Then it has to do with my junior schoolmate.

183
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,270
How can I help you without you telling me?

184
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,699
Big Bro Gang, you also didn't tell me when I asked you.

185
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,219
Hey, Big Bro Gang.

186
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:58,049
Aren't you dating anyone?

187
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,669
I've always been a wanderer.

188
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:02,310
I've never made

189
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,909
whatever I'm losing stay.

190
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:10,250
Then do you know how he got his scar?

191
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,089
I remember when he was in university,

192
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,209
he didn't have the scar you mentioned.

193
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,499
But I heard that he was in a car crash later on.

194
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,860
A car crash...

195
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,140
- That serious?
- Yes.

196
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,699
That point in time was too much of a coincidence.

197
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,640
What point in time?

198
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,849
You seem concerned about him lately.

199
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:36,240
Not like you're purposely prying.

200
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,200
I just want to see if I really did something wrong.

201
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,470
Do you mean forcing him to handle the order?

202
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,750
Was I very mean that day?

203
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,579
He has been in bad shape recently, which everyone should already know.

204
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,039
As far as I know, he has been in love only once.

205
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,469
They met in university,

206
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:17,399
but after I graduated, I started hearing news about them.

207
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,610
I didn't know until then that he got dumped.

208
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,559
So... the car crash happened after that?

209
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,449
When I saw him again this time,

210
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:29,140
I found him a little different.

211
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,509
I believe it has to do with that.

212
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,809
Does even the Single Rule

213
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,440
have to do with this?

214
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,810
Since you live together, why don't you ask him yourself?

215
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,969
Si Qi, don't tell Wang Jing and Xiao Qian about it for now.

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,240
Don't you tell them!

217
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,039
I never thought that he could be more fragile than I expected.

218
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,469
I feel that Big Bro Lei is stronger.

219
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,989
You never give up every time you fail after confessing your feelings.

220
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:10,109
When you fail again, you're going to have more experience points.

221
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:11,769
Wow, Wu Si Qi.

222
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,139
You've been single for twenty-two years since you were born. You haven't even kissed anyone.

223
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,029
Now you're telling me about love.

224
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,040
Too early for that.

225
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,340
Was that your first kiss?

226
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,240
What do you mean by "first kiss"?

227
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,930
No, no, no, n-n-not like that.

228
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,320
When did you two start dating?

229
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,939
Big Bro Gang,

230
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,590
Si Qi has seen very little of the world.

231
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,290
Why do you think it wasn't him who took the initiative?

232
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,329
Little Qi Qi, you—

233
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,949
Hey, objection!

234
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,579
Objection overruled.

235
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,189
- I'm going into the kitchen.
- All right.

236
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:11,380
It was me. It was me who took the initiative.

237
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,479
Exactly.

238
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,979
I'm going blind. I'm going blind. I'm going blind.

239
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:18,579
I'm blinded by your public display of affection.

240
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,829
Those who are in love

241
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,250
can't hide their thoughts.

242
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,730
We're going to have afternoon tea after visiting your dad's grave.

243
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,479
I'll carry it. Don't force yourself.

244
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,319
Mom, just leave it to me.

245
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,869
Why are you absent-minded?

246
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,719
Are you in a hurry to go back?

247
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,539
I'm not.

248
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,370
What did I just say then? What?

249
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,479
Let me ask you.

250
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:05,609
Why did you urgently clear the fridge before going out yesterday?

251
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,829
Because I left the food in the fridge for a long time.

252
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:10,729
Only one day.

253
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:13,879
Also, you cleared your zone only.

254
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,809
Because I didn't want to clear Jin Yu Zhen's zone.

255
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:20,140
You replaced it all with food that Little Zhen can eat.

256
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,989
Mom, you have no idea how ridiculous he's been the past few days.

257
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,240
But you know it very well.

258
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,039
Even if there was some conflict between you two,

259
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,739
don't be stubborn whenever you have a chance to reconcile.

260
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,549
You obviously really care about him, right?

261
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,060
I don't care about him that much!

262
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,989
I can go by myself.

263
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,399
Mom, let me go with you.

264
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:46,969
No, you don't come to visit your dad's grave with me every year anyway.

265
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:49,279
I can go by myself. Head home now.

266
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,210
- Don't follow me.
- No, Mom.

267
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,270
I'm back.

268
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,060
What are you doing?

269
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,280
What did you eat?

270
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,049
I'm fine.

271
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,750
You're answering the previous question.

272
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,399
I don't know.

273
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,159
You're already incoherent.

274
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,639
I... I...

275
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:49,680
I've already answered.

276
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,350
Why did you run away?

277
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,280
Can't you say "thank you"?

278
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,990
Uh-huh.

279
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,019
Uh-huh. "Uh-huh" again.

280
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,040
I can take care of it myself.

281
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,820
Sit down.

282
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,219
I've already replaced the food in the fridge.

283
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,420
Yet you still ate something wrong.

284
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,469
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,719
I'm from Krypton.

286
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:54,009
Aliens don't understand Earth's languages.

287
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,009
What are you talking about?

288
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:58,210
Can you talk normally?

289
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,990
I'm just joking.

290
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,480
Sorry.

291
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,679
When I was little,

292
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,239
my parents also scratched my back like this.

293
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,880
When I scratch your scar,

294
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,559
does it hurt?

295
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,490
Did you see it?

296
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,270
Does it have a story?

297
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,559
No.

298
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,150
No? It doesn't hurt to let me in a little.

299
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,999
Then...

300
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,829
- Are you willing to tell me?
- Tell you what?

301
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:10,110
You've been failing to confess your feelings...

302
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,890
Sorry, I'll take a look at it.

♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

326
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,419
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

327
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,829
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

328
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:58,229
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

329
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,619
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

330
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,499
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

331
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,749
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

332
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:10,469
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

333
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:13,479
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

334
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:17,400
♫ Are irresistible ♫

335
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,489
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

336
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:22,259
♫ I do, do, do ♫

337
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,479
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

338
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,049
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

339
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,319
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

340
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,429
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

341
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,809
This time

342
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,159
I'm coming for you.

343
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,400
♫ Every best moment ♫
