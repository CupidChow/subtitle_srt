165
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,500
Don't leave me.

166
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,470
Okay?

167
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,539
Please!

168

Don't leave me.

170
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,450

be it work or love.

191
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,000
But

192
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,310
you look like you keep moving forward.

193
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,029
In reality,

194
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,500
you are stuck in seven years ago.

195
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,820
Real,

196
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,919
it was quite a while after your accident

197
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,330
when I found out about it.

198
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,990
Does it still hurt?

199
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,679
Later on, I heard from Chairman Mai

200
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,039
that you took over the design studio.

201
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,789
Those who are married should quit.

202
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,039
Those with romantic relationships should quit, too.

203
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,010
Then I knew that I had to personally come to resolve it.

204
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,880
Just tell me the conclusion.

205
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,450
This piece is named "Fragrance of B612".

206
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,990
This time...

207
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,270
it's my turn to look for you.

208
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,199
I knew

209
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,160
someone could save you.

210
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,109
I couldn't confirm

211
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:32,509
until I met him face-to-face.

212
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,880
That person was Shi Lei.

213
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,729
I heard from Chairman Mai

214
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,079
that you all find Real very hard to get along with.

215
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,050
At first, we didn't get along indeed.

216
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,030
But I realized later

217
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,939
that's how he cares about people.

218
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,989
Also, he often quietly

219
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,800
cares about people in his own way.

220
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,770
He's often stubborn as well.

221
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,710
He doesn't say it,

222
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,610
but he's super scared of losing

223
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,120
and getting hurt.

224
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,529
Did you know while you were describing him just now

225
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,930
your eyes were twinkling like stars?

226
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,929
It's you.

227
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,700
I think you're a good match.

228
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,389
Hi.

229
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,759
Did you wait long?

230
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,510
Not really long. It's only 9...

231
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,840
We agreed. Don't forget that.

232
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,719
But... why do I need to trick Jin Yu Zhen?

233
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,829
Not trick him, but test him.

234
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,020
Don't you want to know what he's thinking about?

235
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,940
If he wants to say it, he would've done it already.

236
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,989
He needs someone to push him.

237
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,550
But I don't want him to get hurt.

238
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,629
Then protect him.

239
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,709
Let him know that you two are the only ones for each other.

240
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,579
He'll become fearless.

241
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,250
You, too.

242
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,150
Let's go.

243
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,179
I have a feeling

244
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,039
that Real will bring you a mind-blowing answer.

245
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,270
Shi Lei!

246
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,299
Before then,

247
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,979
I hope you'll relax as much as you can,

248
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,510
otherwise, you probably won't be able to take it.

249
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,700
Jin Yu Zhen.

250
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,679
Shi Lei,

251
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,329
Real,

252
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,429
I wish you both a happy life.

253
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:21,370
We'll keep in touch.

254
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,579
I got you!

255
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,439
- What?
- Say it.

256
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,059
How are you going to prank me again?

257
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,490
What do you mean?

258
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,810
Don't pretend!

259
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,609
How are you and Yi Zi Tong going to prank me?

260
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,400
We aren't going to prank you.

261
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,009
Just a little joke.

262
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:53,180
A joke that almost scared me to death.

263
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,979
But you look pretty good.

264
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,579
Oh, I've had surgery before. My heart is fragile.

265
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,589
Of course.

266
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,530
What now?

267
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,319
Can you feel

268
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,640
my arrhythmia? I need first aid.

269
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,810
Do you feel better this way?

270
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,460
It doesn't seem enough. I need more first aid.
