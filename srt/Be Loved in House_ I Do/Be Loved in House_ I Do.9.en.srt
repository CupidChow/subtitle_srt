00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,120
Why not?

168
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,339
I don't want to affect your work,

169
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,389
for you to give up doing what you love

170
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,110
because of me.

00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:46,299
I really like you a lot.

177

♫ Why do you always apologize to me? ♫

178

I know.

00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:51,909
With you by my side,

180
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,399
I have no fear at all.

187
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,399
Did Si Qi come to work today?

188
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,169
- He did.
- Where is he?

189
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,009
Just now, he suddenly went into the director's room.

190
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,860
I don't know what's going on.

191
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,969
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

192
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:43,079
Big Bro Lei,

193
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,779
I've thought it over.

194
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,680
Wu Si Qi.

195
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,130
Big Bro Zhao Gang and I are in a relationship.

196
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,669
Thank you all

197
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:58,790
for taking care of me all this time.

198
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,750
- Jin Yu Zhen.
- I've said that Wu Si Qi knows what he's doing.

199
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,580
I also know what I'm doing.

200
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,009
This is just between the three of us,

201
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,849
don't tell anyone else at the design studio.

202
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,549
- But... Big Bro Zhao Gang also knows—
- Tell him to shut up.

203
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,200
That's it.

204
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,179
Why don't you go back to work now?

205
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,080
Thank you, Director.

206
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,590
That's my limit.

207
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:55,329
- Why did you do this?
- No reason.

208
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,129
- Why don't you just abandon the rule?
- Impossible.

209
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:00,279
That's the rule.

210
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,259
Why exactly are you so persistent?

211
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,559
- No reason.
- No reason?

212
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,529
Jin Yu Zhen.

213
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,739
Why do you have to push yourself so hard?

214
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:13,489
Say it if something's wrong. I'll help you out.

215
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,150
- Or you're still mad at me, aren't you?
- That's enough!

216
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,680
Have you thought about our relationship?

217
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,609
You have your mid-term exams the day after tomorrow, but you seem to be slacking.

218
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,259
I started preparing a long time ago.

219
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,669
Let me relax a bit.

220
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,210
Meow.

221
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,979
Now we have two cats to watch the shop.

222
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:38,051
Or one of them watches the shop, and the other takes care of the home.

223
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,119
Tonight I'll give you canned food.

224
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,389
Why would you do this to me?

225
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,579
I want the chef's special menu,

226
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,830
which has everything.

227
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,450
Hi, Director.

228
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,980
What would you like to eat today?

229
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,980
I'd like...

230
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,050
What do you want?

231
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,940
The same food as his.

232
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,640
Okay.

233
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,419
I haven't ordered yet.

234
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,069
What do they want to order?

235
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,920
Not important. Just watch.

236
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,670
I want some time to myself.

237
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,469
If you have any worries,

238
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:36,870
- you can tell me.
- I don't want to...

239
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,840
What's wrong?

240
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,570
What did you eat?

241
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,710
Sit down.

242
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,110
Does it feel better now?

243
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,910
Yes.

244
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,389
You did a good job with the proposal today.

245
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,880
- That's what I should do.
- You've improved.

246
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,390
Director.

247
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,550
We will go eat at another restaurant.

248
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,819
- Hey, Wan...
- Wan Wan!

249
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,099
Cheng Luo, watch the shop. We will go out and look for it.

250
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,320
- Okay.
- Wan Wan!

251
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,599
Oh, no! Wan Wan's missing!

252
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,639
- What should we do?
- What should we do? No response from anyone.

253
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,699
Let's play our trump card.

254
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:43,739
Everyone, please! Wan Wan is super cute!

255
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,909
Please hurry up and help look for Wan Wan!

256
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,909
Wan Wan is a really cute cat.

257
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,449

It's wonderful, isn't it?

There's the same atmosphere between the shop manager and Si Qi.

Is it that obvious?

318
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,699

that I like guys?

320
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,569
Big Bro Lei,

321
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,700
I have Xiao Qian already.

322
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,029

I'm not into you.

324

Honestly,

325
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:05,089
the fact that you told me that directly scared me.

326
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,369
But when it comes to this kind of thing,

327
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:10,389
you usually talk to Xiao Qian, don't you?

328
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,909
I can't talk to her now.

329
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:14,799
Why not?

330
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,459
Nothing. We're both guys

331
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:19,750
so I want to see what you think.

332
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,989
I don't find it strange.

333
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:26,239
We live in a different time now.

334
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,790
Just be yourself.

335
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,219
That's right.

336
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:36,459
But it was already hard for me to confess to girls before,

337
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:38,149
not to mention guys.

338
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,339
It has nothing to do with gender.

339
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:44,759
Heterosexual relationships aren't necessarily easy and smooth.

340
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,219
The so-called obstacles are actually created by yourself.

341
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,959
I'm not good at talking,

342
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,879
I can talk to Xiao Qian for you.

343
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,510
You don't need to.

344
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,780
I know what to do. Thank you.

345
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,899
♫ How much do I like you? ♫

346
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:14,180
♫ When do we talk about love? ♫

347
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,119
♫ Now we're lying on the roof ♫

348
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,140
Jin Yu Zhen, I have something to...

349
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,049
It's been so long since I last saw you, Jin Yu Zhen.

350
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,859
♫ Maybe no reasons are needed. I'm just lonely ♫

351
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:25,999
Or should I call you Real?

352
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,769
♫ The awkward conversation turned out to feel warm ♫

353
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:30,899
♫ What is our progress? ♫

354
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,840
♫ To tell you I love you ♫

355
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,890
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

356
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,950
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

357
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,629
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

358
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:51,059
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

359
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,619
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

360
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,909
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

361
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,159
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

362
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,649
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

363
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,149
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

364
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,429
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

365
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,439
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

366
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:12,529
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

367
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:15,329
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

368
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:22,229
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes are irresistible ♫

369
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:25,309
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

370
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,079
♫ I do, do, do ♫

371
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,439
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

372
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,829
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

373
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:35,209
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

374
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,739
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

375
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:41,239
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh. ♫

376
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,749
♫ Every best moment ♫

377
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,520
Can you be in a serious relationship with me?

378
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,580
Yes, I can.
