00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,480
What does it have to do with you?

164
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,109
You're right. All right then.

165
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,050
Please leave.

166
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,710
Oh,

167
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,740
put it back up for me.

168
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,140
[HWC Roasters]

169
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,079
Let me know if you need anything.

170
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,630
Thank you.

171
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,080
Does she look pretty?

172
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,730
What?

173
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,269
Who let you order tea?

174
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,519
I'm in a bad mood. Why don't you have a drink with me?

175
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,900
Shi Lei, have a glass.

176
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,100
Shop manager, how do we deal with this?

177
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,349
Go to the stockroom and grab a few more bottles of red wine.

178
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,599
It will be fine after she finishes vomiting.

179
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,300
Got it.

180
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,219
What about you?

181
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,200
Do you want a glass?

182
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,099
How about this?

183
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:37,649
No added sugar.

184
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,559
The sweetness comes from the oats.

185
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,029
But I don't like the taste.

186
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,629
Don't worry. If you only drink this, it won't have that thick, greasy taste.

187
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,239
Only the refreshing smell of oats.

188
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,569
Even lactose intolerant people can drink it.

189
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,829
But I'm not.

190
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,609
Then you can get more calcium and dietary fiber.

191
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,159
Since you're still growing,

192
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,629
I think you need it.

193
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:00,380
Let me pour you some then.

194
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,450
This is my first piece of copper wire-wrapped sculpture.

195
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,889
Pretty good. I will buy it from you.

196
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,609
That's fine. This is for you.

197
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,099
Then I will treat you to a meal.

198
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,079
I also want to celebrate your first day of work

199
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,479
after qualifying as a lecturer.

200
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,180
Great!

201
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:43,439
Wu Si Qi, hurry up and help me out!

202
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,809
Drink wine...

203
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,009
Hey!

204
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,850
- We will eat next time.
- Okay.

205
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,509
Wu Si Qi! Hey! Come back! You jerk!

206
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:56,720
Give me another glass!

207
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,500
Let's drink.

208
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,499
There you go.

209
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,379
Don't drink too much.

210
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,550
You're really a good man compared to Wang Jing.

211
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,180
Hey!

212
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,439
You should cherish

213
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:15,189
this good man.

214
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,779
Bai Xiao Qian!

215
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,539
I'll tell you what, every time he comes here for a meal, it's because of—

216
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,999
She's drunk. She's like this every time she gets drunk.

217
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,550
Drink wine. Drink wine.

218
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,190
I have an idea.

219
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,739
Today I will start packing.

220
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:40,099
I will move back home tomorrow.

221
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,759
What kind of man is Wang Jing?

222
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,540
Wang Jing, go eat poop!

223
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,580
It's fine now.

224
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,009
Bai Xiao Qian even said she was a good drinker.

225
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,550
The way she vomited was so disgusting.

226
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,950
Jin Yu Zhen?

227
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,640
Remember to come to work tomorrow.

228
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,239
Wait a minute.

229
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,170
Why are you here?

230
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,889
- From now on, I will live here.
- But we already live here.

231
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,389
That's why I made him move out.

232
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,639
- Why?
- Originally, your former boss

233
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,049
had the property rights to this building.

234
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,509
- I took over everything.
- But I said we already live here.

235
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,350
It has nothing to do with me.

236
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,489
- What can he do then?
- Look for a place to live first.

237
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:45,109
If there's anything else, I can help contact moving companies.

238
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:47,679
I can also help look for a place for him to live.

239
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,359
The design studio… No.

240
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,479
I personally will provide him with a housing allowance,

241
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:55,180
but he must move out today.

242
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,739
Si Qi, ignore him.

243
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,840
Let's see what he can do.

244
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,879
You need to know that the contract is legally binding.

245
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,390
I can absolutely exercise my rights.

246
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,879
- Is it okay if I leave?
- Don't, Big Brother Lei.

247
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,719
Don't what? This is my call.

248
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,569
That's fine, Big Brother Lei.

249
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,169
I've got your back.

250
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:30,589
But I've already told my friend that I'm moving in with him.

251
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,819
Goodbye, Big Brother Lei.

252
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,030
Don't worry about me.

253
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,810
Thank you, King of Qin.
(T/N: ancient Chinese Emperor, a tyrant)

254
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,499
What a creative way to describe me.

255
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,709
Thanks.

256
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,940
I'm not praising you.

257
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,049
If you want to move out, too, be my guest.

258
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:00,789
I really don't mind.

259
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,460
I will.

260
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,250
Give me one day.

261
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,519
What are you doing?

262
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,420
I thought you were about to fall so I steadied you.

263
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,269
Hello? I'm wondering if I can

264
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,819
spend a night in your home?

265
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,989
Okay. That's all right.

266
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:44,699
That's fine. Maybe next time. Thank you.

267
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,879
Sorry to bother you.

268
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,729
Hello? I have a question.

269
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,479
Your home…

270
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,180
Hello?

271
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,810
Hello?

272
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,410
What's wrong? It's so late. What are you still doing here?

273
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,590
These are…

274
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,730
Did you get kicked out?

275
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,990
No, I'm fine.

276
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,130
What do you mean you're fine?

277
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,810
Come with me.

278
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,729
Where is Wu Si Qi staying tonight?

279
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:58,560
The number you're trying to call does not have a signal.

280
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,699
"One, individual rooms are private areas."

281
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:14,559
"Do not enter without permission."

282
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,929
"Two, when done using the bathroom,"

283
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,459
"please scrub the floor and mop dry."

284
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,059
Three,

285
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,610
the kitchen is first come, first served.

286
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,179
- What in the world is this?
- Four.

287
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:28,789
- Shut up.
- Food storage is shared equally. Don't take what isn't yours.

288
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:30,749
You're so weird!

289
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:33,709
You asked about it as if you were illiterate.

290
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:36,069
I was nice enough to explain it to you.

291
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,389
- You...
- Five, nobody is allowed to sleep over here.

292
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:41,399
I have five Home-sharing Rules.

293
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,949
- Please comply with them.
- So you just took forever to shower

294
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,600
- because you actually mopped—
- Two,

295
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,969
when done using the bathroom, please scrub the floor and mop dry.

296
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:52,100
Everything's written clearly.

297
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,119
Forget it.

298
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,949
I'm leaving tomorrow anyway.

299
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:01,140
You comply with your own ridiculous rules.

300
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,809
- What's this?
- Four,

301
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:13,669
food storage is shared equally. Don't take what isn't yours.

302
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,619
Are you insane or something?

303
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,209
Are you afraid that people will take your food?

304
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,059
I won't eat your food anyway.

305
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,329
You can come back and take it anytime, even after you move out.

306
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:25,129
Or… you can eat it all tonight.

307
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:28,460
Eat it all tonight? Okay.

308
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:33,342
Tomorrow I'll—

309
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,310
What are you doing?

310
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,029
I always thought that the leader of the design studio

311
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,649
should be steady.

312
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,580
I have to agree with what you said today.

313
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,920
I truly haven't seen much.

314
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:15,742
That's because you don't pay enough attention.

315
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,210
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

316
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,860
♫ Because I do! I do! I do! ♫

317
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,179
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

318
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,599
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

319
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,229
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

320
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:51,629
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

321
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,759
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

322
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,279
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

323
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,689
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

324
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,049
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

325
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,149
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

326
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,210
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

327
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,829
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

328
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:13,919
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

329
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
♫ Are irresistible ♫

330
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,919
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

331
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,650
♫ I do, do, do ♫

332
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,049
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

333
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,479
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

334
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,919
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

335
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,889
Eat you up.

336
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,360
You pervert!

337
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,750
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh. Every best moment ♫
