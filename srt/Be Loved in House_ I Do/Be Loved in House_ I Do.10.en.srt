- This piece is very special.
- Answer my question.

Yuan Shan Group is a big company.

You don't have to test this little design studio of ours in a roundabout way.

As a referrer of this international project,

- You're not honest.

did you never think that I would be involved?

Of course,

59
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,400
I came here for three reasons.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,799
First, I'm not interested in mass-produced products without a distinctive style.

61
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,409
We do also have mass-produced products. Also,

62
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,650
since they're called products, it's quite unlikely to avoid mass production.

63
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,429
Second, Chairman Mai thinks highly of you.

64
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,540
I trust his recommendations.

65

I can't take all the credit.

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,400
This is my third reason.

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,610
Because of you.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,839

He doesn't need you to interfere in his life now.

Come on! They're so madly in love.

But little Qi Qi isn't worried about getting fired at all.

00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:21,760
We all should learn to be courageous like him.

165
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,140
Let's have a toast to courage.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can drink, but don't vomit on me.

167
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,130
Are you awake?

168
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,299
You look quite comfortable.

169
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,190
What did you just dream of?

170
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,440
Have you thought about getting married?

171
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,340
Why do you suddenly ask about this?

172
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,209
Because when Big Bro Lei asked you about the director,

173
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,319
you said you were a wanderer,

174
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:43,440
and you'd never made whatever you were losing stay.

175
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,470
Have you never thought about settling down?

176
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,899
When I was your age,

177
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,449
society wasn't like what it is now.

178
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,800
That's why I came to terms with reality a long time ago.

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,270
Can you be in a serious relationship with me then?

180
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,900
In the moment,

181
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,819
- I'm always very serious.
- I mean,

182
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,120
assuming we won't break up in the future.

183
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,040
Before you reach my age,

184
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,099
you'll still meet many people

185
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:27,549
and even some who are better than me.

186
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,230
Are you helping me get ready for it?

187
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,570
Maybe... I'm helping myself.

188
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,960
I've constantly been thinking about getting married.

189
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,859
Great then.

190
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,479
It's not great unless I'm with you.

191
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,229
I'm only your first love.

192
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,399
If you were never in a serious relationship before,

193
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,509
then I'm your first love, too.

194
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,090
The really, really serious kind.

195
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,639
You're so talkative today

196
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,030
just because of what I said to Shi Lei?

197
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,210
Si Qi.

198
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,579
I really have a hard time imagining

199
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,930
marrying anyone.

200
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,540
What if

201
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,300
it's me?

202
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,549
Yes.

203
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,710
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

204
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,570
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

205
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,250
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

206
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,540
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

207
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:24,149
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

208
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,589
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

209
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,709
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

210
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,059
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

211
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:33,779
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

212
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,069
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

213
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:38,969
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

214
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:43,219
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

215
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:45,929
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

216
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:52,809
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes are irresistible ♫

217
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,300
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

218
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,980
Are you cooking dinner?

219
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:10,129
No, I'll do it myself in a bit.

220
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,930
Or do you want to eat with me?

221
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,800
No.

222
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,640
- Are you not done taking a shower?
- Not yet.

223
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,350
- I'll wait for you then.
- I need a lot of time.

224
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,819
Work.

225
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:25,309
Big Bro Lei, you... are you okay?

226
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,250
- I'm great.
- Nonsense.

227
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,780
So... do you have any ideas?

228
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,019
- After you've archived the files, we'll—
- I'm not talking about the summer projects.

229
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm talking about the director's project.

230
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:43,889
Didn't you know?

231
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,079
Yi Zi Tong, based on the last custom order,

232
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,519
came up with a new theme called "the Only One."

233
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,979
Did the director not mention it to you?

234
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,680
We've all heard about it. Only you didn't know about it?

235
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,969
- Maybe I missed it.
- We don't care if you're absent-minded,

236
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:05,039
but they didn't discuss it with you, the team leader—

237
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,649
I think the project looks fine.

238
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:10,670
You just need to adjust some minor details.

239
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,809
I believe we can handle it ourselves.

240
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,230
Let's go.

241
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,740
Wow,

242
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,259
I didn't expect to see Jin Yu Zhen play along.

243
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,659
I told you they must know each other.

244
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:01,570
Not many people can control our director.

245
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,309
♫ Turning a comma like a kid ♫

♫ I realize you said it right ♫

269
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,540
So Shi Lei knows everything?

270
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,949
Zi Tong actually came to talk to you.

271
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,179
Shi Lei happened to be here as well.

272
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:44,979
How come?

273
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:49,269
Basically, I only heard about what happened between you and Zi Tong

274
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:52,260
so it's hard for me to give you any suggestions.

275
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,520
Why are you suddenly bringing it up?

276
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,869
Yu Zhen, you know it very well,

277
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:04,760
but you don't want to or even dare to admit it.

278
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,649
You haven't confessed your feelings for so long that you've lost courage.

279
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,629
I can totally understand it.

280
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,439
But there are things that you can't just ask.

281
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,299
You can't force other people to take the initiative

282
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,710
because you're afraid of getting hurt.

283
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,899
Sorry, I just assumed everything.

284
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:31,460
Think of it as me talking about someone else.

285
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,560
Shop Manager, is he okay?

286
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,470
A picnic?

287
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,759
Didn't you say that Yu Zhen was nice to keep it a secret for Si Qi?

288
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,809
Consider it my way to show gratitude as his senior schoolmate.

289
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,720
What do you think?

290
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,660
Then I'll let you pass on the message.

291
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,499
Isn't it better for you to say it yourself?

292
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,259
You spend more time with him.

293
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,169
But he's been so busy lately. I don't think he has time for it.

294
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,760
I'm busy, too. Pass it on for me.

295
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:25,009
I...

296
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,319
Just tell me if you have any difficulties.

297
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,760
Don't mutter. It's not like you.

298
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,029
Or you can give me your address so I can help you pass it on.

299
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,110
Or I'll go straight to the design studio.

300
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,239
Then Jin Yu Zhen will wonder

301
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,989
why it isn't Shi Lei telling him.

302
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,169
Is he that kind of person who purposely asks about reasons?

303
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,740
You need to ask Shi Lei.

304
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,420
I'll tell him personally.

305
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,780
I have to go now.

306
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,110
Gang.

307
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,059
Why do you suddenly call me that?

308
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,779
I just want to try.

309
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,110
Let me ask you something.

310
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,679
Have you found Big Bro Lei and our director weird lately?

311
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,669
Why?

312
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,679
Are they together?

313
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,619
But doesn't the design studio have the Single Rule?

314
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,459
The director can keep it a secret, too.

315
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:45,629
Whatever. Anyway, they seem to have been avoiding each other lately.

316
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:48,789
The atmosphere is not the same as it was.

317
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,460
Maybe they're different at home.

318
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,229
Like...

319
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:57,889
this? Or...

320
00:23:57,889 --> 00:23:59,829
- this?
- It tickles.

321
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,740
Don't tickle me.

322
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,659
♫ It's not too bad without a few perfunctory words ♫

323
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,370
How about this?

324
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,820
♫  Can't do anything about it  ♫

325
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,709
♫ My friends' gathering is a bit of a blast ♫

326
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:15,489
♫ Sorry, I can't laugh now ♫

327
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,669
♫ I don't have time to spend with you ♫

328
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:19,439
♫ I want to figure it out ♫

329
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:21,509
♫ I feel like you're not here again ♫

330
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,959
♫ The awkwardness between people ♫

331
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,039
♫ We walk hand in hand ♫

332
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,429
♫ It feels a little strange when I can't keep up ♫

333
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,739
♫ Don't worry. Baby, you're so fine ♫

334
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:35,259
♫ I just don't understand it ♫

335
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,389
♫ I want to be impulsive but too afraid of failing ♫

336
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:42,369
♫ I'm stucking here alone ♫

337
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:45,699
♫ How much do I like you? ♫

338
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:48,949
♫ When do we talk about love? ♫

339
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:52,299
♫ Now we're lying on the roof ♫

340
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:55,249
♫ Now what you gonna do ♫

341
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:58,609
♫ Maybe no reasons are needed. I'm just lonely ♫

342
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:02,909
♫ The awkward conversation turned out to feel warm ♫

343
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,470
Jin Yu Zhen.

344
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,080
What are you...

345
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,240
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

346
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,770
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

347
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,299
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

348
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,629
♫ has the smell of bubbles ♫

349
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:40,279
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

350
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,669
♫ that I may run into someone today ♫

351
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:44,879
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

352
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:47,219
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

353
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,829
♫ Feeling romantic in the
breeze alongside the river ♫

354
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:52,109
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

355
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:55,049
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

356
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:59,179
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

357
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,899
♫ and I wished upon a shooting star ♫

358
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,859
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes are irresistible ♫

359
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,949
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

360
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:13,739
♫ I do, do, do ♫

361
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,139
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

362
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,429
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

363
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,819
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

364
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:25,339
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

365
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:28,119
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh. ♫

366
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,079
I feel that Jin Yu Zhen still cares about you.

367
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,269
That's why I came looking for him.

368
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:35,380
Do you still love him then?
