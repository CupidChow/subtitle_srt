162
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,939
How come it's this guy now?

163
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,670
Ask him.

164
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,520
It must be hard for you to live with this kind of person.

165
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,269
- What do you want?
- I will leave it to you. I will go to work now.

166
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,499
- No, you—
- Where are you going?

167
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:10,609
You can't leave without explanation.

168
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Auntie, I'm sorry. I haven't introduced myself properly.

169
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,770
I'm the new person in charge of Jingcherng Metalwork and Design. My name is Jin Yu Zhen.

170
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,080
Person in charge?

171
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,440
So you're Lei Lei's boss?

172
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,230
That's right.

173
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,930
Why does he live here?

174
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,790
The design studio was in a crisis.

175
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,730
When I took over the company, I took over this house as well.

176
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,319
Lei Lei, why didn't you tell me?

177
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,089
So...

178
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,450
He is the homeowner.

179
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,730
That's right.

180
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,339
I'm sorry. You're a young and capable boss.

181
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,799
- I'm so sorry that I misunderstood you.
- Mom.

182
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,149
- Lei Lei, will you get fired?
- I won't. Don't worry.

183
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,699
Auntie, that's fine. Don't think too much. Maybe...

184
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,769
Shi Lei has been so busy lately

185
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:24,149
he forgot to tell you, and I also didn't introduce myself properly. It was my fault.

186
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,639
Don't say that. You're such a young and capable boss.

187
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,319
You even let Lei Lei live here. I'm so grateful. Thank you.

188
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:34,779
Mom, he's not as good as you think.

189
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,230
Shi Lei is very important to me. I should take care of him.

190
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,400
- Boss, I've brought a lot of food with me.
- Mom!

191
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,179
Lei Lei complains every time that he can't finish it all.

192
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:48,559
Here you are. Do you want some?

193
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,849
Auntie, sorry. I have to rush to the design studio.

194
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,279
Have you eaten? Why don't you bring some to eat for lunch?

195
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,460
That's fine. Don't bother.

196
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,310
Exactly, Mom. He has a nickel allergy, so he can't just eat anything.

197
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,869
Auntie, you both must have a lot to catch up on.

198
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,119
How about I give Shi Lei some time off

199
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,739
so that he can help you settle in this afternoon?

200
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:13,749
No, I'm good.

201
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:16,309
Otherwise, he will blame me for having his pay docked.

202
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,529
Auntie, don't worry. He just finished a really big project.

203
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,199
He has also worked enough hours. It's a good idea for him to take some rest.

204
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,120
His pay won't be docked.

205
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,620
You're a great kid indeed.

206
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,109
Mom, I can keep you company in the afternoon, but you may not be able to stay here tonight.

207
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:39,859
- Why?
- Because we have a rule consisting of five things, the last of which says—

208
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,210
Please rest assured and stay here.

209
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,320
Thank you.

210
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,420
My great team leader, what time is it now?

211
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,609
Almost three o'clock.

212
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:06,110
Almost three o'clock. You had a long lunch break.

213
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,659
My mom came.

214
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:11,310
I just helped her settle. Don't overreact.

215
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,079
Big Bro Lei, your mom prepared a lot this time.

216
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,310
- Yes, she was afraid—
- Will you listen to me?

217
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,059
Jin Yu Zhen didn't come to work this morning.

218
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,859
He only came here at noon and handed something off before leaving.

219
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,809
I'll tell you what, the point is that he was weird.

220
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,210
He seemed absent-minded, which I thought was a big problem.

221
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,859
Maybe he's coming up with a new proposal just like this time.

222
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:39,750
Maybe he's working on something private? Or he's dating someone?

223
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,069
Aren't you overthinking this?

224
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,300
It's not impossible. I'll tell you what, please be on high alert, okay?

225
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,609
Please be on high alert, okay?

226
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,220
Big Bro Lei.

227
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,910
Okay.

228
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,299
Shop Manager, why is it called Wan Wan?

229
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,669
I named it. Don't you like it?

230
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,999
Have you ever asked if it likes it?

231
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,610
Right?

232
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,720
Let me ask you then.

233
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:22,850
Why am I wiping the table while you're playing with the cat?

234
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,510
Why? Why? Why?

235
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,710
Isn't that...

236
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,380
Let's go.

237
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,600
What's going on?

238
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:45,930
I want to ask if I can borrow HWC Roasters.

239
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,840
Is it about work?

240
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,750
Yes.

241
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,100
Did you get off work?

242
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,379
Why did the shop close early today?

243
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,110
It closed early because we're out of limited ingredients.

244
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,080
Are you hungry?

245
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,110
Because you said, you won't buy ingredients to cook at home.

246
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,919
Then let's buy some for today together.

247
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,480
Okay!

248
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,279
Have you prepared for the metalwork course?

249
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,020
Not yet.

250
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,340
I'm only halfway through.

251
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,280
So exhausting.

252
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,369
Think of it as a learning experience.

253
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,320
It'll be your first time teaching a course.

254
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:55,090
Big Bro Gang, weren't you nervous when it was your first time?

255
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,280
What do you mean by first time?

256
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,629
O-O-Opening a shop. The first time...

257
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,630
cooking a dish and all that.

258
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,449
Everything is pretty much my first time.

259
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,900
Not every customer is a regular.

260
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:18,479
They may come here for a meal only.

261
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:23,719
It's their first time and the only time.

262
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:27,050
Different dishes meet different customers.

263
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,460
They're each other's first time as well.

264
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,140
Got it.

265
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,730
Do you?

266
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,379
Even I'm about to lose track of what I'm saying.

267
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,549
It's so easy to understand.

268
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,769
Fate is beyond our control.

269
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,740
What we can do

270
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,639
is to cherish that short but beautiful moment when it comes.

271
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,680
Just like love.

272
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,310
It seems to make a little sense.

273
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,439
So... Big Bro Zhao Gang's first love...

274
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,190
What did it feel like?

275
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,880
Do you... really want to know?

276
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,259
Finish preparing the metalwork course

277
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,750
and then I will tell you.

278
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,420
Hey, it doesn't hurt to let me in on a bit.

279
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,359
Mom, why did you make the bed for me already?

280
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,509
I didn't do it. Your director did.

281
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,239
Your director told me to sleep in his bedroom

282
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,450
- so I moved in there.
- What?

283
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,070
Don't bother. My mom can sleep in my bedroom.

284
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,530
That's what we've done before.

285
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,870
Thank you.

286
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,759
Auntie, my pleasure. I'm so sorry about what happened this morning.

287
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,189
No worries. No worries.

288
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,840
I'm going to bed now.

289
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,470
Good night.

290
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,270
Mom, good night.

291
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
What are you doing?

292
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,360
Hey!

293
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,140
Okay.

294
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,289
- You can have the bed.
- Hey!

295
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,170
You sleep in the bed. I sleep over here.

296
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,290
Turn the lights off. Good night.

297
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,970
How stubborn.

298
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,810
The floor is very hard to sleep on.

299
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,490
Oh, I forgot.

300
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,310
Jin Yu Zhen.

301
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,460
Jin Yu Zhen.

302
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,200
Jin Yu Zhen, are you a koala?

303
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,240
Don't...

304
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,340
Don't...

305
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,530
Don't leave me.

306
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,300
Don't...

307
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,709
♫ I'm like a rendered portrait ♫

322
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,590
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

323
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,889
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

324
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,299
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

325
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,839
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

326
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,249
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

327
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,499
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

328
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,829
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

329
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:47,430
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

330
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,649
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

331
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,619
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

332
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,829
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

333
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:59,569
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

334
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,609
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

335
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,470
♫ Are irresistible ♫

336
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,549
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

337
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,400
♫ I do, do, do.  ♫

338
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,700
♫  We've promised to meet again in early summer  ♫

339
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,079
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

340
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,509
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

341
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,699
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

342
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,899
What if I use my authority as a director to force you to do it?

343
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:30,120
Okay, then we will put an end to our relationship.
