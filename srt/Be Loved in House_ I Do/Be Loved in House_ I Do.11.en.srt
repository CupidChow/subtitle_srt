What are you...

00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,079
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- I'm looking for what I left here.

32
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,799
I cleaned up. There's nothing here.

- do not enter someone else's bedroom.
- Don't change the wording.

The meaning is the same.

- I removed it.
- You removed two of them and kept the remaining three.

- Didn't we discuss it very well?

If Director wants someone to join us, I'm okay with it for sure.

90

you can still understand each other no matter how long it's been

Sorry, I archived all the files by accident.

I thought this would make it more convenient for you to handle it.

All these are projects I didn't get to finish in the past.

Isn't he a good man?

159
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,730
Oh, that's right.

160
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,579
Compared with Yi Zi Tong?

161
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,910
Oh, that's different. He's so capable.

162
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,349
No, no, no! What a weak teammate!

163
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,480
- Wang Jing!
- Where are you going?

164
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
Big Bro Jing!

165
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,100
What are they doing?

166
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,470
Work routine.

167
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,529
You guys are quite interesting.

168
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm very happy to be working with you all.

169
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,469
Actually, it's quite interesting to discuss with you.

170
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,450
So are we considered friends?

171
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,310
Sorry, it may be too sudden.

172
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,790
Maybe we can make friends from now on?

173
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,610
I'll take that as a yes then?

174
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,249
That's not right.

175
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,309
He's so nice.

176
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:37,650
How could I hate him?

177
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,739
- Hello?
- Hi.

178
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,500
Yi Zi Tong?

179
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,680
Did I scare you?

180
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,009
You didn't, but why do you want to talk to me?

181
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,879
Nothing. I'm just wondering

182
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,020
what you wanted to say since you said you had something to tell me.

183
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,570
Thank you.

184
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,489
Real can't drink whiskey.

185
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:14,470
It must be quite inconvenient for you to live together, right?

186
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,990
I'm used to it.

187
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,170
So am I.

188
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,110
I believe Jin Yu Zhen has been thinking about you all this time.

189
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,480
That's why I came here for him.

190
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,280
Do you still love him then?

191
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,009
It doesn't matter if I love him,

192
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,090
but what I want to know is if he still loves me.

193
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,670
How are you going to confirm it?

194
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,969
Or... have you confirmed it?

195
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,779
He can't tell me the truth right now.

196
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,980
You're aware of it, right?

197
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes, he's very hard to get along with.

198
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,970
Did you really complain just now?

199
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,850
Not really.

200
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,119
So seven years ago, you just

201
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,990
left like that?

202
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,220
My family arranged for me to be an intern at the subsidiary in America.

203
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,019
That was a great opportunity.

204
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,809
But didn't you discuss it with Jin Yu Zhen first?

205
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:38,029
I'm not the kind of person who just sits around.

206
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,349
Be it love or work. I'm not satisfied with the status quo.

207
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,600
Of course, Real is aware of it.

208
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,140
I just didn't realize

209
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,519
he would take it so seriously.

210
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,699
Because he loves you.

211
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,530
I know.

212
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,400
That's why he tried so hard to rush to the airport the day I flew out.

213
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,750
But he ended up in a serious car accident.

214
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,319
I remember when he was in university,

215
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,299
he didn't have the scar you mentioned.

216
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,629
But I heard that he was in a car crash later on.

217
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,890
Car crash...

218
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,909
That point in time was too much of a coincidence.

219
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,869
I don't know where he got the news from.

220
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:28,010
There's an 80% chance that it's Chairman Mai. After all, we all know one another.

221
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
I didn't know until later on

222
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,530
that he had been in a coma in the hospital for six months.

223
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,010
After he'd come to, he was depressed for a while.

224
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,180
So this is

225
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,200
how he got his scar.

226
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,450
Is his scar very serious?

227
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,179
Then he worked so hard to develop his career and network.

228
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,540
He wanted to catch up with me in another way.

229
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:13,819
Are you saying Jin Yu Zhen wanted to catch up with you?

230
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,640
Isn't it obvious?

231
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,149
He's allergic to nickel, but because of my family background,

232
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,369
he started to be really interested

233
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,679
in products made from metallic minerals.

234
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,229
Now he's even taken over Jingcherng Metalwork and Design.

235
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:29,630
All the things he's done were making me come here to him.

236
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,490
If he hadn't expected the possibility that we would meet again,

237
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,050
then all the things he's done

238
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,270
would be hard to justify.

239
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,660
The Single Rule...

240
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,790
Sorry.

241
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,420
It's affected you all because of us both.

242
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,880
The Fragrance of B612.

243
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,950
"The Little Prince." Have you heard of it?

244
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,909
Yes, I have. He loved the rose, but...

245
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,309
did the rose love him?

246
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,689
Does this piece of work have a name?

247
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:20,860
The Fragrance of B612.

248
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,810
What the Little Prince missed the most

249
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,790
was still that rose.

250
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,279
Compared with Superman, who couldn't go back to Krypton after it was destroyed,

251
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,379
at least he had the rose.

252
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,579
Superman got sent away when he was little.

253
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,759
Little Prince could go back as long as he fixed his rocket.

254
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,729
Or... do we need to help him and attach a balloon to it?

255
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,310
Attach a balloon...

256
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,909
No wonder Jin Yu Zhen fell in love with you back then.

257
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,940
Are you sure it's only back then?

258
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,680
I heard from Chairman Mai

259
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,580
that you all find Real very hard to get along with.

260
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,000
At first, we didn't get along indeed.

261
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,700
But I realized later

262
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,299
that's how he cares about people.

263
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,769
You're in charge of this project.

264
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,550
So sudden.

265
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,700
Is it difficult?

266
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,300
During the meeting,

267
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,800
he still cared about you.

268
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,110
Here's the relevant information.

269
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,080
Thank you.

270
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,439
Your director told me to sleep in his bedroom

271
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,539
so I moved in there.

272
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,709
Also, he often quietly

273
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,080
cares about people in his own way.

274
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,299
He's often stubborn and says what he doesn't mean as well.

275
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,210
Isn't it a perfect opportunity to have another boss since you hate me so much?

276
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,310
Don't...

277
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,200
He doesn't say it,

278
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
but he's super scared of losing

279
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,170
and getting hurt.

280
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,249
Did you know that, while you were describing him just now,

281
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,730
your eyes were twinkling like stars?

282
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,240
[No smoking in this facility. Maximum Fine: NT$10,000]

283
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,500
I finally see the you I'm familiar with.

284
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,159
Someone who doesn't cover things up, has temper tantrums,

285
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,279
and speaks his mind.

286
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,639
All right. You can't do the last thing right now.

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,430
But you're almost like the you in university.

288
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,049
But, my senior schoolmate,

289
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,390
don't people change?

290
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,750
I know because of Zi Tong.

291
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,299
I mentioned him because the problem you have right now

292
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,080
obviously comes from him.

293
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,900
I think the bigger problem comes from myself.

294
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,119
I admit

295
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,659
I do mind that he walked away seven years ago without saying a word.

296
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,540
To be honest,

297
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,109
I thought about seeing him again.

298
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:10,350
Who would've thought he would show up like this?

299
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,890
It's been so long since I last saw you, Jin Yu Zhen.

300
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,310
Or should I call you Real?

301
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,299
Ever since that day, I've had this bad feeling.

302
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,310
I often think

303
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,660
he showed up because he had other intentions.

304
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,609
Why do you think

305
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,900
he showed up?

306
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,670
I have no idea.

307
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,439
- Have you asked him?
- Senior,

308
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,760
do you think he will tell me?

309
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,240
Yu Zhen, you're capable of solving problems.

310
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,359
Jin Yu Zhen.

311
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,589
Why do you have to push yourself so hard?

312
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:12,259
Say it if something's wrong. I'll help you out.

313
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,989
Or you're still mad at me, aren't you?

314
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:16,020
- Speak—
- That's enough!

315
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,870
Have you thought about our relationship?

316
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,750
Learn to feel it with your heart.

317
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,579
- Did you just come back, too?
- Yes.

318
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:05,360
I want to talk to you about Yi Zi Tong.

319
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,649
Oh, I mean...

320
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:13,279
He's actually quite interesting.

321
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,490
Also, it's pretty good to work with him.

322
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,500
- Really?
- Yes. Xiao Qian and the others like him, too.

323
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,520
Why do you keep speaking highly of him?

324
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,270
What's wrong?

325
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,900
I...

326
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,609
I...

327
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,680
I'll go to bed if you have nothing to say.

328
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,449
Now you don't even dare to take the first step.

329
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:55,610
Learn to feel it with your heart.

330
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,629
- Do you have new toys again?
- Yes.

331
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,709
Look, this uses Black Agate as the main stone.

332
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:20,779
And this is...

333
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:24,290
Burmese Amber and Uruguay Amethyst.

334
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,030
The last one... This is...

335
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,000
Hey.

336
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
- Are you listening to me?
- I am.

337
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,069
Did you know that these metallic minerals were actually Gods' blood and tears?

338
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,730
This big?

339
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,669
Because gods are gigantic.

340
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,019
The tears that different gods shed will become all kinds of gems.

341
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,909
After their blood solidifies, it becomes metal.

342
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,609
That's why people collect them and make accessories.

343
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,150
They marry blood with tears

344
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,400
to commemorate unforgettable love.

345
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,479
- Really?
- I just tricked you.

346
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,380
- Yi Zi Tong.
- I'm right here.

347
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,069
You're so weird.

348
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:46,459
Compared with you, who's allergic to nickel but likes metal accessories, I'm super normal.

349
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,419
I've picked all these accessories, okay?

350
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,739
Just like how you picked me.

351
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,349
Didn't you pursue me first?

352
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,739
When it comes to a certain aspect,

353
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,429
you're easy to see through.

354
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,949
I'm only responding to you.

355
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:02,010
Then why did you...

356
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,930
leave me?

357
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,740
Hi, my little prince.

358
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,510
It feels so real.

359
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,299
Shi Lei. Shi Lei.

360
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,099
Shi Lei. Shi Lei.

361
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,920
Shi Lei...

362
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,100
[Jingcherng Metalwork and Design]

363
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,579
Yi Zi Tong's already arrived at the company.

364
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,780
Why isn't Jin Yu Zhen here yet?

365
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,439
Yi Zi Tong.

366
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,620
Big Bro Jing, are you jealous?

367
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,840
Why is it Yi Zi Tong again?

368
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,080
Since when have they become so close?

369
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,380
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

370
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,800
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

371
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,280
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

372
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,590
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

373
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,249
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

374
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,699
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

375
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,829
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

376
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:53,289
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

377
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,799
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

378
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,079
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

379
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,059
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

380
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,189
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

381
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:07,919
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

382
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,899
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes are irresistible ♫

383
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,889
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

384
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:19,609
♫ I do, do, do ♫

♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

386
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:25,479
If I date someone,

387
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,840
will I have to quit, too?

388
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,319
Shi Lei!

389
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,789
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh. ♫

390
