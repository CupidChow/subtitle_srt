If you gave him documents, I could totally understand,

58

but you gave him box lunches and tea.

Are you a team leader or his secretary?

He's actually not that bad.

66

As long as the Single Rule is still here,

there's no room for negotiation between him and us.

Then we are left with two options.

One of them is to quit.

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,329
Quit... If we wanted to quit, we would've left in the first place.

Fine. I can go back to being a tattoo artist.

- The second option...

73

is to have a new boss.

74
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,749
A new boss... It's not that easy to find one.

If Jin Yu Zhen hadn't taken over the design studio, we would've been closed down.

00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:01,059
I mean... sparkling water is quite good, too.

97
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:03,920
Personally, I recommend the lemon flavor.

98

00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,969
I was going to say I could eat out. Otherwise, I would cause you too much trouble.

Well, Lei Lei saved it for you.

103
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,489
Then... Where is he?

104
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,910
He said he was going out to meet with his colleagues.

105
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,619
He's changed recently.

106
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:46,469
He used to hide his concern for others by being sarcastic.

107
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:47,959
Indeed.

108
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,140
But he's pretty direct with his concern for you.

109
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,279
I'm unfamiliar with the work that you all do,

110
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,719
but I feel

111
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:02,590
that you're not only worried about work.

112
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,020
I'm just thinking about what love is like.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,380
Have you never been in love?

114
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,849
Just like me. I've been in love once.

115
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,660
With Lei Lei's father.

116
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,679
- Big Sis Juan, did you marry your first love?
- Yes.

117
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,739
His father chased after me right after school started.

118
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:43,719
We got married right after graduation. Luckily,

119
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:46,849
I had Lei Lei at thirty,

120
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,299
otherwise, I would've burned myself out

121
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,300
before becoming a charge nurse.

122
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,209
Shi Lei said that you already retired ten years ago.

123
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,829
Exactly.

124
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,379
Lei Lei's father died of a serious disease.

125
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,219
I had to concentrate on taking care of Lei Lei.

126
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:05,019
I made the right decision. Lei Lei works quite hard.

127
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,610
I didn't really have a hard time.

128
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,869
So Big Sis Juan, do you think

129
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:16,619
that you can hardly experience anything with only one love in life?

130
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:20,229
Oh, come on. It has nothing to do with the number of times.

131
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:22,219
Look, Lei Lei fails every time he confesses his feelings.

132
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:24,559
He doesn't even have a chance to take his first step.

133
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,689
How could he experience cherishing people or being cherished?

134
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,360
Does he want to compete with me? It's too soon for him.

135
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,609
Well, I was just joking.

136
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:38,900
As his mother, I'm always worried about him.

137
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,029
He's too sensible.

138
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,449
He's been so focused on work

139
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,149
that he has no time at all to date anyone.

140
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,020
But I believe he just hasn't met the right person.

141
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,760
There must be a chance.

142
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,810
I can't wait.

143
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,090
Hey.

144
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,379
Are you still working?

145
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,100
I'm about to go sleep.

146

Any inspirations?

148
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,570
There must be a way.

149
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,750
It's very worrying.

150
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,859
Have you ever imagined what love is like?

151
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,399
Of course.

152
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,919
Love, when you're waiting in the same place

153
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,610
without them knowing it.

154
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,489
Actually, what that weird guy said is a type of love.

155
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,199
It also reminds me of a story.

156
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,180
"The Little Prince."

157
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,170
Have you heard of it?

158
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,570
Yes, I have.

159
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,040
He loved the rose, but did the rose love him?

160
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,010
You don't say it

161
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,620
because you're afraid of losing them.

162
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,959
But I guess the rose would be quite worried...

163
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,589
Worried about whether the Little Prince would meet other roses.

164
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,449
He never expected to meet the fox in the end.

165
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,699
The fox was fed and kept,

166
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,019
so whenever the fox saw a wheat field,

167
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,630
it thought of the Little Prince's hair color.

168
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,329
So... did it turn out

169
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,250
that the fox was waiting for the Little Prince?

170
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,509
I never thought about that.

171
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,880
I never thought about the fox's standpoint.

172
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,069
If you think about it, the fox and the rose

173
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,010
were rather headstrong.

174
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,740
It was just a different way of expressing themselves.

00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:57,929
If I asked you a month ago, I would've been on the list, too.

327
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,910
Maybe six months ago.

328
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,829
Have I been on your radar since that long ago?

329
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:07,660
You didn't know until now?

330
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,180
Let's go.

331
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,559
I'm leaving now.

332
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,509
Mom.

333
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:24,300
What's wrong?

334
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,399
You look like you have something to say.

335
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,370
What's bothering you?

336
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,259
Hey.

337
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,059
You want to, but don't dare to say it.

338
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,210
Is it something very important?

339
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,260
I don't think I've ever cared so much about someone.

340
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,700
Then just follow your heart.

341
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,839
You don't understand.

342
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,169
You can't simply fall in love with someone.

343
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,620
You're not hurting anyone. Why worry so much?

344
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

345
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,490
Little Zhen is a good kid.

346
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,599
A mother and son are connected.

347
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,330
My instincts are mostly accurate.

348
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,029
I've thought about this before.

349
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,470
If one day,

350
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,910
you confess your feelings to a guy,

351
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,200
and still find happiness,

352
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,340
I'll be happy to accept it.

353
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,700
But isn't it too selfish?

354
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,149
When I married your father,

355
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:20,930
your grandparents nagged at us, too.

356
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,670
Also, you've been focused on your work.

357
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,699
You've finally met the right person.

358
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:35,940
It's time for you to be selfish.

359
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,820
Remember that it's not about gender,

360
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,770
but about how you love someone

361
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,000
and yourself.

362
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,960
Mom, I love you.

363
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,630
I love you, too.

364
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,220
Just tell me the conclusion.

365
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:16,320
This piece is named "Fragrance of B612".

366
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,410
Is this the answer you're looking for?

367
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,809
Being an onlooker to avoid falling in love,

368
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,919
don't you find it boring?

369
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,519
The contract is over. Don't wait too long to transfer the money.

370
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,549
I reported to House that you completed the mission.

371
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,440
How efficient.

372
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,750
Let's work together again if there's a chance.

373
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,150
I will be your most loyal servant.

374
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,420
I think I can go back to my room.

375
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,900
Then don't forget to tear off the rule.

376
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,370
I'll stick it back on the fridge.

377
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,960
Whatever.

378
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,939
Why don't you get back to the bed?

379
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,880
I want to spend one more night sleeping on the floor.

380
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,809
Oh, then...

381
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:33,470
- I'll turn the lights off for you.
- Okay.

382
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,200
Jin Yu Zhen.

383
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,210
I also want to see what it's like to sleep on the floor.

384
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:17,779
♫ I'm like a rendered portrait ♫

385
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:22,889
♫ A flower blooms on the right side of my chest at dawn ♫

386
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:27,909
♫ Nobody wants to write the wrong time difference in parting ♫

387
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:30,609
♫ I think for a bit ♫

388
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:33,089
♫ Then erase the truth ♫

389
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:37,739
♫ I want to fly into clouds. ♫

390
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:44,139
♫ It's a little complicated but simple for me to be stubborn ♫

391
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:49,519
♫ The gentle breeze is blowing into your world ♫

392
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,219
♫ Borrowing could be beautiful ♫

393
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:54,889
♫ There's no comma leading to a sequel ♫

394
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,499
♫ Who gives a nod? ♫

395
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,319
♫ Who gives precedence to that empty seat? ♫

396
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,679
♫ Why do you always apologize to me? Period ♫

397
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,129
♫ The rain is gently dripping ♫

398
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,960
This time...

399
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,250
♫ Catching up with the last page ♫

400
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,129
It's my turn to come to you.

401
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:16,529
♫ I'm used to wasting what's tasteless as I don't like it ♫

402
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:19,179
♫ I feel numb walking forward ♫

403
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:22,769
♫ Honesty comes from guilt ♫

404
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:26,410
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

405
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,120
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

406
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,449
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

407
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:36,859
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

408
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:39,349
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

409
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,849
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

410
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:44,069
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

411
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:46,349
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

412
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:48,869
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

413
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,339
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

414
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,339
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

415
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:58,410
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

416
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,109
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

417
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:08,039
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes are irresistible ♫

418
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,149
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

419
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:12,899
♫ I do, do, do ♫

420
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,249
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

421
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:17,669
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

422
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:20,909
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

423
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:24,509
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

424
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,079
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh. ♫

425
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,709
Have you thought about our relationship?

426
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,910
♫ Every best moment ♫
