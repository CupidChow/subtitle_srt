Don't you find it really accurate?

As a metalsmith, you know a lot about metals.

Have all the dishes on the menu been categorized?

74
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:20,229
Also, there are very few dishes that may cause nickel allergy.

75
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,249
In my third year of university, our club had an orientation activity

76
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:26,539
where a freshman ate some food that contained nickel.

77
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,399
He immediately had a severe allergic reaction and was sent to the hospital.

78
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,809
He was competent,

79
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:36,479
but he couldn't eat many foods

80
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,129
so he rarely went to social gatherings.

81
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,229
He looked popular, but he was a loner.

82
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,640
Everyone jokingly called him a Kryptonian.

83
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,209
So when I opened this shop,

84
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:54,540
I took it into consideration.

Why did you never say anything?

90
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,620
You must know many things about him from back then.

- But he's not as great as Big Bro Gang.

You took Si Qi in without hesitation.

103
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,599
You both joined the same club

104
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,670
- but have completely different personalities.
- What do you mean by "club"?

105
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,220
Jin Yu Zhen was Big Bro Gang's junior at the university.

106
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,529
You're shocked, right? They went to the same university.

107

Big Bro Gang is very easy-going.

To make it my career, I still need to learn a lot from Chairman Mai.

You are too polite. Who is this?

Oh, he is our team leader, Shi Lei.

135

He will explain our current design goals and details to you in a bit.

Nice to meet you, Chairman Mai. Let's get started.

Of course. I have my feet on the ground.

143

I'm nowhere near as sly as you.

- Me?
- Are you confused?

145
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,129
I was just thinking, how come you were so capable?

146
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,449
How were you able to connect with such a large company?

147
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,309
Turns out, you know Mai Zheng Xiong.

148
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:56,109
He also kept praising you after the meeting.

149
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:59,609
Just like a father would toward a son.

150
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,409
Networking is essential.

The Kryptonian thing that I mentioned

154
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,180
was just a joke.

155
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,610
I understand

156
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,240
Did my senior schoolmate tell you?

157
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,180
That's fine.

158
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,320
I mean it.

159

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,620
Your turn.

165
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,190
I'm quitting.

166
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,909
Why do you sound so girly?

167
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:21,539
How could you protest against your boss like this?

168
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,429
You have no idea how strong of an aura our boss has.

169
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,869
- Do you want to get married?
- Yes.

170
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:30,219
Then you have to have a stronger aura than your boss's.

171
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:32,949
If you can't beat your boss, you'll never be able to get married.

172
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,069
I'll tell you what, tell your boss that nobody can change my drafts.

173
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,960
Find someone else if you want to change them. I'm not doing it!

174
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,310
I believe Big Sis Qian has the most powerful aura.

175
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,889
These are the ores the design studio currently has.

176
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,309
We can only base our designs on them.

177
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,020
Has Wang Jing not caught up yet?

178
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,459
Our next ore conference will take place after next month.

179
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,180
It's too slow.

180
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,750
Do you see now?

181
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,299
- See what?
- If it wasn't for the Single Rule,

182
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:18,179
do you think it would've been like this?

183
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,240
Then do you know why I made the rule?

184
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,259
Because work shouldn't be affected by personal matters.

185
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,540
What if we have more people like Wang Jing?

186
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,560
You can't lose something you never had.

187
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,849
Isn't it a slippery slope?

188
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,830
Do you still want to argue?

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,109
Forget it. We have one more week to go.

190
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,290
Just do it your way.

191
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,359
Oh, can I contact Chairman Mai myself?

192
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,269
I believe you're busy and short of time.

193
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:02,700
I'll let you know if anything happens. What do you say?

194
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,799
- Today's young people are really motivated.
- Chairman Mai.

195
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,719
You have contacted me very proactively. Take a seat.

196
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,199
What is going on?

197
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,740
Actually... I would like your opinion on something.

198
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,629
Did Yu Zhen not come here with you?

199
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,479
Our director... Chairman Mai, you know his personality.

200
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:46,009
He's hard to get along with. When coordinating things with other people,

201
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,129
- it takes quite a bit of time.
- What?

202
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,659
Is Yu Zhen hard to get along with? No way.

203
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,099
My impression of Yu Zhen is that he is very considerate

204
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,480
and easy to communicate with.

205
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,549
- It is quite different from what I see.
- Oh.

206
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,010
Does this trouble you?

207
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,439
Do you need me to talk to him about this?

208
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,649
No, no. Please don't bother.

209
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,019
Our director has a high self-esteem

210
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,699
so I don't think it is a good idea to talk to him directly.

211
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:19,579
- You know him very well, don't you?
- No,

212
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,659
I don't, but...

213
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,890
- I do want to find out more about him.
- Why?

214
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,079
Be... because we are colleagues,

215
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,399
plus, we are roommates.

216
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,699
I find it pretty good to know more about my roommate.

217
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,860
So you live together.

218
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,040
You care about each other,

219
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,870
just like a family.

220
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,080
Great!

221
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,989
I don't think he has changed.

222
00:14:54,989 --> 00:15:00,029
I noticed during the meeting that he also cared about you.

223
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,349
- Did he?
- He surely did.

224
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:06,339
For someone to throw themselves into work while also caring about other people

225
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,119
is difficult indeed.

226
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,819
I couldn't do it.

227
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,019
But Chairman Mai, you don't seem like an inconsiderate person.

228
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,019
You have no idea. When I was your age...

229
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,089
I was ambitious and high-spirited.

230
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,989
To develop my career, I worked so hard every single day.

231
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,990
In the end,

232
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,179
I lost my family,

233
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,470
and also sacrificed my family.

234
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,599
Now I don't even know how many times I can see my child in a year.

235
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,100
We haven't visited my wife's grave together in a long time.

236
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,629
That's why young people like you shouldn't be like me.

237
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,220
Cherishing your family is the most important.

238
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,249
- Are you busy?
- I am. Why?

239
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:13,450
- What are you busy with?
- Learning new knowledge and keeping myself cultured.

240
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,499
I use this to process it.

241
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:17,159
Knock it off.

242
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,750
I want to discuss something with you.

243
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,790
What is it?

244
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,750
It's about Chairman Mai.

245
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,639
Now I don't even know how many times I can see my child in a year.

246
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,000
We haven't visited my wife's grave together in a long time.

247
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,250
What do you want?

248
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,390
I know that it's wrong to record it secretly, but I really—

249
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,399
Besides recording secretly, you even want to meddle in his affairs.

250
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,249
How indifferent are you? Aren't you and Chairman Mai close?

251
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,420
Yes, but he is also our client.

252
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,849
I don't care about your motive behind this. Did you know that it disrespects our client?

253
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,109
Fine. I disrespect him. I'm wrong.

254
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,840
- Are you happy now?
- Do you think I'm joking?

255
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,440
Do I look like I'm joking with you?

256
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,939
Listen to me.

257
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:31,879
The only business between us and Chairman Mai

258
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,249
is the proposal.

259
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:37,059
Don't do anything unnecessary.

260
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,630
Chairman Mai told me that you're a considerate person.

261
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,669
No.

262
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,219
But I think you are.

263
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,189
I always believe in my instinct

264
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,470
so I think you can help out with this.

265
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,270
What if I don't lift a finger?

266
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,559
- Then I'll look for Chairman Mai's family myself.
- You'll slow down the progress of the proposal.

267
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,500
- I promise I won't.
- This determines the craft workshop's survival.

268
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,259
I understand, just like Wang Jing, Xiao Qian, and Si Qi.

269
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,429
And even other people. I'm responsible for them because I'm their team leader.

270
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:09,489
Similarly, I'm responsible for Chairman Mai as well.

271
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,419
I'm aware that he accepted this proposal because he felt guilty about owing his family

272
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,150
and wanted to make up for it.

273
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,060
What if I stop you as the director?

274
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,029
Then I'll make a request to edit the proposal as the person in charge of this project.

275
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,610
♫ Several light years away, this journey is full of obstacles ♫

276
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,900
♫ I'm unreasonable and sly like a devil in your eyes ♫

277
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,449

278
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:07,759
♫ Show me. Show me. Your eyes ♫

279
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,559
Chairman Mai replied to us.

280
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,889
Here is the relevant information.

281
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,040
Thank you.

282
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,659
♫ I realize who doesn't care about the rights and wrongs ♫

283
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,609
♫ Hey, our last playing cards are on the table ♫

00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:24,289
♫ Hurry up and write down your promise. Don't change it ♫

285
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,369

286
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:32,809
♫ When it's sunny, it's my turn to blow haze away for you ♫

287
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,999
Wang Jing, do you have any information about copper wire wrapping that you can pass to me?

288
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:41,639
And Xiao Qian, do you have any copper wire wrapping designs?

289
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,070
Big Bro Lei's working so hard.

290
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,599
This is the plan I have come up with so far,

291
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,620
which considers mass production and avoids expensive ores that sell out easily.

292
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,319
If it is not satisfactory, as long as Chairman Mai is willing to give me more time,

293
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,500
I will definitely get it done to the best of my ability.

294
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,899
You're very thoughtful. Excellent.

295
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,119
It is great indeed!

296
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,919
Actually, I have another plan.

297
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,319
- Oh?
- I was inspired by Chairman Mai.

298
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,490
Me? Did I give you any suggestions?

299
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,150
Hey.

300
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,300
This is designed specifically for Chairman Mai.

301
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,480
- This is...
- Please take a look, Chairman Mai.

302
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,610
This is what my son drew.

303
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,820
- Chairman Mai, I'm sorry about this—
- I took it upon myself.

304
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,390
Sorry.

305
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,380
Dad,

306
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,349
how have you been?

307
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,519
Let's go visit mom's grave

308
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,040
on the long weekend of Qingming Festival.
(T/N: traditional Chinese tomb-sweeping festival)

309
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,549
You were so reckless.

310
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,659
It's a good thing that Chairman Mai didn't hold you responsible for recording him secretly.

311
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,250
Otherwise, even I couldn't protect you.

312
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,309
I was going to take some of the responsibility,

313
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:11,799
but I didn't know he liked you so much.

314
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,989
In the end, I looked like I was trying to take credit.

315
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:17,980
Don't worry. You can take the credit.

316
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,860
Why are you so quiet today? It's not like you.

317
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,940
Hey! Hey!

318
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,820
Feels so hot.

319
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,270
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

320
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,559
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

321
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,829
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

322
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,189
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

323
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:02,859
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

324
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,099
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

325
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,399
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

326
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:09,849
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

327
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,349
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

328
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,689
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

329
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:17,719
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

330
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,749
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

331
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:24,539
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

332
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,539
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

333
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,500
♫ Are irresistible ♫

334
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,390
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

335
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,349
♫ I do, do, do ♫

336
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,659
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

337
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,009
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

338
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:44,879
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

339
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:47,289
Where do you want to go?

340
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,259
You can't leave

341
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,909
without an explanation.

342
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,360
♫ Every best moment ♫
