Today we're going to get started with the most basic materials and tools.

Since it's customized, you have quite a few requirements,

318
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,189
and we have to provide the main stone.

319
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,989
Adding all these up,

320
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:56,830
I'm curious to see if you have a budget for it.

321
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,389
Don't worry about it.

322
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:01,139
I sort of have an idea of the market value.

323
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:04,460
Give me a quote. I'll pay twice as much.

324
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,980
Wow! It looks like we're getting a raise!

325
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,319
Where is this rich man from?

326
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:14,040
Once the order is placed, I will pay half of it first.

327
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,450
Once you've confirmed the payment, you can begin to work.

328
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,810
What's the concept?

329
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,340
Love is when you're waiting in the same place without them knowing it.

330
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,809
Waiting for what? Our company doesn't allow romantic relationships.

331
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,450
Exactly.

332
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,150
It's settled.

333
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,749
[HWC Roasters]

334
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:06,449
- They're going to fight.
- I do want to bet that Shi Lei will win,

335
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,880
but looking at the past, I'll bet on Jin Yu Zhen instead.

336
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,080
I have faith in Big Bro Lei.

337
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,319
Why did you accept this project?

338
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,329
Didn't you hear how much he's willing to pay us?

339
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,799
But don't you think this concept contradicts the Single Rule?

340
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,329
If you had had the meeting at the design studio, you would've shot yourself in the foot.

341
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,499
This is Jingcherng Metalwork and Design's project.

342
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,969
Accepting projects is what a director should do.

343
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:31,129
I won't sacrifice everyone's interests for personal factors.

344
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:36,139
I also hope that you're not too emotional to judge these decisions.

345
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,090
It actually makes sense.

346
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,690
But you're against this concept from the bottom of your heart, right?

347
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,799
As the team leader of the design studio, you'll be fully in charge of this project.

348
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,389
Sorry, I'm busy with Chairman Mai's project.

349
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,169
I can wrap it up for you.

350
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,669
- Do you want to take advantage of me?
- Or you can leave it to them.

351
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:58,120
Hey, I...

352
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,579
may not be able to do it. I can't.

353
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:02,999
I can't.

354
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:05,279
Maybe they don't have time.

355
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,239
- Childish.
- Childish?

356
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,899
You're childish.

357
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,019
You accepted the project without discussing it with us.

358
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,779
You didn't consider the practicalities at all.

359
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,630
What if I used my authority as a director

360
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,349
- to force you to do it?
- Okay.

361
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,810
We'll put an end to our relationship.

362
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,029
What did I say? Put an end to our relationship?

363
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,819
What kind of relationship are we in?

364
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,029
A director, a team leader,

365
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,849
and a roommate at most.

366
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,469
Yes, a roommate.

367
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:43,129
What am I thinking? Shi Lei,

368
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:45,739
calm down. Calm down.

369
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,139
Breathe in. Breathe out.

370
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:50,140
Breathe in.

371
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,039
- So what do you want?
- Nothing really.

372
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:03,519
But as a director, you should take over what other people can't handle, right?

373
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,630
Please take full responsibility.

374
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,790
Okay.

375
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,030
I'll do it.

376
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,059
Little Qi Qi,

377
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,419
Shi Lei actually won the fight!

378
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,859
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

379
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:40,890
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

380
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,090
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

381
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,440
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

382
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:48,989
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

383
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,389
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

384
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:53,479
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

385
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,939
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

386
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:58,579
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

387
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:00,909
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

388
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,769
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

389
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:08,009
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

390
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,579
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

391
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:13,669
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes are irresistible ♫

392
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,609
♫ Are irresistible ♫

393
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:20,619
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

394
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,419
♫ I do, do, do ♫

395
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,839
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

396
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,169
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

397
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,499
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

398
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:34,109
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

399
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:36,079
♫ I know. Oh, oh, oh ♫

400
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,839
Can you tell me

401
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,750
what kind of story

402
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:43,830
your scar has to tell?
