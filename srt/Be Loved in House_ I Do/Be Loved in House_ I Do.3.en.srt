so you act like you are superior.

00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:27,140
Are you kidding me? Is the power out?

165
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,319
How much longer do you need?

166
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,250
I'm about to pee myself.

167
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,720
Are you done touching?

168
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,749
Why don't you put clothes on?

169
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:22,990
I just finished showering.

170
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,829
Don't you usually dress before coming out?

171
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,920
Don't you also usually come out shirtless after showering?

172
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,540
That is my habit.

173
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,990
Why "Mmm"?

174
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,220
I just find you very willful.

175
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,240
Willful? You, the King of Qin, say I'm willful?

176
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,559
Being in good shape is a big deal.

177
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,690
Didn't you want to go to the bathroom?

178
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,320
Excuse me.

179
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,770
No progress.

180
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,860
How miserable.

181
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,010
Shi Lei, how are things on your end?

182
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,629
I lost a lot of orders to our competitors once I didn't pay attention.

183
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:15,379
- They were way too fast.
- Because you're still not focusing on work!

184
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,110
When will you stop being dejected?

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,619
The list of our existing clients

186
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,860
doesn't come in handy. It is really hard to network.

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,649
What have you all been doing lately?

188
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,279
It's Little Qiqi!

189
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,549
- I haven't seen you for a while.
- Yes, didn't the semester just start?

190
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,699
I've always been here. Also,

191
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:43,490
the semester started half a month ago.

192
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,920
What did you say?

193
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,799
Two weeks have passed. Time does fly.

194
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,970
What's wrong? Can I help?

195
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,010
Come into my office.

196
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,550
Another rule?

197
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,409
Yin Hua Co. Ltd.

198
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,429
This is an email I got yesterday confirming that we can move onto the next stage.

199
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,419
You can take a look at this initial proposal first.

200
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,969
Feel free to ask any questions you have.

201
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:52,470
If you want to change anything, you can let me know.

202
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,409
- Right now?
- Do I need to wait until you come back from a vacation?

203
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,209
If you have any questions after you go home, you can also ask me.

204
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,439
But time is a little tight. You'll go to a meeting with me in three days.

205
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:08,769
You need to have all the relevant information and ideas ready by then.

206
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,669
I need to look through them the night before.

207
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,420
Did you write it down?

208
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,550
You're in charge of this project.

209
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,870
- So sudden.
- Is it difficult?

210
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,010
Stop looking down on me.

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,769
- Give it to me.
- Okay. Thank you.

212
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,729
Hey, are you working?

213
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,439
Oh, yes. A new proposal.

214
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,489
Since you're working hard,

215
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,260
I will make you a special drink.

216
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,500
I heard you guys mention that you couldn't get this company to place an order.

217
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,549
That's why we gave up before.

218
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,860
Who would've expected Jin Yu Zhen to be capable of connecting with them?

219
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,019
Why sigh when there's a silver lining?

220
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,609
You're right.

221
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,769
If we can get this order,

222
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,199
the craft workshop will overcome this crisis.

223
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,379
But I'll lose my bet.

224
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,899
How come?

225
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:35,240
He introduced me to this project. If we do get it, doesn't that mean he wins?

226
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,140
Will you purposely screw up the project just because of this?

227
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,229
Of course, I won't.

228
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,490
Did he keep mentioning the bet?

229
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,949
Exactly.

230
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,559
It's a good thing for the craft workshop if the project is successful.

231
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,579
Also, leaving it to you

232
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:56,660
means you are helping make it come true, too, doesn't it?

233
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,309
Have you ever thought

234
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,880
that maybe he doesn't care about the bet at all?

235
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,130
Big Bro Gang, why do you make me seem like a narrow-minded person?

236
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,629
He started all this anyway.

237
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,809
Otherwise, who would be silly enough to oppose him?

238
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,120
Do you think your director is quite strange?

239
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,390
It's hard to explain.

240
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,139
You two spend a lot of time together.

241
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:35,350
Striking a balance will make you less exhausted.

242
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,299
If you still find it hard to accept, then look for a comfortable way

243
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,729
to respond to him. You can work for the craft workshop wholeheartedly while convincing yourself.

244
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,920
It won't affect the bet, will it?

245
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,820
But how should I do it?

246
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,870
This... you have to find out for yourself.

247
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,230
Big Bro Lei!

248
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,250
Hey.

249
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,909
- Is your class finished?
- Yes.

250
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,569
Let me ask you something.

251
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,889
If you wanted to thank someone,

252
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,419
what would you do?

253
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,800
It depends on who it is.

254
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,310
- Someone despicable.
- Do you mean the director?

255
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,329
How did you guess it?

256
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,209
He is the only one you recently despised.

257
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,959
Don't you despise him?

258
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,270
I think our director is very skilled.

259
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,590
So... any ideas?

260
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,730
I usually buy people food.

261
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,670
Never mind. Forget about my question.

262
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,909
What is this?

263
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,519
This is Giri choco.

264
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,949
With White Day approaching, people in our department give chocolates to express their feelings.

265
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,500
Everyone makes their own chocolate and gives it away.

266
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,060
I have an idea. Thank you, Si Qi.

267
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,580
Big Bro Lei! Big Bro Lei, wait for me!

268
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,099
Why...

269
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,099
didn't you wait for me to come home and cook?

270
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,489
Well, I'm afraid you'll be too busy.

271
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:37,370
Aren't you busy juggling school and work?

272
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,880
You little fool.

273
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,420
Have a seat. Food will be ready in a minute.

274
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,959
Hi, welcome back!

275
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,950
Do you want to have dinner with me?

276
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,989
Or do you want to shower first?

277
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:17,310
We'll eat after you've showered.

278
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,999
Why did you suddenly cook dinner?

279
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:24,039
As the team leader of the craft workshop, I surely need to thank the art director on behalf of everyone,

280
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,879
for finding us a way out.

281
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,729
It is only a proposal. We didn't get it yet.

282
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:31,699
I know. We will work hard on it.

283
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,470
Come and eat first.

284
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,040
All right. Time to eat.

285
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,750
- Let's have soup first.
- Oh, okay.

286
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,920
What's this?

287
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,789
A daikon radish.

288
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:10,680
A whole daikon?

289
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah.

290
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,870
Let's eat.

291
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,220
Why don't we order takeout?

292
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,270
Eating food like this occasionally is pretty good.

293
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,810
Thank you.

294
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,420
This egg is excellent.

295
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,199
I know these dishes are nowhere as good as restaurants out there.

296
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,569
But I've learned a few dishes from my mom.

297
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,139
Or is there any dish here

298
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,490
that is not to your taste?

299
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,740
Let me ladle out soup for you.

300
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,580
Be careful. It's hot.

301
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,580
♫ I do! I do! I do ♫

302
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,939
♫ Because I do! I do! I do ♫

303
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,259
♫ The coffee shop on the street corner ♫

304
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,609
♫ Has the smell of bubbles ♫

305
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,239
♫ I have an indescribable gut feeling ♫

306
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,669
♫ That I may run into someone today ♫

307
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,819
♫ It's finally on the hour ♫

308
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:19,249
♫ The streets are ablaze with color as usual ♫

309
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,699
♫ Feeling romantic in the breeze alongside the river ♫

310
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:24,089
♫ I can't help spinning excitedly ♫

311
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,079
♫ The midnight showing got delayed ♫

312
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,199
♫ That day you made a promise ♫

313
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:34,009
♫ And I wished upon a shooting star ♫

314
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,979
♫ Your face profile, smile and eyes ♫

315
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:40,939
♫ Are irresistible ♫

316
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,879
♫ I'm gonna share with you, my love ♫

317
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,709
♫ I do, do, do ♫

318
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:48,119
♫ We've promised to meet again in early summer ♫

319
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,569
♫ With the wings that brought us together ♫

320
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,839
♫ I'll fly when sunshine comes after rain ♫

321
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,139
♫ I'll hold it in my hand forever, blooming for you ♫

322
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,159
Big Bro Gang, you probably know what happened when he went to university.

323
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,450
Was he in love with anyone back then?
