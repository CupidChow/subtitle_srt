00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,200
This dress is annoying!

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,280
About the next thing,

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,760
save it for the honeymoon.

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,400
(What? Honeymoon?)

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Got you.

14
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:43,857
(Maslow's hierarchy of needs)

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,280
Mr. Maslow, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,280
Please spare me.

17
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,040
Lin Xuenong.

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,520
(Just run when you see me?)

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
(What did I do wrong?)

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,514
(Unread messages
from Zhou Heng: Six voice messages.)

21
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:24,971
(Why not respond to me?)

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,840
Your delivery needs to be signed for.

23
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Delivery?

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,240
What did I buy?

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
Lin Xuenong!

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,960
Is there anything you want to tell me?

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,720
Mr. Zhou,

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
nothing happened that night,

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
and nothing should have happened.

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Then why did you kiss me?

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,560
I...

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Regard me as a pervert, okay?

33
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,120
I wanted to take advantage of you.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,560
There are a lot of people
who want to do that,

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
but I know you're not one of them.

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
Just think of me as one of them.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,080
It's my fault.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,000
Hate me all you want.

39
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,880
Did you misunderstand?

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,800
I said to save it for the honeymoon...

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
Don't think about anything.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm serious.

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,371
You're going to regret it.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Lin Xuenong!

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm Zhou Heng,

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
not some clown you can fiddle with.

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,360
What are you doing?

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,840
Mom!

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,680
Madam.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
I can't believe

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,600
you're getting married

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,120
without talking to your parents.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,360
Dragon born dragon,
chicken born chicken,

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,280
and mouse's child...

55
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:14,960
Mom!

56
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,560
Shut up!

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,120
Madam,

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
please believe me.

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,120
We'll be happy.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,600
Are you just trying to dump

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
your family's mess on us?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
You wish!

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Son, come with me.

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,160
Let's go!

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,120
She replied!

66
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Tell her

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,920
to keep her chin up. Good job!

68
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,040
Dad, who're you going to guide in life?

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Let's go there.

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,920
It's your sister,

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Cao.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,920
I heard Meng Yang say
you like someone else.

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
How's it going?

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
I think too much.

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
We're just

76
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,000
colleagues right now.

77
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
When she heard the word "marriage",

78
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
she overreacted

79
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,720
and didn't even
give me a chance to explain.

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,920
Son.

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,480
What kind of relationship
starts with marriage?

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Who's not scared?

83
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,360
- Go apologize!
- Go apologize!
