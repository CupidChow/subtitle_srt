=Episode 7=

3
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,320
You

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
can't avoid me anymore.

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,120
Mr. Zhou,

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
you must be hungry.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,240
To thank you,

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm taking you to my secret base.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,320
All right.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,400
Let's go.

11
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:57,542
(Gangyuan Restaurant
Mei's Canteen)

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,200
Aunt Mei!

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,080
Lin, there you go again.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,640
You...

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,360
Why haven't you been here in years?

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,920
Aunt Mei,

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,400
I've been abroad for the past few years,

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
and have returned recently.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,840
You're a regular here, too?

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
Sit here. Come on.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,760
The little goal you talked about
last time, you made it?

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,040
How did you know that?

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,200
I think it's great.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,040
You're a perfect match.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Aunt Mei, this one is my little goal.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I don't have a name yet,

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
but I'm going
to call it Xuenong Spirit.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
What do you think?

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,040
You guys can have a good talk.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,480
Okay!

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I'll get to work.

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,560
- Sure.
- Okay.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,040
Here are your dishes.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
All your favorite ones.

35
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Thanks, Aunt Mei.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,200
Go ahead, please.

That's right. Good quality

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
and low price here.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,280
And Aunt Mei is nice.

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,240
I'll come over as soon as I have time.

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,520
Thank you

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,120

I'm exhausted.

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
What are you doing?

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,160
Making a PPT. Just give me
a minute. You eat first.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,280
Hey,

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,240
Mr. Zhou fired you yesterday

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,650
and put you back to work the next day.

56
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,400
What is he up to?

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,360
Playing hard to get?

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,680
He cherishes talents.

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm also talented

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,720
but why doesn't he come to me every day?

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Well, I see

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
you're going to fall in love with him.

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
No, no no.

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm as normal
as fried eggs and tomatoes,

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
not like abalone or seafood.

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,560
He's only interested in me
for a few days.

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
I won't fall for it.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
Good for you, Nong.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,720
You're wise.

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
But he is Zhou Heng.

71
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,680
When a man like him
throws his pride down to pursue you,

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
you're not moved?

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,880
Listen to yourself.

74
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,350
Even if he gets down on his knees,
I can't be attracted to him.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
(She must explain herself tomorrow.)

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,480
(But we have no relationship.)

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,240
(Why should she explain?)

78
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,240
(People say women)

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,560
(are emotionally unstable
a few days a month.)

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,720
(I've always wondered)

81
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,840
(if men, like women,)

82
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,800
(have a few days a month.)

83
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,450
Here is the document.

84
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,800
Don't make me wait for you next time.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
You're the one who forgot the document.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Lin Xuenong.

87
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
Do you know you
have a meeting with Ice today?

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,920
Look at what you're wearing.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
We represent the face
of the company on the outside.

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
You don't need
to attend today's meeting.

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,600
(You jerk! I'll be there!)

92
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,000
(Ice, Internet celebrity,
and livestreaming sales king)

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
Ice, the helicopter is in position.

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
The band is in position.

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Wei.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,280
Today is the 1314th day
we've known each other.

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I want to make this day memorable

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,920
and make you
the most happiest woman in the world.

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
Wei, please open the door.

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,240
Jerk!

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Who are you? What do you want?

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm so sorry!

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
Hello? Wei, where are you?

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,480
I...

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
But...

106
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
No, you haven't seen it!

107
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm serious.

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,120
Hello? Hello?

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
What kind of paparazzi wrecks my plan?

110
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,400
Ice's always presented himself
in public as single.

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,560
My man said

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,260
he was meeting
his girlfriend here secretly.

113
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
Get a clear shot.

114
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,280
He's just
a livestreaming sales influencer.

115
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
Why are you filming him?

116
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
God, use your mind!

117
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,120
He claims to be in charge
of the nation's women's wallets.

118
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,360
He makes more money
through live commerce than many stars.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
But when does he come?

120
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,160
His agent is not there anymore.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,920
He'll be here soon.

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,160
I've seen your spirits.

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
To be frank,

124
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,240
The Chinese Baijiu is old-fashioned,

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
which isn't for Ice's soul.

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,800
We're not interested.

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
Hope it'll be successful.

128
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,850
(Gu Yu, looks like the endorsement
isn't going to work out.)

129
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Hey! Still filming?

130
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
What are you doing?

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,840
Honey,

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,240
we'll talk about it at home.

133
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
Don't be mad.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,120
We're fine. Let's go home.

135
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,180
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,600
We'll talk about it at home.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,160
Let go of me!

138
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,160
What happened?

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
Isn't that our son's classmate,
Lin Xuenong?

140
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Let's go home,

141
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Dad.

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,040
Shame on her dad.

143
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,100
(Dandan noodles.)

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Let's go home.

145
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
We'll talk about it at home.

146
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
What are you doing?

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,480
(I think my crowd phobia
seems to have acted up again.)

148
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Are you okay?

149
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,000
You did great just now.

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
But I still need you
to pretend to be my girlfriend.

151
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,640
Name your price.

152
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,320
You think you can
buy everything with money?

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
Who do you think you are?

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,840
If you agree to endorse Xuenong Spirit,

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
I'll do as you request.
