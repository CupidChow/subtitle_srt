00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,440
I'm thirsty. I'll grab
a bottle of water.

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,760
Why you are here?

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,520
I asked Lin Xuenong to bring you here.

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,000
I wasn't clear that day?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You ever said

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,920
I would take someone I like

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,085
to the top and watch the sunset.

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,720
No tricks,

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,200
but genuineness.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,120
I know I have many titles,

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
like "Marketing King",

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,200
"Best Male Star Online",

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,120
"Most Votes Winner"

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
and "Fastest Influencer
to Reach 10 Million Followers".

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
I missed the point.

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,200
I want to tell you

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
that without these titles,

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm only an ordinary boy.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
I hope the girl I like

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,200
likes me the same way.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
So why do you like me?

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,000
I like you when you're working,

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,400
you're like a lioness
defending her territory.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,920
I also like you
when you're protecting friends,

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
you're like a brave tigress.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,040
Well, I'm so glad to hear it. Thanks.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,760
What? Tigress and lioness are great.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Who says women
should be protected by men.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,560
Women can protect men too.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I feel so safe around you.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
So cozy.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
You like guards?

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
I know in your mind,

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,685
I'm always a lady killer
who is careless and casual.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,560
But I have no reservations

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
or secrets from you.

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,080
I am what I am.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
Actually, I also have my answer.

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
But I'm unwilling to admit it.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,960
I still have the biggest secret.

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,120
My real name is...

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Don't laugh!

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
You can't tell anyone about it!

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Understand?

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Depends on your performance.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,440
So...?

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,880
Well, since you're honest,

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,880
I do like you.

53
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Let's be in a relationship.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,280
Really?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,680
Great!

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,400
Lin Xuenong!

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Make me look good.

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
That's what we're going to do to him!

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
He's coming.

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,160
Why are you here?

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,120
Heng, are you in a relationship
with Lin Xuenong?

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
- You can't do it!
- No way!

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why?

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,960
Is it because of Xuenong's dad?

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
But he is giving up alcohol now.

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Because you're related by blood.

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
What?

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Xuenong!

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
What were you talking about?

70
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:54,560
Do you remember that sister
on the Internet named Xiaocao?

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,840
I finally got a chance to make a joke.

72
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,000
- They don't get us!
- Look how silly they are!

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Xuenong!

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Xiaocao!

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
We're JJ.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,560
So JJ stands for two persons?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Let me explain.

79
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,560
My name is Zhou Jianghe.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,840
And she's Ye Jing.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Our names both start with J.

82
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,040
So our user name is JJ.

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,240
Aren't you in the Drake Passage?

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,240
You also said you raised pigs in Gansu.

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Xuenong,

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
haven't you always wanted to know

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,920
who created the Jinghe old spirits?

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,800
My parents

89
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,000
are the founders of that.

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
What?

91
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
You're looking for me?

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
Right. We're kind of in the same career.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,480
I just do things

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,800
on a whim.

95
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,480
Then I left and enjoyed life
with his dad.

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,360
Oh, I see.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,120
By the way,

98
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,800
how did you know her?

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
We're not telling you.

100
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Right.

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,920
That's the secret among us.

102
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
Xuenong

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,920
also knew my secret.

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,800
Xuenong.

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Actually my full name is Ye Zhouheng.

106
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
Zhou Heng doesn't want to depend on us,

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,240
so he's been hiding
who he is since his first job.

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,800
We're not trying to hide who we are.

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,800
We're just used to it over the years.

110
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,120
And it's not a big deal.

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
Because

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
I haven't had the right time

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,920
to tell you.

114
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,160
There is so much information today.

115
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know
how to process it for a while.

116
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
It's okay.

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
Go home and accept them slowly.

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,920
Xiaocao, welcome home!

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,360
Oh no, you guys are JJ!

120
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,360
That's so embarrassing.

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,920
It's okay.

122
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Didn't expect that, huh?

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
Exciting?

124
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,800
Stop it!

125
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
Are you ready to leave?

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,680
Is the process done?

127
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I discussed it with my dad.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
They still wanted me
to go there personally

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,480
to take charge.

130
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,920
After all, this is the group's

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,120
first acquisition of a foreign company.

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
How long will you stay there?

133
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
A couple of days.

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,160
But the next time I'm back,
I'm moving completely.

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
I expect the fastest process

136
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
to take about two years.

137
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
That long?

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,680
Xuenong...

139
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,160
You...

140
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,720
I'll go with you.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
Of course I should be with you.

142
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,160
I should pick up the phone.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Hello? Yu?

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,120
Don't forget about your meeting

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,240
with my boss tomorrow.

146
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
I'll send you the address and time.

147
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,720
Remember to get there in time.

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
I give up.

149
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
Don't do that.

150
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,280
My boss really appreciates you!

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,920
I've promised him on your behalf!

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,160
I know it's a great chance.

153
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Yes.

154
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,160
Now that you know, why hesitate?

155
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,320
Because of Zhou Heng...
