=Episode 8=

3
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,990
I still need you
to pretend to be my girlfriend.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,000
If you agree to endorse Xuenong Spirit,

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
I'll do as you request.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,720
Let's go.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,080
Look at them!

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,320
Excessive breathing can lead
to serious loss of carbon dioxide,

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,440
causing respiratory alkalosis.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,640
(Using brown paper bags
can capture carbon dioxide)

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,640
(and allow people
to take it back into the body.)

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,400
I really want to drink today.

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,280
Why? Are you hallucinating again?

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,680
Yes.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,040
Your hallucination
started at the spa hotel,

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,320
so it was...

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,560
Zhou Heng. Am I right?

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
It would be fine if there was only him.

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,000
You mean it's not just him,

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
and there's someone else?

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,200
Listen to me.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,040
One is an aloof jerk.

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,920
Another is a sweet gentleman.

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
My head is literally going to explode.

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Nong, good for you!

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,400
How many men do you have in your head?

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,520
Gu Yu!

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't want...

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
I'm coming.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,710
I'll go sign something
and be right back.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,280
Wait for me.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
Come back soon.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,280
I don't want to drink alone,

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
because I might be drunk soon.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,840
You said sometimes being honest

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,560
was the best thing to do.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
(Zhou Heng, CEO of Jinghe Spirits)

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,000
Then I'm going to be honest
with you right now.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,280
In fact,

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,560
ever since the day at the spa hotel,

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,400
my hallucinations

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
have gotten worse.

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,520
You were prim and dressed

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,120
but to me,

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
(Zhou Heng, CEO of Jinghe Spirits)

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
you were undressed

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,280
and kept tantalizing me.

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,520
What can I do?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
See?

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,440
Being honest is useless!

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,880
My hallucination is getting worse.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
Now,

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,080
a real Zhou Heng is coming up.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,800
(Rent collection day)

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
(Sleep before 11:00 PM)

56
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,910
♪When the coffee pours♪

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
♪By the end, my face♪

58

65

I need to learn to live

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,800
Lin!

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Yes?

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm coming.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,828
Lin, are you here?

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Lin,

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
I leave the kit here for you.

72
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
Okay. That would be great.

73
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,720
Thanks for coming. You can leave now.

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
When did you find a boyfriend?

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,920
He's kind of good-looking.

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,480
Just leave!

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,240
Mr. Zhou, what brings you here?

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Who is he?

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,600
He's my neighbor.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,920
He had a broken light,
so he asked me to borrow some tools.

81
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
He's the guy

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,600
on the motorcycle?

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,720
That one is my tenant.

84
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,360
Looks like you
have quite a few side hustles.

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Not so many.

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,920
How do you know he has a motorcycle?

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,160
Well,

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,800
I guess.

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Randomly?

90
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
(I haven't had any hallucinations yet.)

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,240
(I'm finally back to normal!)

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
(I can finally work!)

93
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Why are you so happy?

94
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Well, the problem
that were bothering me

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
has been solved.

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Are you so happy
that your hallucinations are gone?

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,720
(Jesus! How does he know it?)

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm not. I'm just...

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
It's okay.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,160
You don't have to dodge me anymore.

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,160
(What did he mean by that?)

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,800
Xuenong.

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Do you really

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,480
want to stay single like this?

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,360
I've got

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,120
my future all figured out.

107
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,160
No matter what,

108
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,720
you won't change your plan
in your lifetime?

109
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
(Is he)

110
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
(serious about me?)

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Mr. Zhou, it's getting late.

112
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,720
Now I'll take you back.

113
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:58,000
("Phobic Psychology")

114
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,685
(How to break the psychology
of avoiding fear?)

115
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,680
(Face the things you're afraid of first)

116
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,314
(and don't run away from them.)

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,400
My friend was working on it.

118
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,480
He asked me to borrow it.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,680
It's not what you think.

120
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:32,942
(How do you get rid
of this anxiety and fear?)

121
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:34,714
(Don't worry too much
about gains and losses.)

122
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,710
(Don't want to bury
your head in the sand, do it now.)

123
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:44,028
(Recognize phobias correctly.)

124
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,828
(This is very common in modern cities.)
