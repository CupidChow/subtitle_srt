2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,160
Can I hang out with you on your island?

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,320
No, I'll lock myself in.

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,760
Hey!

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,600
Be careful!

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
I'm the one

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,720
who will get to the top right away.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm exhausted.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,440
Are you okay?

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm fine.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,920
It's your turn.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
What? I don't understand.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
Tell me your reasons.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,920
What?

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Why do you have to get married?

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,920
Simply, it's an excessive
sense of responsibility.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,840
Responsibility?

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm really exhausted.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,560
I can carry you.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,120
Then you won't be tired.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
It's beautiful here.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,040
Help me take a photo.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,320
Of course.

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,280
What do the lyrics

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,400
of this song mean?

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
It means

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,000
"It is better to have loved and lost"

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,160
"than never to have loved at all."

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
So it's okay to lose someone you love?

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
If I lose you,

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,840
it's like you said...

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,280
I'll be alone for a lifetime.

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,000
When I'm old,

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll go to buy an island.

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
You are an idiot.

37
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
Where are you going?

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
This road is too smooth.

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
I want to find a more winding road.

40
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
It really suits you
to be a troublemaker.

41
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,840
I want to show her how much I love her

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
in a really awesome way!

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,520
Courting underwater in the Maldives.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,680
Lousy.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,000
Skydiving and pulling banners?

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
I have a fear of heights.

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Listen. That's what I think.

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
My plan is

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I'll charter a revolving restaurant,

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,680
and it has to be one
of those panoramic windows.

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I'll book it,

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
and we can enjoy every item in it.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,160
Then we can be happy
and watch animals.

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,400
Have great food and have fun.

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,160
Wait.

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,600
Just two of you

57
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:26,657
can come to the top
and watch the sunset.

58
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
No tricks,

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
but genuineness.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Zhou Heng!

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
Zhou Heng!

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Zhou Heng!

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,280
Zhou Heng! You can't
joke about such things!

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,920
Where are you?

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm here!

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,920
Lin Xuenong, have you figured it out?

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,160
Yes! Hurry down!

68
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,428
You know what you want?

69
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, I did think it through.

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,240
I do like you.

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,040
Lin Xuenong.

72
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Yes?

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,400
Take me to your island.

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
You're the island owner.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
And I'm the owner's boyfriend.

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,840
Of course.

77
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,800
But why do I have to
give up my principles

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,480
instead of you giving up yours?

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,920
You've always been on the offensive.

80
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Then I'll decide

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,560
to change my position.

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Yeah!

83
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,120
Mr. Zhou.

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,040
I want to ask you something.

85
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,360
What are you hiding from?

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,800
Where are your principles?

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
As a CEO of a company,

88
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
why are you scared?

89
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,720
All right. I was just messing with you.

90
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,085
I want to ask you a question.

91
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,040
As our CEO,

92
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
you must know many secrets
of our company, right?

93
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,240
I've gone through all the files,

94
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,171
but I can't find the information
about the original female liquor maker.

95
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Who is she?

96
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,040
I do know.

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,480
Besides,

98
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,800
I know who she is.

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Tell me!

100
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,800
Come here.

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
It's a secret.

102
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,360
Childish!

103
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,840
Get on.

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Making fun of me again?

105
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,480
Hurry up.

107
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:50,120
You have any ideas for eating?

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Let me treat you.

109
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me think

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
of a restaurant.

111
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,120
I know where to eat.

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,160
Hold me.

113
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,000
To your house!

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,240
Can you handle it?

115
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,040
Yes!

116
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,680
Come in.

117
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Awesome.

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,160
I didn't know your house was like this.

119
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,360
I decorated and designed
all this myself.

120
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
How's it? Do you like it?

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Well, it's kind of tasteful.

122
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,800
But today I should check it out.
