00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,040
Mr. Zhou! The first bottle
of spirit ever produced!

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,040
Please have a try.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,320
(Wait.)

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,920
(Is it my hallucination or is it real?)

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,360
(Oh, it's real.)

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,920
The best way to deal
with your hallucination

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,257
is to deal with him.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,360
(He slept so well.)

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,960
(Is this a chance God gave me?)

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,920
(No! I can't take advantage of him
when he's asleep.)

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,200
(This is hooliganism.)

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,680
(Is she going to kiss me or not?)

15
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:48,142
(Tianma Spirits)

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Director Ma, look at my spirit!

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,560
Well,

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
what's the matter?

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,920
Tianma Spirits?

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,560
Isn't this our rival?

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Director Ma,
are you going to job-hop?

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,480
When you're my age,

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,480
it's hard to do it.

24
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
Then why are you planning
to change your job?

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
The new product release meeting
is about to start.

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,840
Xuenong, don't you understand?

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Mr. Zhou won't want idle people.

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,240
I should make plans
for myself before it's too late.

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,280
After all,
I still have my family to support.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,080
No way!

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Who's the developer
of this Chinese Baijiu?

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
Tell me about it.

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,720
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,680
Let me introduce you.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,720
About this Chinese Baijiu,

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
right after the last meeting

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
of all our colleagues...

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,440
Director Ma.

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,771
Does this spirit
have anything to do with you?

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,914
Mr. Zhou, here is the thing.

41
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Lin Xuenong and I
developed this spirit together.

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,840
We put a lot of effort into it.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,880
And we worked overtime every day
to develop it.

44
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,400
All right.

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,080
I...

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,600
Director Ma.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Congratulations.

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
Lin Xuenong.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
You're fired.

50
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,840
Mr. Zhou, wait...

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Actually, Xuenong was...

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,120
Lin Xuenong, what were you thinking?

53
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Director Ma spoke for you.
Why did you stop him?

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,360
I've been clear about it.

55
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,280
Director Ma...

56
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
Get in the car.

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
Is it okay for you?

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
Yes.

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
Call me if you need me.

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
Why didn't you explain?

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,920
I accepted my own responsibilities.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,428
Why did you share your credit
with Director Ma?

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Sometimes being honest
is the best thing to do.

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,800
Mr. Zhou,

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,120
would you please go somewhere with me?

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,457
Why did you bring me here?

67
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:18,800
Look at it!

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Keep down.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,240
It's here.

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,600
How about this one?

71
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Get down a little bit.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
That's Director Ma.

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,120
On weekends, no one can reach him.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
Once I had an emergency,

75
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,400
I asked all my colleagues to know

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,800
that he took his daughter
to play here on weekends.

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
Look! You caught it!

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
I know, for you, Director Ma

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,360
isn't a competent director of R&D.

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
But in my eyes,

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
he's a good father.

82
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,720
Catch the big one.

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,840
That's it!

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,800
Zuo.

85
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,160
They're your new parents.

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,920
Behave yourself, okay?

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,160
Please rest assured.
We'll treat him well.

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,600
Let's go.

89
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Go now.

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
You caught another one!

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,840
Yes! I made it again!

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
You're awesome!

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go get some good food,

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,600
shall we?

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
Dad, you're the best!

96
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Lin Xuenong.

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
I rescind my decision to fire you.

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,000
But the entire R&D
will share your credit.

99
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,280
So is the bonus.

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,000
So you're not going
to punish Director Ma, right?

101
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
He'll be transferred
to a more suitable position.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,800
However,

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
you should promise me one thing.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,480
What is it? Just tell me.

105
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,240
You

106
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
can't avoid me anymore.
