00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,320
Come in.

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,400
I didn't know your house was like this.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,040
I decorated and designed
all this myself.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,040
How's it? Do you like it?

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, it's kind of tasteful.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,840
But today

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I should check it out.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,360
I mean your cooking skills.

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,640
Look at your pretty hands.

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,760
Be careful not to cut them.

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,480
Have you ever cooked?

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,920
I didn't do it before.
So I'm inexperienced.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,680
Can't even wash rice?

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,280
My parents are coming.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,040
How about

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,840
meeting them?

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
No!

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,120
Dad. Mom.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
What brings you here?

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,280
I know you're home.

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,000
Good for you.

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
Started cooking alone?

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Exactly.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,400
How can you go out on a date

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
on a beautiful night like this?

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,280
If you find a girlfriend,

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,130
what should we do?

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,840
Yes.

32
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:15,830
In that case, you won't
be able to piss us off.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,280
Dad.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,560
That's not true.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,914
Wouldn't you be glad you pissed us off?

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,000
Maybe our son doesn't like men or women.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,720
Breaking up was just
an excuse to put us off, right?

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,800
You're right.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,240
(Well, they are Zhou Heng's parents.)

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
(They look a little familiar.)

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
Hello. Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Zhou.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,560
covering for housekeeping here.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
I only work one day.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
I've done

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,080
my work today.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
So I have to go.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Bye.

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,440
Hey, stay here for the dinner.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
Something is off.

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
Nonsense.

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,440
Pathetic!

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,960
The only women
who have been in this house

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
are your mother

55
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
and the cleaning lady.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
Cleaning lady?

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Tell us the truth.

58
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
Is she your girlfriend?

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Wait and see.

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
There's a chance.

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,440
(Don't listen to my parents.)

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,360
(They...)

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
(Your parents love you.)

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,000
(Your family is so happy.)

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,520
(There's one person
missing from my family.)

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
(And that's you.)

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
What are you doing?

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
Why not respond to my message?

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,440
About the thing you were
talking about last time,

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
is it okay for me to do that?

71
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
This week, I'm taking her for this.

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,840
Do you girls like this stuff?

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,000
Help me think about it.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
Why not respond to my message?

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,800
(What are you doing? Answer me!)

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,285
(I'm busy talking
about the new spokesperson.)

77
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:31,600
What's going on?

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,360
Almost done?

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,714
The live stream is about to start.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
Who endorsed
the Xuenong Spirit last time?

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
What?

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Xuenong Spirit.

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
Xuenong Spirit?

84
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:50,230
(Ice's Live-stream)
There are only 2,000 left of the German

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,030
(It's so cheap!)
coffee maker we just introduced.

86
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,160
Let's order quickly!

87
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:55,240
How many orders are left?

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,040
Less than 1,000.

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,371
Do you hear it? Less than 1,000!

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Count ten seconds backward.

91
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,720
(I think it's expensive.)
Ten. Nine. Eight...

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Sold out!

93
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay.

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Then pass this product.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,142
Come on! The next item.

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,480
This product...

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
(I like its price! So cheap!)

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
(Ice's recommendation! I must buy it!)

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
(You're so handsome!)

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
My dear fans,

101
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,240
now I'd like to introduce
this spirit to you.

102
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,280
Its name is Xuenong Spirit.

103
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:23,040
This is the best Chinese Baijiu

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
I've had in years.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This spirit

106
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,800
is low in strength
and a special blend.

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
It looks beautiful

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,480
and doesn't go to head easily.

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
(Tonight!)
High cost performance!

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,428
It is easy to carry when you go out
and get together with friends.

111
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,240
(I've bought it!)

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
Get to the cart!

113
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,514
(Lin Xuenong)

114
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,820
(Lin Xuenong)

115
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Hello?

116
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
What happened?

117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
How are you?

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
(Zhou Heng! Something happened!)

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,000
What?
