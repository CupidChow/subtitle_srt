=Save it for the Honeymoon=

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,480
There's a fine

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,160
for being late.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,920
(Lin Xuenong!)

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,880
(Now I'm facing the most
inexplicable crisis of my life.)

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
(My hallucinations
haven't gone away,)

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
(and they've even escalated.)

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
How's it going?

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,040
Well, it's almost done.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,960
It's almost done.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,920
It'll be ready in a minute.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,240
Are you okay?

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,880
Your questionnaire

15
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:03,280
is not good enough.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,320
Work is so boring.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,560
How about

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
doing something else?

19
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:13,560
What exactly are you doing?

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,840
(God.)

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,320
(How can I do my work?)

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,840
(Zhou Heng)

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,028
(A fresh start for Jinghe Spirits)
How's it? Handsome, huh?

24
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:33,971
(Zhou Heng, CEO of Jinghe Spirits)

25
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:40,028
(A fresh start for Jinghe Spirits)

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,600
(Didn't Mr. Zhou talk to you?)

27
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:59,050
(He didn't fire you
for offending him so badly.)

28
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,050
(Such a great boss.)

29
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,150
(Nonsense.)

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,257
(He's bothering me every day.)

31
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,657
(I can't even concentrate on my work.)

32
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,085
(Is it harassment?)

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,840
Hey, are you up so late?

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Lost sleep?

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,520
When you're young, you don't know
how precious something is.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
When you're old, don't regret it.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Save it for yourself.

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,880
This spirit is low in strength,

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
but it tastes good.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,840
This is the taste
of the first love you mentioned.

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,560
Lin Xuenong.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,880
You made me impressive.

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
But

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
she made me weird.

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,440
Still not admitting?

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,360
It's rare that there's a woman

47
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,160
who can turn you on.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Never mind what she said.

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,280
Just go for it,

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
and take the initiative.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
Lin Xuenong.

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
During the day, you don't
answer your phone and can't be reached.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,680
What are you doing?

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,120
Are you okay?

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
Bad luck.

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Lucky me.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
So you mixed the spirit
you gave me before

58
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,800
into the new one to create a new taste?

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,280
Since there's something new,

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,480
why don't you let me know?

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,480
I want you to taste it when it's ready.

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Then may I taste you?

63
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:36,240
(What are you talking about?)

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
(He swallows in front of me.)

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,160
(Does Charming Zhou Heng
affect Genuine Zhou Heng?)

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm a little hungry.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,000
I already took a bite of this burger.

68
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,680
Do you mind?

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,840
I don't mind.

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,800
(If I don't get out of here,)

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,480
(something bad is going to happen.)

72
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,090
The elevator is fixed.
There are two people in it.

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
Oh, god.

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,480
That was terrifying.

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Mr. Zhou, you can go back first.

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
I'll report to you tomorrow.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,840
A liar's nose gets longer.

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,920
So this is how you see me.

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
(What?)

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
(Can he see my hallucination?)
