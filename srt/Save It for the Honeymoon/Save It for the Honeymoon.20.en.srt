Xuenong!

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Mr. Zhou is always out of the office,

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,040
so I can't find him to sign these.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,240
Do you know where he is?

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,840
Go to ask his secretary.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,680
I don't know his stuff.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,440
Xue...

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Why don't you call me?

11
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,320
Being ghosted, huh?

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,400
I don't see any need for contact.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Think of it as a game.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:17,971
Okay?

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,680
Don't follow me.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,320
Game?

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,400
You think me of that?

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
Ladies. Ice is coming here again.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
Whoever wants to take photos hurries up!

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm a big fan of you!

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,320
Can we take a photo together?

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,440
Yes, I like you too!

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
Give us a signature!

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,240

Take good care of her.

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,680
I'll go first.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Okay.

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,400
Why are you here?

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,960
Yesterday was your birthday.

42
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,280
I prepared a special gift for you.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,160
This matter is very complicated

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,360
and I can't tell you

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,360
until I'm absolutely sure.

46
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
I don't want to give you false hope.

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,840
What happened to your hands?

48
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
Come to a place with me.

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
Then you'll know everything.

50
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,142
Let's go.

51
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,040
Come inside.

52
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,480
You...

53
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,480
Are you Lin Xuenong?

54
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,480
Your dad's alcohol addiction is serious.

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,120
Thanks to Zhou Heng,
he got your dad here in time.

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,040
We worked with some medication
and psychotherapy.

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
He's

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
more stable now.

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,840
He'll wake up soon.

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
You can go visit him.

61
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,920
Thanks, Doctor.

62
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
Turns out your hand...

63
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Compared with this small thing,

64
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
Mr. Lin's contribution is huge.

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,600
He really wants
to stop drinking for you.

66
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
He's willing to cooperate,

67
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,920
and that's how we got here.

68
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,600
Go ahead.

69
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Xuenong.

70
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Dad.

71
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,840
Take it easy.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,240
Look at me! I'm high-spirited, right?

He is buying me some good things!

77
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,240
Why don't you look happy?

78
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,960
Not really. I just can't remember

79
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
the last time

80
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
I saw you sober.

81
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Xuenong.

82
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm a terrible dad!

83
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm sorry for you!

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
In fact,

85
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,680
I also hate myself

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,600
for still being alive.

87
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,720
I must quit drinking,

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
and be a good dad.

89
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,040
Is that okay?

90
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,800
My good girl.
