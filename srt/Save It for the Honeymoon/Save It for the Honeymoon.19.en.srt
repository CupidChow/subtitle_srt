00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,640
What's wrong?

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,600
You don't seem to be
in a good mood lately.

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,760
Me?

6
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,360
I got a promotion and a raise.

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,320
I couldn't be happier.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Before the dinner,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll invite today's secret guest.

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,200
Because of him,

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,760
our Xuenong Spirit

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,360
can earn a reputation in the market.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Let's welcome

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,080
Ice.

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,428
Sorry about that earlier.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,040
Hope we can continue cooperation.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,680
You have secrets
with me now?

18
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,142
Glad to cooperate with you.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Do you drink it?

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
I finally found you.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,000
Why didn't you respond to my messages?

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,920
You're out of the shadow.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
So my mission is over.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,400
So we can't chat?

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,560
What can I talk to him about?

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,040
Do you hate me?

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
You hate me?

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Hate me?

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes, I do.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
I hate you!

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,560
But I like you.

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
How about you?

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm happy.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,840
It's finally time for us to be alone.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,960
This is our memorial site.

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think so.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It was so humiliating.

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
You're right.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,840
After all, you were obsessed with me.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Nonsense! I didn't do that!

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,560
Don't you ever miss my messages again.

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,680
Don't ignore me!

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,280
Don't give orders in front of me.
Do you hear me?

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,280
This way!

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
Your birthday is at the next month.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
But I've never given a girl a gift.

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,840
So I've been trying
to figure out what to get.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't want anything.

49
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,680
I only want...

50
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,680
Save it for the honeymoon.

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
All right. I'll stop it.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Listen.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Are you sure
you've never been in love?

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm serious about relationships.

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
I only choose the one
I'm meant to be with.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Can you tell me more

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,000
about your past?

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,280
I want to learn more about you.

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
Actually,

60
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
I have a secret.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,400
Hello?

62
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
What?

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
What happened?

64
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Dad!

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
What's going on?

66
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
Are you hurt?

67
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,400
Are you okay?

68
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
What? Are you still smoking?

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,040
You almost killed us!

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm sorry for that.

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm really sorry.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
How could you be a daughter?

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Look at your dad!
And you just left him alone?

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
Do you have any conscience?

75
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
Madam, we're sorry to trouble you.

76
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
Dad, are you okay?

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
How are you?

78
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,480
Mr. Lin.

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,920
You're right.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm not strong.

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,280
I also want to escape.

82
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,280
However,

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
because of my dad,

84
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,160
I don't want to be laughed at by anyone.

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,840
I don't want to do it again.

86
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
You could have told me.

87
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,280
I don't know how to say it.

88
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,600
I don't want my burden
to be yours.

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,920
Because you treat me well.

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm sorry

91
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,480
for keeping this from you.

92
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,000
Xuenong.

93
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,160
Xuenong.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,040
You can leave now.

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll stay.

96
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,240
Just go!

97
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,600
I don't want to be embarrassed anymore.

98
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,720
Xuenong!

99
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,680
Mr. Zhou is always out of the office,

100
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,360
so I can't find him to sign these.

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,720
Do you know where he is?

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
Go to ask his secretary.

103
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
I don't know his stuff.

104
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:08,480
Xue...
