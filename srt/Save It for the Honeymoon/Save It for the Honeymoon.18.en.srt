=Episode 18=

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Lin Xuenong

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
is the one I want to marry.

5
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,850
(When did you get your boyfriend?)

6
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,485
(When do you get married?)

7
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:40,571
(Hello? What are you doing?)

8
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:42,570
(How's your work lately?)

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,570
(How's it going?)

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,570
(How have you been lately?)

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,400
It's me.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,200
What's wrong?

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,120
It's all your fault.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,480
Now my neighbors

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
and friends I haven't talked to

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,320
in years are all asking me

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
about your news.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,760
I was telling the truth.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,840
That's the thing between us.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,200
Don't let outsiders know it.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,120
Look at it now! Everyone knows it!

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,560
You...

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,840
You

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
are going to give up your principles?

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,320
I'm willing to give up my principles.

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,560
So give up yours, okay?

27
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,400
(Situation One)

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,080
What happened?

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
I have an emergency.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,360
Want my company?

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,280
It's about my tenant.

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
I can go by myself.

33
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's do it next time.

34
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,560
Okay.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah! I'm not a backup anymore!

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
It's amazing!

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
You're full of energy.

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,080
Because of the breakup thing.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes. Congratulations.

40
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,280
You're being yourself again.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,960
Thanks for your hard work.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Last night, you stayed up
so late with me.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,600
Not a big deal.

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't like owing someone a favor.

45
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,560
Now Lin Xuenong

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,400
and I are quits.

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Remember to find someone

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,120
who can cherish you in the future.

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,360
Of course.

50
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
When you were young...

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,600
We're getting home soon.

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
Always being roaring drunk!

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,720
Get out of our place!

54
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm so sorry about it.

55
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,920
Lin, good for you.

56
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
I couldn't tell it before.

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
Mr. Zhou is so deep in love.

58
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,680
Tell us

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
about your story!

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Enough.

61
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,240
Stop gossiping.

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,360
Tonight,

63
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,000
let Xuenong treat us to dinner,

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
and tell us the details.

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,040
That's great!

66
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:20,360
Mr. Zhou.

67
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,628
You've been working hard lately.

68
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
This weekend,
let's celebrate it in the Spa hotel.

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
Great!

70
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,000
Remember that document?

71
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
Go to make it.

72
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
Let's go first.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
You take your time.

74
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
How's your situation?

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you need help?

76
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,160
It's all settled.

77
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,720
(Am I entitled
to give him a happy life?)

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,240
(What am I doing?)

79
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,040
(Am I really ready)

80
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
(to give up
my no-marriage, no-love policy)

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
(and be with him?)
