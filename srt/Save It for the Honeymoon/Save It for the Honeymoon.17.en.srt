00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,160
How are you?

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,480
(Zhou Heng! Something happened!)

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,160
What?

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,080
What happened?

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,240
Call us this late?

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Do you know it?

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,120
Alas, what are they up to?

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm sorry

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,320
to call everyone together so late.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,880
We have an emergency.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,200
Gu Yu, please say it.

14
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,440
Ice introduced our spirit
during his livestream.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,120
Xuenong Spirit is on the top trend.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,890
The distributors
are bombarding me with calls,

17
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,040
asking for orders.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,000
That's great!

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,680
Gu Yu.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,320
To communicate with Ice

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,700
and talk about the next cooperation.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,320
Director Ma.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,960
You lead the team to meet all aspects
of the order needs.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,040
Lin Xuenong.

25
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,480
Go to supervise the production.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,920
Okay.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
Our company works together

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,680
to ensure production and shipment.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,040
We should ensure
both production and reputation.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,920
Thank you all.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Wake up!

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,680
You finally came here for me.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,000
Are you insane? You won't
get a commission by doing that.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,760
I'm not short of money.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
Don't speak to those nobodies.

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,040
I can be your spokesperson for free.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
Dealing with my relationship

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
is what you should do.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
I can't ensure

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,760
that I'll definitely
help you win her back.

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,200
Or how about finding an expert instead?

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,400
No way.

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,657
No one else will know
about it but you and me.

44
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,480
You can tell me, so you can tell others.

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
It's my private matter.

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,680
There's no way I could tell others.

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,760
You're my only listener.

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Sit here.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm telling you the truth.

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,880
Forget her.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
In her eyes, you're just a backup

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,720
who has

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,120
no pride, bottom lines, or ego.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,600
Things won't work out for you two.

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm so handsome

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
and rich!

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,120
I couldn't be a backup!

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
You know it yourself

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
but you're unwilling to admit it.

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
I think

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
we sold a lot of

62
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Xuenong Spirit.

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
And we should make a PR gift box.

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
What do you think?

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,885
Our company's production lines
have been proven for many years,

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,280
both in terms of quality and shipments.

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,114
Hope we can cooperate next time.

68
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,000
Alright.

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Personally, I prefer that color.

70
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,840
For me, I like this color.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,840
How about using blue? What's it like?

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Not bad. This type
of gift box is pretty, too.

73
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Right. It's your design, right?

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
And it matches the name
of Xuenong Spirit.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
So does this package.

76
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,571
(A couple of Jinghe Spirits:
Zhou Heng and Lin Xuenong)

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Jinghe Spirits
was almost closing before.

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
But now it
outperforms us Tianma Spirits.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,840
I paid a lot for you to do marketing.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,000
So what have you done?

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,600
Pack up your stuff and get out of here!

82
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,320
Lin Xuenong!

83
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:30,142
(Figure Drawing)

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Hello?

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,160
I want to break the news.

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Contact famous celebrities to spread it.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
Whatever the cost may be,

88
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,360
make this a big deal!

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Someone spoiled the reputation
of Xuenong Spirit.

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,560
They said Ice introduced our product

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,114
because he had a relationship with you.

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Ice did post
some romantic videos about us.

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,920
The netizens said you were playing Ice

94
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,360
and hooking up with Mr. Zhou.

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,714
They regard you as a rambling rose.

96
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:05,920
You're being cyberbullied.

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,360
They think too highly of me.

98
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,360
The woman who can
play with these two people

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
must have a high EQ and IQ.

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,800
Well, don't worry.

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Look! I just bought these cute flowers.

102
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
Is it cute?

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,040
Take it.

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
No. Wait.

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,360
Lin Xuenong.

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,360
Are you really yourself?

107
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,160
Back then, you'd be crying.

108
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Why are you so calm today?

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
In the future,

110
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,800
I only care about the people I love
and the people who love me.

111
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,920
It doesn't matter
what other people think.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Besides, the reputation
of the Xuenong Spirit

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
has been hyped.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
I can also stay off the Internet

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,920
and do my own thing.

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,280
People on the Internet

117
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,040
can think what they want.

118
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
It's none of my business.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,240
So I won't say anything in response.

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
You really decide not to respond?

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Yes.

122
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,360
Look at me.

123
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
You've made up your mind?

124
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes.

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay, I'll handle it.

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,160
Gu Yu! What are you going to do?

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Actually, we don't need
to respond to it.

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,560
Why hold a press meeting?

129
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,160
This whole thing

130
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
wasn't entirely my idea.

131
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,742
Just watch it.

132
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,040
Each department, attention!

133
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Three, two, one. Action.

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Hello, everyone.

135
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,560
(I don't like you!)

136
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Today

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,360
I want to clarify the relationship

138
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,680
between me and Ms. Lin Xuenong.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
(So what about your date?)

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,120
We're not a couple.

141
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,120
Just a little business cooperation.

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
Not even friends.

143
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
Previously,

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,720
I posted romantic videos on my account.

145
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
And the woman
was indeed Ms. Lin Xuenong.

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,360
But

147
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,600
I did that

148
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
to cover my real girlfriend's identity.

149
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,360
(I can't understand!)

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
There were paparazzi photos

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,120
of me and Ms. Lin Xuenong,

152
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,040
so I asked her to pretend
to be my girlfriend.

153
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:26,600
The impact

154
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,800
of this incident
on Ms. Lin Xuenong's distress

155
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
and public opinion was great.

156
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,920
I hereby

157
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,240
solemnly apologize to the public.

158
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
What is he doing here?

159
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:03,600
(It's Ice's account!)

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
(The CEO? Who's he?)

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,920
Hi, everyone. I'm Zhou Heng.

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,480
(Who's this? So handsome!)

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,240
Rumor has it
that she's been hitting on me

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
and hooking up and all that...

165
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
These are not true.

166
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
(Where is the agent?)

167
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
(What day is it today?)

168
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040
We're in a serious relationship.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,600
Lin Xuenong

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
is the one I want to marry.
