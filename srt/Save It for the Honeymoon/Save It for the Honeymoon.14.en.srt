This new grape variety has
a higher acidity, which will be

27
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,640
more conducive to sugar removal
than traditional brown sugar beads.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
Could you think about it?

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
I'll send you later. Take a look.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay. I'd love to.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,440
This is our liquor maker, Lin Xuenong.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,560
Xuenong.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes. I'm coming.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
I'll take this sample away first.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,120
Mr. Zhou.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,800
Is this...?

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
I heard you two...

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
We're partners during work,

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,000
and good friends in daily life.

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,160
That's great.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
Then I'm happy to marry you.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
Let's go shopping.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, Xuenong!

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,720
You're my senior sister!

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,880
Is it okay to make fun of me like this?

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,240
It seems facts

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
are richer than words.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
Just wait till you thank me,

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
You brat.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
Jerk!

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,160
Did you misunderstand?

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,280
What?

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,000
She's my senior sister.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
You're popular, huh?

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,560
Senior sister, huh?

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
She did that on purpose!

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,280
You got to be kidding me.

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,800
Don't you want to hear my explanation?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,280
I'm not interested.

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,280
Wait!

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,600
So many candidates.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,520
But none of them are as popular as Ice.

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
What should I do?

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
What happened again?

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,840
I ordered a thousand roses

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,600
for Wei's dog

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,280
who did breeding today.

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
But she called me crazy.

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
She even blocked it for me.

70
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
Buy a thousand roses for a dog?

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,600
I'd have done the same thing.

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,480
I told you about girl psychology.

73
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,160
The best thing
you can do is calm down.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,360
I can't calm down.

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
I saw her show come out,

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
and her footage,

77
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,240
and now all I can think about is her.

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,040
I can't forget her!

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,920
All I can think...!

80
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Ice!

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm working overtime now.
No time for chatting.

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,480
Bye.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Hey! Don't hang up!

84
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Hello?

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Hi?

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Hey!

87
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,720
I'll treat you to Australian lobster
and anything else.

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,040
Everything you want.

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
It's your call.

90
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:55,240
Please help me sort it out.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,920
Please. I'm begging you.

92
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Who are you texting?

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,160
A hopeless love-sick fool.

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Have a thing?

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
Nonsense!

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,360
Right now

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm just a free trash can for emotions!

98
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,240
I have to make a PPT.

99
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,280
I have to go now.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,000
Bye.

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Bye.

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
Mr. Zhou, there are two paths.
Which one do you prefer?

103
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Great! I'll take this one.

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Right. That's the way you should go.

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,280
That's the tourist route,

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
while I'm on the senior route.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
It's tough.

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
You just take the easy way out.

109
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm not listening to you!

110
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,480
How about I carry it for you?

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,160
I can do it myself.

112
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,840
The air is fresh.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,040
I never asked you before.

114
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:41,840
Why don't you fall in love
or get married?

115
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,480
Then I also want to ask you,

116
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
why do you have to get married?

117
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm the one who asked you first.

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
This is what I think.

119
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,040
It's nice to be alone,

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
and you don't have to care about others.

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
Do whatever you want.

122
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
If I were as rich as you,

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,040
I would buy an island first.

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,040
And I would plant
many fruits and vegetables there.

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
And there would be many animals.

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,742
Just play by myself.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
In that case,

128
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
can I hang out with you on your island?
