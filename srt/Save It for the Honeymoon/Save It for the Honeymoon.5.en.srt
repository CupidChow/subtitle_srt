3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,960
So this is how you see me.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,480
That's not true.

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,680
I put up
with your usual weird behaviors,

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,640
but

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,080
you have the nerve to publicly

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,542
smear my image in the company.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
So that's what you're referring to.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,400
Don't you think

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,640
you look more manly
after I've painted you

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,840
with this beard?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,640
My image is none of your business.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,680
Just focus on your work,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,960
and don't bother to do anything else.

16
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:05,257
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,960
I have no feelings for you.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,880
Everyone in the company knows

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,760
that I don't fall in love

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
or get married.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,320
Even if there's only one person

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,280
left in the world,

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,200
we can only be good fellows.

(A fresh start for Jinghe Spirits)

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,480
Why is he still angry?

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,560
Petty man.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,571
(Zhou Heng, CEO of Jinghe Spirits)

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,200
At your age,

29
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,400
you can go out and have a relationship.

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,560
Why come here and bully me in chess?

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,200
Don't play if you can't afford to lose.

32
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:56,120
Don't use his relationship as an excuse.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,640
He's the one who doesn't go on
blind dates or choose a lover himself.

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
What kind of girlfriend
are you looking for?

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,560
Well, I'm still too easy on you.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
In ancient times,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,960
I'll arrange a marriage for you,

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
and see what you can do.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,120
If I can't confirm

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
how I feel about her,

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,960
then even if it's just me
and her left in the world,

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
we're going to be good fellows.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
I won.

00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,110

(As long as your request is reasonable,)

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,400
(then I can promise you
for the sake of work results.)

(Before the new
product release meeting,)

50
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:49,371
(would you mind not seeing me?)

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,714
(Why?)

52
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:52,340
(It's for the job.)

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,400
(What kind of strange request is that?)

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,885

Why are you leaving so soon?

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,560
Why did you come out

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,190
in the middle
of such a beautiful concert?

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
As for Andre's work,

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
not just anyone can interpret it.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,560
I'd rather get out

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,000
than suffer in there.

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,650
What are you looking at?

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,560
It's the weekend, but you came here
with me on my market research.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
It was all

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
to get you to pay me
back the money you owed me.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Is money all you think about?

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
You're talking about yourself!

70
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh wait, there's still a man
in your mind,

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
who is half-naked.

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,520
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,800
Why would a woman seem

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,520
to be interested in you,

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
but then avoid you everywhere?

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Who is she?

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
I'd like to meet her.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,720
Hi, there.

79
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,280
Would you like
to taste our Xuenong Spirit?

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,240
I promised her

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
that I wouldn't see her

82
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,920
before the release meeting.

83
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,560
I'll massage up your legs
when we get back.

84
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,457
You'll be comfortable.

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920
Come on, Masseuse Lin.

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,160
Hey,

87
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
is it true that your hallucination
hasn't gone away?

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,360
It bothers me, too.

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,360
You haven't seen her in a few days.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
You feel bad?

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,160
I wonder

92
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,160
if there's something wrong with me?

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,240
You're helpless.

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,920
I'm not sure.

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,800
And she said

96
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,120
she wouldn't fall in love
or get married.

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,160
Isn't that weird?

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,800
Well, it's indeed true.

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,480
But listen to me,

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,800
the best way to deal
with your hallucination

101
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,000
is to deal with him.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,040
Deal with him!

103
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
You're right!

104
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,240
How do I do that?

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
Use your mind.

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Naughty girl.

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,360
I can help you.

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,280
Are you tired?

109
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,840
Don't be unhappy.

(A fresh start for Jinghe Spirits)

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
How am I supposed to work

112
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
if I keep hallucinating?

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,040
The best way to deal
with your hallucination

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
is to deal with him.

115
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,280
Is this the only way

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
to cure my hallucination...?

117
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
Is it okay

118
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,360
if I do this?

119
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,240
Of course.

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,040
No way.

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,560
He can't get the wrong idea
that I'm into him.

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,720
So how do I do it
without anyone noticing...?

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,600
No!

124
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,400
I can't do it!

125
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,920
What was I thinking? God!

(A fresh start for Jinghe Spirits)

127
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
I'll add a motion effect

128
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,040
for you.

129
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,240
Here, I'll draw you a big nostril.

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you okay?

00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:53,057
(Zhou Heng, CEO of Jinghe Spirits)

132
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm fine.

133

I'm just coordinating the expansion
of our production.

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,828
If you have any concerns,

135
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
you can make them clear.

136
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Don't hold them in.

137
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Sometimes being honest
is the best thing to do.

138
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,480
Fighting!

139
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
(Can I really)

140
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,720
(be honest with you?)
