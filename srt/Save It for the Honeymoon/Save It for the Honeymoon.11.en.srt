00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,400
Try the size.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
What? How can I wear
something so revealing?

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,840
Didn't I tell you before?

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,960
It's a summer swimsuit shoot.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,120
If you don't cooperate,

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,760
then the endorsement
of Xuenong Spirit will be...

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,840

I thought

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,000
a turtle's shell could be removed.

54

But I didn't realize

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,280
that the shell was part of the body.

00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,257
If you try to pry the shell open,

57

My relationship with her is fake.

66

I've seen you so domineering.

There's a lot you haven't seen.

76

This is the first time
I've been protected by a girl.

77
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
It's kind of

78
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,480

How do you know what I'm thinking?

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
You're a mysterious person,

83
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
but also easy to understand.

84
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,920
