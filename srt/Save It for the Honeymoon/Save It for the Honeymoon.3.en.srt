=Save it for the Honeymoon=

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,120
I've tasted your spirit.

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,000
About the last time I said
your spirit was garbage,

5
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,630
what happened just now can make it even.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Forget about it.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,640
Are you sure
you don't want to go to the hospital?

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
Am I that fragile to you?

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,400
Well, I should go back now.

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,040
It's time to gather
and head back to the city.

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,120
Stop there.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,680
What?

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,771
Don't want to be responsible?

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,480
Why does it come up again?

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,840
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,480
I...

17
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:36,914
can't reach the wound.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,771
Apply it on my back.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
What?

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Okay.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
(Jesus!)

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,760
(How did you
take your clothes off so quickly?)

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,560
What are you doing?

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
(Another hallucination?)

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,120
(Am I blind or insane?)

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
Turn around. I'll get undressed.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,120
Okay.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,120
Why still get undressed?
I've seen enough.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Oh god!

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,720
I've always insisted
on never getting married.

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,880
Come on.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,240
(No way. I have to control myself.)

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,880
In fact, I want to tell you...

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Lin Xuenong.

35
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes?

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
Your spirit...

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,400
How is it?

38
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,680
Not bad.

39
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
Duplicity.

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Open the door!

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,160
Open!

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
Open the door!

43
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,750
(You've received a new message.)

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,730
(Your bill is long overdue)

45
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,600
(and we're now
in final negotiation for repayment.)

46
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,700
(If repayment isn't completed,)

47
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,750
(it shall be deemed
that you have no intention to repay.)

48
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,228
(To Gu Yu:)

49
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:32,142
(Gu Yu, I'd like to borrow
some money from you.)

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,028
(Gu Yu, I'd like to borrow
some money from you.)

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,142
What are you doing here?

52
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Listen to yourself.

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
Would you have had

54
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,840
such a delicious breakfast
if I hadn't come?

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,360
Tell the truth.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm always set up on blind dates,

57
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,171
so I come here to avoid it.

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,400
By the way,

59
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
have you ever tasted a flavor?

60
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
It is like

61
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
something that never exists

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,840
in the world.

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I get it.

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,480
For the taste you're talking about,

65
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,000
I tasted it 15 years ago.

66
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,720
It tastes just like what you expect.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,800
Don't you think it's perfect?

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,400
It's like something that you can never
get back if you miss it.

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,600
Perfect? Not so much.

70
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,000
But it feels like something is missing.

71
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
You do need a doctor.

72
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,400
Listen,

73
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
no one in the world is perfect.

74
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
But your first love

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,160
must be perfect.

76
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,240
First love?

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,240
Right.

78
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,600
Aren't you talking about the first love?

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
What else is it?

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm talking about spirits!

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,000
That makes sense.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,240
You've never been in love.

83
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,600
How can you know
the beauty of first love?

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,120
Morning.

85
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,800
Morning.

86
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,470
That's a lot, my bestie.

87
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,800
I've received it.

88
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,560
I'll pay you back when I get paid.

89
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,600
No rush.

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,240
Is it Situation One?

91
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Well, no.

92
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,720
However,

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
at the new product release meeting,

94
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll definitely win.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,680
When the bonus is paid,

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,160
I can make money again!

97
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay. See you at noon.

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,160
Okay. Bye.

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
There's a fine

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,640
for being late.
