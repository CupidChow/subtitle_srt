00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,720
So warm.

4
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:46,714
Get your hands off!

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,680
I feel dizzy.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,440
Lin Xuenong,

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,000
you made me impressive.

8
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,457
(Director Ma)

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,680
Hello?

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,400
(Lin Xuenong, where have you been?)

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
(Come here!)

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
Mr. Zhou, we're sorry.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,000
Please forgive us.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,200
No!

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Director Ma.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,280
(Are you kidding me?)

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,120
Don't fool me with formalism.

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm not your former boss.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
(What happened?)

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
I want results.

21
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
(Why is he dressing like that?)

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,760
Don't pay attention to...

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,480
(Am I hallucinating?)

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Next month,

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll officially hold
a new product release meeting.

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
You can either present your best work,

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,840
or

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,400
you can spend a month

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
looking for your next job.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Let's leave here.

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,000
Mr. Zhou,

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,440
you asked me to choose

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
some top liquor makers.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,000
I've already arranged
their interviews for you.

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
(It was a humiliating moment.)

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,520
I don't care what other people develop,

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,120
but the spirit I made is not garbage.

38
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,971
You can't judge it
if you don't taste it.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,880
Why did she get mad at me?

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't care what other people develop,

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
but the spirit I made is not garbage.

42
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,428
You can't judge it
if you don't taste it.

43
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:55,280
(There were rumors about
a liquor-making genius in the company.)

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
(Could it be her?)

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou!

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Wait until the next month.

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,960
Still 36 degrees Celsius.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not sick.

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
You were humiliating Mr. Zhou in public.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
So bold. Are you done
paying your mortgage?

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
I want to ask you a question.

52
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,400
Have you ever been in this situation?

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,120
Well, this guy is wearing clothes,

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
but all you can think about

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,600
is him naked.

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
You have a crush on someone.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,680
No way!

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,240
I just can't control my mind

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,000
that imagines something really weird.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,440
Well, I get it.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,280
Dogs

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
don't want to eat cookies
after tasting meat.

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
So your matter is easy to handle.

64
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
How?

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
Just sleep it off.

66
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Sleep it off?

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Is that easy?

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,240
If it doesn't work, sleep more.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,160
How about this?
I'll live outside tonight,

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,400
and leave you alone.

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,080
How can I sleep so early?

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Pretty fast.

73
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,440
Here you are.

74
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,280
(It indeed smells good.)

75
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,040
Who's that?

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
Mr. Zhou, what brings you here?

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
As your leader, do I need a reason

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,480
to talk to you?

79
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,914
- Last night...
- Last night...

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
After you.

81
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,000
Last night, you suddenly fainted,

82
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
so I had to carry you to my room.

83
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
I also got another room.

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't get me wrong.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm the type of principles,

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,160
but I'm not indifferent.

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't think what you did

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
last night was appropriate.

89
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,480
It's still early.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
Let's get some more sleep.

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,240
Are you okay?

92
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,600
Your eyes tell me

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,000
you want to

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,240
kiss me.

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
(Is it true that geniuses)

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
(are psychopaths?)

97
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,040
Ah!

98
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,000
Watch out!
