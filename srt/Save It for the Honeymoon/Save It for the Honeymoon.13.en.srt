00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,480
Then what else can I do?

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,760
Just because I like you!

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,314
I don't care what you look like.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,240
But I can't fall in love or get married.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,040
I just want to focus on my work.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,640
Stay here.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm serious.

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,000
I can feel you also like me.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,200
Lin Xuenong, I'll wait for you!

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,228
I won't do anything
until you make a decision.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,200
I know you're serious.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,400
But I just can't promise anyone.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
You said to save it for the honeymoon...

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
So this is me. That's it.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll wait for you

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,257
until you're willing to say

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,628
and fall in love that day.

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,000
Make my son happy?

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,971
Who do you think you are?

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Can you make me happy?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,200
(Schedules)

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,960
Dad.

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm back.

26
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
Did you make such a mess again?

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
It's raining again.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,440
Have you been
feeling better these days?

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,440
I've been making

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
pretty good spirits lately.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,680
Dad?

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Dad!

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Xiaoxiao.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,680
I just

35
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
had a dream

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,280
that your mom was back.

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,680
Isn't it cold for you to sleep here?

38
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,400
I'll take you to sleep inside.

39
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Be careful.

40
00:04:53,628 --> 00:05:00,620
(How long does your father want to wait
to pay back the money he owes?)

41
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
(Just give me a little more time.)

42
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,942
(I'll send you the money
as soon as the end of this month.)

43
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,480
Unhappy?

44
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,560
No.

45
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,480
I was hasty yesterday.

46
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,560
If you still have concerns,

47
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
we can be colleagues first.

48
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,600
Traitor!

49
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,742
How long are you going
to keep this from me?

50
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
Gu,

51
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,342
don't be wrong
about good people like me.

52
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,560
I heard all about
what happened the other night.

53
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,480
Mr. Zhou gave you a necklace
and confession

54
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,120
in front of the whole company.

55
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
It's not true.

56
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
It's all because of you.

57
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,600
He thought Song Bo

58
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,480
was my ex-boyfriend.

59
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,800
That's great.

60
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,120
That means Mr. Zhou is indeed into you.

61
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
Well, I'm also confused.

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
I feel like I might

63
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
have

64
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,160
a crush

65
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,920
on him?

66
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,480
However...

67
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,360
I don't want to give up
my own principles.

68
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,800
If this is your thought...

69
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,040
Hey.

70
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
It's easy to do it.

71
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,560
Try to be with him.

72
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,160
If he can make you happy,

73
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,400
you guys just go ahead.

74
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,600
If he disappoints you,

75
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
just break up with him.

76
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,600
You don't know if you want it

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,920
until you try it.

78
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
Give it a thought.

79
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
Okay. I'll think about it.
