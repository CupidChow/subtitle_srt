=Save it for the Honeymoon=

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,640
He's going abroad for two years.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
His going abroad doesn't stop you
from starting your new business.

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,640
All right. I have to go. Bye.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
Listen. Don't stand him up.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,280
Remember to show up tomorrow.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,720
(Would I have delayed her development?)

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,720
(Is coming with me)

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,920
(the best thing for her to do?)

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,120
So you're talented in making spirits.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,720
Without adequate marketing,

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,600
you can't sell them.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,640
Come to join us.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,320
It's my honor to be invited by you.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,520
But...

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,480
Don't say no to me just yet.

18
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,028
You know I cherish talents like you.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,200
Our company's position in the industry

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,280
is also needless to say.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,560
So if you choose to join us,

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,920
you'll have a brighter future.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,560
All right.

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Give it a thought.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,942
I'm waiting for your decision.

26
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:50,200
(Mei's Canteen)

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,200
I didn't fall asleep
until 5:00 this morning.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
What's the matter?

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Lost sleep again?

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Because of that new offer?

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,320
How do you know it?

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Xuenong.

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
Do you remember when I told you

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
that I had a long story?

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
In fact,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Aunt Mei is my biological mother.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
They weren't married

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,840
when they had me

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,720
because they didn't think it through.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
So

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,080
I grew up in the orphanage.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,360
Well, does Aunt Mei...

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,880
Yes.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,360
She doesn't know it.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't hate them.

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
I just don't want

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
to make the same mistakes they did.

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Turns out

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,240
that's the real reason you don't cross
the line before marriage.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
When I was a kid, I was worried

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,240
that my parents would get bored with me.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
Afraid that their love for me

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
will disappear one day.

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,720
But they love me very much.

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
They showed me what love is.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,680
So I want to give you the same love.

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,080
Do what you want.

58
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
You know

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,560
I'll always be here.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,280
I'll wait for you to come back.

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,360
Xuenong?

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,800
Xuenong?

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
Hello?

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
Lin Xuenong is kidnapped by me.

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
If you want her alive,
don't call the police.

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Come to this address quickly.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,400
Hurry up!

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,160
Xuenong!

69
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Xuenong!

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Stay still!

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Let her go!

72
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll give you anything you want!

73
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
For her,

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,680
do you give up everything?

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I do.

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
What?

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
You don't?

78
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,160
I do!

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Please let her go!

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
You all heard him!

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
Everybody, please testify for me!

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,800
He says he does!

83
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,560
I testify for you.

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,600
So do I.

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,600
I also heard that!

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,160
Great!

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,160
Wonderful!

88
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,240
You're so pretty.

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Dear friends and relatives,

90
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
I declare

91
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
(Wish your marriage)
Mr. Ye Zhouheng

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,280
(to last forever!)
and Ms. Lin Xuenong's wedding ceremony

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,360
officially open!

94
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
You scared me!

95
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
My son is so great!

96
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,720
You've been giving,

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,160
so I'm taking the big step.

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,680
Zhou Heng!

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
No...

100
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,800
Ye Zhouheng,

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,600
you're my man from now on!

102
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,080
Okay!

103
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,240
Come and cut your cake.

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,228
It's made of glass!

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,840
Fill it up!
