00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,680
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,685
You talked about running away
from your dad,

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,720
but you ended up taking his place.

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,840
It means that your love for him

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
has never changed.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,960
I had a good childhood, too.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,040
He was very good at making spirits

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,428
and was highly regarded in the factory.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,120
But to give us a better life,

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,685
he quit his job
and learned to run a business.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
He ended up with a pile of debt.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,240
My mom also left.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,000
He never talked about it,

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,680
but I knew

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,560
he missed the distillery.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680
I became a liquor maker

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,200
to fulfill his wish.

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,760
Thank god you came here.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,840
Or I wouldn't have met you.

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,920
Why do you act
like you're always grateful

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,560
when you're the one
who's been healing me?

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,640
I should be grateful.

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
If I had not met you,

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
I would have been lonely forever.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Xuenong,

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I understand your concerns.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,560
From now on,

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
you have me and your dad.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
You're not alone anymore.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
We were hit by the same Cupid's arrow.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Look!

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
Are you insane?

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Am I a tool for your performance?

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,880
Is someone making another video?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
No!

37
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,280
You've done with actresses.

38
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,342
Now you want to date
some regular person like me?

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
Stop it, okay?

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,000
You may see me as a slacker,

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
but I take my relationship seriously.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
Or I wouldn't have stayed

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,171
with my ex for so long.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,520
What can I want from her?

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,840
Just a sincere love.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
I don't care about that.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,240
But I don't know what you want from me.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,120
Ice, you're so popular.

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
There must be a lot of girls

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
around you who like you.

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,240
So please just leave me alone, okay?

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,400
I don't want to play with them!
All I want is just you!

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,880
Okay. I'm full.

54
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,120
So delicious.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,440
It's worth it to eat with you.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
Because we always eat at home.

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,080
Of course. It's healthy
and money-saving.

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,880
Xuenong.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,280
Was there something

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,120
you wanted to tell me?

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,960
I have a gift for you.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's that?

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,160
From now on,

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
my house belongs to you.

65
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,600
(Thank you!)

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,160
(I can reach where I am
because of your kindness.)

67
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,280
(It's also because you're strong.)

68
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,480
(As a young lady,)

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
(you're alone on a farm out west.)

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,428
(Too bad you didn't
give me the address,)

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,400
(or I'd send you
something nice every day.)

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,920
(You're a navigator
out there every day.)

73
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,280
(You're lucky to have a signal.)

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
(You're almost
at the South Pole now, aren't you?)

75
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,000
What kind of job
are you making up? The navigator?

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,714
Why didn't you say
you were an astronaut?

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,560
She even said
she was raising pigs at Gansu.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,160
(Without you,)

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
(I would never have met
the love of my life.)

80
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
(I'll show you our photos.)

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,600
Is this...?
