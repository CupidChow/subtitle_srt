It's the letter of cancellation.
Sign it.

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,040
This is the end of our cooperation.

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm talking to you!

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,760
Sit here and have dinner.

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,320
The person I invited is not coming.

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,640
Let's have it.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,680
You bullied my bestie
and beat up my leader.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,028
Do you think I'll enjoy this dinner
dumped by someone?

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,560
Excuse me. This is
our best Australian blue abalone.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,640
Please enjoy it.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you still wrongheaded?

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
I was crossed in love.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,760
So we should celebrate it!

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Excuse me? Please give me the wine list.

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
She fell in love with
that famous director.

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
She abandoned me.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Hey!

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm talking to you!

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,810
I broke up and you don't comfort me?

26
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:09,560
Just eating?

27
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:14,514
You two can still be together.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,440
Really?

29
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,440
Do you have any ways to win her back?

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Just tell me! Quickly!

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
All right.

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,440
Take your time.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,514
Order more if it's not enough.

The release meeting is coming soon.

38
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,342
In addition to
this traditional presentation,

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,960
don't you have

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
more fresh ideas?

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,657
(Xuenong Spirit)

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
I want to highlight the idea of youth.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,840
What are

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
your opinions?

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
I think

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,560
we should make full use of social media

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,280
and open accounts on various platforms.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,400
But the most important thing now

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,120
is to choose a new spokesperson.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,160
I...

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,680
I have an idea.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,080
We can make a mixed table

53
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,280
with Xuenong Spirit as the base,

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
which can showcase more new flavors.

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
I'd also like to hear your opinions.

(Best wishes
from the most handsome man, Ice!)

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,560
You do have a conscience.

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,280
(Xuenong Spirit)

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,520
Gu Yu. It's all settled.
Let's get inside.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,160
Let's go.

63
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,840
Thank you all

64
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:23,742
for coming to the new product
release meeting of Jinghe Spirits.

65
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:24,914
Applaud.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
I hope the Xuenong Spirit

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
will bring you a happy evening.

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,840
You can try this type.

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
Seems like a lot of people like it.

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,160
Give me a special blend
of Xuenong Spirit.

71
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,240
Sweetie.

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,920
This is the woman
I was telling you about.

73
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Being ostentatious is a bad sign.

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,400
Hey,

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,160
I heard you hooked up with Ice.

76
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:03,285
But you always say
you won't get married.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,160
Simply,

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,360
you're just waiting to marry up.

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,542
Creep people look at everyone
like their own kind.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Director Ma,

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,360
who's that?

82
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:15,920
Oh, he's one of Tianma Spirits.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
I used to see him downstairs
in the company.

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,400
Looks like a friend
of Lin Xuenong and Gu Yu.

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Wait.

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,720
Why would Ice endorse

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,680
such a thing as plain water?

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,280
How much did you contribute?

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,342
We only have
a professional relationship.

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
Well, professional relationship...

91
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Like I said,

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
people like you won't be loved.

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,800
You deserve to die alone.

94
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,040
Hey! You...

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
You did a great job.

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,142
I'll give you a present.

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
What are you doing?

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
Xuenong,

99
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,400
who's this?

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,800
There you go!

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,720
An Internet celebrity
isn't as rich as a CEO.

102
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,120
You are indeed observant.

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
No wonder this meeting

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,800
is focusing on your Xuenong Spirit.

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,360
What's going on?

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
Xuenong, how are you?

107
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,840
Are you okay?

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,360
Mr. Zhou!

109
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,560
What exactly were you doing just now?

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Today's all about the Xuenong Spirit,

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,840
not the things between us!

112
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:53,228
I saw your ex-boyfriend do that to you,

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
and I got mad.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,800
Yes, he was the ex-boyfriend

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
but not mine. It's Gu Yu's.

116
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,040
Even if it was my ex,

117
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,800
I don't need a rich boyfriend

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
to back me up.

119
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
Then what else can I do?

120
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,680
Just because I like you!
