=Episode 1=

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,360
He is a super manager
who can bring dying enterprises

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,440
back to life!

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,360
He is a corporate magician
who has created

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,000
countless "firsts".

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,360
Covered in glories,

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,760
he is our new CEO!

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,160
Who is he?

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,040
He is Zhou Heng!

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
What?

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,200
Where is he?

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
(Why was I having these dreams again?)

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
(Oh, God!)

15
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:24,480
(My name is Lin Xuenong.)

16
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,857
(I do liquor-making
at a spirits company.)

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,120
(My biggest goal is)

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,680
(to support myself and my dad)

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
(with the money I earn.)

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,680
(All these years,)

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,680
(I don't even work out in love.)

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,560
(Because I think it's a waste of time.)

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,400
(There is no such thing
as Mr. Right at all,)

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,542
(and I don't have time
for trial and error.)

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
(So...)

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
(I'll die alone.)

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,920
(However,)

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,640
(since the new CEO
took office,)

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,920
(my life hasn't been peaceful.)

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,920
(My ordinary life)

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,120
(suddenly became very exciting!)

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,920
(It all started a few weeks ago.)

33
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:11,920
(Welcome to the World Hotel)

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,000
Awesome.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,840
The new boss is so generous.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,280
Previously,

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,880
we always went where it was cheap.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,840
But now we're brought
to someplace exotic

39
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,680
as soon as he takes charge
of our company.

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,080
Delicious cuisine and SPA
are waiting for me!

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
Hey, wait a second.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Today, Mr. Zhou will come to join us,

43
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,680
and he wants to taste
the spirits from our R&D.

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,360
Go back to the company
and fetch them.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,880
Be quick.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,560
Right now?

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,160
Yes.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,720
It's far from the hotel.

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,000
By the time I get back,
it will be night.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,120
Just follow the orders.

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Go.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,880
Leave now.

53
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Be quick!

54
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:46,020
(World Hotel)

55
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,350
Mr. Zhou hasn't arrived yet,

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,657
so meet me at the lobby bar.

57
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,280
How heartless of Mr. Zhou
to let me go back for the spirits.

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm just a wage earner.

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,840
I don't even get to eat.

60
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,285
I have to find something to eat.

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
(Lin Xuenong)

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
(Liu Wenhao from R&D Department Two)

63
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:22,571
♪Making coffee just for one♪

64
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:27,800
♪And eating breakfast all alone♪

65
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,714
♪Fewer dishes to be done♪

66
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:38,314
♪I'm never running behind♪

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,514
(Liu Wenhao, Lin Xuenong)

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Where are my spirits?

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
What have you done?

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,720
Garbage

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
belongs in the trash can.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Who are you?

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,700
Lin Xuenong?

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,980
(Lin Xuenong from R&D Department One)

75
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,680
Nice name,

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,080
but a hollow person.

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,400
If your R&D had capabilities,

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
Jinghe Spirits wouldn't decline.

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,040
A bunch of losers.

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,720
I don't care what other people develop,

81
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,360
but the spirit I made is not garbage.

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,228
You can't judge it
if you don't taste it.

83
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,800
So what?

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Are you trying to tell me

85
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,560
that you're a liquor-making genius
among these losers?

86
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,120
And there is a bottle of vintage spirit
in this bag of junk?

87
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
What a joke.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Mr. Zhou, are you okay?

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
(Is he...?)

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Who is he to criticize me?

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,600
Does he even know the word "respect"?

92
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
How did someone with such a low quality

93
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,240
get to be the CEO?

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Why should I treat him nice?

95
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,240
It's his fault!

96
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:13,600
I'm not the one to be blamed.

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
With such a leader,
I would rather resign.

98
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,240
But my house loan,

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,680
my spirits,

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
and my dad...

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,680
Why am I so unlucky

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
to meet such a freak?

103
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you done?

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,400
Mr. Zhou!

105
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,160
You heard all that?

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,160
Yes.

107
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm leaving right now.

108
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,800
This way.

109
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Oh, it's that way.
