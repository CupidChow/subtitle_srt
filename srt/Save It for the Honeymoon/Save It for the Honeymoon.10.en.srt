=Episode 10=

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,160
Lin Xuenong!

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm Zhou Heng,

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,320
not some clown you can fiddle with.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,360
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,640
He looks terrible.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
What's going on with you two?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,840
This is Ice's first
spirits recommendation.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,680
So give the audience

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,240
a bigger discount.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Besides,

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,880
do you have a better choice

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,720
for your spirits giveaway?

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,680
Cup

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,120
or jug?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Beauty,

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,760
time to eat.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
What's the matter?

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,280
Gu,

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,171
I heard you asked Ice
to endorse your company's new spirits.

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,480
With such a great celebrity,

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,640
for the sake of our relationship,

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,120
can you give me a referral?

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,120
Of course.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Ice and his agent

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,828
are in our conference room right now.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,040
But he was won over

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,680
by this girl you hate the most.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
You must be too proud

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
to ask her for help.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,840
Let's go.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,400
Sit over there?

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,120
Okay.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,280
Hey.

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,360
What's going on with you lately?

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,880
You look like you're crossed in love.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,280
What?

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
Nonsense!

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,880
I don't like anyone.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,560
No one?

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Yes.

44
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
Nobody?

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,880
Fine.

46
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:31,960
What's going on over there?

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
Why all the noise?

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,400
My fried eggs and tomatoes!

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You told me to wait,

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,520
and I did so.

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,000
But you went shopping with him!

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,280
Your "boyfriend" is crying.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Want to comfort him?

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
Stop making fun of me!

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
How can I care about him

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
when my own life is a mess?

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Hey,

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
it's your phone.

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,280
Do you have tissues?

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
Am I not handsome enough,

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
not fit enough,

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
or not rich enough?

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
What's so great about actors?

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
Why does she look down upon me?

65
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,280
Ice, this situation needs to stop.

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
She texted me.

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,600
Wait, what are you doing?

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
She... She's going to get mad at me

69
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,530
if I don't answer her for a minute.
Give it to me!

70
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,120
I promise you,

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,542
five minutes, and she won't be mad.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,680
No way!

73
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,280
See?

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,000
How could I possibly be mad at you?

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,280
(What should I say?)

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,480
(I can't lie and say)

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
(I don't care about getting married.)

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Hello?

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,040
How's the project going?

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,480
Where is Lin Xuenong?

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,720
It's time to make good
on my girlfriend's impersonation.

82
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:01,800
Spend the next three days
shooting footage with me,

83
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:03,942
and make more
public displays of affection.

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,200
The sweeter, the better.

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
You guys okay with that?

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
It depends on Lin Xuenong's
personal wishes.

87
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,720
As a leader,

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,360
I don't force
my employee to "fall in love".

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,280
Director Ma, am I right?

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
What?

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Yes, you're right.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,720
Ice speaks for our company,

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
so I'm going to fulfill my promise.

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,840
Director Ma, am I right?

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,840
Right.

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
It's a deal, then.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,240
Oh!

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
Well, I guess we look like a couple now.

99
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,680
It would be perfect if I reworked it.

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,560
Yeah!

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,485
Honey, I'll take you to archery.

102
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:59,971
(Romantic daily routine
of Ice and his girlfriend)

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,240
Honey, good for you!

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,600
(Tanghulu)
Honey, your favorite is Tanghulu.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,240
Then take a strawberry one?

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

107
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,840
Do you like the strawberry one?

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,600
Yes.
