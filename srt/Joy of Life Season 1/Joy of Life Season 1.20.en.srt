1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 20

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,830
Prime Minister, what do you mean?

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,950
If I keep thinking of him,

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,360
how could I focus on supporting you?

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,400
Now that it has happened,

20
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,680
you have to be careful of the Crown Prince.

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,630
Do you think

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,440
he wants to kill me?

23
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,870
There are two reasons.

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,360
First,

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
you'll take over Neiku

26
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,110
from Li Yunrui.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,910
She is Wan'er's birth mother.

28
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,030
I didn't mean to offend her.

29
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,960
Second,

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,520
you've been supporting the Second Prince

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,910
since you came to the capital city.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,670
The Crown Prince is not happy about that.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,190
I just met the Second Prince a few times.

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,270
I'm not his supporter.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,440
You should have avoided seeing him.

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,670
The capital city is a dangerous place.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,880
If you didn't choose to support someone,

38
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,360
it could

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,080
lead to your doom.

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,600
What should I do?

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,830
From now on, remain neutral.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,960
Try your best

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,270
to avoid seeing either of them.

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,470
But you just said

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,750
I should choose to support someone.

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,830
Now that you're my son-in-law,

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,360
you'll be on my side.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,470
But if the Crown Prince holds a grudge against me,

49
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,750
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble because of me

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,550
when he succeeds to the throne.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,550
I'll try to act as a mediator.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,830
If he keeps treating you as an enemy,

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,630
I'll help

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
someone else

55
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,470
succeed to the throne.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
It turns out it's not blue

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
when there is little water.

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,190
But I've never seen the sea.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,910
I can take you to see it in the future.

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,360
Elder brother, are you done talking?

61
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,750
Dabao,

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,550
I'm going to marry your younger sister.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
So, you'll be my elder brother.

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Are you going to marry Wan'er?

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,670
Yeah.

66
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,040
She's a nice girl.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,070
She's never scolded me.

68
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,600
Besides,

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,270
She...

70
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,640
She also treats me on cakes.

71
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,920
I'll treat you on cakes too.

72
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,670
Really?

73
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,200
Yes.

74
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,880
So,

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,550
will you take me to see the sea?

76
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,070
Sure.

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,950
We have to

78
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,720
take Wan'er with us.

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,510
Go!

80
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,830
Hi, Mr. Yuan.

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,950
Let's go.

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,550
Trust me.

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,320
I'll take Wan'er with me no matter where I go.

84
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,070
That would be great.

85
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,830
How about Erbao?

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,600
What?

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,550
Shall we

88
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,880
take Erbao with us?

89
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,040
Dabao,

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,070
Erbao

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,880
has gone somewhere far far away.

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,110
You probably won't see him for a long time.

93
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,880
Is he dead?

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
I once raised kittens

95
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,550
and bunnies.

96
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,830
But they were gone later.

97
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,790
I looked,

98
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,640
looked,

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,510
and looked for them.

100
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,270
But I failed to find them.

101
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,480
A maidservant told me

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
they're dead.

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,350
I asked Wan'er what it means.

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,830
She said

105
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,790
it means

106
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,790
they've gone somewhere far far away

107
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,390
and I won't see them

108
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,760
for a long, long time.

109
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,000
Someday,

110
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,040
I'll also go there.

111
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,110
Then I'll see them again.

112
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,720
So, in the future,

113
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll go to

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,760
that faraway place.

115
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,600
I'll see my kittens,

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
my bunnies

117
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,110
and Erbao.

118
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,070
When I see them again,

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,920
I...

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll tell them

121
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,350
it has been a long time and I miss them.

122
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay. You can say that.

123
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,510
Wan'er also likes to

124
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,670
touch my head like this.

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,350
It's comfortable.

126
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,230
Elder brother,

127
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,230
the two of you are quite alike.

128
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,790
Dabao,

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,670
I told you you'll be my elder brother.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,670
Listen to me.

131
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,950
Don't call me like that again.

132
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,070
Are you younger than me?

133
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,950
Yeah. I'm younger than you.

134
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,200
Call me Fan Xian.

135
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,440
Fan...

136
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,510
Can I call you Xianxian?

137
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,000
Dabao,

138
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
this name

139
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,670
sounds weird.

140
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,230
Xianxian.

141
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,350
Don't call me like that.

142
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,670
-Xianxian. -Stop calling me like that.

143
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,480
Xianxian! Xianxian! Xianxian!

144
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,230
I've told the Crown Prince about it.

145
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,760
He didn't say anything.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,510
It's okay as long as he knew it.

147
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,920
Your Excellency,

148
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,070
Are you sure

149
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,670
you'll entrust the future of your daughter and your clan

150
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,830
to Fan Xian?

151
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,550
I saw

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
Fan Xian play with Dabao.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,270
So did I.

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,790
Actually,

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,950
even the servants in my mansion

156
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,070
will laugh at Dabao

157
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,760
behind my back

158
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,920
when they see him.

159
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
I know most of them

160
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,110
look down upon him

161
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,950
and are impatient with talking to him.

162
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,830
But Fan Xian smiled from the bottom of his heart

163
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,270
when he stayed with Dabao.

164
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,640
It's true.

165
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,790
It seems Fan Xian treats Dabao

166
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,790
as his friend.

167
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,480
In that very moment,

168
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,790
I decided to

169
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,640
rely on him for our future

170
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,150
if he has nothing to do

171
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,470
with Gong'er's death.

172
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,000
Alright. Let's say goodbye here.

173
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,280
Go back. I'll come some other day.

174
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,790
You were not called in by my dad.

175
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,080
What?

176
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
Those who are called in by my dad

177
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,640
don't like to play with me.

178
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,470
They only smile at me

179
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,000
when dad is around.

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,470
They ignore me

181
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,150
if dad is not around.

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,640
Did you tell your dad

183
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,880
about it?

184
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
No.

185
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,440
You can't!

186
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,470
I'm telling you.

187
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,470
You can't tell my dad.

188
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,760
If you do,

189
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,030
he'll scold them

190
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,030
and they'll feel depressed.

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,910
Dabao,

192
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,400
do you know how long

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,150
I've been in the capital city?

194
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,550
No.

195
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,320
Since I came here from Danzhou,

196
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,790
I've met many people and

197
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,320
many things have happened.

198
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,320
But in my opinion,

199
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,550
you're more lovely

200
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,400
than most of them.

201
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Danzhou?

202
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you mean I'm a good guy?

203
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,200
Yes, you're.

204
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,590
Xianxian, remember

205
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,910
to often come play with me.

206
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,000
I told you not to call...

207
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,080
Okay. I promise.

208
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,910
Then, go home.

209
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,710
If you don't,

210
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,350
your dad will also scold you.

211
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm leaving.

212
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,030
Remember.

213
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't pick up food

214
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,440
that's thrown away by others.

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,030
Got it.

216
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,710
Don't jump in puddles.

217
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't grab others' candy.

218
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Got it.

219
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,910
And,

220
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,230
remember

221
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,880
to put on clothes before you go out.

222
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,840
Got it.

223
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,350
Remember

224
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,520
to use chopsticks when you have a meal.

225
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,880
Don't eat with your hands.

226
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,440
Got it.

227
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,470
Your Excellency.

228
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,080
Why is it you again?

229
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,030
Of course it's me.

230
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,470
Are you expecting someone else?

231
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,470
You told me

232
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
to send your sister to the Eastern Palace.

233
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
The Crown Prince didn't come to

234
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,840
the Prime Minister Mansion to catch me.

235
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,150
Yeah.

236
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,960
Lady Ruoruo stayed there for a long time

237
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,150
before she came out.

238
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,320
I'd been waiting for her.

239
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,400
She said

240
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,350
it's too slow to come over in a sedan chair.

241
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,030
She asked me to come here first.

242
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,840
What's the matter?

243
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,880
The Crown Prince left.

244
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,150
He might have gone to the bathroom.

245
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,350
Please don't crack a joke.

246
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,350
He didn't go to the bathroom.

247
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,320
He left the Eastern Palace.

248
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,150
I see. It's a serious matter.

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,350
Where is he going?

250
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,670
The Investigator's Office.

251
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
Why does he want to go there?

252
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,910
Lady Ruoruo said

253
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
he's going to see Si Lili.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,110
Your Highness, are you going to

255
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,030
the Investigator's Office to see Si Lili?

256
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

257
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,150
You don't need to follow me there.

258
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,670
Your Highness,

259
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,670
you don't believe what Mr. Yuan said, right?

260
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,910
I don't believe what Si Lili said.

261
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,960
So, are you going to interrogate her again?

262
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,230
On the contrary,

263
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,440
I'm going to save her.

264
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,470
He wants to save Si Lili.

265
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,110
Lady Ruoruo also asked the Crown Prince

266
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,710
why he wants to do that.

267
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,590
He said,

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
now that

269
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,150
you interrogated Si Lili alone,

270
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,640
it means it's possible

271
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,760
you've known Lin Gong's issue,

272
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,150
but you told Si Lili

273
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,640
not to tell anyone else about it.

274
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
Why would Si Lili

275
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,000
listen to my brother?

276
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,880
Why would she rather suffer cruel torture
than tell the truth?

277
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,840
Because Fan Xian

278
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,760
would promise to spare her life in return

279
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
if she keeps the secret.

280
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,110
I'll never break my promise.

281
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,550
Tell me his name

282
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,200
and I'll keep you safe.

283
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,960
Lady Ruoruo wanted me to ask you

284
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,080
if you promised

285
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,470
to keep Si Lili safe

286
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,350
just as the Crown Prince said.

287
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,590
I want you to trust me.

288
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,710
I am the only one

289
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,440
who is willing to keep you alive

290
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,760
in the capital city now.

291
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,150
Okay.

292
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Your Excellency.

293
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,350
What else did the Crown Prince say?

294
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,230
He said

295
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,640
he'd swear in the name of his identity as the Crown Prince

296
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,440
he'd get Si Lili out of the dungeon

297
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,440
and keep her safe

298
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
if she tells the truth.

299
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's go to the Investigator's Office.

300
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,030
Your Excellency, don't panic so much.

301
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,550
Maybe Miss Si Lili

302
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,320
is still passionately devoted to you

303
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,470
and refuses to say anything.

304
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,320
Si Lili wouldn't

305
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,230
tell the truth

306
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,440
just for one reason,

307
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
that is, she knows that

308
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,000
the Investigator's Office thinks highly of me.

309
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,110
So, she wouldn't tell the truth

310
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,230
as long as she's imprisoned

311
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,440
in the Investigator's Office.

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,230
If she knows the Crown Prince would save her...

313
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,910
She'll sell me down the river.

314
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,150
If Si Lili tells the truth,

315
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,080
the Crown Prince, the Prime Minister

316
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,200
and even His Majesty

317
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,590
would think

318
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,000
it's me that killed Lin Gong.

319
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,590
It's too late.

320
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,440
Your Excellency, you have to find a way

321
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
to stop the Crown Prince.

322
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,200
If I stand out at this moment,

323
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,400
it means I admit I did everything.

324
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,150
I have an idea.

325
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,080
I'll try to delay the Crown Prince

326
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,150
and you go to the dungeon

327
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,280
and kill Si Lili.

328
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,280
I promised not to kill her.

329
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,230
It's urgent.

330
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,280
You'll die if she's alive.

331
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,760
But it's of no use to kill her.

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,080
If Si Lili is killed at this moment,

333
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,590
it just proves I want to do away with a witness.

334
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,710
We can say

335
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,760
it's the secret agents from Beiqi that did it.

336
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,080
Do you know why the Crown Prince

337
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,350
told Ruoruo the reason

338
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,280
why he'd come to the Investigator's Office?

339
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,440
Why?

340
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,280
Because he has never believed

341
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,840
Ruoruo would support himself.

342
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,000
He told her about it

343
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,470
just to let her send word to me

344
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,710
so that I'd respond.

345
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,320
So, what can we do to solve the dilemma?

346
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,080
I just hope

347
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,230
someone can stop him

348
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,320
from entering the Investigator's Office,

349
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,200
or I'll come to the end of a blind alley.

350
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,280
But the Crown Prince is so powerful.

351
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,400
Wait. There is still hope.

352
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,150
His Majesty once said

353
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,760
Their Highnesses shall not meddle

354
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,150
in the Investigator's Office's affairs.

355
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,110
Besides,

356
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,880
the directors of divisions

357
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,110
wouldn't let him in.

358
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,880
I hope so.

359
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,590
There they are.

360
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,790
Line up!

361
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Mr. Zhu, please step aside.

362
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,400
Your Highness, His Majesty said

363
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,760
princes can't come inside.

364
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,200
Do you want to stop me?

365
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,640
He wants to stop me.

366
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,400
I dare not.

367
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,640
It's His Majesty's order. I hardly dare disobey it.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,640
Okay.

369
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,590
From now on,

370
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,710
I'll start to go inside.

371
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,320
And I won't stop

372
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,350
unless

373
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,280
you take actions.

374
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,760
Your Highness, if you insist on doing it,

375
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,840
His Majesty will fly into a rage.

376
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,230
Do you dare to take actions?

377
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,320
The Investigator's Office is of great importance.

378
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,710
It's the lifeblood of the imperial court.

379
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,400
Your Highness, if you step forward again,

380
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,030
I'll draw my sword.

381
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,640
I just dare not disobey His Majesty's order.

382
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,910
I'll have no other choice

383
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
but to knock you out

384
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,230
and then take you to His Majesty.

385
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,710
I see.

386
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,550
Do you think you can

387
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,550
stop my picked guards

388
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,430
by yourself alone?

389
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,280
Draw your swords!

390
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,430
Your Highness, here is the capital city.

391
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,040
How will you explain it to His Majesty?

392
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,400
Lin Gong is my good friend.

393
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,710
For both private and public reasons,

394
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,920
I'll find out the truth.

395
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,070
The Investigator's Office will do it.

396
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,160
I don't trust you.

397
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,000
Step aside!

398
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,680
The Crown Prince is so tough.

399
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,710
I'm dead.

400
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,230
His Excellency Yan and His Excellency Zhu.

401
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,070
are trying to stop him.

402
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,880
They couldn't do it.

403
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,430
I've underestimated the Crown Prince.

404
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,000
Such being the case,

405
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,950
all our plans in the capital city will come to nothing.

406
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
Wang Qinian,

407
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,640
I'll find a way

408
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,400
to get out of the capital city.

409
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,040
You just pretend

410
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,110
you know nothing about it.

411
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,470
They won't make things difficult for you.

412
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
Your Excellency.

413
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,310
Farewell, Wang Qinian.

414
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Your Excellency.

415
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,880
-Step aside! -Listen.

416
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,880
What's the noise?

417
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,640
Go!

418
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Black knights!

419
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,230
Disarm them.

420
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,190
-Head. -Head.

421
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,950
What's wrong?

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,590
I've got a cold.

423
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,710
I'll send for an imperial physician.

424
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,110
Don't bother.

425
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,460
=Chen Pingping, Head of the Investigator's Office=

426
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,640
What happened to his legs?

427
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,880
That very year,

428
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,430
Head Chen travelled hundreds of miles

429
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,040
with black knights

430
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,310
and defeated Xiao En,

431
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,680
the No.1 villain of Beiqi.

432
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,920
However, he was injured during that battle

433
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,590
and couldn't walk since then.

434
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,800
Your Highness, please go back.

435
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,560
Go away!

436
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,430
Chen Pingping, you're so powerful.

437
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,880
Someone said

438
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,110
you're only second to one person in the capital city.

439
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,470
Your Highness, you misheard it.

440
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,310
I've heard black knights

441
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,430
are good at fighting and have killed numerous people.

442
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,230
Do they dare to kill a Crown Prince?

443
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
Or will you do it yourself?

444
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,880
Attacking a Crown Prince

445
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,430
is not something a loyal subject should do.

446
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,280
Then you couldn't stop me.

447
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,680
Go away!

448
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,950
Go away!

449
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,310
He's so tough.

450
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,800
What are you doing?

451
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Go away!

452
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,190
Protect His Highness.

453
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,430
Go away!

454
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,640
Chen Pingping!

455
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,680
Let go of me.

456
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,950
Chen Pingping!

457
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,230
Chen Pingping!

458
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,190
Protecting Crown Prince

459
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,310
against assassinations

460
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,000
is what a loyal subject should do.

461
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,190
Master Shadow.

462
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,680
Head wants to see you.

463
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,190
I've been thinking about

464
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,710
why black knights showed up at that time

465
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,430
when I chased Si Lili out of town.

466
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,640
How did they know

467
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
about my whereabouts?

468
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,680
Seeing you throw a dagger,

469
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,310
I finally understand.

470
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,880
It's true that Head asked me

471
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,310
to stay and serve you.

472
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,920
It's also you that sent secret messages

473
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,040
to black knights, right?

474
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,760
He and I

475
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,070
are closest to Head.

476
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,830
You can leave. I'll tell him everything.

477
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,350
Got it.

478
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,070
You prove yourself to be Head of the Investigator's Office.

479
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,400
Nobody else could be

480
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,470
more scheming and calculating than you.

481
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,680
Push me in.

482
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,880
Why are you looking at me? Anything on my face?

483
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,590
Come closer.

484
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,920
You should wear more. Don't catch a cold.

485
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
You have her eyes.

486
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,000
At that time, she just stood there.

487
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,310
I asked her

488
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,920
what flowers she wanted to plant

489
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
when the Investigator's Office was just set up.

490
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,800
I'd find them no matter how precious they are

491
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,680
as long as she told me.

492
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
She scattered those wildflower seeds

493
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,110
she got by the roadside

494
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
alongside the wall at random.

495
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
She said,

496
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,590
we didn't need to grow flowers

497
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
because these seeds

498
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,470
would find their own way of living.

499
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,040
Who is she?

500
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,350
Ye Qingmei. Your mother.

501
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Who's Ye Qingmei?

502
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Wuzhu is in the capital city?

503
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,040
Who is Wuzhu?

504
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
He killed Lin Gong.

505
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,070
The truth hasn't been found out

506
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,070
about Lin Gong's death.

507
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,800
You don't believe me.

508
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,560
It's alright.

509
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,160
I'll take care of the rest about Lin Gong's issue.

510
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,120
The Imperial Study

511
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,110
Your Highness.

512
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,800
I want to see His Majesty.

513
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,430
Your Highness, what's the matter?

514
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,800
Your Majesty,

515
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,950
His Highness wants to see you.

516
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,350
He said

517
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,160
he guessed

518
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,230
the real murderer

519
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,800
who killed Lin Gong.

520
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,190
Who does he think it is?

521
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,040
I hardly dare say.

522
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,040
I'm not asking for your opinion.

523
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,040
Just repeat his words.

524
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,310
His Highness said

525
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,710
it's probably the Second Prince.

526
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,190
Your Excellency Wang, why are you sitting here?

527
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,230
Your Excellency,

528
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,000
please don't call me like that.

529
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,830
You're a trusted follower of Head.

530
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,680
You're closest to him.

531
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,230
I'll have to rely on you

532
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,400
in the Investigator's Office.

533
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,070
Your Excellency, please don't say that.

534
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,040
Actually,

535
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,280
we just made a deal.

536
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,190
What is it?

537
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,430
Your Excellency.

538
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,280
Your Excellency. Your Excellency.

539
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,310
Actually,

540
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,520
I planned to quit the Investigator's Office,

541
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,400
but Head Chen

542
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,710
offered me something

543
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,760
and asked me to stay and serve you

544
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,280
before he came back to the capital city.

545
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,760
At first,

546
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,110
I didn't plan to accept it.

547
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,880
But since I met you at the gate of the capital city,

548
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,830
I began to think about it.

549
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,280
Later on,

550
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,920
I watched you for several days.

551
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,310
I found

552
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,470
you're not only handsome and brave,

553
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,280
but also noble-minded.

554
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,560
I admire you so much

555
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,710
that I decided to

556
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,400
stay here

557
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,000
and serve you.

558
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,000
Tell me the truth.

559
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,880
You're generous with your money.

560
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,400
That's why I admire you.

561
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,160
Why did you want to quit?

562
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,520
Over the years,

563
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,160
the Investigator's Office has done a lot

564
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,190
and readjusted the administration of officials.

565
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,590
I'd have a bright future

566
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,880
if I stay here.

567
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
But I don't think

568
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I still have

569
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,310
the ambition.

570
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,400
I don't want to be promoted again.

571
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,160
Speaking of it, maybe I'm too soft-hearted

572
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,640
to bear the sight of

573
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,230
those harsh punishments.

574
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
Is it by Chen Pingping's order?

575
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,640
Of course not.

576
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,230
Head once said

577
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,350
such torture can be used

578
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,230
to deal with enemies,

579
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,230
but should never be used on one of us.

580
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,400
Nobody would listen to him?

581
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,040
There is something you don't know.

582
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,680
Nowadays,

583
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,830
there are more and more people

584
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,640
who're willing to die for Nanqing.

585
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,230
They're so loyal

586
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,560
that they can't tolerate

587
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,230
a little mistake.

588
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,950
Then they've become

589
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,470
more and more ruthless.

590
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,190
Even Head

591
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,040
can dare not criticize such loyalty.

592
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm lazy by nature.

593
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,680
I failed to change with the times.

594
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,590
I failed to keep pace with them.

595
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
So,

596
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,000
I wanted to quit.

597
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,920
Where are you

598
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,830
going in the future?

599
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,400
Where could I go?

600
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,110
Of course

601
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,710
I'll keep serving you.

602
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,950
I see. I see.

603
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,070
I did lie to you.

604
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,000
I'll do something to show my apology.

605
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,190
What are you going to do?

606
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,070
Hold on.

607
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,710
What are you doing?

608
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,310
Your Excellency.

609
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,520
I'll treat you on tasty food. It's on me.

610
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,350
Let's go enjoy ourselves.

611
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,830
Hold on.

612
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,920
I don't have enough money.

613
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,400
I'll pay for 1.5 bowls of noodles.

614
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,590
Can you give me two bowls?

615
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,590
No. No way.

616
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
I'm not done talking. Look.

617
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,000
Only one bowl

618
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,230
with minced meat.

619
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,160
Just add some soup

620
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,430
to the other bowl.

621
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,760
Is it okay?

622
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,920
Okay.

623
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,400
You're flexible enough.

624
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,590
Okay.

625
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,350
Your Excellency.

626
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,800
Here you are.

627
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,590
Okay.

628
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,470
It looks small in size,

629
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,680
but the taste is very special.

630
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,640
Enjoy it. I've paid for it.

631
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,110
The two bowls of noodles look different.

632
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,760
You're right.

633
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,680
The essence of the noodles

634
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,640
lies in the soup.

635
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,190
You'll know its original taste and flavor like this.

636
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,950
All the extra toppings

637
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,070
have been omitted.

638
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,110
They're omitted.

639
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,880
Come on.

640
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,800
Eat while they're hot.

641
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,560
These toppings are unnecessary.

642
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,430
Chen Pingping

643
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,470
is a monster from Heaven.

644
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,110
He looks different from us.

645
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,640
Humans

646
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,310
have two eyes,

647
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,880
but Chen Pingping

648
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,310
has three more eyes

649
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,280
between the two like ours.

650
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,950
Most of us have two arms,

651
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,950
but Chen Pingping

652
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,400
has two more on his back.

653
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,640
With edged tools in his hands, he's awe-inspiring.

654
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,110
Five eyes?

655
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,070
Four arms?

656
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,880
Exactly.

657
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,800
His Excellency Chen

658
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,710
is over three meters high.

659
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,040
His face looks like a door plank
and his fist like a hammer.

660
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,000
He has a large, fierce-looking mouth.

661
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,590
When he shouts at the town,

662
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,430
a roll of thunder

663
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,280
will crash in the sky immediately.

664
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,920
Every night,

665
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,310
Chen Pingping would go to the army barracks of Beiqi

666
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,040
and eat over ten soldiers.

667
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,280
Having got used to it,

668
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,880
the Beiqi forces draw lots

669
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,920
to wait to be eaten by him.

670
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,040
Dear all, in a word,

671
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,430
Chen Pingping is brave and battlewise

672
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,230
and can even move mountains.

673
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,190
How do you like it, Your Excellency?

674
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,190
Not bad.

675
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,710
So, you've forgiven me, right?

676
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,680
I have to think about it.

677
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,680
Let me get you more soup.

678
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,400
Okay?

679
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,160
That's enough.

680
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,230
Young Master.

681
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,520
Why are you still here eating?

682
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,680
Why are you here?

683
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,040
I just listened to stories in the tea house.

684
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
Why did you go there?

685
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,680
Our bookstore

686
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
is going to open.

687
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,680
Why are you so neglectful?

688
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,800
We should spend more time

689
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,560
collecting relevant information.

690
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,280
I just heard a new story.

691
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,830
"Chen Pingping

692
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,800
Travelled Hundreds of Miles to Beiqi Alone."

693
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,230
It's amazing.

694
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,760
If you write a book about it,

695
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,640
it'll definitely sell well.

696
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,920
Chen Pingping?

697
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,310
Travelled hundreds of miles?

698
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,470
Alone.

699
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,350
Eunuch Hou.

700
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,070
Mr. Fan.

701
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,040
His Majesty wants to see you. It's urgent.

702
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm not done with the noodles.

703
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,560
There is no time for delay.

704
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,350
They're all waiting for you.

705
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,360
Eunuch Hou, how did you know I was there?

706
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,950
You were not at home,

707
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,670
so I went to the Investigator's Office.

708
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,080
Head Chen told me you were there.

709
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,710
Chen Pingping?

710
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,710
The Investigator's Office

711
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,470
can find anyone

712
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,280
in the capital city easily.

713
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,470
He found me so quickly.

714
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,950
He must have sent someone to tail after me.

715
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,840
Mr. Fan,

716
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
what Head Chen wants to do

717
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,870
is not something we should think about.

718
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,520
Young Master,

719
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,430
your brother said

720
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,800
he'd treat me on noodles,

721
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,000
but he left

722
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,950
before he paid.

723
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,470
Can you give the money to me?

724
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,870
I'll pay for it.

725
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,470
How much?

726
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,470
Three taels of silver.

727
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,560
Three taels?

728
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,520
Yeah. It's cheap.

729
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
For the two bowls of noodles?

730
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,600
Even without meat.

731
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,560
It's profitable.

732
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,710
More profitable than opening a bookstore.

733
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,670
How about like this?

734
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,390
I'll buy the store

735
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,390
tomorrow.

736
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,150
The money you paid today will be considered your shares.

737
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,600
Great! I'll make a fortune.

738
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,390
He wouldn't even pay a cent.

739
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,950
Mr. Fan, hold on please.

740
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,560
Let me tell His Majesty about it.

741
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,320
Prime Minister.

742
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,230
I saw you from the distance.

743
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,150
You have nothing to lose by calling me uncle.

744
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,560
Uncle, you're also here.

745
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,910
His Majesty said

746
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,360
it's something about Gong'er's death.

747
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,360
It's a serious issue.

748
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,710
Shall we talk about it just in the Imperial Study?

749
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,430
With His Majesty there, there will be no room for maneuver.

750
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,150
Prime Minister. Mr. Fan.

751
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,080
This way, please.

752
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,430
Don't be afraid. Follow me.

753
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,910
Your Majesty.

754
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,320
Prime Minister and Mr. Fan are here.

755
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,760
Let them in.

756
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
Your Majesty.

757
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,470
They're here.

758
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,280
You can make things clear

759
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,230
in their presence.

760
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,950
Prepare a seat and some tea for Prime Minister.

761
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

762
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,470
Your Majesty, how about me?

763
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,630
You?

764
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,280
Just stand here.

765
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,760
Your Highness, you don't need to bow to me.

766
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
The Investigator's Office has checked Lin Gong's body.

767
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,040
He was killed by a skilled swordsman with a fast sword.

768
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,840
Among all swordsmen in the capital city,

769
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,360
only Xie Bi'an that works for the Second Prince

770
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,190
has the ability to do that.

771
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,470
Do you mean...

772
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,430
He means

773
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,910
I'm the one who killed Lin Gong.

774
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,150
Are you the killer?

775
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,230
You have to ask Fan Xian about it.

776
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,190
Your Highness,

777
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,470
how is it related to me?

778
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,040
During 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. of the day
when Lin Gong was killed,

779
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,670
I happened to meet Fan Xian on the street

780
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,120
and we had a small talk.

781
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,910
Xie Bi'an was also there.

782
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,430
I just asked you to be here to give witness.

783
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,390
Xie Bi'an is known as

784
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,910
"Faster than Light."

785
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,150
He is the best swordsman

786
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
in the capital city.

787
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,390
Faster than light?

788
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,390
Fast sword.

789
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,390
Is it true?

790
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,040
Yes.

791
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,950
The Investigator's Office has confirmed

792
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,390
Lin Gong was killed during 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.

793
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,150
In this case,

794
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,150
Xie Bi'an didn't have enough time

795
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,910
to rush out of town to do that.

796
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
There is another possibility.

797
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,320
Fan Xian and you joined hands

798
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,390
to let Xie Bi'an kill Lin Gong.

799
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,670
He was giving false testimony

800
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,760
to help you stay out of it.

801
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,910
It's more ridiculous.

802
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,080
Why did I want to kill Lin Gong?

803
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,390
Why did Fan Xian want to do that?

804
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,080
Lin Gong is the one behind
the assassination attempt on Niulan Street.

805
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,760
Fan Xian holds a grudge against him.

806
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,670
Your Highness,

807
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,000
I have no idea about that.

808
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,630
He's the Crown Prince.

809
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,230
We have to bear it if he wants to declare us guilty.

810
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,190
Then tell me

811
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,870
who else is so skilled at swordsmanship

812
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,800
if it's not Xie Bi'an.

813
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,950
It's not hard

814
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,560
to hire a sword master

815
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,670
who is unrecognized, right?

816
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,320
To whom are you making pointed allusions?

817
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,430
I'm just trying to reason.

818
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,760
It's enough.

819
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,710
Prime Minister,

820
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,560
the victim is your son. What do you think?

821
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,630
In my opinion,

822
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,520
the person to blame

823
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,630
is Chen Pingping.

824
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,910
The Investigator's Office is responsible
for the safety of the capital city.

825
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,910
Up to now, they haven't reported

826
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,430
the truth about my son's death.

827
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,710
It means Chen Pingping

828
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,910
has neglected his duties.

829
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,430
It makes sense.

830
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,000
I hope to

831
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,910
confront Chen Pingping

832
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,150
and see him be punished according to law.

833
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,950
It seems you enjoy standing there.

834
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,430
Your Majesty, shall I kneel down?

835
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,870
Rise.

836
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,870
Send an imperial decree

837
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,120
and ask Chen Pingping to come here.

838
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,520
Got it.

839
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,800
Chen Pingping!

840
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,120
Your Majesty.

841
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Do you know your sin?

842
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,560
Why do you say that?

843
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,560
The Prime Minister's son was killed.

844
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,520
As Head of

845
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,470
the Investigator's Office,

846
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,000
you haven't found out the killer up to now.

847
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,560
You have to take responsibility.

848
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,710
Your Majesty,

849
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,950
we've found out the killer.

850
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,190
You found it out?

851
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,320
Good.

852
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,080
In the presence of Prime Minister and others,

853
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,280
tell me who is the killer.

854
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,280
Prime Minister,

855
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm surprised to hear the sad news upon my return.

856
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm sorry for your loss.

857
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,600
Who is the killer?

858
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,800
Si Gujian from Dongyi Town.

859
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,040
One of the Great Masters?

860
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
If it were not a Great Master,

861
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,840
who else could use a sword so quickly?

862
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,080
As a Great Master,

863
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,040
he travelled hundreds of miles to the capital city

864
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,150
to kill the Prime Minister's son?

865
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,360
Why did he do that?

866
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,360
Lin Gong joined hands with Si Lili

867
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,710
to try to assassinate Fan Xian on Niulan Street,

868
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,630
but Si Gujian lost a disciple and a follower

869
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,280
during the process.

870
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,000
The two female assassinators

871
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,470
were killed by Fan Xian.

872
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,910
Why did Si Gujian kill Lin Gong

873
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,190
to take revenge?

874
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,710
Everyone knows that

875
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,390
Si Gujian is obsessed with swordsmanship.

876
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,800
Fan Xian killed the two assassinators

877
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,360
when he was attacked.

878
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,280
Si Gujian would think highly of him

879
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
because of his capabilities.

880
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,040
And he'd only take revenge on

881
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,190
Lin Gong and Beiqi

882
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,520
that are behind all this.

883
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,740
In the river of history,

884
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,940
time goes round and round.

885
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Memories about the former and present lives

886
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,180
join each other in an endless way.

887
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,780
In the long drunken Milky Way,

888
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,500
one season follows another in a flash,

889
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,700
and the wild geese are flying south.

890
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,620
I just can't give up

891
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,620
to be with you for my whole life.

892
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,900
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

893
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

894
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,580
Year after year in the wandering,

895
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,140
I count the remaining years.

896
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,340
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

897
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,900
even though we have ended up the destiny,

898
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,580
I never feel regretful.

899
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,540
In such a chaotic world,

900
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,300
I still miss you as ever.

901
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,940
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

902
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,660
With a gentle heart,

903
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,220
I cherish our remaining years.

904
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,060
Even though we have to go through

905
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,020
all the hardships along the journey,

906
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:35,340
you always stay by my side,

907
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,100
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

908
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,020
Year after year in the wandering,

909
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,380
I count the remaining years.

910
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,740
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

911
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,540
even though we end up the destiny,

912
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,980
I never feel regretful.

913
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,900
In such a chaotic world,

914
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,860
I still miss you as ever.

915
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,540
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

916
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,300
With a gentle heart,

917
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,700
I cherish our remaining years.

918
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,500
Even though we have to go through

919
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,660
all the hardships along the journey,

920
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:15,940
you always stay by my side...
