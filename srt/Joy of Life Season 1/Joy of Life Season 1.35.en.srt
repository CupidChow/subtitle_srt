1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 35

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,270
He is saved by people from Beiqi.

17
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,400
Beiqi is in the wrong.

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,510
They won't prevent us from

19
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,510
taking Yan Bingyun back.

20
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,800
Beiqi?

21
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,230
Shangshan Hu is Xiao En's adoptive son.

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
You know him, right?

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,120
Your Excellency, are you in contact with him?

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,310
I only want to borrow his name.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,030
Grand General sent me to save you.

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
You're a follower of Hu'er?

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,670
Yes.

28
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,470
As long as Nanqing stays unharmed,

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,240
I will take any order.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,080
Good.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Later I'll fight Xiao En

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
with all my strength.

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,880
The border is right ahead. We don't have much time.

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,160
Let's do it.

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,030
Let's get into the woods

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,830
and go north.

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,440
Leave now!

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,830
Grand General is waiting for you ahead.

39
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,110
Xiao En was taken away

40
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,720
by men of Shangshan Hu.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Split up and chase him down.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,030
Yes!

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,720
Hurry up!

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,390
It's done.

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,630
Did anything go wrong?

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,110
Your Excellency, you showed up in time.

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,440
Xiao En didn't have time to ask.

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
By calling "Grand General",

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,270
everyone thinks

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,240
Shangshan Hu's men did it.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,390
It's time for us

52
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,270
to chase him.

53
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,600
Can we catch up with him?

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,190
Don't worry. Someone is following him.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,110
Who is there?

56
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,670
Mr. Xiao, you're really vigilant.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,110
Your lightness skill is good.

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm flattered.

59
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,550
I grow a bit fat recently.

60
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,790
I'm not so flexible.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,510
You set up the iron chains, right?

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,550
You're welcome.

63
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,550
You've been leaving marks.

64
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,830
You just keep running. I'll keep doing my job.

65
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,040
Let's stay focused on our own things.

66
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,950
Your Excellency, are you OK?

67
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,000
Your Excellency.

68
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,920
Senior, you're old.

69
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,920
Can he run that way?

70
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,830
Your Excellency, he's not here.

71
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,790
Young Master, which one shall we kill?

72
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,320
He's not here.

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,160
Then let's go back.

74
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,790
Nonsense!

75
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,350
Find him! He must be nearby.

76
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,640
You would have been dead back in the old days.

77
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,160
Time and tide wait for no man.

78
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
So no one came to save me.

79
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,350
My men pretended to be

80
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
Shangshan Hu's men.

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Do you lure me out of the mission

82
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,510
to kill me?

83
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,550
I have a question for you.

84
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,600
Go ahead.

85
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,470
Do you know Danzhou?

86
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,960
I grew up in Danzhou as a child.

87
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,880
I see.

88
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,110
Why do you ask me that?

89
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,230
Never mind.

90
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,670
You can kill me now.

91
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,960
Take her!

92
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,860
Your dagger.

93
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,580
=Haitang Duoduo, Saintess of Beiqi=

94
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,790
If you take another step forward,

95
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,960
I'll kill him.

96
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,150
Go ahead.

97
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,550
You're not here to save him.

98
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,710
No, I'm not.

99
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,080
Kill him if you want. I'm just watching.

100
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,640
What's your relationship with Ku He?

101
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,910
So you figured out.

102
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,670
You're Saintess Haitang,

103
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
the last apprentice of Ku He.

104
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,110
My name is Haitang Duoduo.

105
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,440
You can call me Haitang,

106
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,590
or Duoduo.

107
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm Fan Xian.

108
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,000
I know you, the poetic genius from Nanqing.

109
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,470
Insidious and ruthless at such a young age,

110
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,550
you're not a good man.

111
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,110
Are you also here to kill him?

112
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,880
You can kill him. I'll just stand by and watch.

113
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
Fine. Give me the dagger.

114
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,760
Keep an eye on him.

115
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,320
Let's fight.

116
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,400
Are you nuts?

117
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,200
I just told you

118
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm not here to save him.

119
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,590
We can talk after the fight.

120
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,000
You must be insane!

121
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,960
Shameless!

122
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,910
If you don't believe me,

123
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,880
you can slash him first.

124
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
That makes sense.

125
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,790
Well.

126
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
This is for you.

127
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,760
Stop! Stop!

128
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,790
Awesome!

129
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,400
You're really above the Ninth Dan!

130
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,790
Excellent! Excellent!

131
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,230
You're not bad

132
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,230
among the younger generation.

133
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,280
You're so insidious.

134
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,400
I didn't mean to.

135
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,320
Also,

136
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
fighting should be simple.

137
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,280
No need to include so many tricks.

138
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,760
Why did you pick a fight with me?

139
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,280
Someone once told me

140
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,030
if I want to

141
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,110
improve my martial arts skills,

142
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,440
I have to fight someone peerless.

143
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,670
You're really good.

144
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,710
It would be a pity not to fight you.

145
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,640
That's all?

146
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,550
What else?

147
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,880
Now that we're done fighting,

148
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,400
you should kill him.

149
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,230
Duoduo,

150
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,000
why do you want to kill him?

151
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,230
My teacher wants to kill him.

152
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,590
Why does Ku He want to kill him?

153
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,230
I don't want to tell you.

154
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,910
Look, we're...

155
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,880
Will you kill him or not?

156
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,350
If you don't, then I will.

157
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,960
He doesn't want to kill me.

158
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,320
If he does,

159
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,470
he would have killed me already.

160
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,550
Senior, you're right.

161
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
I've tried so hard

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,150
to keep you under my control.

163
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,110
How can I just kill you?

164
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
If you really don't want to kill him,

165
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,590
then I'll kill him instead.

166
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,790
Yan Xiaoyi. Director Yan.

167
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,350
Fan Xian,

168
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,080
I'll make you pay today for humiliating me in the capital city.

169
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
He was trying to shoot me.

170
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Why did you stop the arrow?

171
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,440
I stopped it subconsciously.

172
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,030
Only after stopping it did I realize that it was coming at you.

173
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,470
That's the Ninth Dan archer of Nanqing.

174
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,520
He's unparalleled in the world.

175
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,440
How is that relevant to me?

176
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,400
Of course it is.

177
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,840
Let me introduce.

178
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
This is Haitang Duoduo, Beiqi Saintess.

179
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,520
Director Yan,

180
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,320
by killing the Saintess, you'll make a name

181
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,880
among the frontier soldiers.

182
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,520
Whatever you say, you'll die today.

183
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,790
You should be careful.

184
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,400
I'm afraid Director Yan wants to kill you.

185
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,110
Shameless!

186
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,470
Right, he's shameless!

187
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,150
Later, we should get out together

188
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,440
and look after each other.

189
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,000
War horses?

190
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,760
Yan Xiaoyi has brought the cavalry.

191
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,000
Miss Duoduo,

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,110
we can cooperate with each other...

193
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,910
Where is she?

194
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,440
She was here just now.

195
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,670
Your Excellency, the horses are coming.

196
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,080
They are wearing Beiqi uniforms.

197
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,320
What a coincidence!

198
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,230
I just borrowed Shangshan Hu's name,

199
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,670
and here he comes!

200
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,150
It's Beiqi army.

201
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,790
Beiqi army?

202
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,760
Why are they here?

203
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,880
The border is not far ahead.

204
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,520
They must have crossed the border secretly.

205
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,470
=Shangshan Hu, Grand General of Beiqi=
Father, long time no see.

206
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,200
Grand General, if you take another step forward,

207
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
you'll only get his dead body.

208
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,520
Is he also here to kill you?

209
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,470
Your Excellency, watch out!

210
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,680
Are those wounds on my father

211
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,520
caused by you?

212
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,110
Another Ninth Dan martial arts master!

213
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,310
I heard you're a poetic genius.

214
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,040
Let me give you a poem for free,

215
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,920
and you should let me go unharmed.

216
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,230
You can keep it as your last will.

217
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,710
The moment I heard of your name,

218
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,590
I couldn't help wondering

219
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,230
whether you're surnamed Shang

220
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,760
or Shangshan.

221
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,280
Man's body rots to nourish all things on earth.

222
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,760
Death is only a start.

223
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,430
That is Fan Xian,

224
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,560
the man I want to kill.

225
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,920
The other is Shangshan Hu,

226
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
the Grand General of Beiqi.

227
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,190
Grand General?

228
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,430
If I kill him, will it be counted as a military exploit?

229
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,000
It is equivalent to attacking cities and capturing territories.

230
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,190
If I order you to kill him,

231
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,070
will you be scared?

232
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,760
Wait! Come back!

233
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,310
You're really courageous!

234
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Young Master, let's do it!

235
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,830
Let's wait till Fan Xian is killed.

236
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,230
If I knew,

237
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,680
I wouldn't have engaged myself in the two fights just now.

238
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,680
Wait!

239
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,400
Do you know Danzhou?

240
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,040
I grew up in Danzhou as a child.

241
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,830
Father, would you like to kill him in person?

242
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,800
Don't kill him now.

243
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
Why don't they kill him?

244
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,590
Maybe they want to hold him hostage.

245
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,470
He's so lucky!

246
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,230
Are we going back to Beiqi?

247
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,470
Yes.

248
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,710
After all we're within the territory of Nanqing.

249
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,160
We'd better go back as soon as possible.

250
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,710
Take him with us.

251
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,070
Shall we attack?

252
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,190
Fine! Fine! Fine!

253
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,950
You're really fearless.

254
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,280
You're just a group of peasants.

255
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,590
What do you want?

256
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,400
Are you going to confront the Beiqi cavalry

257
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,160
face to face?

258
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,040
Follow them quietly.

259
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,430
We should find a chance to attack.

260
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,800
How long have you been in Danzhou?

261
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,800
Since I was a child.

262
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,230
When did you go back to the capital city?

263
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,310
Not long before.

264
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,160
It's really fast for you to be promoted as Director-General

265
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,040
of the Investigator's Office.

266
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,430
My official career is quite successful.

267
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
You're quick at answering questions.

268
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,920
I was caught.

269
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,430
I should be cooperative.

270
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,190
Father,

271
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,710
should we also bring the others?

272
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,590
No need.

273
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,190
I only need him.

274
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,680
Shall we kill them all?

275
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,710
How dare you?

276
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,710
Kill them all!

277
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,640
Really?

278
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,470
Shangshan Hu,

279
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,950
take it easy.

280
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,590
I won't prevent you from saving Xiao En.

281
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,640
I only want him dead.

282
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,400
I can take one more step back.

283
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,760
You can kill him if you want.

284
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,920
After Fan Xian is killed,

285
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,760
I'll leave right away.

286
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,920
As I said,

287
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,310
I have to take him back.

288
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,800
You heard him.

289
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,880
Then you all have to

290
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,230
die here.

291
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Kill them all!

292
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,040
If he doesn't shoot,

293
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,640
Shangshan Hu dares not make a move.

294
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,190
Isn't this a good opportunity?

295
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Father, go north.

296
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,560
Kill the Beiqi bastards!

297
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,640
Kill the Beiqi bastards!

298
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Oh, my God!

299
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,230
It's actually real!

300
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,470
All of us are veterans

301
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,760
retired from the frontiers.

302
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,310
We're most adept

303
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,560
in murdering and robbing

304
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,520
without any mistakes.

305
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,230
Kill Shangshan Hu!

306
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,280
How dare you be distracted when pointed by my arrow?

307
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,470
Fan Xian!

308
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,070
Young Master Guo!

309
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,680
Thank you, Young Master Guo!

310
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,470
Screw you!

311
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,310
This is my dagger.

312
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,520
You actually bring it to me specially!

313
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,430
You villain!

314
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,310
Fan Xian, I'm gonna kill you.

315
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,040
I know! I know!

316
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,190
You're all here to kill me.

317
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,000
Just wait a moment.

318
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,400
Director Yan!

319
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,710
Director Yan,

320
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,710
I'm Guo Baokun, the Imperial Compiler.

321
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm also here to kill Fan Xian.

322
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,000
They're veterans from Nanqing.

323
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,230
They are not enemies.

324
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,520
Young Master Guo it is!

325
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,400
Director Yan, what're you doing?

326
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,830
It doesn't make sense.

327
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,830
Yan Xiaoyi must have left the camp without permission.

328
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,950
Why would he leave anyone alive

329
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,000
to put himself at risk?

330
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,640
Keep an eye on them!

331
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,310
Yes.

332
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,880
If you don't stop him,

333
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,110
we'll all be killed

334
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
by Yan Xiaoyi.

335
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,520
The Beiqi War God

336
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,880
will die today.

337
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,160
Yan Xiaoyi is the only Ninth Dan archer

338
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,950
in the world.

339
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,760
If you don't kill him now,

340
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,950
countless Beiqi soldiers will be shot dead

341
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,590
on the battlefield in future.

342
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Who can stop me?

343
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,640
It's for the righteous cause of your country,

344
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,950
you can't be intimidated!

345
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,000
My clothes are stained.

346
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,760
Haitang Duoduo!

347
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
Nice move.

348
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,070
How do you know I'm here?

349
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,160
I don't.

350
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,070
I just cried out for a try. And I guessed right.

351
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,640
Your Excellency,

352
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,190
I see

353
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,470
guards of the mission coming.

354
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,430
Let's go.

355
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,040
You can't have him.

356
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,710
Miss Duoduo, why are you still here?

357
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,560
I'll leave after I kill Xiao En.

358
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
So many people are killed today.

359
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,350
All of them combined

360
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
won't be able to stop me.

361
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,560
They won't try to stop you.

362
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,920
The fight is between us.

363
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,800
You're no match for me.

364
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,310
Courage and uprightness are the most
important in fights between warriors.

365
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,400
Even if I'm no match for you,

366
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,000
I'll fight you fairly and openly.

367
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,880
Well said!

368
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,950
I didn't expect you

369
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,920
to be a brave and strong man.

370
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,920
I underestimated you.

371
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,070
You lost. Thank you for letting me win.

372
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,110
Didn't you just say

373
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,830
you would fight me fairly and openly?

374
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,590
I'm a student of Fei Jie.

375
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,310
It's known to everyone that

376
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,520
we fight with

377
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,470
poisons.

378
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,310
Didn't Fei Jie tell you that

379
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,280
poisons are useless to

380
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,470
martial arts masters above the Ninth Dan?

381
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,590
Do you feel hot and flushed

382
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,310
with a racing heart?

383
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,880
Poisons are useless,

384
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,040
but it's not a poison.

385
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
Then what is it?

386
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,800
It's an aphrodisiac.

387
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,280
You!

388
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,760
Stop fighting with me!

389
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,950
I never take advantage of others.

390
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,950
Just leave!

391
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I do find it hard

392
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,230
to suppress the heat.

393
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,430
It's really an aphrodisiac.

394
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,190
Hide Xiao En first.

395
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,280
It's too late.

396
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,000
Senior Xiao,

397
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,710
please tell them that

398
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,710
I was the one who caught you.

399
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,430
Now I'm the only one

400
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,160
who wants to save your life.

401
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,110
What about him?

402
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,040
Take him along.

403
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,800
Beiqi tried to rescue Xiao En,

404
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,430
But His Excellency Fan took the lead

405
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,350
and brought Xiao En back.

406
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,160
So, please be relieved.

407
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't worry.

408
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,310
Let's take a short break

409
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,800
and set off right away.

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,950
-OK! -OK!

411
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,800
It's really not easy for His Excellency Fan.

412
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,310
He chased Xiao En all the way!

413
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,280
Senior, please get on the carriage.

414
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,520
Kill the members of the mission,

415
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,760
and I'll tell you anything

416
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,760
you want to know.

417
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,640
I do want to catch you,

418
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,040
but I don't want to betray my country.

419
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,160
Senior Xiao,

420
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,230
chance is easily missed.

421
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,830
Just behave yourself and get on the carriage.

422
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,280
There's still a chance.

423
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,710
I've been curious.

424
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,350
I didn't kill you

425
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,760
because of your

426
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,830
hidden secret.

427
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,710
But why didn't you kill me?

428
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
What's so special in Danzhou

429
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,000
to keep a ruthless man like you

430
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,310
from killing me?

431
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,310
The black knights didn't show up

432
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,310
throughout the whole process.

433
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,800
If Chen Pingping really cares about you,

434
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,590
how can he forget about this?

435
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,830
You should be careful.

436
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,070
We're about to arrive in Beiqi,

437
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,190
but Shangshan Hu still led his men

438
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,230
to attack the mission.

439
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,000
It's obvious that some people

440
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,350
from the imperial court of Beiqi want to take your life.

441
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,590
You should also be careful.

442
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Find more allies.

443
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,560
Don't rely solely on

444
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,430
Chen Pingping.

445
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,880
Your Excellency, feel relieved.

446
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
I've handled everything.

447
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Have you noticed any trace of

448
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,710
the black knights around?

449
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,830
No.

450
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,800
Where's Guo Baokun?

451
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,590
He's over there.

452
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,040
He just sits still

453
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,280
after reaching the campsite.

454
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,470
The black knights are not here.

455
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,070
Head must have

456
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,230
forgotten about it.

457
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Your men are

458
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,400
all buried.

459
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,800
Bold with good martial arts skills,

460
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,070
they must have joined the army.

461
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,560
I gathered them

462
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,430
to kill you.

463
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,310
Why do you want to kill me?

464
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,160
For my dad.

465
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,280
Your dad is dead?

466
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,310
Nonsense!

467
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,190
Since he's not dead,

468
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,950
why do you hate me?

469
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,520
My dad was sent to jail because of you.

470
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,040
Then why did you

471
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
attack Shangshan Hu?

472
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,110
I want to kill you both!

473
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,280
Why do you want to kill Shangshan Hu?

474
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,920
By killing him,

475
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,560
I can use my military exploit to get my dad out of jail.

476
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,350
Now that Shangshan Hu is still alive,

477
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,070
how can you get your dad out?

478
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,800
I...

479
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,230
I'll offer you two choices.

480
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,160
One is to kill me right now.

481
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,310
I'll take this one.

482
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,470
The other is to let me get your dad out of jail.

483
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,760
We don't bear deep hatred against each other.

484
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,520
Nonsense!

485
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,920
You beat me.

486
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,710
You don't hate me for sure.

487
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,680
I was caught by Shangshan Hu today.

488
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,640
Anyhow,

489
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,230
thanks to you, I escaped.

490
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,230
I kind of owe you.

491
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,640
How about this?

492
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,110
I'll make you a deal.

493
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,680
When we go back to the capital city with Yan Bingyun,

494
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,230
I'll personally beg His Majesty

495
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,160
to release your dad.

496
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,430
Why would His Majesty listen to you?

497
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,310
He won't

498
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,160
if the Princess Royal is still in the capital city.

499
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,310
But now Li Yunrui

500
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,400
has been kicked out of the capital city,

501
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,430
your father's sin of forming a clique

502
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,680
matters nothing.

503
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,800
What tricks

504
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
are you playing this time?

505
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,920
I have conditions.

506
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,470
When we return to the capital city,

507
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,520
you should personally

508
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,070
accuse Yan Xiaoyi of colluding with Beiqi

509
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,920
to assassinate the mission members.

510
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,040
Stop hesitating!

511
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,430
Even if you don't testify against him,

512
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,920
Yan Xiaoyi will also try to kill you.

513
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,070
What else do you want?

514
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,110
After your dad is released,

515
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,560
your family should ally with me

516
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,640
and share connections with me.

517
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,800
Nobody cared when my dad was put in jail.

518
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,280
We have no connections.

519
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,560
It's natural that no one cares about
you when you're down and out.

520
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,080
Once your father is released,

521
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,600
your former friends and relatives

522
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,320
will swarm to visit you.

523
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,520
It's a cold world after all.

524
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,320
You have the support of Chen Pingping
from the Investigator's Office.

525
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,320
Why do you need our support?

526
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,800
Just tell me yes or no.

527
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,280
Will anyone else help you

528
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,080
but me?

529
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,230
We're about to leave.

530
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,230
Aren't you going back to your carriage?

531
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,670
An aphrodisiac?

532
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,430
How do you know that?

533
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,710
Taking an aphrodisiac along with you,

534
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,630
you're really no gentleman.

535
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,040
Your Excellency,

536
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,950
I'm the only girl in the mission.

537
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,670
By bringing the aphrodisiac along,

538
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,670
whom do you plan to use it on?

539
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,320
Well...

540
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,710
it's not what you think.

541
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,140
Your Excellency!

542
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,660
Yan Xiaoyi.

543
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,020
Help!

544
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,180
You're awake.

545
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,540
Luckily, your internal organs are unharmed.

546
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,780
It was Yan Xiaoyi.

547
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,180
I was too careless.

548
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,860
I thought it was all settled.

549
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,140
I didn't expect him to return.

550
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,220
It's really hard to guard against the
assassination of a Ninth Dan archer.

551
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,820
He's also injured,

552
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,700
so your wound is not deep.

553
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,940
He won't come back in a short time.

554
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,780
You'll be fine.

555
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,220
Your Excellency.

556
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,660
What do you need?

557
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,420
Who took off

558
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,940
my clothes?

559
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,260
Well...

560
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,300
I'm the only one in the mission

561
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,260
who's proficient in medicine.

562
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,980
Your wounds had to be taken care of.

563
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,700
All of my clothes?

564
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,460
I had to bind up your wounds.

565
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,300
It's an act out of emergency.

566
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,540
You bring medicine along.

567
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,260
It's not an aphrodisiac.

568
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,340
Whatever you say.

569
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,940
It's really not.

570
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,140
Then what is it?

571
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,900
Your Excellency.

572
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,900
What's up?

573
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,940
Just get off and see yourself.

574
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,100
Your Excellency, shall we fight?

575
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,940
We stand no chance.

576
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,580
We can use a strong crossbow.

577
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,260
Don't follow me.

578
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,100
Your Excellency.

579
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,660
You've dried your clothes with internal force.

580
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,460
Did you jump into a river?

581
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,620
Come with me. Alone.

582
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,420
This way.

583
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,740
That woman is really good at martial arts.

584
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,060
Never mind.

585
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,740
His Excellency asked us

586
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,700
to wait here.

587
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,900
Wang,

588
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,620
I'm just worried.

589
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,660
No need.

590
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,860
Gorgeous as he is,

591
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,340
I actually feel that

592
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,220
the Beiqi Saintess

593
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,420
has fallen for him.

594
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,780
She is going to confess her love

595
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,100
in private.

596
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,740
His Excellency drugged her,

597
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,380
yet she falls for him?

598
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,820
The drug is the key.

599
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,500
His Excellency is a student of Fei Jie.

600
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,980
That aphrodisiac must be exceptional.

601
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,380
The Saintess must have really

602
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,140
fallen in love with him.

603
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,340
How can there be such drugs?

604
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,100
His Excellency has many specialties.

605
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,100
Just follow me.

606
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,220
I'll answer your questions.

607
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,020
OK.

608
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,700
Give me the antidote.

609
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,540
Listen to me.

610
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I'll kill you if you say another word.

611
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,780
It's not an aphrodisiac.

612
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm telling the truth.

613
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,260
Just think about it.

614
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,420
I was after Xiao En.

615
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,260
In that case,

616
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,460
why did I bring an aphrodisiac?

617
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,260
Then what is it?

618
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:22,900
Why...

619
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,260
Why did it make you hot and flushed

620
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,980
with a racing heart?

621
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,660
Actually, I made the drug myself

622
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,940
to boost metabolism

623
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,860
and increase energy.

624
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,100
What is metabolism?

625
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,100
Let me put it this way.

626
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,300
If you take this drug after getting injured,

627
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,060
it can unleash your potential

628
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,220
so as to maintain your military strength.

629
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,340
It's not a poison.

630
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,540
Instead, it's good for health.

631
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,340
Your heart raced

632
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,180
because of the drug.

633
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,740
You may feel hot,

634
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,140
but your reaction ability can be greatly improved.

635
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,020
Did you feel that?

636
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,540
You lied to me previously.

637
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,220
If I didn't say that,

638
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,700
you would kill me right away.

639
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,500
Weren't you afraid that I might see through your lie?

640
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,220
I suppose you had no experience.

641
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,660
Why do you tell me

642
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,540
the truth now?

643
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,940
I'm a gentleman.

644
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,060
How can I lie to you?

645
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,420
Bullshit!

646
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,460
If I don't tell you the truth,

647
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,020
you might kill me just now.

648
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,620
I can still kill you now.

649
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,900
You won't.

650
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,500
Then just go to hell.

651
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,900
You won't kill me.

652
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,980
Why are you so sure?

653
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,780
Everyone saw you take me away from

654
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,140
the official road just now.

655
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,540
If I die,

656
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,820
Nanqing will definitely launch a war against Beiqi.

657
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,500
You're the Saintess of Beiqi.

658
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,460
Would you like to

659
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,580
see your people suffer?

660
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,020
I can kill you first.

661
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,540
Then I'll kill everyone in your mission.

662
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,420
You're not bloodthirsty.

663
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,260
How could you know?

664
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,020
If you are,

665
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,020
you wouldn't let me

666
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,780
kill Xiao En.

667
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,300
You would definitely kill him yourself.

668
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,660
Also,

669
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,540
you wouldn't bother

670
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,620
asking me for the antidote.

671
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,700
Would you like a bite?

672
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,300
You're really a piece of work!

673
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,900
Aren't you afraid it might be drugged?

674
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,580
It's sweet.

675
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,500
Of course.

676
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,900
It's our gift

677
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,380
for the imperial family

678
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,660
of Beiqi.

679
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,980
I took it out from the mission.

680
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,700
Wang,

681
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,500
why does it take so long?

682
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,660
It makes sense that they're not back yet.

683
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,340
What do you mean?

684
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,220
Just think about it.

685
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,380
That Beiqi Saintess is a martial arts master.

686
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,460
If she wants to kill His Excellency,

687
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
how could it take so long?

688
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,580
They must have a good talk

689
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,780
and become friends already.

690
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,620
That's too fast!

691
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,900
Amazing!

692
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,140
Amiable as His Excellency is,

693
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,860
they might be eating fruits together.

694
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,860
Are you really the Saintess?

695
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,580
In the river of history,

696
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,780
time goes round and round.

697
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Memories about the former and present lives

698
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,020
join each other in an endless way.

699
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,620
In the long drunken Milky Way,

700
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,340
one season follows another in a flash,

701
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,540
and the wild geese are flying south.

702
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,460
I just can't give up

703
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,460
to be with you for my whole life.

704
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,740
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

705
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

706
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,420
Year after year in the wandering,

707
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,980
I count the remaining years.

708
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,180
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

709
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,740
even though we have ended up the destiny,

710
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,420
I never feel regretful.

711
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,380
In such a chaotic world,

712
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,140
I still miss you as ever.

713
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,780
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

714
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,500
With a gentle heart,

715
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,060
I cherish our remaining years.

716
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,900
Even though we have to go through

717
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,860
all the hardships along the journey,

718
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:23,180
you always stay by my side,

719
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,940
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

720
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,860
Year after year in the wandering,

721
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,220
I count the remaining years.

722
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,580
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

723
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,380
even though we end up the destiny,

724
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,820
I never feel regretful.

725
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,740
In such a chaotic world,

726
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,700
I still miss you as ever.

727
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,380
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

728
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,140
With a gentle heart,

729
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,540
I cherish our remaining years.

730
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,340
Even though we have to go through

731
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,500
all the hardships along the journey,

732
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:03,780
you always stay by my side...
