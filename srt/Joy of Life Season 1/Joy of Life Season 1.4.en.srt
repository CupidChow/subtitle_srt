1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 4

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,910
Close the door.

17
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,550
Give out my order.

18
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,720
Tell them to clean up

19
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,600
the servants' kitchen,

20
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,670
for Fan Xian to move in.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,750
Yes.

22
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Madam.

23
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,880
Still inside?

24
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
Yes.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,320
There's no sound. It's very quiet.

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,270
Sizhe! Sizhe!

27
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,000
Wake up!

28
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,880
Mom, ten taels of silver will be enough!

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,720
You...

30
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,080
It's improper for me to go.

31
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,630
Just go to your father's study.

32
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,240
Say that

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,960
you're worried that he might be hungry.

34
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,550
Ask him if he wants any pastries.

35
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,080
Take the chance to see

36
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,390
what Fan Xian is doing

37
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,910
in the study.

38
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,390
Mother, you're right.

39
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll do as you command.

40
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,190
Take Young Master there.

41
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,270
Yes.

42
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,550
So obedient.

43
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,000
He's finally made some progress.

44
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,950
Lead the way faster!

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,070
Yes!

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,270
It's so late, but my dad hasn't eaten anything yet.

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm so worried!

48
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,440
Really worried!

49
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,320
Young Master?

50
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,200
Am I silly?

51
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,880
Young Master!

52
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,600
Madam, Young Master has run away.

53
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,660
Fan Jian, Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue & Earl Sinan

54
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,550
Feeling anxious after waiting so long?

55
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,230
Father, good evening!

56
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,440
To answer your question, I'm not anxious.

57
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,830
After waiting in Danzhou for so many years,

58
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,270
no need to be anxious for a little longer.

59
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,640
It sounds like a complaint.

60
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,270
Should I shed tears

61
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,270
and cry for an hour with you in my arms

62
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,230
to express

63
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,440
my regret?

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
Please don't!

65
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
I think so, too.

66
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
Then let's get down to business.

67
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,880
What kind of person do you want to become?

68
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,440
I want to become the richest man in the world,

69
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,550
living a peaceful and romantic life
with many young and beautiful wives.

70
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,320
Sorry, I'm a vulgar man.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,550
How will you build up a fortune?

72
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,070
I've already thought about that!

73
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,600
I have a unique technique.

74
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,320
Under high temperatures,

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,670
I can make something marvelous out of sands

76
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,640
which is much smoother and
more transparent than the crystal.

77
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,110
I call it glass.

78
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,390
Once it is made...

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,720
Where did you get that?

80
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,000
Your mom made it before.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,670
And the technique is mature.

82
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,950
Never mind. I've got something else.

83
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,510
I can use grease

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,950
to produce something special

85
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,110
which can clean both clothes and human body.

86
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,480
Smooth as grease

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,270
with fragrance,

88
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,440
it's far better than honey locust and wood ash.

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,760
I call it soap.

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Your mom made that before.

91
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,110
She not only made soap,

92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,640
but also perfumed soap.

93
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
That's fine.

94
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,830
Actually, I've got something else.

95
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,070
Nowadays,

96
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,830
besides honey,

97
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,760
sweet food are usually made of

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
maltose or malt.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,640
Even saccharose is pretty rough.

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,350
I've got a technique

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,040
to further refine the saccharose into

102
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
granulated sugar as white as snow.

103
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,760
And the flavor is excellent.

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,670
White granulated sugar.

105
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,950
There are two full jars in the kitchen.

106
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,270
Also made by my mom?

107
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,200
Yes, your mom made it back then.

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,110
Why haven't I seen these things

109
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,230
in Danzhou?

110
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,510
They are only used by

111
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,040
influential officials

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,600
and circulated in big cities.

113
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,920
So I'm to blame

114
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,760
for living in the rural area.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,230
Do you have any other ideas?

116
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,230
No.

117
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,070
Why is my mom always one step ahead of me?!

118
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,670
Your mom ran a firm,

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
so she had countless fancy ideas.

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,040
Back then, the scale of her firm

121
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,480
was already No.1

122
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,790
in the world.

123
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,790
It was the fortune center of the world.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,790
I've heard about that.

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,510
Rumor has it that after she died,

126
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,070
the firm was registered under the state treasury.

127
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,350
That's not true.

128
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,350
It was controlled by the imperial family

129
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,110
and was named Neiku
(Homophone for underwear in Chinese).

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,270
Who came up with such a vulgar name?

131
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
Mind your words!

132
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,480
It was named by His Majesty.

133
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,440
What's so vulgar?

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,110
Never mind. Go on.

135
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,760
Diligent in handling complicated national affairs,

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,640
His Majesty has no energy

137
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
to manage Neiku in person.

138
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,230
Therefore,

139
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,510
he put Li Yunrui, the Princess Royal,

140
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
in charge.

141
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,320
The Princess Royal is in charge of Neiku?

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,350
She's extremely beautiful

143
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,960
and very gentle.

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,350
Though she's not related to His Majesty by blood,

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,280
she's deeply trusted.

146
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,910
And she's not married yet.

147
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,300
Li Yunrui, the Princess Royal of Nanqing

148
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,230
Father,

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
are you into her?

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,760
Nonsense!

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
Since we met,

152
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,320
you've talked from the firm to the Princess Royal.

153
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,960
You said we would talk about business,

154
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,550
but you only talked about gossips.

155
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,110
Do you know what gossip means?

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,550
The Princess Royal

157
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,030
has a daughter with Lin Ruofu,

158
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,840
the current Prime Minister.

159
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,640
You just said

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,030
she's not married yet.

161
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,150
It's a big secret.

162
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,320
You're definitely gossiping!

163
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,960
The Princess Royal's daughter

164
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,150
is named Lin Wan'er.

165
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,350
She is the woman

166
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,910
you come to marry.

167
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,960
Bastard son and bastard daughter,

168
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,790
we're really made for each other.

169
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,640
His Majesty proclaimed that

170
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,110
whoever marries Lin Wan'er

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,150
can take over

172
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,280
Neiku

173
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,150
from Li Yunrui,

174
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,590
the Princess Royal.

175
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,320
Chen Pingping and Fei Jie

176
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
don't want you to come to the capital now.

177
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,350
I take you here

178
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,030
while they are away.

179
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,230
Because now

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,710
is the best chance to get back

181
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,760
your mom's properties

182
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,590
and reclaim

183
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,470
what should be yours in the first place.

184
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,790
Here!

185
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,790
This is for you.

186
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,880
What's this?

187
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,150
The summary of important things of Neiku over the years.

188
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,350
Read it carefully.

189
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,150
It's helpful for you to reclaim the properties.

190
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,710
Actually, I...

191
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,440
But you should be more careful.

192
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,670
Neiku is a money tree for the imperial family.

193
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,350
A lot of people don't want you to take over.

194
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,030
My greetings to you, Your Majesty!

195
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,760
Arise.

196
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,230
Thank you, Your Majesty!

197
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,400
It's late. What brings you here?
=Empress Dowager of Nanqing=

198
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,550
Your Majesty!

199
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,280
Fan Xian has arrived in the capital.

200
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,550
It's the kid Earl Sinan

201
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,520
kept in Danzhou.

202
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,320
Wan'er was sent out of the palace

203
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,350
right after I gave birth to her.

204
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,030
I've always felt guilty

205
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,470
and wanted to find her a good husband.

206
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,550
But Fan Xian is a bumpkin from a remote place

207
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,080
with no fame or talent.

208
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,910
He's no match for Wan'er!

209
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,790
So, you...

210
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,760
I don't want Wan'er to marry him.

211
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
So the Princess Royal doesn't like the marriage.

212
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,710
That's right.

213
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,320
She's not happy with it from the start.

214
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,440
Then it's over.

215
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
Without the consent of the mother-in-law,

216
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,150
there will be no marriage.

217
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,710
She has no say

218
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,000
in your marriage with Lin Wan'er.

219
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,320
She's her mom, yet she has no say in this?

220
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,470
For the imperial family,

221
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,080
family affection is never the theme.

222
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,790
You want to stop Fan Xian from marrying Wan'er?

223
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,590
Your Majesty, I beg your support!

224
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,100
Hong Sixiang, Head of Eunuchs of Nanqing

225
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,880
Princess Royal.

226
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,760
Eunuch Hong,

227
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,470
When it comes to the imperial family,

229
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,590
only His Majesty can make the call.

230
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,880
No one cares if you like it or not.

231
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
That is a warning for you

232
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,470
to never cross the line.

233
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,840
Yes.

234
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,080
As long as His Majesty consents,

235
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,760
what others think

236
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,590
doesn't matter.

237
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,200
But why does His Majesty

238
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,960
have to make me

239
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,030
marry Lin Wan'er?

240
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,840
His Majesty has four sons.

241
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,640
The eldest one is away leading troops.

242
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,030
The youngest one is still a child.

243
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,710
Now the Crown Prince and the second prince

244
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,640
are fighting for the throne.

245
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,280
How is that relevant to me?

246
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,230
The Princess Royal has supported

247
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,640
the Crown Prince all along.

248
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,150
It's like the imperial wealth

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
is controlled by the Crown Prince.

250
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,400
It's way too dangerous.

251
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,200
So the Head of Neiku must be replaced.

252
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Exactly.

253
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,880
By taking over Neiku,

254
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,150
I practically shake the foundation of the Crown Prince.

255
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,550
This might be the cause of

256
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,350
the assassination in Danzhou,

257
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,440
You mean

258
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,550
it's the Crown Prince and his followers who tried to kill me.

259
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,760
It's probable with interests concerned.

260
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,590
You've said all these

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,280
to clear

262
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,880
Liu Ruyu.

263
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,910
You don't believe me?

264
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,840
You even drag the Crown Prince into this.

265
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,910
Does it matter if I believe you or not?

266
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,760
Follow me.

267
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,150
Princess Royal.

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,440
His Majesty wants to see you.

269
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,880
Please come with me.

270
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,150
Just lead the way.

271
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,100
Fan Ruoruo, daughter of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian

272
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,980
Fan Sizhe, second son of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,790
I'm hungry.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,670
Finished talking? Go ahead and take a seat.

275
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,840
I have to say this.

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,640
You don't want to eat,

277
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,000
but Fan Xian can be hungry.

278
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,780
Fan Xian, bastard son of Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian

279
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,660
We have important things to discuss. Please leave us.
=Liu Ruyu, Fan Xian's stepmother=

280
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,020
We have important things to discuss. Please leave us.

281
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,940
We have important things to discuss. Please leave us.
=Fan Jian, Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue & Earl Sinan=

282
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,110
We have important things to discuss. Please leave us.

283
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,110
Yes.

284
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,470
Only me?

285
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,000
Get out now!

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,790
Yes!

287
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,670
Did you send

288
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,790
Butler Zhou to Danzhou?

289
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,710
Master, you've known that.

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Danzhou is so faraway.

291
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I thought

292
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
it would be reassuring to send someone trustworthy

293
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,320
to take care of Xian'er.

294
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,840
He tried to assassinate Fan Xian

295
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,910
in Danzhou.

296
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,230
A...assassinate?!

297
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't know that?

298
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,470
I haven't heard from him this month.

299
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,790
I've no idea.

300
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,840
There won't be any letters.

301
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,640
My mother has sent him onto a fish boat.

302
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,590
He won't get down in recent years.

303
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,030
Staying away for all these years,

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,030
he actually dare betray his master.

305
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,080
Thank God Xian'er is all right.

306
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,710
Butler Zhou confessed it all.

307
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,440
He had received your secret letter,

308
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,790
asking him to kill Fan Xian

309
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,110
with the Investigator's Office.

310
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,150
How come the Investigator's Office is also involved?

311
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,960
They also received a fake order.

312
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,640
The Investigator's Office only answers to His Majesty.

313
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,880
Whoever can insert spies in the Investigator's Office

314
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,960
must be from the imperial family.

315
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,280
And Lady Yi, mother of the youngest prince,

316
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,880
happens to be your cousin.

317
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,160
Master, you mean

318
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,280
I am the one who wants to kill Fan Xian?

319
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,230
Aren't you?

320
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,310
No, it's not me.

321
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,400
Why not?

322
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,070
I...

323
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,070
Tell him.

324
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,830
If I want to kill you,

325
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,110
I'll definitely

326
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,000
find a stranger

327
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,710
to do the job.

328
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,590
I'll never ask Butler Zhou to do it.

329
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,560
I... I'm not that stupid.

330
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,280
Maybe you did it the opposite way.

331
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,760
I have no reason to kill you.

332
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,110
You don't want me to inherit the family properties.

333
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,310
No, Fan Xian.

334
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,520
I might be particular about you,

335
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
and I might try to suppress you,

336
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,000
but I'll never try to kill you.

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,590
Why?

338
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,070
If you die because of me,

339
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,680
Master is sure to

340
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,230
drive Sizhe and me out of the Fan mansion.

341
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,640
I...

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,800
This...

343
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,590
Ruoruo.

344
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,710
I think she's made a point.

345
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,230
If she wanted to kill you,

346
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,230
she wouldn't involve her minion.

347
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,880
Right.

348
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,190
So?

349
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,160
Words alone

350
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
can't prove anything.

351
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,230
I...

352
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,590
You can investigate on your own.

353
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,640
Let's eat first.

354
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,350
Here you are!

355
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,430
It's from the Princess Royal.

356
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,060
Li Yunrui, the Princess Royal of Nanqing

357
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,590
Your Majesty, the Princess Royal is here.

358
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,420
Emperor Qing, Nanqing's emperor

359
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,040
Don't hold a grudge against the Empress Dowager

360
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,710
for that slap on your face.

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,040
I just don't want Wan'er

362
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,640
to marry a bumpkin.

363
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,470
You can just say it out!

364
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Why ruin

365
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,800
other's reputation instead?

366
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,710
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

367
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,880
I don't understand.

368
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,560
Really?

369
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,310
Gong Dian!

370
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,230
Yes!
=Gong Dian, Deputy Director of Imperial Guards of Nanqing=

371
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,110
Go find out

372
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,470
who sent the maidservants

373
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,070
out for purchasing today.

374
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,830
Yes, Your Majesty!

375
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,520
Take a seat.

376
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,110
Come on! Let's eat while the dishes are still hot.

377
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,470
Eat more.

378
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,310
What a feast!

379
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,880
Here, I'll fetch you some soup.

380
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,880
OK.

381
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,680
You're so kind!

382
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
This is the white gourd clam soup.

383
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,110
I especially

384
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,430
have the clams delivered.

385
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,070
Here! Have a try!

386
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,800
Thank you so much!

387
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,950
Madam, I've never seen such a dish

388
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,040
in Danzhou.

389
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,000
Really?

390
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,110
- Just try it! - How does it taste?

391
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,920
Do you like it?

392
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,110
I'm so blessed!

393
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,070
- Good! - Terrific!

394
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,350
Madam! Father!

395
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,040
This fish is specially brought here

396
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,640
from Danzhou.

397
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,830
Please try and see how you like it.

398
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,640
OK! Let's taste it!

399
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,310
It looks so yummy. You're so thoughtful.

400
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
If you like it,

401
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,520
I'll send you fish regularly from home.

402
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,470
I like it very much. It also smells good.

403
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,310
I'm glad you like it.

404
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Master, eat more.

405
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,110
Here!

406
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,590
Madam!

407
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,230
Did you make all the dishes?

408
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,230
Yes, I did.

409
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,680
My dad is so lucky!

410
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,560
I specially made them for you.

411
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,400
Lucky me!

412
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,680
I'd like to learn a few dishes from you in future

413
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,760
so that I can cook for you. Is that OK?

414
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,470
No problem!

415
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,110
Let me see what I want to learn.

416
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,110
Come on! Try more!

417
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,710
Sister.

418
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,400
Here!

419
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,110
I've only been out for a little while.

420
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,310
How come

421
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,880
they suddenly become so close?

422
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,470
It's nothing.

423
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,310
They just suspect that your mom

424
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,000
tried to kill elder brother.

425
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,430
Come on! Try this!

426
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,830
This!

427
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,520
Let me get it for you.

428
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,920
It's delicious.

429
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,350
Sister, don't you lie to me!

430
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,880
It's the truth.

431
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,040
Eat with me! I can help myself!

432
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,950
I'm just happy watching you eat.

433
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,880
Then I'll eat more.

434
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,470
Here! Here! Here!

435
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,950
Come on! Eat!

436
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,640
OK!

437
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,830
Your Majesty,

438
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,950
Ms. Han from Shanggong Bureau

439
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,040
is the one who arranged for today's purchase.

440
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,800
Where is she?

441
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,040
Your Majesty, she has

442
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,070
hung herself.

443
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,760
Your Majesty, do you need me to explain

444
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,350
my relationship with that Ms. Han?

445
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,230
No need to make it so clear.

446
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,800
If Your Majesty ask,

447
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,590
I'll answer.

448
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
Are you tired?

449
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,310
Resting in the imperial palace all the time,

450
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,710
I don't feel tired.

451
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,430
Good!

452
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,640
Then just sit here and wait!

453
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
Your Majesty,

454
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
what are we waiting for?

455
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,640
A man.

456
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,590
May I ask who he is?

457
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,800
If it's a court official,

458
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,400
then I'd better excuse myself.

459
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,680
You'll know who he is

460
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,680
when he arrives.

461
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,680
Your Majesty, His Highness requests to see you.

462
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,590
Let him in.

463
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,760
Look, here he is.

464
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,560
Don't just kneel. Say something.

465
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,160
It was me who planned

466
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,310
the whole maidservants blocking the carriage thing.

467
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,190
I'm willing to take punishments.

468
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,830
I'm really disappointed at you.

469
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,800
Li Chengqian, the Crown Prince of Nanqing

470
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,680
I acknowledge my sin.

471
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Li Yunrui didn't acknowledge anything.

472
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,880
I made the mistake

473
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
out of temporary confusion.

474
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,040
Reconsidering it now, I feel so ashamed.

475
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,680
Neiku should be managed

476
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,400
by the person pointed by Your Majesty.

477
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,640
I should never act as I think fit.

478
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,950
By taking charge of Neiku,
one can gather the wealth of the world.

479
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,190
As the Crown Prince,

480
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,640
you sure have to fight for it.

481
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,920
What really disappointed me

482
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
is the means you've adopted.

483
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,310
Let me ask you.

484
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,230
Is there any difference

485
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,800
between an imperial blood

486
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,920
and a street civilian?

487
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,070
As different as heaven and earth.

488
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,280
But some may say

489
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,830
they are both

490
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,680
ordinary people

491
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,350
with two hands and two eyes.

492
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,040
Your Majesty, that's insane.

493
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,000
What are complicated ethic codes

494
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
and strict laws for?

495
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,880
For protecting the foundation of the country.

496
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,560
Protecting the foundation of the country?

497
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,350
It's for building a high tower

498
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,070
in people's heart,

499
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,470
so that we can stand high above
the masses with dignity and respect.

500
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,680
Whoever said that should be executed.

501
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,800
Trying to ruin other's name

502
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,430
at the cost of the imperial name,

503
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,950
we've become a joke.

504
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,400
With more jokes, there goes the reverence.

505
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,070
Without the reverence,

506
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,040
no dignity or respect will be found in people's heart.

507
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,470
Then the tower will collapse, right?

508
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,680
You are ruining our foundation on your own.

509
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,520
Your Majesty, I see.

510
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,880
You don't!

511
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,350
Just think it over.

512
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,000
Come here.

513
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,520
This is the list of officials

514
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,800
to be dismissed these days.

515
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,470
Be prepared for it.

516
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,560
See who are on the list.

517
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,560
Are your followers on it?

518
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,350
I've also been the Crown Prince.

519
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,560
I've fought for what I should.

520
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,350
But there is always a line.

521
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,310
Your Majesty!

522
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,430
Just leave!

523
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,110
Your Majesty!

524
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,830
Leave!

525
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,280
Father!

526
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,280
I'm leaving for studying.

527
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,470
Me, too.

528
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,800
Yes.

529
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,230
Master,

530
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
the room for Xian'er

531
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,470
is tidied up.

532
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,680
I'd like to show him around now.

533
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,470
See if he needs anything else.

534
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
You may leave first.

535
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,230
I need a word

536
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,470
with him.

537
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,710
Yes.

538
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,560
You're in the capital city now.

539
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,160
Learn to be cautious

540
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,470
later on.

541
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
I'm pretty cautious all the time.

542
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,230
How can you call yourself cautious by bring
the assassin of the Investigator's Office

543
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,830
to the capital city.

544
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,230
So you know about Teng Zijing.

545
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,190
The guards escorted you to the capital

546
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,830
are all elites.

547
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,040
You really think they wouldn't notice

548
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,760
when there was one more person.

549
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,040
What's this?

550
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,310
Arrest warrant.

551
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,520
I found it in the files of the Ministry of Penalty.

552
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,470
It's for Teng Zijing.

553
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,230
What crime did he commit?

554
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,950
I don't know, and I don't need to know.

555
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,350
Just be careful of him.

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,710
It's an old warrant.

557
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,040
Anyway, he's not here now.

558
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,280
Stay away from the Investigator's Office

559
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,920
in future.

560
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,800
Moreover,

561
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,350
I will make secret investigations to find out

562
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,110
whether the Crown Prince is the one who tried to kill you.

563
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,560
Don't act rashly on your own.

564
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,710
Act rashly?

565
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,640
What can I do?

566
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,400
Can I rush into the Eastern Palace and kill the Crown Prince?

567
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,280
Back then,

568
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,710
your mom could really do that!

569
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,640
So awesome!

570
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,520
She was bound to no rules of the world.

571
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,350
She could always

572
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,640
make unexpected moves.

573
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,920
How did she die?

574
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,160
She was killed.

575
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,560
Those who killed her, are they still alive?

576
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,640
I don't know.

577
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,110
In theory,

578
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,040
the villains who killed your mom

579
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,000
were all wiped out back then,

580
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,190
but Chen Pingping and I both think

581
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,920
there is hidden danger

582
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,040
in the capital city.

583
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
So,

584
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,160
I've always kept you in Danzhou.

585
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,000
Eventually,

586
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,800
you still take me to the capital city.

587
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,880
I've told you.

588
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,640
It's the best chance to get back

589
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,880
your mom's properties.

590
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,680
You're right.

591
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,590
Well.

592
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,310
You're also tired. Have a good rest.

593
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,310
As to your marriage with Lin Wan'er,

594
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll arrange everything for you.

595
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,470
No need to worry about anything.

596
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
I don't want to marry her.

597
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,310
What did you say?

598
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,280
I said

599
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,800
I didn't want to marry Lin Wan'er.

600
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,160
I've said so much,

601
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,000
but you still don't get it?

602
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,040
I get it.

603
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,040
My mom used to have a firm.

604
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,880
Now it belongs to

605
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,110
the imperial family.

606
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,000
By marrying Lin Wan'er,

607
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,160
I can take the firm back.

608
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,470
Now is the perfect chance.

609
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,560
I understand all the things you've said.

610
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,230
I just don't want to marry her.

611
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:28,950
Why?

612
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,110
I'm falling in love with

613
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,190
a drumstick thief.

614
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,400
What?

615
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,040
Actually, it has nothing to do with her.

616
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,110
Even if I hadn't met her,

617
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,520
I still won't marry Lin Wan'er.

618
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,280
Neiku is the fruit of

619
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,430
your mom's painstaking labor for a lifetime.

620
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,950
I understand it's very important to you.

621
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,680
But...

622
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,950
But how can I

623
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,230
put this?

624
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,400
Look!

625
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,430
It can move.

626
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,590
If cut open, it'll bleed.

627
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm growing up recently,

628
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,230
so I eat a lot every day.

629
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,350
Vegetables are good for health,

630
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,640
but I still love to eat meat.

631
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,070
Eating too much meat,

632
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,800
my nose will bleed,

633
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,680
and my nails will grow fast,

634
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,160
so I often have to cut them every day.

635
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,830
What nonsense are you talking about?

636
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,830
I'm telling you that I am a man.

637
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,190
Not a chess piece.

638
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,760
Not a chip.

639
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,310
I am a living man.

640
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,760
Why would I

641
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,110
use my life

642
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,000
to trade for a firm?

643
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,160
Xian'er, you have to understand.

644
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,160
If you control Neiku,

645
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,040
you're in control of

646
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,110
uncounted wealth.

647
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,950
Were you with my mom

648
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,230
for her money?

649
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,190
How dare you!

650
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,880
I can't marry her.

651
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
I want to live

652
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,520
for myself.

653
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,680
These are all your followers.

654
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,310
His Majesty is warning me.

655
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,680
It's a warning and a guide.

656
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,430
Officials on the list

657
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,040
are all from Ministry of War and Ministry of Personnel.

658
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,350
See it yourself!

659
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,710
His Majesty wants to tell you

660
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,880
the line is military power and official governance.

661
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,800
As long as you don't cross the line,

662
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,560
you can do

663
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,000
whatever you want.

664
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
If that's true,

665
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,350
then I can take Neiku by force.

666
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,680
His Majesty just said

667
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,760
we had adopted the wrong means,

668
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,280
but he didn't say

669
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,430
we can't go after Fan Xian.

670
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,040
Aunt,

671
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,640
what should we do?

672
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,710
Why did His Majesty choose Fan Xian

673
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,950
to compete for the financial power of Neiku?

674
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,280
He has never been to the capital city

675
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,430
and he belongs to no factions.

676
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,710
He's not the only one.

677
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,470
But why him?

678
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,520
Rumor has it that

679
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,000
Fan Xian has written

680
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,120
a masterpiece named Red Mansions

681
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
under a pseudonym.

682
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,190
I was wrong before.

683
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,800
To destroy him completely,

684
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,280
we must aim at

685
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,950
what he's best known for.

686
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,280
Red Mansions.

687
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,910
Young Master.

688
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,800
Young Master.

689
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,390
Give it to me!

690
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,520
Give me!

691
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,190
Give me that!

692
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,870
Just put it down.

693
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,040
Put it down! Put it down!

694
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't need these.

695
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,470
All of you, just go back.

696
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,630
Young Master,

697
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,320
we are the servants

698
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,760
of your yard now.

699
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,120
Where else can we go?

700
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,560
You...

701
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,630
Look at me!

702
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,710
Healthy and strong as I am,

703
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,470
I don't need any servant.

704
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,040
In addition,

705
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,800
as men, we are born equal.

706
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,520
No one is superior and no one is inferior.

707
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,360
We are all the same.

708
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,360
You should also live for yourselves.

709
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,520
Just go.

710
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,630
What are you doing?

711
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,630
Young Master.

712
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,000
We are servants.

713
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,120
If we did anything wrong,

714
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,630
please punish us directly.

715
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,710
Just don't scare us.

716
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,280
Right, Young Master.

717
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,600
How am I scaring you?

718
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm serious

719
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,670
about that.

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,710
Moreover,

721
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,670
stop calling yourselves servants.

722
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,040
We are

723
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,320
all equal.

724
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,120
Everyone is his own master.

725
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,080
Young Master,

726
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
life or death, we belong to the Fan family.

727
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,560
We're absolutely loyal!

728
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,120
We're absolutely loyal!

729
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,150
Apparently,

730
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,120
debating

731
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,630
based on different knowledge levels

732
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,080
is by itself unequal.

733
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,360
Personnel management is an art.

734
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,080
Sometimes,

735
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,760
you have to be simple and rough.

736
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,670
Just fuck off!

737
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,950
I'm unsociable and eccentric.

738
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,470
I don't want to see others in my yard.

739
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,670
Hurry up and leave!

740
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,520
Leave! Mind your own business!

741
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,390
Young Master,

742
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,040
if...

743
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,080
if you said that earlier,

744
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,630
we would understand you.

745
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,190
Then why are you still here?

746
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,150
Yes, Young Master!

747
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,360
We'll leave now.

748
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,950
Whatever you need,

749
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,910
just tell us.

750
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,360
Leave right away!

751
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,430
Or I'll beat you with a plank.

752
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,670
Yes, Young Master.

753
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,600
You guys!

754
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,950
Hurry back and find a plank

755
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,800
for Young Master.

756
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,910
-Yes. -Fuck off!

757
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,760
Young Master, you've had a long day.

758
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,710
Please rest early.

759
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,430
If he lives alone,

760
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,870
who shall take care of his daily life.

761
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,520
Fine! Fine!

762
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,630
There are so many

763
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,390
weird young masters and ladies

764
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,040
in different families.

765
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,000
It's no big deal.

766
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
Only what he said first

767
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,280
sounds horrifying.

768
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,950
Enough! Enough!

769
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,470
You guys, listen to me!

770
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,430
It's not that bad.

771
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,320
He was much nicer

772
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,230
when he asked for a plank for beating us.

773
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,470
Right!

774
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,520
Fan Xian! Fan Xian!

775
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,800
Fan Xian.

776
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,670
Are you asleep?

777
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,630
It's Fan Sizhe.

778
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,470
I need to talk to you.

779
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm coming in.

780
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,520
Sleeping already?

781
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,080
Wake up!

782
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,910
Don't sleep!

783
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,190
I have something to tell you.

784
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,710
How come you sleep like a log?

785
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,390
Fan Xian! Wake up!

786
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,230
Fan Xian,

787
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,150
haven't you slept in Danzhou?

788
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,670
Are you awake?

789
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,600
I have something to tell you.

790
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,520
Well, today,

791
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,670
I almost beat you.

792
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,800
It's my fault.

793
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,280
After all, we are relatives,

794
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,000
right?

795
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,950
How about this?

796
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,910
I'll book a table in a restaurant

797
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,520
at noon tomorrow.

798
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,950
Take it as my apology for you.

799
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,760
Is that OK?

800
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,670
Well, I'll take that as a “Yes”.

801
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,360
At noon tomorrow. Don't forget!

802
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,430
I'm leaving.

803
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
I'll leave this on your desk.

804
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,190
Fan Xian.

805
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,700
Who is he?

806
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,620
Teng Zijing, member of the Fourth Division
of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing

807
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,320
What?

808
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,760
He's the guard who escorted me to the capital city.

809
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,470
Sending away all the maidservants

810
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,150
while keeping a guard,

811
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,710
what's wrong with you?

812
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Why are you here?

813
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,230
There's one more thing.

814
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,600
Dad

815
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,910
is old-fashioned and inflexible.

816
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,630
But no matter what,

817
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,520
he's still your dad.

818
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,760
Do you understand?

819
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,360
I don't need you to tell me that.

820
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,470
Fine! Fine! Fine!

821
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,910
Don't tell him about

822
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,840
our lunch tomorrow.

823
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,710
I see.

824
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,390
I'll leave you to your business.

825
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,470
Where were you just now?

826
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,320
Anywhere you can't see.

827
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,150
Aren't you gone?

828
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,560
Listen.

829
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,520
He has fallen into my trap.

830
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,670
Tomorrow morning,

831
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,710
find some guys to go out with me.

832
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,320
I will beat up

833
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,710
the bumpkin from Danzhou.

834
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,950
He is a Young Master of the family after all.

835
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,950
He is a Young Master.

836
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,430
I'm not, right?

837
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,760
Fuck off!

838
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,470
Yes.

839
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,190
All your files back then

840
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,390
were transferred by the Investigator's Office.

841
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,710
The only thing left

842
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,470
is this arrest warrant.

843
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,120
According to it,

844
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,710
the crime you committed back then

845
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,910
was assassinating court officials.

846
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,800
This is weird.

847
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,710
Why would the Investigator's Office

848
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,950
hire a criminal

849
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,600
like you?

850
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,900
In the river of history,

851
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,100
time goes round and round.

852
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Memories about the former and present lives

853
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:33,340
join each other in an endless way.

854
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,940
In the long drunken Milky Way,

855
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,660
one season follows another in a flash,

856
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,860
and the wild geese are flying south.

857
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,780
I just can't give up

858
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,780
to be with you for my whole life.

859
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,060
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

860
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

861
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,740
Year after year in the wandering,

862
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,300
I count the remaining years.

863
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,500
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

864
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,060
even though we have ended up the destiny,

865
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,740
I never feel regretful.

866
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,700
In such a chaotic world,

867
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,460
I still miss you as ever.

868
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,100
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

869
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,820
With a gentle heart,

870
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,380
I cherish our remaining years.

871
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,220
Even though we have to go through

872
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,180
all the hardships along the journey,

873
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:32,500
you always stay by my side,

874
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,260
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

875
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,180
Year after year in the wandering,

876
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,540
I count the remaining years.

877
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,900
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

878
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,700
even though we end up the destiny,

879
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,140
I never feel regretful.

880
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,060
In such a chaotic world,

881
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,020
I still miss you as ever.

882
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,700
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

883
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,460
With a gentle heart,

884
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,860
I cherish our remaining years.

885
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,660
Even though we have to go through

886
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,820
all the hardships along the journey,

887
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:13,100
you always stay by my side...
