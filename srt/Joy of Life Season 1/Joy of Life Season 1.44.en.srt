1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 44

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
Auntie, what else do you tell him?

17
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,830
Nothing else.

18
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,310
I just warned him

19
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,440
when he left.

20
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,040
About what?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,510
After thinking about it,

22
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,870
I'd better warn you about one thing.

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,950
Did I miss anything?

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,470
Since you told the Empress Dowager

25
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,470
that you have feelings for me.

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,320
You can't let others

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,720
see through your lie.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,910
Pardon?

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
I said you can't let others

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,080
see through your lie.

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,240
Don't worry.

32
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,880
During this period,

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,750
I'll visit you often.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,630
It's getting cold.

35
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,320
Take showers with ice water more often.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
Why?

37
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,960
To keep your mind clear and suppress your nature.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,910
When you see me often,

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,360
do remember to control yourself.

41
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,000
Keep alert all the time.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,110
Control your feelings. Don't take it seriously.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm just afraid

44
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,880
you might hurt yourself.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,470
You said that?

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,830
What's wrong?

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,720
Auntie, you're really...

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,750
Really what?

49
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,750
Nothing.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,390
I suddenly feel Fan Xian and you

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,830
are made for each other.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,670
His Majesty must be confused.

53
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,600
Your Excellency,

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,270
the water is cold.

55
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,630
Let me add some warm water for you.

56
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,550
Why do I have to suppress my nature?

57
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,960
Why would I hurt myself?

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
She seems to keep a low profile usually,

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,320
but she's so narcissistic actually!

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,960
Do I have to marry her

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,240
by simply looking at her?

62
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,000
How ridiculous!

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,190
Your Excellency, you're so angry.

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,750
Do you feel a bit regretful?

65
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,720
Bullshit!

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Regret for what?

67
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm just angry! I'm so mad!

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,000
It feels like...

69
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,830
like...

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,520
Do you understand?

71
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,240
Yes.

72
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,520
Get insulted by someone,

73
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,470
who runs away in time,

74
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,910
right?

75
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,550
Yes!

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,030
No!

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,160
It doesn't sound right!

78
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,270
Your Excellency, please calm down.

79
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,350
If you

80
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,510
feel angry,

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,480
you can use your charm

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,320
to bewitch her

83
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,270
and make her lose her mind.

84
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,880
Later, just ignore her.

85
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,950
By then, you can

86
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,000
vent your anger.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,670
Fine.

88
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,920
When we go back to the capital city,

89
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,720
repeat what you just said

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
to Wan'er.

91
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,720
No! No! No!

92
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,510
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,640
Your Excellency, please forgive me.

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,790
I'll never say that again.

95
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,160
Are you here

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,440
to say that?

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
Of course not.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,390
Have you heard

99
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
what I've done clearly?

100
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,440
Conspiring with the imperial family

101
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,270
of Beiqi on smuggling in private.

102
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll report that when we return to the capital city.

103
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
If I really want to smuggle goods,

104
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,070
will I tell you about it?

105
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,670
Your Excellency, you want to use the smuggling as an excuse...

106
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,670
To associate with

107
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,200
the imperial family of Beiqi openly

108
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,440
From now on,

109
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,230
with money clearing the way,

110
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,000
it'll be way easier to pry into information.

111
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,640
Shen Zhong won't allow it.

112
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,510
So we have to

113
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,720
crush him completely.

114
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
I need your help for that.

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,350
I'm not recovered yet.

116
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,640
How can I help you?

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Hand the intelligence network of the Investigator's Office

118
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,350
in Shangjing Town over to me.

119
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,110
It's an order from Chen Pingping.

120
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,040
After going back,

121
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,510
I'll ask the Head in person.

122
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,920
That's too late!

123
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,640
Our intelligence network is in the dark.

124
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
It's the safest.

125
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,640
How can that be late?

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,270
We have to destroy Shen Zhong now.

127
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,350
We need a push.

128
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,760
Are you still suspicious of me?

129
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,350
Considering your temperament, I'm just worried.

130
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,200
It's all for

131
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
getting the smuggler's name

132
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
out of Shen Zhong.

133
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,040
No hurry.

134
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,670
Aren't you eager to find out the truth?

135
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,440
I've thought about it.

136
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,790
After going back to the capital city,

137
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll tell the Head the whole thing.

138
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,550
He surely can find the chief culprit.

139
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
Then Chen Pingping will get the credit

140
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,110
instead of me.

141
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,320
Do you want to take the credit?

142
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,070
I'm just tired of being a chess piece.

143
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,270
You don't trust the Head?!

144
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,600
Now I trust no one.

145
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,440
Then it's more unlikely for me

146
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,110
to give you what the Investigator's Office has achieved

147
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
after years of painstaking labor.

148
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,720
The man behind the smuggler

149
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,950
must be paramount and powerful.

150
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,270
If we investigate into the case when we're back,

151
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,230
any leak of information

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,830
is bound to cause turbulence.

153
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,720
If you really put Nanqing first,

154
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,670
you should help me figure out the truth.

155
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,110
I also don't know

156
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,270
how many secret agents of

157
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,270
the Investigator's Office

158
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,790
are hiding in Beiqi?

159
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,510
Why?

160
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,160
It's not long since I was transferred to Shangjing after all.

161
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,670
Then how do you use the intelligence network?

162
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,950
Through one man.

163
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,200
I dispatch secret agents in Shangjing

164
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,670
through him.

165
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Tell me who he is.

166
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,350
It's all for Nanqing.

167
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,940
=Oil shop=

168
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,230
Miss, don't worry.

169
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,440
I'll deliver it to your home later.

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,880
Boss, I want to buy oil.

171
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,920
Sir, which oil do you want?

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
Half jin of palm oil.

173
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,640
OK.

174
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,950
Do you have any pot?

175
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,510
Yes, three coins for one pot.

176
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Do you have sesame oil?

177
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
The sesame oil is too expensive.

178
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,270
Unless it's time for worshipping the Heaven,

179
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,480
no one buys it normally.

180
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,350
Besides worshipping the Heaven,
it can also be used to mourn people.

181
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,390
Fine.

182
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,230
How much do you want?

183
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,390
We can order it for you.

184
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,070
Seven jin six taels nine qians four haos.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Boss,

186
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
why do you close

187
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,790
so early today?

188
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,200
Sorry, please come back tomorrow.

189
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,760
But I...

190
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,550
Finally, you're here.

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
After the Chief was caught,

192
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,950
no one has been sent by the imperial court to take over.

193
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,270
I thought

194
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,200
they want us to stay quiet.

195
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,590
Yan Bingyun was rescued.

196
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,760
That's good.

197
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,350
He told me that

198
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,670
you're in charge of dispatching

199
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,910
the secret agents in Shangjing Town.

200
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,880
Is there a secret order for us?

201
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
I've persuaded Shangshan Hu

202
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,150
to serve the Empress Dowager of Beiqi.

203
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,350
Now, what you should do is

204
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,110
to spread my words with Shen Zhong

205
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,590
in the imperial palace today

206
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,550
on the street

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,350
as chitchat.

208
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,470
It's a piece of cake.

209
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,280
I'll inform our agents in a moment.

210
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,110
He will work with you.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,760
But Your Excellency,

212
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,030
identities of secret agents in Shangjing

213
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,000
are top secrets.

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,150
How long have you stayed in Shangjing Town?

215
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,030
Over ten years.

216
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,880
Do you miss home?

217
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,790
Of course I do.

218
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,230
When this is over,

219
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,440
you can go home.

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,880
He will replace you to

221
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,790
manage the intelligence network of Shangjing Town.

222
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,030
I didn't receive such an order.

223
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,230
I just made the decision.

224
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,590
Your Excellency,

225
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,110
what's your position

226
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,280
in the Investigator's Office?

227
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,840
Director-General!

228
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Do you have any other question?

229
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,110
It's a big deal.

230
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,880
It's my decision.

231
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
I'll take

232
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,470
any consequence.

233
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,000
If Yan Bingyun

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,350
doesn't agree with the appointment,

235
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,960
he wouldn't send me to you.

236
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,110
I know,

237
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,200
but...

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,320
But after staying in Shangjing for ten years,

239
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,520
you must have made some new friends.

240
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,640
Yes.

241
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,000
It's also for maintaining my current identity.

242
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
Now that you're reluctant to take the order,

243
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,400
is it because you're unwilling to leave Shangjing

244
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,640
and part with your Beiqi friends?

245
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,840
Absolutely not!

246
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,440
I'll take the order.

247
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,230
But I wonder

248
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,590
which division he is from

249
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,880
and which Director he is working for.

250
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,150
He's not from the Investigator's Office.

251
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,910
What?

252
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,840
Let me introduce.

253
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
This is the son of Guo Youzhi, the Minister of Board of Rites.

254
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,400
You can call him Guo Baokun.

255
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,470
But Your Excellency,

256
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
the secret agents of Shangjing

257
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
are managed by the Investigators Office all along.

258
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,550
He's my subordinate.

259
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
If you have a problem with me,

260
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
you can submit a memorial

261
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,670
to impeach me when you're back to the capital city.

262
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,440
But now, just do what you're told.

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,910
I dare not.

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,880
Fine. You may leave.

265
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,000
I need a word with him.

266
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll get things ready in the backyard.

267
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,840
In a little while,

268
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,080
I'll introduce him to

269
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,110
all the secret agents in Shangjing.

270
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,960
Think it over.

271
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,590
From now on,

272
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,520
you'll stay in an enemy capital alone

273
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,030
and face great danger.

274
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,640
You promised to save my dad.

275
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,550
I will.

276
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Why me?

277
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,710
The intelligence network of Shangjing
Town is of great importance,

278
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,760
the one in charge must be my man.

279
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,280
I'm not your subordinate.

280
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Except me,

281
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,790
who else will save your dad?

282
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,520
Who else can save your dad?

283
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,880
I'm your only option.

284
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,350
Dare you lie to me,

285
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,910
I'll kill your with my own hands.

286
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,550
No,

287
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,280
you must let me kill you.

288
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,710
Rest assured.

289
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,790
Moreover,

290
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,640
Shen Zhong knows me.

291
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,000
He'll be a hidden danger.

292
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,960
Don't worry.

293
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
You're a shield

294
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,110
especially for Shen Zhong.

295
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,590
You only need to run the business

296
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,030
and give bribes.

297
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,280
Matters concerning the secret agents

298
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,400
will be managed by others.

299
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,320
Who?

300
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,670
What if someone comes to examine the shop?

301
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,790
The smuggling

302
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,150
is a deal with the Beiqi's upper class.

303
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,030
Once the profit chain spreads out,

304
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,000
many people will benefit.

305
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,400
No matter what happens,

306
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,520
they'll handle it for you.

307
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
Unbelievable!

308
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,790
It's dangerous and inefficient

309
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,030
to risk your life inquiring about information

310
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,550
and hide yourself.

311
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,280
It's time to change your mind.

312
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,150
From now on, with money clearing the way,

313
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,470
we can have our enemy protect us.

314
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,550
But Shen Zhong is against this.

315
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,030
Shen Zhong won't be a problem.

316
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,230
It's an irresistible trend.

317
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,110
One man alone can't stop it.

318
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,200
That makes sense.

319
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,790
Don't smirk.

320
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,000
Have you heard?

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,880
Someone from Nanqing

322
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,400
wants to cooperate with us.

323
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,280
By the time the trade route opens,

324
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,470
it will bring a large sum of money.

325
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,320
I heard that

326
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,840
it will be handled by the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

327
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,080
If it succeeds,

328
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,280
our Division will benefit.

329
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm afraid it won't be easy.

330
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,550
A couple of days ago,

331
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,470
Commander Shen said on the Hall that

332
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,910
he wouldn't help to make it happen.

333
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,550
Really?

334
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,710
Haven't you heard about their talks on the Hall?

335
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,350
Tell us about it.

336
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,710
A couple of days ago, Commander Shen said

337
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,110
in front of Her Majesty that...

338
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,320
Your Excellency,

339
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,280
your words with Fan Xian

340
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
in front of Her Majesty

341
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,910
are spreading everywhere.

342
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,280
Fan Xian has made a nice move.

343
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,670
However, he forgot that the capital is

344
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,350
controlled by Embroidered Uniform Guards.

345
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,110
Pass on my order to each battalion commanders.

346
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,880
Spare no efforts in blocking the rumor

347
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,030
and check strictly.

348
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,400
Are these vegetables picked today?

349
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,960
Yes.

350
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,110
They're fresh. Just picked.

351
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,840
Have a look!

352
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,030
Fresh pork.

353
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,110
Ribs also.

354
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,030
Lady, do you want anything?

355
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,150
It looks good.

356
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,200
Just picked.

357
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,150
Give me two.

358
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,670
Shouldn't all Saintesses love

359
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,960
ancient calligraphy and paintings

360
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,280
or magic weapons?

361
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,760
But I prefer eating.

362
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,000
Please trim them for me.

363
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,880
Remove the leaves outside.

364
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,710
OK! OK!

365
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,200
The leaves outside are not fresh.

366
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,150
Don't put them inside.

367
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,640
These are all fresh.

368
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,760
Should you pay attention?

369
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,670
To what?

370
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
You're a Saintess after all.

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,590
The basket doesn't go with your temperament.

372
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm not in the imperial palace.

373
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,320
You should pay attention to

374
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,520
your temperament all the time.

375
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
It's not only for pretending

376
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,200
in the imperial Palace.

377
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,030
You've got a point.

378
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,840
Carry it for me.

379
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,440
I have a question for you.

380
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,110
Go ahead.

381
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,910
Are you responsible for the rumor

382
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,640
in the capital recently?

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,670
Yes.

384
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,230
Then do you know

385
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
Shen Zhong has ordered Embroidered Uniform Guards

386
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,550
to block the information?

387
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,550
It won't work.

388
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,030
The power of Embroidered Uniform Guards

389
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
is beyond your imagination.

390
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,030
I know, but it still won't work.

391
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,840
How about making a bet?

392
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,280
So you're really confident.

393
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Your Excellency, do you want to see me?

394
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,030
Haven't I given the order?

395
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,320
How come the rumor

396
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,710
is still rampant these days.

397
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,520
Your Excellency,

398
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,150
all the battalion commanders said

399
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,400
they had acted according to your order,

400
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,110
but it doesn't work.

401
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,710
I've urged them repeatedly,

402
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,150
but they said

403
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
they had tried their best.

404
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,110
Well...

405
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,680
Why are you so sure

406
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,280
the Embroidered Uniform Guards won't take it seriously?

407
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,070
Because they're human.

408
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,070
So what?

409
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,880
Humans are selfish.

410
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,920
If the smuggling falls into place,

411
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
Embroidered Uniform Guards will all benefit

412
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
by controlling the financial power.

413
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
Who doesn't want to

414
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,710
live a better life while alive?

415
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,680
Shen Zhong gets in their way,

416
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,230
so no one wants to help him for sure.

417
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,830
But there must be people who don't seek profits.

418
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,400
Even if they don't seek profits, they will seek power.

419
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,710
Shen Zhong controls

420
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,110
Embroidered Uniform Guards all by himself.

421
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,350
If he doesn't step down,

422
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
how can others move up?

423
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,470
If so,

424
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,350
why didn't they challenge Shen Zhong

425
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,110
as the Commander-in-chief

426
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,110
in earlier years?

427
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,110
In earlier years, he was deeply trusted by the Empress Dowager.

428
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,880
They knew they couldn't beat him,

429
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
so they bowed at his feet.

430
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,000
What about now?

431
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,430
Now with Shangshan Hu rising sharply,

432
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,830
Shen Zhong is no longer the most powerful minister

433
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,710
serving the Empress Dowager.

434
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,590
Exactly.

435
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,590
Have you planned all of that?

436
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,280
Cutting off others' source of income

437
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,400
is similar to killing their parents.

438
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,800
The Embroidered Uniform Guards aren't

439
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,110
the only ones to gain profits from the smuggling.

440
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,350
Believe me.

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,230
If Shen Zhong goes his own way,

442
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,430
he'll become the target of public criticism in the end.

443
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
But as long as the Empress Dowager trusts him,

444
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,470
he'll be fine.

445
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,520
Keep the birthday celebration simple.

446
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,640
Just share the happiness with the people.

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
I see.

448
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,110
I'll handle it.

449
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,950
You're occupied.

450
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,760
No need to worry about

451
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,560
such a miscellaneous thing.

452
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,310
No, that one.

453
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,830
But your birthday celebrations have been prepared

454
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,470
by Embroidered Uniform Guards all the time.

455
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,800
Yes, indeed.

456
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,190
I remember that

457
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,000
your subordinator, the deputy commander,

458
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,230
is quite alert and resourceful.

459
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,710
You can leave this to him.

460
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,590
Your Majesty.

461
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm afraid that you might be too tired.

462
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,430
I have to find someone capable

463
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,430
to assist you.

464
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,710
It's my turn. I haven't put down my chess piece.

465
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,680
No.

466
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,310
That one.

467
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

468
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,040
You may leave.

469
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,640
I win!

470
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,520
Good! Let's play another round.

471
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,310
Right, it's different now.

472
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,230
Now the Grand General

473
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,800
is most favored by Her Majesty.

474
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,350
Contradicting Her Majesty in face,

475
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,230
no wonder Her Majesty is displeased.

476
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,110
I heard!

477
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,800
He's not so trusted as before.

478
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,160
Her Majesty seldom summons him.

479
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,140
=Shen Mansion=

480
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
Your Excellency,

481
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,110
the tailor has finished

482
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,000
altering your robe.

483
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,000
The python pattern bestowed by

484
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,310
Her Majesty has been embroidered on it.

485
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,560
Your Excellency,

486
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,880
isn't today the day when battalion commanders

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,710
from different battalions come to report to you regularly?

488
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,560
How come no one

489
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,280
is here?

490
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,590
Do I remember the wrong day?

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,110
Two deputy commanders and two assistant commissioners

492
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,070
have important things to attend to.

493
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,920
Those battalion commanders

494
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,160
are busy working.

495
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,830
They should at least

496
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,920
inform Your Excellency.

497
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,350
It's not bad to be idle.

498
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,520
In your opinion,

499
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,110
why does the Empress Dowager

500
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,040
suddenly treat Shen Zhong so coldly?

501
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,760
Shen Zhong is too aggressive.

502
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,710
The Empress Dowager didn't mind that before.

503
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,110
It's because he could control

504
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,680
the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

505
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,110
She surely would tolerate

506
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,400
a capable subordinate.

507
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,230
But now is different.

508
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,190
The Embroidered Uniform Guards are divided.

509
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,760
Your Empress Dowager sees it all.

510
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,950
Actually, she can eliminate

511
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,430
the conspiracies

512
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,950
and recover Shen Zhong's power easily.

513
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,430
Why should she?

514
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,800
Ministers getting separated

515
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
in different cliques

516
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,000
by competing for power

517
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,830
is better for check and balance.

518
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,880
It's much safer than

519
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,640
having only one powerful minister.

520
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,040
But Shen Zhong does everything

521
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,310
out of his loyalty

522
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,470
instead of selfness.

523
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,070
What does loyalty have to do with that?

524
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,590
In past dynasties,

525
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,400
so many loyal ministers were killed.

526
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,230
Where are we heading?

527
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,800
I remember you drugged me

528
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,760
when we first met.

529
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,040
Why do you bring that up again?

530
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,160
You lied to me that it was an aphrodisiac.

531
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,310
I had no other choice.

532
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,190
I thought it's over.

533
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,110
I remember.

534
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,070
Now I'm taking you to

535
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,430
an extremely dangerous place

536
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,160
to avenge the drug.

537
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,310
If you're scared,

538
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,430
just don't follow me.

539
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,950
To avenge the drug.

540
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
You even make a word.

541
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,920
Whose home is this?

542
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,830
Mine.

543
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,680
Did you grow up here?

544
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Not really.

545
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,400
My master asked me to stay in Shangjing.

546
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,590
I love to stay quiet,

547
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,520
so I took this place to grow vegetables.

548
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,830
I visit here whenever I'm free.

549
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,280
Are these all grown by you?

550
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,520
As to the flowers,

551
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
I just scattered the seeds randomly.

552
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,640
I seldom took care of them.

553
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,400
They grow on their own.

554
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,950
She scattered the wild flower seeds

555
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,070
she picked along the road

556
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,920
by the wall randomly.

557
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,710
She said,

558
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,880
"No need to take care of them.

559
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,520
Life can find its way

560
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,880
to thrive."

561
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,040
Who's that "she" you just mentioned?

562
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,350
Your mom said

563
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,230
it has its own destiny.

564
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,470
Let it grow as it likes.

565
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,830
You sound like

566
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,520
a woman I know.

567
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,710
Is she also a Saintess?

568
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,640
It's a pity that

569
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,590
the vegetables are not fully grown,

570
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,350
or I wouldn't have to buy vegetables outside.

571
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll take it.

572
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,680
So you like farming?

573
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,920
It calms my mind.

574
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,160
Others calm their minds

575
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,470
by playing the zither and burning incense.

576
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
I like it this way.

577
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,800
Why not sit down?

578
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,400
The soil should be turned.

579
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Soil?

580
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,640
Thank you.

581
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,800
The water is fresh and sweet.

582
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,110
Why do you know how to farm?

583
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,590
When learning poisons, I've planted poisonous weeds.

584
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,710
It's the same.

585
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,880
You're really weird.

586
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,830
So are you.

587
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,310
I can't see through you till now.

588
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,400
Why do you want to see through me?

589
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,880
What's the fun of that?

590
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,310
It's no fun.

591
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,760
If so,

592
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,760
why do you do that?

593
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,590
If we do nothing,

594
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,710
how can we prove we're alive?

595
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,110
Do we need to prove that?

596
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,400
The common answer is

597
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,430
"Don't we"?

598
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,760
Which answer is uncommon?

599
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,430
I've no idea.

600
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,830
It seems we've been talking nonsense.

601
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,190
I like it this way.

602
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,760
Lazy and loosened,

603
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,710
sit under the sun and talk nonsense.

604
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,830
I don't find it hard.

605
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,000
Do you often find it hard?

606
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,520
Intriguing against each other with crafty tactics,

607
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,110
it's like walking across an abyss

608
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,430
on a vine.

609
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,040
I just feel strained all the time.

610
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,110
So I need time like this

611
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
to sit idly with friends

612
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,880
without thinking anything

613
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,110
and talk casually.

614
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,350
Is that so hard?

615
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,040
It's hard to have free time,

616
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,430
and it's even harder to find a friend.

617
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,880
Are we friends?

618
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,920
To some extent,

619
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,230
we are enemies.

620
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,880
But you know,

621
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,470
the most dangerous people in the world

622
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
are not your enemies.

623
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,590
You are right.

624
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,430
Now those who rally together

625
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,880
to attack Shen Zhong

626
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,590
are all his subordinates

627
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,470
and friends.

628
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,950
They're not his friends.

629
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,070
I just said

630
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,470
it's hard for people like us to have friends.

631
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,110
If I didn't hear it wrong,

632
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,230
Your Excellency, you're depressed.

633
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm just dissatisfied.

634
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,920
Born into an influential family,
having a successful official career,

635
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,920
and known as the poetic genius sent from Heaven,

636
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,230
how can you be dissatisfied with

637
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,040
such a life?

638
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,520
I feel lonely.

639
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,560
It sounds affected.

640
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,160
I'm affected all the time.

641
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,590
Now in the Investigator's Office, you're only second to the Head.

642
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,000
You'll marry a beautiful wife when you're back.

643
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,310
Your younger sister is known for her talent.

644
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,520
Your father is a high-rank official.

645
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,280
You associate with talented people of the time.

646
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,880
How can you be lonely?

647
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,160
Father is father, wife is wife, and sister is sister.

648
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,520
They're my family,

649
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,070
not my friends.

650
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,680
As to others,

651
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
we're tied up by interests.

652
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,310
Call me a hypocrite

653
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
or call me a fool.

654
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,470
Anyway,

655
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,680
I find it hard to be a minister,

656
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,230
and unhappy

657
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,680
to be a son.

658
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,800
Do you really have no friend?

659
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,000
Teng Zijing was my friend,

660
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
but he died for me.

661
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,520
Now,

662
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,710
Wang Qinian can be counted as my friend.

663
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,070
You really speak highly

664
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,280
of him.

665
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,710
Wang Qinian lives a more authentic life than I am.

666
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,950
What do you mean by authentic?

667
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,000
He fears his wife and loves his daughter.

668
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,590
He lives his life

669
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,070
for them.

670
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,800
Though it's not easy

671
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
for him sometimes,

672
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,310
at least he's happy.

673
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Isn't your life authentic?

674
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,470
I have so many secrets in my heart.

675
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,160
I can't tell them and I have no one to tell them to.

676
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,640
Like what?

677
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,640
For example, I'm actually

678
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
the son of Emperor Qing.

679
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,710
I was born noble

680
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,190
but brought up in the Fan family secretly.

681
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,230
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

682
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,920
No need to talk rubbish.

683
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,230
Do you have anything else to say?

684
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,000
Yes.

685
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,680
I'm hungry.

686
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,280
Stop staring at me. I won't eat in advance.

687
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,430
I didn't expect you can cook.

688
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,640
My senior fellow apprentices and I

689
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,590
lived in the valley with my master.

690
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,520
I was in charge for cooking.

691
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,000
Aren't you his last apprentice?

692
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,710
The last apprentice to cook.

693
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,640
Well said.

694
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,950
Wait over there. It won't take long.

695
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,880
Have a try.

696
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,280
It's really good.

697
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,400
Aren't you afraid I might poison the dishes?

698
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,110
Just go head.

699
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,110
Right, you're a master of poison.

700
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,160
What now?

701
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Do you have any wine?

702
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,590
You're really making yourself at home.

703
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,590
Better be good.

704
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
It's really good.

705
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,710
It's from Qingyu Hall in Nanqing.

706
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,800
Really?

707
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,710
Back then, Ye Qingmei

708
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,070
was absolutely brilliant.

709
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,160
Qingyu Hall gathered the wealth of the world.

710
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,310
Anything good

711
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,880
must be from her firm.

712
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,430
She was really amazing.

713
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,400
Do you think

714
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,710
I pretend to

715
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,280
drown my sorrow

716
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,560
despite an infinite bright future?

717
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,920
I have no time to think about that.

718
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,560
I can't let you

719
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,520
drink up the good wine

720
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,560
all alone.

721
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,880
It's tuneless.

722
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,680
I suddenly remember a piece of poetry

723
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,430
which suits me well.

724
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,070
Tell me about it.

725
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,070
Leave behind a residue of happiness!
Leave behind a residue of happiness!

726
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,640
Unexpectedly you will come across a benefactor!

727
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,430
Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother,

728
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,430
will have laid by a store of virtue
and secret meritorious actions!

729
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,950
My advice to you, mankind,

730
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,640
is to relieve the destitute and succour the distressed!

731
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,070
Do not resemble those

732
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,590
who will harp after lucre and show themselves
unmindful of the ties of relationship:

733
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,040
that wolflike maternal uncle of yours
and that impostor of a brother!

734
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,160
For far above the constellations,

735
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,400
one watches all and makes just calculations.

736
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,190
It sounds familiar.

737
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,280
It's the sum-up for Sister Qiao

738
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,560
in the Red Mansions.

739
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,710
What's it called?

740
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,040
Leave behind a residue of happiness!

741
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,350
Relieve the destitute and succour the distressed.

742
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,350
It actually reflects a kind heart.

743
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,400
It's so hard.

744
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,350
My master said

745
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,470
the more difficult a thing is,

746
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,800
the harder one should work to make it happen.

747
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,520
You're trying to strengthen me out.

748
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,390
Why are men different from animals?

749
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
It's only because men value righteousness.

750
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,320
Your Majesty,

751
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,950
though we're from different countries,

752
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,710
but all the people in the world

753
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,000
are the same.

754
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,870
I hope that you spare no efforts

755
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,000
in preventing the war after going back,

756
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,190
thus saving all the people from hell.

757
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,000
You wanted to kill Xiao En before.

758
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,470
Wasn't him a living man?

759
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,710
Saving thousands of men by killing one man,

760
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,910
what's wrong with that?

761
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,150
It's not a simple calculation.

762
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,600
If one hundred men

763
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,120
will die one day.

764
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,520
By killing 49 of them, you can save 51.

765
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,670
Will you kill them or not?

766
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,520
In this sense,

767
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,520
we're both heartless.

768
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,630
Let me be.

769
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,710
Let me

770
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,630
get drunk today.

771
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,080
Drink less.

772
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,840
Don't get drunk.

773
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,870
You are?

774
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,840
You're awake.

775
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,080
Miss Lili!

776
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,040
I thought

777
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,710
you'll sleep the whole night?

778
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,600
It's almost dawn.

779
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,710
I have no status,

780
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,080
so I still live outside the imperial palace.

781
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,760
But it won't take long.

782
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,840
After the Empress Dowager's birthday,

783
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,840
I can move into the imperial palace.

784
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,760
I...

785
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,190
I don't know

786
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,520
why I keep thinking of you

787
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,670
like I've lost my mind.

788
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,230
I just want to see you

789
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,840
before moving into the imperial palace

790
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,080
and tell you about my feelings.

791
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,080
Fan Xian,

792
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,520
I like you.

793
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,360
Miss Lili,

794
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,120
I have a fiancée named Lin Wan'er.

795
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,950
I've sworn

796
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,230
to only love her in my life.

797
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,470
A lifetime

798
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,520
is long, but it's also short.

799
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
I'm narrow-minded.

800
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,470
I can't have someone else

801
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,230
in my heart this life.

802
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,560
You don't have to say that.

803
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,390
I just want to tell you.

804
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,760
You love the one in your heart,

805
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,470
and I love the one in my heart.

806
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,630
Let's not bother each other,

807
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,280
OK?

808
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,560
After tonight, we may not see each other.

809
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,470
In the future,

810
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,080
we probably won't meet again.

811
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,320
I just want to talk to you.

812
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,040
I asked Duoduo

813
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,710
to help me.

814
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,080
It might be absurd,

815
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,040
but I don't regret it.

816
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't be nervous.

817
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,760
I just want to talk.

818
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,000
Or we may

819
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
talk about the girl

820
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,430
in your heart.

821
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,000
How did you meet?

822
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,870
How did she walk into your heart?

823
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,320
Tell me your story

824
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,470
so my curiosity can be satisfied.

825
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,760
You really want to hear?

826
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,910
Yes.

827
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,390
Actually we met

828
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,760
by accident.

829
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,120
I just arrived in the capital city from Danzhou.

830
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,630
In the Qing Temple,

831
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,280
when I first

832
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,360
met her,

833
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
she had a...

834
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,950
The cocks are crowing.

835
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,150
What?

836
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,800
All the cocks are crowing.

837
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,430
Do you know what that means?

838
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
What does that mean?

839
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,840
It's dawn.

840
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,360
Finished talking?

841
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,150
When did you drug me?

842
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,840
You're the apprentice of Fei Jie.

843
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,470
Why would I drug you?

844
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,670
Then why did I pass out?

845
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,390
The wine is strong.

846
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,710
You were not drugged,

847
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,710
but drunk.

848
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,950
Then why were you OK?

849
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,080
I'm gifted.

850
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,430
I've never got drunk since I was a child.

851
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,280
You...

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,230
I told you

853
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,000
I would avenge the drug.

854
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,150
You were careless yourself.

855
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,360
What's wrong with you?!

856
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,660
=Shangjing Town=

857
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,040
Python pattern bestowed by Her Majesty.

858
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,390
Your Excellency, in the imperial court now,

859
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,600
only you have the honor.

860
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,630
Your Excellency, today is Her Majesty's birthday.

861
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,320
When you enter the Hall, you might as well...

862
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,600
What?

863
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,000
You might as well take a step back

864
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,760
and agree on the smuggling.

865
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,190
Your Excellency, not only the Embroidered Uniform Guards,

866
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,320
but all the ministries are paying attention to this.

867
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,320
If you still refuse to compromise,

868
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,520
you'll really offend

869
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,760
all the ministers in the imperial court.

870
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
As long as you take a step back,

871
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Her Majesty will surely be happy.

872
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,080
By then,

873
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,430
you'll still be in charge of the Embroidered Uniform Guards

874
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,710
If I worry about my life,

875
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,120
I don't deserve the robe.

876
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,150
Your Excellency!

877
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,120
Please.

878
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,560
Your Excellencies,

879
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,670
that way, please.

880
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,470
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

881
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,630
It's over there!

882
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,320
Can we sit here?

883
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,150
Yes, your seats are here.

884
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,670
If he doesn't let us sit here,

885
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,230
we'll have to sit outside the Hall.

886
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,320
Langtao wants to challenge Fan Xian

887
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,430
on the Hall.

888
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,560
Your Excellency.

889
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,360
Your Excellency!

890
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,320
Are you OK?

891
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm fine.

892
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,560
Take him to a cool place, and let him drink more water.

893
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,780
In the river of history,

894
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,980
time goes round and round.

895
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Memories about the former and present lives

896
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,220
join each other in an endless way.

897
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,820
In the long drunken Milky Way,

898
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,540
one season follows another in a flash,

899
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,740
and the wild geese are flying south.

900
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,660
I just can't give up

901
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,660
to be with you for my whole life.

902
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,940
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

903
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

904
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,620
Year after year in the wandering,

905
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,180
I count the remaining years.

906
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,380
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

907
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,940
even though we have ended up the destiny,

908
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,620
I never feel regretful.

909
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,580
In such a chaotic world,

910
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,340
I still miss you as ever.

911
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,980
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

912
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,700
With a gentle heart,

913
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,260
I cherish our remaining years.

914
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,100
Even though we have to go through

915
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,060
all the hardships along the journey,

916
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,380
you always stay by my side,

917
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,140
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

918
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,060
Year after year in the wandering,

919
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,420
I count the remaining years.

920
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,780
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

921
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,580
even though we end up the destiny,

922
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,020
I never feel regretful.

923
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,940
In such a chaotic world,

924
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,900
I still miss you as ever.

925
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,580
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

926
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,340
With a gentle heart,

927
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,740
I cherish our remaining years.

928
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,540
Even though we have to go through

929
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,700
all the hardships along the journey,

930
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:21,980
you always stay by my side...
