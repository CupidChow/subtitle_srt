1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless
chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 2

16
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,230
These people are here to escort me to the capital city?

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Who asked them here?

18
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,760
Your father, of course.

19
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,080
I have refused him.

20
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,400
The capital city is not a good place.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Your mother died there.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,000
You can live longer if you stay here.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,760
But they are kneeling out of the door.

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,910
Leave them alone.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,190
If they kneel there till they die, just bury them.

26
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Uncle,

27
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,000
should I go to the capital city?

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,670
I remember your mom doing business

29
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,600
in the capital city back then.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,550
What else?

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
I can't remember.

32
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,720
So you mean

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,800
I should go.

34
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,390
To go or not to go, it's up to you.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,600
My mom was killed in the capital city.

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,030
Are those killers still alive?

37
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,270
I have no idea.

38
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,320
I want to go to the capital city.

39
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,520
What if it's dangerous?

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,960
Whatever you like.

41
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,270
What are you looking at?

42
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,030
I've been wondering recently.

43
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,160
Will your face remain young

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,270
when I am in my seventies or eighties.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,670
Grandma!

46
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,160
Madam!

47
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,960
Those soldiers

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,470
won't eat anything.

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,550
I'm afraid if treated indifferently,
they won't remain loyal.

50
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,760
Madam, I...

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,640
Eat!

52
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I like this.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,270
Today's dish is so fresh! Where does it come from?

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
He's asking you!

55
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,440
Ha's nephew delivered it early in the morning.

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,830
Isn't Ha the one who usually delivers the vegetables?

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,200
How come his nephew came here today?

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
Ha's sick, so his nephew took his place.

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,880
Is there anything wrong?

60
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,950
Has Ha's nephew been here before?

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,200
It must be his first time.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,760
Anything wrong?

63
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,720
Nothing.

64
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,880
Grandma.

65
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,790
I've finished eating. I'll leave now.

66
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,000
Madam, forgive me for being outspoken.

67
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,040
A dish of bamboo shoots counts for nothing.

68
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,390
But he was acting

69
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,550
so arrogantly.

70
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,790
I'm just speaking out my mind.

71
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,950
Young Master!

72
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,000
Have you eaten the bamboo shoots?

73
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes.

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,440
I...

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,110
Young Master, you...

76
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,070
Young Master, we don't know why.

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,230
Everyone suddenly

78
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,110
started vomiting and having watery stools.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Come with me.

80
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,040
Take this.

81
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,440
Make them drink some milk.

82
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,510
They'll be fine after vomiting.

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
Here! Here! Here!

84
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Where are the men in red?

85
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,640
They asked about Ha's residence.

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,320
Then they left.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,230
Here! Here! Here! There! There!

88
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,950
Here! Here! Here!

89
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,270
Do make them drink more milk.

90
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,160
Everyone drinks some.

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,320
Here! Here! Here!

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,830
Wait!

93
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
What are you doing?

94
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,040
Kill the one who poisoned the dish.

95
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
Ha has delivered vegetables for us for many years.

96
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,920
He must have been held hostage.

97
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,040
If you rush in,

98
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,040
he will be killed.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,230
Step aside!

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm Fan Xian.

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,670
Step aside!

102
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,920
What if it's a trick to lure you away?

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,880
Leave it to me.

104
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,510
Lend me a knife.

105
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,480
Ha!

106
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,000
You are the one who poisoned the bamboo shoots.

107
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,780
=Teng Zijing, member of the Fourth Division
of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,200
Holy crap! Doraemon!

109
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,000
You lose!

110
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,200
You've put poison on your dagger.

111
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,760
Before you die, I have a question for you.

112
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,440
Why didn't you

113
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
let the soldiers in just now?

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,230
Risking your life

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
for a guy delivering vegetables,

116
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,710
it's not worth it.

117
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
What a coincidence!

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,320
My knife is also coated with poison.

119
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,400
Why are you fine with it?

120
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,710
To tell you the truth,

121
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,230
I've been poisoned since my childhood.

122
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,320
For me, ordinary poison

123
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,670
won't work.

124
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,280
You're the one who poisoned the dish.

125
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,520
Why didn't you use something highly toxic?

126
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,350
I only need to kill you.

127
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,280
Why do you have to kill me?

128
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,470
I received a secret order
from the Investigator's Office to kill the traitor.

129
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,760
You're from the Investigator's Office.

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,520
If you kill me,

131
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,520
another assassin will come.

132
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,840
If the Investigator's Office wants to kill someone,

133
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,520
he won't be able to...

134
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,760
Token for Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

135
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,840
Where did you get it?

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,470
Fei Jie from the Third Division of the Investigator's Office

137
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,440
is my teacher.

138
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,910
You don't believe me?

139
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,320
My mom died early.

140
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,230
I own no place in the Fan mansion.

141
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
I've lived in Danzhou since I was a child,

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,230
but my dad never visited me.

143
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,200
My point is

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
how come a bastard son like me

145
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,150
has the quality

146
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,110
to become a traitor?

147
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,710
Only because I'm handsome?

148
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,790
You're a bastard?

149
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,230
So think about it.

150
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,590
I'm afraid there's something wrong with

151
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,400
the secret order from the Investigator's Office.

152
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
We can really talk about it.

153
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,320
What do you think?

154
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,280
Moreover,

155
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
I also have a question for you.

156
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
The Fan mansion is managed according to strict rules.

157
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,790
How could you fool everyone

158
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,320
by pretending to be Ha's nephew

159
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,150
in you first appearance?

160
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,880
Who covered for you?

161
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,150
=Butler Zhou, butler of the Fan mansion in Danzhou=

162
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,550
=Butler Zhou, butler of the Fan mansion in Danzhou=
You're the one who cooperated with the assassin

163
00:10:59,550 --> 00:10:59,620
=Butler Zhou, butler of the Fan mansion in Danzhou=
to mix the poison in the dish.

164
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,590
to mix the poison in the dish.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,840
But it seems that

166
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,470
grandma has already figured it out.

167
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,060
=Madam Fan, Nanqing Earl Sinan Fan Jian's mother=

168
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,640
Madam!

169
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,880
Everything I did

170
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,400
is for the Fan family.

171
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,670
Take your time. Tell me everything.

172
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,710
Xian'er, kneel down and listen.

173
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,320
I was sent by Madam Liu Ruyu

174
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,350
to keep an eye on Fan Xian.

175
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,840
Once he arrives in the capital city,

176
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,400
he is sure to scramble for family properties.

177
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,790
Rather than let him ruin the family,

178
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,910
it's better to make sure

179
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,960
he never arrives in the capital city.

180
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,320
Moreover,

181
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,550
the Investigator's Office wanted to kill him this time.

182
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,960
I was just

183
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,110
giving them a hand.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,000
That's right.

185
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,960
To protect the Fan family, we can't be softhearted.

186
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,080
Xian'er, you must keep that in mind.

187
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,230
You've grown up.

188
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,440
You must learn to be merciless.

189
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,080
I see.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Guards!

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,110
Madam!

192
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,520
Break his legs!

193
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,880
Throw him onto a fish boat!

194
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,440
He doesn't have to land the rest of his life.

195
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,280
Yes.

196
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,110
No! No! No!

197
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,000
No! No! No!

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,790
Madam!

199
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,840
You've never liked Fan Xian
the whole time, haven't you?

200
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,150
It's all an act!

201
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,200
An act!

202
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,790
He had received a letter from Liu Ruyu,

203
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,230
asking him to cooperate with others

204
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,000
to kill you.

205
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,320
What do you think?

206
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,790
Madam Liu Ruyu

207
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,150
sends me gifts on every festival.

208
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,520
She's very kind to me.

209
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,590
I do remember that.

210
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,000
Right. A letter alone can't prove her guilty.

211
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll ask your father

212
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
to investigate it further.

213
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,760
There must be an outcome.

214
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,550
Grandma!

215
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,150
What if I investigate it myself?

216
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,200
You want to go to the capital city?

217
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Haven't we agreed that

218
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,590
you stay in Danzhou?

219
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,760
I'll persuade your father.

220
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,150
Grandma!

221
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,670
Look what a big man I've grown into.

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,880
I have to witness the big world.

223
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,030
The first assassin has come,

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
and a second one will follow.

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,440
I've hidden for so long,

226
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,350
but they still won't let me go.

227
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,840
I might as well face them directly.

228
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,940
Have you made up your mind?

229
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,540
I'll come back after solving everything.

230
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,700
What if Liu Ruyu is behind the assassin?

231
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,980
Then I'll tell her that

232
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,260
I'm not interested in the family properties.

233
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,700
I just taught you

234
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,300
to be merciless.

235
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,140
Just be cautious!

236
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,540
Rest assured. I'm smart and flexible.

237
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,100
When will you leave?

238
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,340
Tomorrow.

239
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,620
Well,

240
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,260
I won't see you off tomorrow.

241
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,860
I'm too old to stand separation.

242
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,940
Go back and get prepared.

243
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,620
Your grandma is really merciless.

244
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,780
She won't let him land the rest of his life.

245
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,940
I've heard that

246
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,260
you two don't get along. Is that true?

247
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,140
I've been hunted down by assassins since childhood,

248
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,860
so I was always worried that
I might bring trouble to my family.

249
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
So you asked her

250
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,260
to treat you indifferently.

251
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,460
But actually you were protecting her, right?

252
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,700
Now I'm leaving.

253
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,380
There's no need to act any more.

254
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,580
Thank you for helping me

255
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,820
in the cooperation.

256
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,620
No need to thank me.

257
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,940
The Investigator's Office has sent
an urgent order via a flying pigeon,

258
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,060
saying that the secret order to kill you is fake.

259
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,020
Someone wanted to get rid of you

260
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
by using the Investigator's Office.

261
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,500
Who?

262
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,820
We're still investigating.

263
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,460
When I arrive in the capital city,

264
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,780
I can figure it out for sure.

265
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,780
Fan Xian, I need a favor from you.

266
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,980
Just say it.

267
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,500
Please kill me.

268
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,540
Pardon?

269
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,020
Please kill me.

270
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,580
What's your name?

271
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,780
Teng Zijing from the Fourth Division
of the Investigator's Office.

272
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,180
Boss, I'd like to buy a pair of scissors.

273
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,380
Here is the money.

274
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,580
I'll take the scissors.

275
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,880
He stole a lot of things.

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,830
I know.

277
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,640
Because it doesn't matter

278
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,350
whether the shop makes a profit or not.

279
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,160
You're here to protect me.

280
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,830
Yes.

281
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,590
Uncle, I'm leaving for the capital city.

282
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,520
OK.

283
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,920
I didn't tell you about the assassination this time.

284
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,800
Do you know why I keep it from you?

285
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,950
I don't.

286
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,680
Because I want to show you

287
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,310
I can live well

288
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,710
in this world

289
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,000
without your help.

290
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,350
I've already grown up.

291
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,310
Good.

292
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,400
Ever since I could remember,

293
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,430
you've been guarding me.

294
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,230
As long as you're around,

295
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,430
I fear nothing.

296
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
But that is not right.

297
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,190
What is not right?

298
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,830
Liu from the kitchen likes fishing.

299
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,000
Ma who guards the door loves watching girls.

300
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,110
Everyone has a hobby.

301
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,350
And you? What do you like?

302
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,350
Nothing.

303
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,760
Then do you have someone you like?

304
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,160
Something you want to do?
Your own plan for life?

305
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,040
Sometimes, I just feel that

306
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,760
you are living for me.

307
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,560
That's not fair to you.

308
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,190
You don't need me anymore?

309
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,560
I will always need you.

310
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,000
But Uncle,

311
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,710
to me,

312
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,160
you're more than a guardian angel.

313
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,070
You're also the most important family member

314
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
I've left in the world.

315
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
I hope you can find something

316
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,880
you want to do.

317
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,950
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

318
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,710
Not really.

319
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,310
Uncle.

320
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,560
I'm leaving for the capital city tomorrow.

321
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,230
I will find those who want to kill me,

322
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,280
and I will explore my mom's stories.

323
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,880
I will live my life

324
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
better than anyone else in the world,

325
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,830
because that's what I want all along.

326
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,800
That's terrific.

327
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
I hope you can find something

328
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,070
you want to do.

329
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,400
Live for yourself.

330
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,350
Find something I want to do.

331
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,950
Live for myself.

332
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,430
Find something I want to do.

333
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,040
Live for myself.

334
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,950
Uncle Wuzhu,

335
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,520
can you show up

336
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,560
normally?

337
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,920
I remember.

338
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,350
Remember what?

339
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,040
Miss once said the same words

340
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,680
as you did this afternoon.

341
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
She wanted me

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,110
to find something I like.

343
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,070
Then have you found it?

344
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
I want to open it.

345
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,310
It was left by miss back then.

346
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,760
It's from my mother?

347
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,000
What's in it?

348
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,950
I don't know.

349
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,830
You never opened it?

350
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,760
She never told me to open it.

351
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,800
What now?

352
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,830
I've thought for a long time.

353
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,000
In this world,

354
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,520
what I want to do most

355
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,950
is to open this box.

356
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,590
I want to see

357
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,680
what on earth did Miss leave.

358
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,160
You must have been through a lot.

359
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,830
I've forgotten.

360
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,830
Come on! Let's open it.

361
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,070
I don't have the key.

362
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,830
Wait a minute.

363
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,280
Wait a minute. I'll go fetch another knife.

364
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,000
It's way too tough.

365
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,070
What's it made of?

366
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,280
I don't know.

367
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,350
How come it's so tough?

368
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,310
Where did my mom get it?

369
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,040
I've forgotten.

370
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,710
Where is the key?

371
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,280
In the capital city.

372
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,560
So, I will also go to the capital city.

373
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Let's leave together tomorrow.

374
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,880
I'll leave first. Let's meet in the capital city.

375
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,040
What about this box?

376
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,160
You keep it.

377
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,160
What's it really made of?

378
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,400
Girl.

379
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,920
Madam!

380
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,880
Is Young Master gone by now?

381
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,400
Let's go and have a look.

382
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,800
No need.

383
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,590
Yes.

384
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
He knows what he wants.

385
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,110
He'll leave eventually.

386
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,520
Young Master!

387
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,040
I've told you I won't see you off.

388
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,560
You...

389
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,070
It's not proper!

390
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,830
Take care.

391
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,430
When I figure everything out,

392
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,350
I will come back to pick you up.

393
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,590
Young Master.

394
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,470
The water is being heated.
It's gonna take a while before eating.

395
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,640
That's fine. Go ahead and do your business.

396
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm just walking around for a stretch.

397
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,830
Yes!

398
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,350
Young Master!

399
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,230
Young Master!

400
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,310
Young Master!

401
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,310
Teng...

402
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,470
Young Master, what's wrong?

403
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,310
Nothing.

404
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,430
Well,

405
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,800
why are you here?

406
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,350
I also need to return to the capital city.

407
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,800
Didn't you ask me to spread the word that

408
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,880
you're dead?

409
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,470
Right.

410
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,000
Officially, I was killed by you.

411
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
I can't show my face in public.

412
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,470
So I follow you cavalry

413
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,800
to avoid examination.

414
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,590
My guards know you?

415
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,560
No, they don't.

416
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,110
But they know what silver is.

417
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,520
Why do you go to the capital city?

418
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,000
It's none of your business.

419
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,950
Fine with me.

420
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,950
I go to the capital city this time

421
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,110
to find out who really wants to kill me.

422
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,830
It's Liu Ruyu, isn't it?

423
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,760
The second wife of your father?

424
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,590
I want to know how she

425
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,710
misled the Investigator's Office.

426
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,590
I don't know that.

427
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,430
You can help me find out.

428
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,640
When arriving in the capital city,
we can cooperate with each other.

429
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,760
Your death is the best cover.

430
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,640
Why should I help you?

431
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,710
Don't you want to know who tricked you?

432
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,560
No, I don't.

433
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,640
Now, you're asking me for a favor.

434
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,640
Well then,

435
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,520
I'll consider it when I reach the capital city.

436
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,560
Come back!

437
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,560
Do you think

438
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
you are serious enough?

439
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,800
You have to prepare for your marriage
when you arrive in the capital city.

440
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,230
You won't have time for the investigation.

441
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,430
What marriage?

442
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,160
Aren't you going to the capital city for getting married?

443
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,040
No one told you that?

444
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,110
No one did.

445
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,680
How did you know?

446
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,560
After receiving the secret order of killing you,

447
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
I have to know your information.

448
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,470
Just a quick glance.

449
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Then whom am I going to marry?

450
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,640
I don't know.

451
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,070
I was ordered to kill you,

452
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,000
not your whole family.

453
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,040
Why should I learn so much about you?

454
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,560
This

455
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,040
is my gift for your marriage.

456
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,230
Wish you a long and harmonious union,
and may you have a baby soon.

457
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
I'm going to make a fire.

458
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,160
What are you doing?

459
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,800
The trade caravan coming toward us
belongs to the Investigator's Office.

460
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,020
=Fei Jie, director of the Third Division
of the Investigator's Office=

461
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,230
Luckily, I have sharp eyes.

462
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,920
Most men in that trade caravan

463
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
are from the Fourth Division.

464
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,230
Moreover,

465
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,950
powerful as your teacher,

466
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,110
he actually travels along to keep up the formation.

467
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,760
I'm afraid something serious is happening.

468
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,640
Stop!

469
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,520
What are you doing?

470
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,590
Master Fei, we've checked.

471
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,520
The inn is safe.

472
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,190
Good. Then we'll rest here.

473
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,830
Yes.

474
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,520
I will walk around

475
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,400
to see if there's anything strange.

476
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,710
OK.

477
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,470
I know you'll follow me.

478
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Where did you get this?

479
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,680
I took it from a fruit ranch nearby.

480
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,950
Where are you going?

481
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,830
Beiqi.

482
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,760
Beiqi?

483
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,190
Don't they always want to go to war with us?

484
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,190
The war is coming.

485
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,400
The Investigator's Office established
an intelligence network

486
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
in Beiqi years ago.

487
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,710
The performance was bad. They need a head.

488
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,710
So they send you there?

489
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,520
Me? I'm only good at poisoning others.

490
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm seeing someone off.

491
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,590
The one sitting in the carriage?

492
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,400
Yes.

493
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,280
It's Yan Ruohai's son,

494
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,950
Yan Bingyun.

495
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Really a promising young man.

496
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
How can you send such an excellent
young man to an enemy country?

497
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,000
It's all because of you.

498
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,880
Because of me?

499
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,310
That Teng Zijing you killed is a scout of the Fourth Division.

500
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,560
A member of the Fourth Division
actually tried to kill his superior.

501
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,470
Yan Ruohai must take the responsibility.

502
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,400
Teng Zijing

503
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,430
is under the command of his son Yan Bingyun.

504
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,920
The Head was so angry that
he dismissed him from his post,

505
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,830
asking him to disguise with his men as trade caravan

506
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,070
to take over the intelligence network in Beiqi.

507
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,400
It's pretty serious.

508
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,400
I'm kind of seeing him off,
and kind of keeping up the formation.

509
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,280
I killed a member of our division. Am I in trouble?

510
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,110
Teng Zijing is not a regular member of the Investigator's Office.

511
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
He is relatively new to our office.

512
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,590
So it's no big deal.

513
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,950
But you were lucky this time.

514
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,430
What do you mean?

515
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,280
The Fourth Division is in charge of detection and patrol.

516
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,470
The Sixth Division is the division responsible for assassination.

517
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,160
Whoever wants to kill you didn't try hard enough.

518
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,000
The fake order wasn't given to the Sixth Division,

519
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,230
so the scout of the Fourth Division took action.

520
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,560
If someone from the Sixth Division took the order,

521
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,430
then you were in real trouble.

522
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,430
I didn't know there are so many stories behind.

523
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,880
Well, you should go back.

524
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,350
And listen,

525
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,800
no matter what happens, just wait till I'm back.

526
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,000
Also,

527
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,000
next time you take pears,

528
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,950
do pick those big, fatty ones.

529
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,190
Those are much sweeter.

530
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,110
Fan Xian.

531
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,680
Yan Bingyun.

532
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,470
Do you stop me

533
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,160
to avenge Teng Zijing's death?

534
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,400
Teng Zijing didn't deserve to die.

535
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,310
I already killed him. What do you want?

536
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,710
Give me the token for Director-General.

537
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,040
So you want to take it by force?

538
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,640
Give it to me!

539
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,800
Come on!

540
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,920
Yan Bingyun.

541
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,710
You should remember the order you've taken.

542
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,400
You can't get off the carriage

543
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,310
before arriving in Beiqi.

544
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,560
Fan Xian is cruel and mischievous.

545
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,800
If he keeps the token,

546
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,520
the Investigator's Office
as well as Nanqing will be in danger.

547
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,710
If you get off this carriage,

548
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,040
our undercover operation in Beiqi will be ruined.

549
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,230
By then,

550
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,590
you will be the one

551
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,950
who puts Nanqing in danger.

552
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,110
I won't get off the carriage.

553
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,160
You guys! Take his token for me.

554
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,040
Whoever moves will be killed immediately.

555
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,160
Let's go back.

556
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,830
That's right.

557
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,950
Go back and rest.

558
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,400
We still have a long way to go tomorrow.

559
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,560
Fan Xian, we'll meet again.

560
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
He won't be back for a minute.

561
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,120
Wait a moment!

562
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Mr. Fan!

563
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,100
It's a long way from Danzhou to the capital city.

564
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,000
=Wang Qinian, clerk of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=
It's a long way from Danzhou to the capital city.

565
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,180
=Wang Qinian, clerk of the Investigator's Office of Nanqing=

566
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,630
You must be tired.

567
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,000
Do I know you?

568
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,470
I've admired you for a long time.

569
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,150
It's a pity that I never got the chance to meet you.

570
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,600
Today we finally meet. I feel so honored.

571
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,760
Fine. Let's find a place to talk

572
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,360
some other day.

573
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,150
I'm not available today. I need to get back at once.

574
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,870
See you.

575
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,670
Wait a moment.

576
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
You want to check me?

577
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,520
Of course not.

578
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,470
I have something to show you.

579
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,760
This map

580
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,630
illustrates the scenic spots of the capital city in detail.

581
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,230
You are here for the first time.

582
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,520
It might be useful.

583
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,430
Thank you!

584
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,230
Two taels of silver will be enough.

585
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
Two taels?

586
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,430
This map

587
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,630
is made of fine paper

588
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,120
and drawn with fine brush and imperial ink.

589
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,040
I worked my heart out

590
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,120
to paint it myself

591
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,670
after carrying out repeated surveys and explorations.

592
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,360
Besides,

593
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,870
it's the last one left.

594
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,430
Only two taels of silver.

595
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,040
It won't even cover

596
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,710
the trips I've taken and the tea I've had.

597
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,080
Two taels of silver! Here you are!

598
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,470
Let's go!

599
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,710
It's more than two taels!

600
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,190
Everyone,

601
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,280
see you later.

602
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,630
Wang,

603
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,840
how many of your crappy maps have you sold?

604
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,190
Almost every young man from official families

605
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,560
who came a long way to the capital city has bought my map.

606
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,230
Aren't you afraid of being beaten up?

607
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,470
For those who are from big families, two taels of silver

608
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,600
are no big deal.

609
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,800
Moreover,

610
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,600
there're so many cunning foxes

611
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,630
in the capital city.

612
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,040
I'm also helping them grow up faster.

613
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,760
Thank you! Thank you!

614
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Why not tear it up?

615
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,280
It's two taels of silver after all.

616
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,190
Walk along this road,

617
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,040
and you'll see the Fan mansion.

618
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,560
Let's part here.

619
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,670
Are you leaving?

620
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,520
I've told you. When I arrive in the capital city,

621
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,870
I've something personal to deal with.

622
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Thanks for taking me in.

623
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,910
We'll probably never see each other again.

624
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,950
Come to me if you need anything.

625
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,080
I might be able to help.

626
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,910
You are probably unable to protect yourself.

627
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,910
If Liu Ruyu really wants to kill you,

628
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,760
I'm afraid it won't be easy for you

629
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,870
to enter the Fan mansion.

630
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,430
Please don't die.

631
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,000
Even if you die, I won't avenge on your death.

632
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,470
Thanks for your blessings.

633
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,150
Let's see how you are gonna kill me.

634
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,710
Right after the red flags pass,

635
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,910
we jump on that carriage.

636
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,520
Do you understand?

637
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,280
Yes!

638
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,950
The guards are needed elsewhere.

639
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,390
I'll escort you back home.

640
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,800
I was just told that

641
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,390
I can reach the Fan mansion by going straight.

642
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,670
Why do you make a turn?

643
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,560
A carriage turned over in front.
We have to make a detour.

644
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,360
What a coincidence!

645
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,800
Young Master, I need to answer the call of nature.

646
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,190
Please wait a moment.

647
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,670
What is this temple?

648
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,950
Get out!

649
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,840
Having overbearing vitality Qi

650
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,630
at such a young age,

651
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,760
who are you?

652
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,430
You don't know who I am?

653
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
I really don't care.

654
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,670
Someone important is praying in the divine temple.

655
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,800
No one shall enter.

656
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,320
So I'm not expected.

657
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,910
The man inside the divine temple said

658
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,600
all citizens of Nanqing can worship in the temple.

659
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,800
You can go inside.

660
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,120
But you can only enter the side palace hall,

661
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,560
not the main hall.

662
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,910
What if I don't go inside?

663
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,600
Then just leave. Cut the crap.

664
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,600
What does the temple worship?

665
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,800
Any temple for worshipping is a divine temple.

666
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,840
How could you not know that?

667
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,520
Divine temple?

668
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,000
When heaven was separated from earth,
giant monsters ran wild.

669
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,470
Master from the divine temple
came to earth with dignity and virtue,

670
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,280
teaching mankind characters and etiquette

671
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,630
and helping mankind cutting mountains and making seas,

672
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,390
thus laying foundation for the human race.

673
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,870
Haven't you learned that from your parents?

674
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,600
Mythology.

675
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,670
You really don't know who I am?

676
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,700
In the river of history,

677
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,900
time goes round and round.

678
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,260
Memories about the former and present lives

679
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,140
join each other in an endless way.

680
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,740
In the long drunken Milky Way,

681
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,460
one season follows another in a flash,

682
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,660
and the wild geese are flying south.

683
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,580
I just can't give up

684
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,580
to be with you for my whole life.

685
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,860
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

686
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,660
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

687
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,540
Year after year in the wandering,

688
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,100
I count the remaining years.

689
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,300
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

690
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,860
even though we have ended up the destiny,

691
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,540
I never feel regretful.

692
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,500
In such a chaotic world,

693
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,260
I still miss you as ever.

694
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,900
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

695
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,620
With a gentle heart,

696
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,180
I cherish our remaining years.

697
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,020
Even though we have to go through

698
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,980
all the hardships along the journey,

699
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:45,300
you always stay by my side,

700
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,060
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

701
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,980
Year after year in the wandering,

702
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,340
I count the remaining years.

703
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,700
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

704
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,500
even though we end up the destiny,

705
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,940
I never feel regretful.

706
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,860
In such a chaotic world,

707
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,820
I still miss you as ever.

708
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,500
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

709
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,260
With a gentle heart,

710
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,660
I cherish our remaining years.

711
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,460
Even though we have to go through

712
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,620
all the hardships along the journey,

713
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:25,900
you always stay by my side...
