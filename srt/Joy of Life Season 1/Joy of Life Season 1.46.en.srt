1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 46

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,480
Master Zhuang has passed away.

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,550
What?

18
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,720
He died this morning.

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,760
When he was on his deathbed, he asked me to go to his place

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
and hand these things over to you.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,590
This is a list compiled by him.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,950
He left all the books he collected

23
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,080
to you.

24
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,110
Do you know what it means?

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
It means he relies on you

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,670
as for the inheritance of literature.

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,440
He places great expectations on you.

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,100
=Poetic Genius=

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,600
Man like you who's capable of writing wonderful poems

30
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,160
shouldn't be defiled by the secular world.

31
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,630
I can't bear to see

32
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,440
these excellent poems covered by dust.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,000
Actually, I just saw him twice.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,390
As for the inheritance of literature, it's all about the spirit.

35
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
His last words are

36
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,520
that you should follow your heart.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,030
He also said...

38
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,630
I've been living a happy life.

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,800
I've never felt wronged

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,550
or cheated myself.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Your Excellency Fan,

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,550
I hope it's the same case for you.

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,750
Live a happy life.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,030
Be happy.

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Happy.

46
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,750
Happy.

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
Happy.

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,630
In my lifetime,

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,390
I've annotated numerous books

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,960
and written many articles.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,880
But my experience is

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
what I feel most proud of.

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,600
I must go too.

54
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,160
I think

55
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,600
we'll see each other again.

56
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,230
Lili is also here.

57
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,000
Where?

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Stop looking.

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,390
She's staying where she can see you.

60
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,320
Biejie.

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
"Please don't"?
('Biejie' sounds like 'Please don't' in Chinese)

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,160
What a weird name.

63
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,640
Go! Hurry!

64
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
Mr. Yan!

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
Leave here now.

66
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,550
My brother wants to kill all of you.

67
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,110
Leave here before it's too late.

68
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,040
Go!

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,920
Brother!

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,600
For the sake of our country, kill all the Nanqing people.

71
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,640
Is Shen Zhong crazy?

72
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,640
The Imperial Guards are also here.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,880
They're here to protect Lili.

74
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,440
I know about your wounds most.

75
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,760
Brother!

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,160
Go.

77
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,000
Hurry up.

78
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,510
Go!

79
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,830
Don't be afraid.

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
You won't die.

81
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,600
I'll save you.

82
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,790
You won't die.

83
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,150
Heaven wants to destroy Beiqi!

84
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,670
Fan Xian.

85
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,670
Don't move!

86
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
A large number of goods in Neiku have been smuggled.

87
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,550
Actually, I've paid attention to that.

88
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,710
But the money

89
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,760
has been transferred

90
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,520
to the biggest family of Nanqing,

91
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,030
the Ming family.

92
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,400
The Ming family?

93
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,840
This family

94
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,880
works for the Second Prince and Li Yunrui.

95
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,840
No.

96
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,320
Li Yunrui has been supporting the Crown Prince.

97
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,640
You're fooled.

98
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,470
Oh. Fan Xian,

99
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,470
I've left you a present.

100
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,710
Why did you tell me about it suddenly?

101
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,320
I want to exchange it

102
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,590
for my sister's life.

103
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,710
To be honest,

104
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,320
I really want to

105
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,670
kill you and Yan Bingyun.

106
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,880
I know.

107
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,200
The odds are against us.

108
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,030
When the Imperial Guards showed up,

109
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,670
I made a choice.

110
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,520
I didn't stop

111
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,640
when my sister stood in the way,

112
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,910
but she's not fatally injured.

113
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,470
Only by doing that

114
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,760
can I give her a chance to survive.

115
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,760
I'll die, anyway,

116
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,150
but I'm afraid

117
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,200
life will be harder for her

118
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,880
if she stays in Beiqi alone.

119
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,150
Your Excellency Fan,

120
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,550
please take my sister to Nanqing.

121
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,550
I promise.

122
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,910
Your Excellency Shen,

123
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,200
you can leave with us.

124
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,230
None of the Embroidered Uniform Guards of Beiqi

125
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,110
has ever chosen to give in to the enemy.

126
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Take him back

127
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,670
and wait for His Majesty's orders.

128
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,110
-Go. -Go.

129
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,440
Go.

130
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,080
Go.

131
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,520
-Go. -Go. Go.

132
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,150
If it hadn't been for Lili,

133
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,910
the majority of you

134
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,000
would've been killed here.

135
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,150
Remember what she did for you.

136
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,110
I'll pretend not to see her.

137
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,640
Hide her in the cart and take her back.

138
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,350
Now we really have to say goodbye.

139
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,880
But I always think

140
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
we'll see each other again.

141
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,320
There you are.

142
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,670
A lot of people are anxious about

143
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,200
the possibility of your staging a comeback.

144
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,080
It just proves they're afraid of you.

145
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,230
It's not easy

146
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,710
to rise from the ashes.

147
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
So,

148
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,110
if I kill you at this moment,

149
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
nobody would feel pity for you.

150
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The Empress Dowager would just scold you

151
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,840
when she knows about it.

152
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,790
She may not punish you at all.

153
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,150
Did you force my subordinates

154
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,960
to kill themselves?

155
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,590
Yes.

156
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,080
Was my adoptive father killed by you?

157
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,230
Exactly.

158
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,000
That is

159
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,150
why I'll kill you!

160
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,470
I know.

161
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,400
Grand General,

162
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,760
His Majesty hasn't issued an imperial edict.

163
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,710
It's snowing.

164
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Go to hell!

165
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,800
This is

166
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,560
my revenge.

167
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,000
Lady Shen's wound is nothing serious,

168
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,350
but she hasn't come round.

169
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
You don't need to tell me anything about her.

170
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,710
But I saw you hold her in your arms.

171
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,880
She's a Beiqi person.

172
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,070
Not anymore.

173
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,070
Someone said

174
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,830
people who have feelings

175
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,280
and know about his love

176
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,230
are stronger

177
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,040
than those who are cold and ruthless.

178
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,830
Don't you have anything to say?

179
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,590
Now that you know

180
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,470
it was the Second Prince that tried to kill you,

181
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,920
what will you do?

182
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,160
I'll ask him why he did that

183
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,590
when I go back.

184
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,710
Once you ask him this question,

185
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,920
there'll be no turning back.

186
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,830
He wants to kill me.

187
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,680
How can I pretend not to know about it?

188
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Your opponent is a prince.

189
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Do you think the odds are in your favor?

190
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,350
I don't care about the odds.

191
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,710
What do you care about?

192
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,950
I have to fight back now that he wants to kill me.

193
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,520
Only in this way can I live a happy life.

194
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Will you help me

195
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,280
when we go back to the capital city?

196
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,800
You can think about it

197
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,710
on the way.

198
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,190
No matter if you decide

199
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,310
to help me

200
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,950
or to support the Second Prince,

201
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,110
you have to make a choice

202
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,640
since you've known the truth.

203
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,830
I'll wait for your reply.

204
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,880
I've never been into you.

205
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
I know.

206
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,880
I tried to hate you,

207
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,880
but I still don't have the heart
to see you be tortured like this.

208
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,310
I've never loved you.

209
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,590
Go.

210
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,710
Hurry up.

211
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,070
Go!

212
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,950
What's up?

213
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,520
Someone is around.

214
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,590
Where?

215
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,310
Your Excellency,

216
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,830
I'm bad at everything else

217
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,040
except the art of

218
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,800
tracking.

219
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,520
Your Excellency, you know that.

220
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm sure

221
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,680
someone is watching us out there.

222
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Come on. Have a cake.

223
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,880
Your Excellency, the cakes are for you.

224
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
What are you looking at?

225
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,710
Who is it?

226
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,590
Xie Bi'an?

227
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,470
Mr. Yan.

228
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,920
What's up?

229
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,800
His Excellency Fan wants to see you.

230
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,230
Xie Bi'an is here.

231
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,430
The swordsman that works for the Second Prince?

232
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,950
Exactly.

233
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,430
Where is he?

234
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
I let him go have a rest.

235
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,400
Is he here to deliver a letter?

236
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,070
Yeah.

237
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,950
He wanted us to open it at the same time.

238
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,470
It's for you.

239
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,880
Let's treat the letter like face-to-face conversation.

240
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,400
I miss you since you left the capital city.

241
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,560
I know myself well enough.

242
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,470
You know,

243
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,560
I'm a little lazy.

244
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,590
I hate to beat around the bush.

245
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,310
So, let's get straight to the point.

246
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,560
Fan Xian,

247
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,520
you must've known

248
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,400
what I did in Shangjing.

249
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,830
Let me put it this way.

250
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,110
In this world,

251
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,040
it's the most difficult thing to be an emperor's son.

252
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
Conflicts also take place among men in other families,

253
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,880
but as a loser, they'll just lose bright futures,

254
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,040
lose family property

255
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,560
or lose face.

256
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,110
If I lose,

257
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,230
I'll die.

258
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,710
So, I've done all those things

259
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,190
to survive.

260
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,160
I hope you can understand.

261
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,230
You must've guessed

262
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
the one you fought

263
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,950
is on my side.

264
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,880
I have to admit

265
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,760
what happened to you

266
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,160
was caused by me.

267
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,230
I don't have much choice.

268
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,280
Please forgive me.

269
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,310
However, to be honest,

270
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,560
I think really highly of you.

271
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,310
A man shouldn't live in the past.

272
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,230
If you forgive and forget,

273
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,760
I swear

274
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,230
I'll make you

275
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,400
the most powerful minister in Nanqing.

276
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,830
Since then, the Fan family

277
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,230
will be the No.1 family in Nanqing.

278
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
I've heard you dream of

279
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,560
living a life without worry.

280
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I can help you do that.

281
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,880
You have my word.

282
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,350
I asked Xie Bi'an

283
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,470
to take you a gift.

284
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,230
I hope you can feel

285
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,470
my great sincerity

286
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,400
and agree to give me a helping hand.

287
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,310
What did he write in the letter?

288
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,190
Tell me about yours first.

289
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,310
He promised to give me a high position with a high salary.

290
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,590
In a word, he hopes I can forgive and forget.

291
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,310
He said everything that should be said,

292
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,760
but no details have been given.

293
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,800
There is even no signature.

294
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,950
It can't be used as evidence.

295
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,950
He's cunning.

296
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,880
A life without worry?

297
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,230
Yep.

298
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,160
You know,

299
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm not ambitious.

300
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,470
I just want to live a rich, cozy life.

301
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,280
I have no desire to go further ahead.
All I want is to live quietly.

302
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,280
Then you should say yes.

303
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,070
I'd like to,

304
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,880
but those who died

305
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,000
hold me by the corner of my clothing.

306
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,470
I want to keep them quiet.

307
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,680
I want to let them loosen their grip.

308
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,470
You don't want to reach a compromise?

309
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,430
Everyone has to be responsible

310
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,800
for the consequences of his choices in life.

311
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,400
He'll be rewarded if he does things right.

312
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,310
He'll be punished

313
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,800
if he does things wrong.

314
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,230
If a thing happens

315
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,400
and the consequences are ignored,

316
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
I'll be resentful.

317
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,800
If I'm resentful,

318
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,950
how could I live a happy life?

319
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,000
How about you?

320
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,830
What did he write in the letter to you?

321
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,430
He asked me to understand something.

322
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,830
If the truth is exposed,

323
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,560
he'll do all he can to revolt.

324
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
By then,

325
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,280
disturbances are bound to happen in Nanqing.

326
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,280
So what?

327
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,520
Everything the Investigator's Office has done

328
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,310
aims to prevent Nanqing

329
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,190
from falling into turmoil.

330
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,310
That's also my duty as long as I live.

331
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,070
Will you tolerate corruption

332
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,310
to prevent turmoil?

333
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,470
I need more time to think about it.

334
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
He said he's got me a gift.

335
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
How about looking at it with me?

336
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,350
Your Excellency.

337
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,430
Where is Wang?

338
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,470
He's arranging with the mission.

339
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
He said it's safer not to let too many people

340
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,590
know about what's happening here.

341
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,800
Wang Qinian is considerate.

342
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,800
Yeah.

343
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,350
Mr. Yan, you had a narrow escape from death.

344
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
Congratulations.

345
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,350
I have a question for you.

346
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,230
Please go ahead.

347
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,830
When did the Second Prince know about

348
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,000
what the mission had done in Shangjing?

349
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,830
The two places are thousands of miles apart
and it's inconvenient to communicate,

350
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,350
so His Highness didn't know

351
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,110
what the mission had done in Shangjing.

352
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,400
So why did he ask you

353
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,040
to send us such a letter?

354
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,640
Because His Highness believes in His Excellency Fan.

355
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,800
On the day when you left the capital city,

356
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,190
His Highness said that

357
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,470
you'd find out the truth

358
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,350
about what happened in Shangjing.

359
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,470
When you go back,

360
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,590
tell him that I believe his sincerity.

361
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,800
But I'm narrow-minded.

362
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,430
I won't forgive him.

363
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,070
His Highness asked you

364
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,230
to accept his gift.

365
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,920
He said

366
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,430
you lost a guard

367
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,680
and he should do something to make it up.

368
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,040
That kid will

369
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,000
learn from the best teacher

370
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,830
and have the brightest future.

371
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,950
His Highness asked you

372
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,920
to trust him.

373
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,310
Moreover,

374
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,040
there is more than one layer in the box.

375
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,430
Please look at the stamp.

376
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,560
Danbo Bookstore.

377
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,470
Your brother is my good buddy.

378
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,800
Of course I'll give you more chances.

379
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,760
Do you mean

380
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,040
there is something else I can do

381
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,920
to make more money besides running a bookstore?

382
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,560
It'll let you make a fortune.

383
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,470
His Highness said

384
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,830
Fan Sizhe is pure and cute

385
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,590
and he's a likeable guy.

386
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,950
Fan Sizhe is a legitimate child

387
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,160
and I'm a bastard son.

388
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,350
Do you think I'm getting well along with him?

389
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,070
His Highness said

390
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,830
you look cynical and

391
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,830
act weird at ordinary times,

392
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,160
but by nature,

393
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,760
you care about your family and friends.

394
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,000
He said

395
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,160
he couldn't get it wrong.

396
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,800
He's quite confident.

397
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,350
The box has three layers in total.

398
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,310
I've been observing your hands.

399
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,590
I've measured your hand size in secret.

400
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,710
Okay. I like it.

401
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,920
How could you

402
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
catch Fei Jie?

403
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,920
Mr. Fei is an expert on poisons and poisoning.

404
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,070
Of course we couldn't catch him.

405
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,950
But everyone

406
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,470
has a soft spot.

407
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,840
Really?

408
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,470
I don't know

409
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,870
what his soft spot is.

410
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,910
Your Excellency Fan,

411
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,470
you're Mr. Fei's soft spot.

412
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,630
Mr. Fei.

413
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,320
Is it taken there?

414
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,280
Yeah.

415
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,080
I asked Xie Bi'an

416
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,840
to rush there

417
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,600
with your gloves.

418
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,630
I hope Fan Xian will believe my sincerity

419
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,670
when he sees the gloves.

420
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,000
If he's in trouble,

421
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,230
shouldn't I go there personally?

422
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,470
Mr. Fei.

423
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,670
As Director of the Third Division of the Investigator's Office,

424
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,190
you're always under the watchful eyes of many people.

425
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,080
If you leave the capital city just like that,

426
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,000
it'll be hard to explain it to His Majesty.

427
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,120
But don't worry.

428
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,360
It's just some trivial matters

429
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,230
about the handover of the mission.

430
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,390
I've sent guys there

431
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,560
to give him a helping hand.

432
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,150
I'm sure Fan Xian will be back safe and sound.

433
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,230
Why did you do that?

434
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,430
Because I find a kindred spirit in him.

435
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,710
As soon as you get anything about him,

436
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,630
just let me know.

437
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
You can count on me, Mr. Fei.

438
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll come to you again.

439
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,120
Is this a threat?

440
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,840
His Highness treats Fan Xian as a good friend.

441
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,840
Of course he wants to

442
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,950
take care of people around him.

443
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,840
What if I don't agree to support him?

444
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,710
His Highness has been making preparations.

445
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,190
He's got lots of money

446
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,360
and some troops.

447
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,870
They'll be here tomorrow

448
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,040
to protect you on your way back.

449
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,950
Do you think how many soldiers you need

450
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,120
to kill me?

451
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,430
His Highness also wants to know

452
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,390
how many people need to die

453
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,670
before you regret

454
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,390
having made a wrong decision.

455
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,120
I'll come here again tomorrow.

456
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,800
I hope you can

457
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,800
give His Highness

458
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,840
a clear-cut answer by then.

459
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,840
If you say yes,

460
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,600
I'll protect you and make sure you go back safe and sound.

461
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,390
If not,

462
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
I'll kill you.

463
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,430
Your Excellency.

464
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,150
Sometimes, if you take a step back,

465
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,870
you'll save all their lives

466
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,670
and have a bright future.

467
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,630
Do you still think

468
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,710
you have a choice?

469
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,870
I want to have a try.

470
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,520
How about you?

471
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,600
Have you made your choice?

472
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,950
What time is it?

473
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,150
No idea.

474
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,120
It's not early, anyway.

475
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,360
Gao Da!

476
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,470
Form up and get ready to hit the road.

477
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,710
That's right.

478
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,950
I'm here to see you off.

479
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,000
You've thought about it for a night.

480
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,190
What's your choice?

481
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,000
Fan Sizhe is the legitimate child of the Fan family.

482
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,710
If he dies,

483
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,630
my father won't leave it at that.

484
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,470
Mr. Fei serves as Director of the Third Division
of the Investigator's Office.

485
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,630
If he dies,

486
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,520
the Investigator's Office won't let it go at that.

487
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,150
He doesn't dare

488
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,840
to kill the two of them.

489
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:25,910
So, what on earth

490
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,910
is your choice?

491
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,280
It's not about my choice,

492
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,150
but yours.

493
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,150
You can

494
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,670
kill all of us here!

495
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,670
Then after you go back,

496
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,360
all of you will be considered betrayers of Nanqing.

497
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,230
Your family will get into trouble

498
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,320
and you'll never rise again.

499
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,870
If you don't,

500
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,710
you'll have to helplessly watch me

501
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,080
go back.

502
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,280
As for the things he asked you to take to me,

503
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,630
I'll give them back to him one by one.

504
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,390
If anything happens to

505
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,230
Teng Zijing's son,

506
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,760
I'll let him pay with his life.

507
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,040
Ask him

508
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,670
if he dares to take such a big risk

509
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,470
because of a kid.

510
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,840
And ask yourself

511
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,600
if you're sure

512
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,280
you can kill me.

513
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,710
Your Excellency!

514
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,080
This is my choice.

515
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,560
Everything the Investigator's Office has done

516
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,870
aims to prevent Nanqing

517
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,000
from falling into turmoil.

518
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,120
That's also my duty as long as I live.

519
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,710
Is he dead?

520
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,910
Is that the end of it?

521
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,080
Of course not.

522
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,260
Take the bull by the horns and die to survive.

523
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,420
It is dedicated to all ordinary but brave people in the world.

524
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,540
It's you who make the world warmer with your love and hope.

525
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,580
The story never ends.
Looking forward to the coming year and seeing you again!

526
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,580
The end of Season 1

527
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,420
In the river of history,

528
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,620
time goes round and round.

529
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,980
Memories about the former and present lives

530
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,860
join each other in an endless way.

531
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,460
In the long drunken Milky Way,

532
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,180
one season follows another in a flash,

533
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,380
and the wild geese are flying south.

534
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,300
I just can't give up

535
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,300
to be with you for my whole life.

536
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,580
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

537
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

538
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,260
Year after year in the wandering,

539
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,820
I count the remaining years.

540
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,020
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

541
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,580
even though we have ended up the destiny,

542
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,260
I never feel regretful.

543
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,220
In such a chaotic world,

544
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,980
I still miss you as ever.

545
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,620
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

546
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,340
With a gentle heart,

547
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,900
I cherish our remaining years.

548
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,740
Even though we have to go through

549
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,700
all the hardships along the journey,

550
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:04,020
you always stay by my side,

551
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,780
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

552
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,700
Year after year in the wandering,

553
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,060
I count the remaining years.

554
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,420
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

555
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,220
even though we end up the destiny,

556
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,660
I never feel regretful.

557
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,580
In such a chaotic world,

558
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,540
I still miss you as ever.

559
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,220
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

560
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,980
With a gentle heart,

561
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,380
I cherish our remaining years.

562
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,180
Even though we have to go through

563
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,340
all the hardships along the journey,

564
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:44,620
you always stay by my side...
