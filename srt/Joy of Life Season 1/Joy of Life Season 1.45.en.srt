1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 45

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,830
She's in the imperial palace.

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,600
Who?

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,750
Si Lili.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,190
How dare you mention her?

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm about to settle the score with you.

21
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,910
I'm the envoy of Nanqing,

22
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,000
and she belongs to His...

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,160
She likes you.

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
I have to help her.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,600
His Majesty is your little nephew.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,030
But Lili is my sister.

27
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,360
What a messy relationship!

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,190
She just wanted to talk to you before
going into the imperial palace.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
She didn't ask you to marry her.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,550
Why do you panic?

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,080
How's she now?

32
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,910
She's learning etiquette

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,550
and getting ready to meet His Majesty
in the imperial palace at any time.

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,630
I'm afraid

35
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,080
you won't be able to see her again.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
I don't want to see her.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,190
To you,

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,190
it was

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,110
just a talk.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
But to Lili,

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,880
she drifted along all her life

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,000
struggling for survival.

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,470
A talk with you

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,670
might be one of

45
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,190
her few good memories.

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,910
If you still feel angry,

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,080
don't blame her but me.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,190
Your Majesty, happy birthday! May
you live as long as the Heaven!

49
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,240
May you live a thousand of years!

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,110
Thank you for your

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,550
best wishes.

52
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,630
Please!

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,270
Take your seats.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,030
Let's eat!

56
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,440
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager! Your Majesty the Emperor!

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,910
I'm Langtao.

58
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,390
I'd like to compete

59
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,960
with His Excellency Fan from Nanqing,

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
so as to add fun to the birthday celebration.

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,110
Mr. Fan, do you want to compete with him?

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,040
Your Majesty,

63
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,670
I'm willing to

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,790
admit defeat.

65
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,040
No need to compete.

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,000
Then,

67
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,110
so be it.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,670
Your Excellency,

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
are you admitting that Nanqing is weak

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,480
without competent martial arts masters?

71
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,790
I admit defeat for myself.

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,600
It has nothing to do with Nanqing.

73
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,760
Didn't you remain undefeated

74
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,950
in front of your residence?

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,200
After entering Shangjing,

76
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
didn't you keep the flag unharmed on
your way to the imperial palace?

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,550
How come you chicken out

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,790
in front of me?

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,070
Is it because the Nanqing martial arts masters

80
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,640
all tend to bully the weak and fear the strong?

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I won't force you.

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,550
As long as you admit that

83
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,200
martial arts masters from Nanqing are weak and coward,

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,110
I can let you off.

85
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,230
Then let's fight.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,230
I have something to say.

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,270
Senior, let me fight him instead.

88
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,200
Why?

89
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm the Saintess of Beiqi,

90
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,110
but he talked wildly,

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,350
on the Hall, saying that

92
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,070
he fell in love with me at first sight.

93
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,270
He must be good

94
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,510
at martial arts.

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,230
Today, I want to see

96
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,350
how deeply

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,390
he loves me.

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
Your Majesty, I beg your approval.

99
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,510
Langtao, back off.

100
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,040
Will you fight me?

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,350
Of course. Why not?

102
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
What weapon will you use?

103
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,760
Sword.

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
His Excellency once fought a Ninth Dan martial arts master,

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,200
and he's also the poetic genius sent from Heaven.

106
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,830
Haitang is the Saintess of Beiqi

107
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,200
and the youngest martial arts master above the Ninth Dan.

108
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,320
Among the younger generation,

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,670
the most famous two

110
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,200
are finally competing for victory!

111
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Wang,

112
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,670
why aren't you excited?

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,070
This fight

114
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,670
won't be exciting to watch.

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,110
How do you know?

116
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,510
Just wait and see.

117
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,320
Why don't they fight seriously?

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Just think about it.

119
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,040
Come closer! Come closer! Come closer!

120
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,110
What's the relationship

121
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,270
between Miss Duoduo

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,110
and His Excellency?

123
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,350
It's...

124
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,110
What is it?

125
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,670
They're intimate.

126
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,550
How can they fight each other seriously?

127
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,550
But Miss Duoduo is not to blame.

128
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,150
Look at His Excellency.

129
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,710
He's adept with both the pen and the sword.

130
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,230
How can any girl not like him?

131
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,230
I just feel sorry for Beiqi.

132
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,960
They've only cultivated

133
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,110
one Saintess for so many years,

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,960
but she falls for

135
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,400
His Excellency.

136
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,150
Are you fighting

137
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,550
or dancing?

138
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,230
It's Her Majesty's birthday.

139
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,470
What are you doing?

140
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,440
Are you cheating Her Majesty?

141
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,150
Saintess, your martial arts skills are really amazing.

142
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,910
I really admire you.

143
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,710
Your Excellency, you're really resourceful.

144
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,030
I fail to control my strength

145
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,280
when fighting with a real competitor.

146
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,710
I didn't mean to hurt this minister.

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,710
I'm really sorry.

148
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,790
Your Majesty,

149
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
our fight ends in a tie.

150
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,150
Good! Good! Good!

151
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,670
On such an auspicious day,

152
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,550
a tie is the best.

153
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,280
That fight was really beautiful.

154
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,710
So auspicious!

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,590
I like it.

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,350
When we see the princess back home,

157
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,550
we must say

158
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,550
they fought each other relentlessly

159
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,590
with blood all over their faces.

160
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,760
Why?

161
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,200
Otherwise, I'm afraid it might be hard

162
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,110
for His Excellency to explain.

163
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

164
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,150
Right! Right!

165
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,910
Wang,

166
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,030
you're really foresighted!

167
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
I really admire you.

168
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,790
Wang, I've learned a lot

169
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,400
by your side these days.

170
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,710
Wang,

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
I even feel

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,710
I've become much cleverer

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,030
these days.

174
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,790
But you must know how far to go and when to stop.

175
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,440
you can't

176
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,840
outsmart His Excellency.

177
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,400
I know that.

178
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,030
Wang,

179
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,440
let's restrain our talents.

180
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
Fan Xian,

181
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,840
I heard after going back to Nanqing,

182
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,590
you'll take over the financial power of Neiku.

183
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
After that,

184
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,590
Embroidered Uniform Guards

185
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,790
will do business with your branch on behalf of Beiqi.

186
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,840
I see.

187
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,080
Wait!

188
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,230
Your Majesty,

189
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,590
I find it inappropriate.

190
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,710
We'd better consider carefully before making the decision.

191
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,910
Commander Shen,

192
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,110
I've thought it

193
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,030
through.

194
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,840
It can only benefit Beiqi.

195
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,520
Nothing is inappropriate.

196
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,280
Fan Xian is too cunning to trust.

197
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,400
Your Majesty, please think twice.

198
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,150
Your Majesty,

199
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,790
I have something to report.

200
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,000
I originally intended to hold it after the birthday celebration,

201
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,280
but since Shen Zhong is too arrogant,

202
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,590
I can't tolerate it anymore.

203
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,640
Tell me about it.

204
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,670
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of

205
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,960
Embroidered Uniform Guards,

206
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,960
is suspected of colluding with the Investigator's Office

207
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,080
to sell military information.

208
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,520
Treacherous as he is, he should be punished.

209
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Your Majesty, please be perceptive and perspicacious.

210
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Having controlled Embroidered Uniform Guards for so many years,

211
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,760
Shen Zhong is loyal to Beiqi all the time.

212
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,910
By accusing him of treason,

213
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,790
you'd better not talk recklessly.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,230
I have evidence.

215
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,400
What evidence?

216
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,960
Our war against Nanqing

217
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,840
was started by mistake,

218
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,590
but we suffered great losses.

219
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,710
After all, we lost because

220
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,030
our military information was leaked.

221
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,400
Yan Bingyun from the Investigator's Office
pried into information in Shangjing

222
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,640
and leaked the military information.

223
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,030
Everyone here

224
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,000
must have known about this.

225
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,760
But what you don't know is that

226
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,030
after coming to Shangjing,

227
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,790
Yan Bingyun and Lady Shen fell in love

228
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,110
and often saw each other in private.

229
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,710
It's pretty obvious as to

230
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,110
who leaked the military information.

231
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,350
Nonsense!

232
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,590
Yan Bingyun and Lady Shen

233
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,640
were intimate with each other.

234
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,440
Many people can prove that.

235
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,280
What's more,

236
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,590
when Yan Bingyun was caught,

237
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,350
Lady Shen visited him many times.

238
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,200
Their love was true.

239
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Additionally, when Fan Xian

240
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,790
tried to rescue Yan Bingyun,

241
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,000
Lady Shen was the one

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
who led the way.

243
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,590
Many officers from Embroidered Uniform Guards saw that.

244
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,280
Your Excellency Shen,

245
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,760
do you still want to deny it?

246
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,150
She was deceived by Yan Bingyun.

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,910
Your Majesty,

248
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,790
I've never told my family

249
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,910
about military information.

250
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,760
Yan Bingyun couldn't have

251
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,400
got information from her.

252
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,590
Having told her or not,

253
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,000
you know it better than me.

254
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,470
Your Majesty,

255
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,470
my loyalty to Beiqi

256
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,470
is without question.

257
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,880
The frontier forces were defeated repeatedly,

258
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,790
and His Excellency Shen,

259
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,550
knew the military deployment very well.

260
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,230
Your Excellency,

261
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,670
your sister and you

262
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,640
are really suspicious.

263
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,110
Your Majesty, though I'm not capable,

264
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,280
I know

265
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm a citizen of Beiqi.

266
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,110
I would never betray my country.

267
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,880
I know

268
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,470
Shen Zhong is loyal.

269
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,960
His Excellency Shen may be loyal,

270
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,670
but his sister...

271
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,400
I suggest

272
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,710
sending Lady Shen to prison

273
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,230
and using cruel torture to find out the truth.

274
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,680
Your Majesty,

275
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,520
though my sister

276
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,110
was blinded by love,

277
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,590
she would never

278
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,230
betray our country.

279
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,230
Your Majesty, please be perceptive and perspicacious.

280
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,680
Your Majesty, what do you think?

281
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,350
Mother, it's up to you.

282
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,310
Loyal and brave all the time,

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,520
Commander Shen has rendered many meritorious services to Beiqi.

284
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,110
It's inappropriate

285
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,680
to humiliate a meritorious minister.

286
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,830
But there's something

287
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,160
suspicious about it.

288
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,160
Even if your sister

289
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,520
didn't leak the secrets,

290
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,040
Shen Zhong, you're to blame for not teaching her

291
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,880
properly.

292
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,560
You can still be the Commander-in-Chief,

293
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,590
but the python pattern on your robe

294
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,520
should be removed.

295
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,430
Her Majesty has given the order.

296
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,040
What're you waiting for?

297
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,920
You killed my personal guards

298
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,350
and my adoptive father.

299
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,880
Have you ever thought this would happen to you?

300
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,350
Fan Xian.

301
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,430
Yes.

302
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,110
The business between Neiku

303
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,830
and Embroidered Uniform Guards

304
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,470
is settled.

305
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,160
After returning to Nanqing,

306
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,070
you should arrange it as soon as possible.

307
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,950
I see.

308
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,800
Your Majesty.

309
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,590
I still find it inappropriate.

310
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,190
Commander Shen is excited and indignant.

311
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,950
It's not appropriate for him to discuss government affairs.

312
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,400
Send him back

313
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,040
for a few days' rest.

314
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,590
Your Majesty,

315
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,830
whatever I say,

316
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,400
I say it for the benefits of Beiqi.

317
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,310
I'm selfless, Your Majesty!

318
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
You're selfless.

319
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,350
Are you suggesting we are selfish?

320
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,000
Her Majesty decides to do business with Neiku.

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,040
Is Her Majesty

322
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,190
selfish?

323
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,160
Take him away.

324
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,920
The traitor will endanger our country! Your Majesty, think twice!

325
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,310
The traitor will endanger our country! Your Majesty, think twice!

326
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,560
The traitor will endanger our country! Your Majesty, think twice!

327
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,230
The traitor will endanger our country!

328
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,950
Mr. Fan, when will you leave?

329
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,110
Your Majesty, I'll leave tomorrow.

330
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,000
After parting this time,

331
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,070
I wonder when we can meet again.

332
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,520
Mr. Fan, you should

333
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,000
spend more time writing your book.

334
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm still waiting for the following chapters.

335
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

336
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,430
Making a man like Shen Zhong

337
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,760
lose all his authority

338
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,920
in such a short time,

339
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,230
Your Excellency, you're really amazing!

340
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,230
However,

341
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,520
he's still the Commander-in-Chief.

342
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,190
He won't hold the position for long.

343
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
Others will take over his power when he falls into disgrace.

344
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
It's only a matter of time.

345
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,880
It's a bit too fast.

346
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,470
Your Excellency, what's your concern?

347
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,350
Though we've taken down Shen Zhong,

348
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,830
we still haven't got

349
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,040
the name of

350
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,470
the smuggler.

351
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,920
Your Excellency!

352
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,680
Your Excellency, Shangshan Hu is here.

353
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,350
He wants to see you.

354
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,520
Where's the body of my adoptive father?

355
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
There's a cave on the cliff.

356
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,920
Was he buried inside?

357
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,950
I didn't bury him under the ground.

358
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
He said in his last wish that

359
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,710
after being locked up

360
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,800
deep in the dungeon for decades,

361
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,640
he was scared of the darkness under the ground.

362
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,400
He wanted to rest in the light.

363
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,710
Tell me the exact place.

364
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,680
I've written it for you.

365
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,590
I was intended to kill you

366
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,280
before you leave Shangjing.

367
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,560
I'll leave tomorrow.

368
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,040
You'd better hurry.

369
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,190
Given that you've disposed of my adoptive father's body,

370
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,800
I'll spare your life this time.

371
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,110
Fan Xian,

372
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,000
after my mourning period,

373
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,880
I'll go to Nanqing in person

374
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,800
to take your life.

375
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,280
I'll wait for you.

376
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,830
Gao Da.

377
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,680
Your Excellency.

378
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,560
Ask Haitang Duoduo

379
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,470
over.

380
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,590
What's wrong?

381
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,760
Your Excellency, there are many people in the mission.

382
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,160
It's easier for the princess to find out.

383
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,590
Please be cautious.

384
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,070
Hurry up and go!

385
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,310
Stop hanging out with Wang Qinian.

386
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,430
I...

387
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,470
What?

388
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,640
Your Majesty,

389
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,280
I've passed on your order

390
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,070
in advance.

391
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,040
Those who are loyal to you

392
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,560
in different ministries

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
all know that

394
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,000
we'll deal with Shen Zhong today.

395
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,680
For those who want to help Shen Zhong out of old friendships,

396
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,070
some are controlled

397
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,560
and some are sent away from the capital.

398
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,710
With my followers

399
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,400
and my mother's followers

400
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
working together,

401
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,000
Shen Zhong stands no chance.

402
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,590
He Daoren goes to see Fan Xian secretly.

403
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,280
Guo Baokun is the nominal Chief.

404
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,190
He Daoren is the actual future

405
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,400
Chief of secret agents in Shangjing Town.

406
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,430
After I leave,

407
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,710
you should take charge of the intelligence
network in Shangjing Town.

408
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,680
I'll try my best.

409
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,640
Take it easy.

410
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,070
After our smuggling business expands,

411
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,310
we can buy information

412
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,680
openly.

413
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,640
It won't be long

414
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,470
before secret agents can live a safe life.

415
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,920
What else do you want to tell me?

416
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,800
I can't stay long

417
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,640
for fear that I might be discovered.

418
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,950
Nothing else.

419
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,590
No need to see me before I leave.

420
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,230
Protect yourself. Don't be discovered.

421
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,760
Your Majesty, since you've known

422
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,310
He Daoren is a secret agent of Nanqing,

423
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,230
why not catch him?

424
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,310
What can we get

425
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,190
by catching him?

426
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,280
Sometimes, enemies can

427
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,710
do things for us.

428
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,590
Look at the situation now.

429
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,640
Shen Zhong has no future.

430
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,230
Now we don't have to fight him.

431
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,760
So why not use our enemies?

432
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,800
But now,

433
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,230
He Daoren is useless

434
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,230
after defeating Shen Zhong.

435
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,950
No hurry.

436
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,070
By keeping He Daoren,

437
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,830
Nanqing can only

438
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,760
get the information

439
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,230
we want them to get.

440
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,000
Your Majesty, you want to use He Daoren

441
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,110
to sow distrust among our enemies.

442
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,470
But Her Majesty

443
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,470
has got Shangshan Hu.

444
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,950
Mother will never send Shangshan Hu

445
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,070
back to the army.

446
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
From now on,

447
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,230
that tiger is useless.

448
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm afraid Fan Xian

449
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,190
will become a formidable enemy of Beiqi.

450
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,230
Fan Xian will never be our enemy.

451
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,070
Remember that

452
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,160
the biggest enemy

453
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,230
always comes from within.

454
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,310
Those princes from Nanqing

455
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,760
are all hard to deal with.

456
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,470
Fan Xian still has

457
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,680
a long way to go in future.

458
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,100
=Poetic Genius=

459
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,590
You're leaving.

460
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,310
Why ask me over?

461
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,520
I want to see someone.

462
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Si Lili can't see you for sure.

463
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,230
It's Zhuang Mohan.

464
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,830
Didn't he spit blood

465
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,070
after being pissed by you?

466
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,880
You still can't let him go?

467
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,590
I was entrusted by someone to send him a message.

468
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,280
Why do you ask me for help?

469
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
You can see him yourself.

470
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,430
I don't want others

471
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,400
to know about it.

472
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,070
What about me?

473
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,590
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

474
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,800
The green leaves are fresh but the red flowers are fading!"

475
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,830
You're crabapple blossoms.

476
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,640
You're no mortal.

477
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,640
You're smooth-tongued

478
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,800
when asking for help.

479
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,560
Do me a favor.

480
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,190
I assure you

481
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,470
it won't harm Beiqi.

482
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,710
Nor will I scold him.

483
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,710
Master Zhuang.

484
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,900
=Zhuang Mohan, Beiqi Litterateur=

485
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,230
No need to stand up.

486
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,950
Fine.

487
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,160
Take a seat! Take a seat! Take a seat!

488
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,160
Look!

489
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,350
The line "One who has seen the ocean
thinks nothing of mere rivers.

490
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,590
One who has appreciated the clouds over the
Wushan Mountain sees nothing of mere clouds."

491
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,400
has beautiful diction and neat antithesis.

492
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,590
But without knowing the context of the latter sentence,

493
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,800
it doesn't make any sense.

494
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,830
It really doesn't make any sense.

495
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,110
Wushan Mountain is a holy mountain in the far south.

496
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,760
This mountain is renowned for its unparalleled cloudscape.

497
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,520
The latter sentence uses its name

498
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,430
to express the loyalty in love.

499
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,760
I see.

500
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,800
I've checked many books,

501
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,040
but I just couldn't find Wushan Mountain.

502
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,310
Luckily, you explained it to me.

503
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,520
Are you annotating the poetry collection?

504
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,280
Yes.

505
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,110
I have another question.

506
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,760
Look!

507
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,280
Prince Chen paid at a banquet in the Palace of Perfection.

508
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,470
Ten thousand coins for a cask of wine,
with many a laugh and quip.

509
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,190
What's the literary quotation?

510
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,430
Prince Chen

511
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,350
is a prince surnamed Cao.

512
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,760
He once held a banquet

513
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,710
in the Palace of Perfection.

514
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,710
A prince surnamed Cao?

515
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,000
In past dynasties,

516
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,280
no one from the imperial families was surnamed Cao.

517
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,920
Master Zhuang,

518
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,230
I told you on the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest that

519
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,040
all these poems come from

520
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,190
another world.

521
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,470
So these literary quotations certainly

522
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,070
won't be found in historical records.

523
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,950
Then,

524
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,680
it's a fairyland in dream?

525
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,470
It's not a fairyland. It's...

526
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,160
What?

527
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,350
It's the imprint left by

528
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,350
another era.

529
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,470
What? Era?

530
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,280
It is earlier than all history

531
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
for hundreds and thousands of years.

532
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,800
It's a splendid

533
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,710
civilization

534
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,190
lost in the

535
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,560
river of time.

536
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't get it. I don't get it.

537
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,310
Are you referring to

538
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,040
the ancient times?

539
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,470
It's even earlier than that.

540
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,560
How do you know these?

541
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,280
Since I was born,

542
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,430
these things

543
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,680
have been carved in my mind

544
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,190
as if I've seen them in my dreams.

545
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,590
So it is

546
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,760
a dreamland.

547
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,470
Can I put it this way?

548
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,110
Yes, you can.

549
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Good.

550
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,470
Now I understand why there're so many

551
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,190
unknown literary quotations.

552
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,280
It's not because I'm a poor scholar.

553
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,560
How can I know stuff

554
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,520
of the fairyland?

555
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,920
Don't let it bother you.

556
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,070
Fine.

557
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,280
When you came in just now,

558
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,830
why was there no report?

559
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,800
Actually,

560
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,160
I sneaked in to see you.

561
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,400
Your servant was lured away

562
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,560
by my friend.

563
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,470
Why do you sneak in?

564
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,760
Actually, I know

565
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,000
you are in Shangjing,

566
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,160
and I want to see you very much.

567
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,470
But my servant stops me

568
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,560
from visiting you.

569
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,950
He said my condition would go worse

570
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,920
if I see you.

571
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,430
Master Zhuang, are you sick?

572
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,190
I'm just old.

573
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,160
Don't! Don't! Don't!

574
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,400
Your Excellency, back on the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest,

575
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,640
I framed you up.

576
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,400
Till today,

577
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,800
I feel guilty all the time.

578
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,640
By seeing you today,

579
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,310
I can finally apologize to you in person.

580
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,310
Your Excellency,

581
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,640
please be magnanimous and forgive me.

582
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,310
Master Zhuang, you don't have to!

583
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,400
When it comes to explaining classic texts
and annotating articles, you win.

584
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,560
But when it comes to reciting poems, I win.

585
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,430
For a literary giant...

586
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,760
Good poems!

587
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,560
...I'm not qualified.

588
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,310
Good!

589
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,430
But for a man,

590
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,160
you're not qualified.

591
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,070
I know you did that

592
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,190
to save Xiao En.

593
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,590
To be honest,

594
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,630
though he is surnamed Xiao,

595
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,080
he's my full brother.

596
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,470
Actually, Master Zhuang, I visit you this time

597
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,760
because Senior Xiao asked me to.

598
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,870
Really?

599
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,560
He finally wants to contact me.

600
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,360
Did he ask you

601
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,280
to tell me anything?

602
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,670
What's wrong?

603
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,080
Is he dead?

604
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,150
Before going back,

605
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,950
you should visit Zhuang Mohan when you're free.

606
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,870
Inform him of my death.

607
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I will.

608
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,120
Tell me.

609
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,870
Will I see them after I die?

610
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,910
Man dies.

611
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,560
Senior Xiao died in peace.

612
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,800
He lived a miserable life.

613
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,600
That's because

614
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,630
he killed so many people.

615
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,630
Nowadays, man gets power

616
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,190
by killing others and setting places on fire.

617
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,280
Your Excellency,

618
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,840
you shouldn't be like that.

619
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,230
Man like you who's capable of writing wonderful poems

620
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,870
shouldn't be defiled by the secular world.

621
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
I can't bear to see

622
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,800
these excellent poems covered by dust.

623
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,800
Master Zhuang, I promise you.

624
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,040
I'll never be like that.

625
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,360
Good!

626
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,000
Good!

627
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,950
It's late.

628
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,870
I'm leaving.

629
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,390
When will you leave Shangjing?

630
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,910
We'll leave tomorrow.

631
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,710
Tomorrow?

632
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,040
Then this must be

633
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,390
our last time to meet.

634
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,560
In my lifetime,

635
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,950
I've annotated numerous books

636
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
and written many articles.

637
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,230
But my experience is

638
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,710
what I feel most proud of.

639
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,280
Isn't that Commander Shen?

640
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,520
Her Majesty ordered you

641
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,710
to rest at home for a few days.

642
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,840
But our Division can't operate

643
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,670
without a leader.

644
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,190
There's no other way.

645
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,910
From tomorrow on,

646
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,710
I'll take your position temporarily.

647
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,230
Feel relieved to rest at home.

648
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,910
Just leave

649
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,150
all the trouble

650
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,360
to me.

651
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,670
Your Excellency,

652
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,280
why are you still here?

653
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
Seriously speaking,

654
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,840
you're defying the imperial order.

655
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,520
Don't make it hard for me.

656
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,800
Shall I walk you out in person?

657
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,600
Your Excellency,

658
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,670
powerful and influential as you are,

659
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,360
why do you insist on staying here?

660
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,280
Should I find someone to help you?

661
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,360
Who are you?

662
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,840
How dare you break into the Division?

663
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,470
Your Excellency, are these

664
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,950
all your men?

665
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,040
What we're going to do today is simple.

666
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,150
Stop and kill the Nanqing mission.

667
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,520
There's no imperial edict.

668
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,190
It's my own decision.

669
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,870
As long as we kill every member of the Nanqing mission,

670
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,230
the business deal

671
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,470
will become null automatically.

672
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Everyone,

673
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,470
succeed or not,

674
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,120
this operation will cost your lives.

675
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,630
I'm also afraid to die.

676
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,670
But on second thought,

677
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,520
if I can save Beiqi by sacrificing my life,

678
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,520
it's totally worth it.

679
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,800
With me or not, it's up to you.

680
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,000
I won't force you.

681
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,670
Commander Shen,

682
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,190
you should think is through.

683
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,630
Guards!

684
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,630
You traitors,

685
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,670
how dare you

686
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,600
do this?

687
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,910
Whoever leaves

688
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,000
will be killed!

689
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,280
Do you know

690
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,840
that will cost your lives?

691
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,800
You!

692
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Come back!

693
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,950
Come...

694
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,230
Come on!

695
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,280
Take them!

696
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
Come on!

697
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,500
Come on!

698
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,900
=Shangjing Town=

699
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,950
Your Excellency, do you trust

700
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,430
Guo Baokun to stay in Shangjing?

701
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,760
You're right.

702
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,910
What about leaving you behind?

703
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,870
Guo Baokun can definitely complete the task!

704
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,430
They can leave now?

705
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,000
It's too easy for them.

706
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,950
Your Excellency.

707
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,470
She's here.

708
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,800
See me off with a load of things?

709
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,390
Master Zhuang has passed away.

710
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,760
What?

711
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,060
In the river of history,

712
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,260
time goes round and round.

713
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,620
Memories about the former and present lives

714
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,500
join each other in an endless way.

715
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,100
In the long drunken Milky Way,

716
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,820
one season follows another in a flash,

717
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,020
and the wild geese are flying south.

718
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,940
I just can't give up

719
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,940
to be with you for my whole life.

720
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,220
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

721
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

722
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,900
Year after year in the wandering,

723
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,460
I count the remaining years.

724
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,660
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

725
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,220
even though we have ended up the destiny,

726
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,900
I never feel regretful.

727
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,860
In such a chaotic world,

728
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,620
I still miss you as ever.

729
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,260
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

730
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,980
With a gentle heart,

731
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,540
I cherish our remaining years.

732
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,380
Even though we have to go through

733
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,340
all the hardships along the journey,

734
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:14,660
you always stay by my side,

735
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,420
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

736
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,340
Year after year in the wandering,

737
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,700
I count the remaining years.

738
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,060
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

739
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,860
even though we end up the destiny,

740
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,300
I never feel regretful.

741
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,220
In such a chaotic world,

742
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,180
I still miss you as ever.

743
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,860
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

744
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,620
With a gentle heart,

745
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,020
I cherish our remaining years.

746
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,820
Even though we have to go through

747
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,980
all the hardships along the journey,

748
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:55,260
you always stay by my side...
