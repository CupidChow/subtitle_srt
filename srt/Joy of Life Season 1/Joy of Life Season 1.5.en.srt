1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,700
Have you ever heard about that

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,580
the cliff of a snow mountain

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,220
once fascinated numerous people?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Legend has it that,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,940
there were treasures at the peak

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
but also there was a bottomless chasm hidden over there.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
The smart, the fool

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,740
and the kind people,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,220
all are familiar to you.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,660
On the mountainside, on the cliff,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,580
on the cloud,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and in the human world,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,220
snowflakes are drifting profusely and disorderly.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Joy of Life Season 1

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Episode 5

16
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,440
All your files back then

17
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,630
were transferred by the Investigator's Office.

18
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,950
The only thing left

19
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,720
is this arrest warrant.

20
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,360
According to it,

21
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,950
the crime you committed back then

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,160
was assassinating court officials.

23
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,030
This is weird.

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,160
Why would the Investigator's Office

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,390
hire a criminal

26
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,830
like you?

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,240
And why do you turn to me?

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
To pick up your former career?

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,080
Do you have the token for
Director-General of the Investigator's Office?

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,160
Yes, I have.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,470
You will go to the Investigator's Office.

32
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,390
Maybe!

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,030
What are you doing?

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
The Investigator's Office has special records

35
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,030
of all cases.

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,600
If you can bring me

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
my file which doesn't have much importance,

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,030
I'd give my life

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,630
to you.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,830
And from now on,

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,720
I'll be your slave and servant.

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,670
You can determine my life and death.

43
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,880
I don't want to do that.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
I will never

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
kneel in front of you

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,470
if I have another choice.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,520
I understand.

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,630
I don't even have

49
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,670
the slightest bit of dignity

50
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,320
as a man.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
Don't push me.

52
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,000
I might do

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,830
terrible things beyond your imagination.

54
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,600
I know you will.

55
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,880
I swear

56
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,720
that file is nothing confidential.

57
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,800
Since you're the Director-General,

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,190
it's a piece of cake for you to take it out

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,000
without any trouble.

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,110
I'm saying it once again.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,110
I don't want to do it.

62
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,670
I will help you

63
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,800
with one extra condition.

64
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,950
You must tell me

65
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
what's on the file,

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,440
why you would

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
assassinate the officials

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,480
from the imperial court,

69
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,880
and why

70
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,920
do you give up everything?

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,510
I was...

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,880
These people are...

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,920
The story was a cliche!

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,720
This common couple poured water on the street

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,110
and stained the royalty's dresses.

76
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,270
As a consequence, they got beaten up.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,720
Thank you for saving my life.

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,950
Thank you!

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Thank you for saving my life.

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,200
So you stopped them

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,110
protecting the couple?

82
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,230
It's not their fault.

83
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,160
I had no sense of propriety

84
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,320
and stewed in my own juice.

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,830
I don't think you did anything wrong.

86
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,640
The master of those people

87
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,350
is called Guo Baokun.

88
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,270
And his father is Guo Youzhi,

89
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,160
the current Minister

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
of the Board of Rites.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
He has paramount power.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,670
What happened next?

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,880
One day later,

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,110
I was on the wanted list of the Ministry of Penalty.

95
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
It's nothing but a fight.

96
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,350
Why put you on the list?

97
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,110
The charge was assassinating important officials.

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
That charge

99
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,440
was based on nothing.

100
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,670
How did they declare you guilty without evidence?

101
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,950
There were witnesses.

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,040
The Guos?

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
It was that couple.

104
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,070
I was just convicted like that

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,920
with extermination of all my family members.

106
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,040
Your family got involved as well?

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
My wife just got pregnant at the time.

108
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,160
I begged them for mercy

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
and asked for death

110
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,480
in exchange for the lives of my family.

111
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,920
But they told me that

112
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,320
the national law is too rigorous
to give personal considerations.

113
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,670
I remember that I wanted to laugh

114
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,000
upon hearing these words,

115
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,600
but I just couldn't.

116
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,640
Who saved you?

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
The Investigator's Office.

118
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,830
They transferred me away from the jail

119
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,670
and took away all the files

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,070
with just one condition.

121
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,390
They wanted me

122
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,440
to serve them in the Investigator's Office.

123
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,600
If I agree,

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
they would save my family.

125
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,040
They must be attracted by your capabilities.

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,270
What if I don't know any Kung Fu?

127
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,480
Will there be vegetation

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,920
all over my cemetery?

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,350
For sure,

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,070
I am still alive,

131
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
but a lot of people died

132
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,640
with grudges.

133
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,950
You hate them.

134
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,600
Whom?

135
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,110
Do you mean Guo Baokun?

136
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,600
He is the son of the Minister of the Board of Rites

137
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,350
who is at a top position.

138
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,390
It's a bliss for me to stay alive.

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,790
I don't dare to hate him.

140
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,640
I mean that couple

141
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,510
After I came under the Investigator's Office,

142
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,230
I talked to them in private.

143
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,670
I really want to give them

144
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,390
a good round of beating

145
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,600
to unleash the anger in my heart.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,670
Did you do it?

147
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,950
Please give me some money.

148
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,920
Please help me with some food.

149
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,230
It's very tiring, isn't it?

150
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,440
You're sweating.

151
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,400
Miss, please give me some food.

152
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,320
Miss!

153
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,350
What a miserable boy!

154
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,470
Please give me some food! Sir!

155
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,150
Please give me some money! Sir!

156
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,000
Give some to him.

157
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

158
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,670
Not at all.

159
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,440
Let's go!

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,520
Thank you! Thank you!

161
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,520
Life is not easy for anyone.

162
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,350
Yeah!

163
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,150
Please give me some money. Sir!

164
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
Please give me some food.

165
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,640
Please have mercy! Sir!

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,520
Please!

167
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,840
Please give me some money! Sir!

168
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,030
Please give me some food!

169
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,880
Have mercy on me please!

170
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,350
Please give me some food. Miss.

171
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,000
Have mercy please!

172
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Anyone please help me?

173
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,470
Thank you! Thank you! Sir!

174
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,150
Thank you!

175
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,910
Thank you!

176
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,470
They are merely common people.

177
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
What can they do when they are summoned by

178
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
the Minister's Residence as witnesses?

179
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,400
Ever since then,

180
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I understand that there is no black and white in this world

181
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,550
but just rich and poor.

182
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,470
I realized

183
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,440
I had to take my wife and children away

184
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,470
from the capital city

185
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,670
and spent the rest of the life

186
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,840
in obscurity.

187
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,110
So you used me for a fake death

188
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,030
to run away from the Investigator's Office?

189
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
I went home once.

190
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,550
It's all empty now.

191
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,910
My family are all missing.

192
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,230
I am a dead man

193
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,030
in name.

194
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,080
I can't investigate it.

195
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
You're the only man

196
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,960
that I can trust.

197
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,790
So,

198
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
this is the reason why you are looking for

199
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,470
the files of the Investigator's Office?

200
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,520
There must be record

201
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,000
about my family's whereabouts.

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
You have my life

203
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,520
if you can help me find them.

204
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,110
I don't need your life,

205
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,760
but I'll help you.

206
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,000
You clearly had the chance to kill that couple,

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,590
but you didn't.

208
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,200
You said you are apathetic now

209
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,790
but you're not.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,840
That's the reason that I help you.

211
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,760
Let's go!

212
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,200
My Lady, it's time to take the medicine.

213
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,700
Wan'er,

214
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:12,790
Wan'er,
=Ye Ling'er, Lin Wan'er's good friend=

215
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,260
I'm treating you with drumsticks today.
=Ye Ling'er, Lin Wan'er's good friend=

216
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm treating you with drumsticks today.

217
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,790
My Lady! My Lady!

218
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
Watch out for the wind!

219
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,670
My Lady!

220
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
You promised me

221
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
to keep it a secret, didn't you?

222
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,440
Why do you want everybody

223
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
to know it

224
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,080
as soon as you come?

225
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,670
It's no longer a secret now.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,030
Drumsticks. Pork knuckle. You can take whatever

227
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,350
-you want. -My Lady!

228
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
What are you waiting for?

229
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,880
Take him to the kitchen

230
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,640
and get him prepared.

231
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,550
Do it now!

232
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,550
Lady Ye,

233
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
what new idea

234
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,590
do you have today?

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,350
I went out of town yesterday
to watch sword shows on the street

236
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,440
and learned that a chef

237
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,880
can make dishes out of grains, vegetables, and beans

238
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,320
with the taste of various meats

239
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,760
which is not only tasty

240
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,840
but also vivid.

241
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,440
So I brought him here

242
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,350
to satisfy your craving for food.

243
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,880
You're so considerate.

244
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,350
Of course!

245
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,520
If you have a craving for any food

246
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,590
in future,

247
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,320
I'll bring him to you.

248
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,760
I have no luck to enjoy them

249
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,030
despite how honored I am.

250
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,790
Are you alright?

251
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,400
You are spitting blood again.

252
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,840
Did you catch a cold yesterday

253
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,550
when visiting the Qing Temple?

254
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm fine!

255
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,230
Totally fine.

256
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,200
Do you think

257
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,790
some day

258
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,590
I would get used to

259
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,440
spitting blood.

260
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,710
No way!

261
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,520
Are you an assassin?

262
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,670
Not really.

263
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,280
Then, are you sent by the God?

264
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,200
Not really either.

265
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
I think you are.

266
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,910
It's fine.

267
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,110
After vomiting several times, I just get used to it.

268
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,910
I'll find a famous reclused doctor for you

269
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,150
some day when I go out of town.

270
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,200
You'll be cured.

271
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,840
In view of the current situation,

272
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,400
I won't be happy

273
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,910
even if I'm cured.

274
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,960
You're still concerned about the bestowed marriage?

275
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,200
I know the situation

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,590
about my body.

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,520
I could die any time.

278
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,640
Why would I die with the marriage contract?

279
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,110
That's bullshit!

280
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,640
You don't have to blame yourself

281
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,590
for a bastard.

282
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,470
He is a bastard.

283
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,030
So am I.

284
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,350
What's the difference?

285
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,640
You are the awe-inspiring princess

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,110
which is evidently different from him.

287
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,840
I grew up in sheer coverup

288
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,200
for my whole life.

289
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,910
The so-called identity as a princess is all fake.

290
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Even if I am a princess,

291
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,520
I can barely decide

292
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,150
who I can love.

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,710
If anyone offends you,

294
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,000
I can stand up for you

295
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,590
to beat him up.

296
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,440
But...

297
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,910
I might have a weak body, but I have a strong will.

298
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,400
My marriage

299
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,470
shall not be controlled by the Emperor's order

300
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,910
or by the usurp of the imperial power and treasure.

301
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,590
I have only one requirement

302
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,640
to the person that I'm going to marry.

303
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,550
What's the requirement?

304
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,080
It must be a person that I love.

305
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,550
That's a good point, Wan'er.

306
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,230
Yes. Love is the thing.

307
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,470
I'm gonna fine a man

308
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,440
that I love too.

309
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,760
We're so indulged

310
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,310
in empty talk.

311
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,190
That's nothing difficult.

312
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,760
Wait! Where are you going?

313
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,710
Fan Xian is the determinant.

314
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,710
I'm gonna find him

315
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,590
and make it clear to him.

316
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,520
He has to understand

317
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,350
how bad he is

318
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,680
and plead the emperor to cancel the marriage contract.

319
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,560
My Lady,

320
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
where are you going?

321
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,070
You can't catch a cold again.

322
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,520
We're going to ask for the
cancellation of the marriage contract.

323
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,830
My Lady!

324
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,190
Take some!

325
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,560
No! No! No!

326
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,830
By the way, I've got one more thing to do.

327
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,280
Ask him to pull over!

328
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,350
I need to get off.

329
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,880
What's so urgent?

330
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,830
I don't know either. I'm...

331
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,680
Stop!

332
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,830
Ask the guy from Danzhou

333
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,470
to come off!

334
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,920
Come off!

335
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,710
I'm going off to take a look!

336
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,760
It's OK.

337
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,920
Don't worry. Sit tight!

338
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,830
Do you hear me! Come off right now!

339
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,520
Brother!

340
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,470
It's all fine now.

341
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,830
OK. Get off and take a look.

342
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,350
He wanted a fight and got beaten up.

343
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,350
Young Master!

344
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,680
Young Master, please help me!

345
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,710
Don't come to me! Go away!

346
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,920
I don't even know you.

347
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,430
Young Master!

348
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,160
Shut up!

349
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,760
Do you know them?

350
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,880
No, do you?

351
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,520
Me neither!

352
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,560
Neither of us know him.

353
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,470
Young Master!

354
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,830
Shut up! I'm not your master!

355
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
Total bullshit!

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't even know who you are.

357
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,160
Why the heck do you take me as your master?

358
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,470
The tie between me and my brother
is tighter than anything else.

359
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,760
Don't you try

360
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,920
to alienate us.

361
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,920
Your Majesty,

362
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,520
Fan Xian and the legitimate son of Earl Sinan were together.

363
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,640
They should have gone to the Yishi House.

364
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,280
And

365
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,470
the men of the Crown Prince

366
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,830
are keeping an eye on the whereabouts of Fan Xian.

367
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,880
Apart from that,

368
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:44,500
the hangers of the second prince

369
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,760
the hangers of the second prince
=Eunuch Hou, private servant of Emperor Qing=

370
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,100
are hunting him secretly.
=Eunuch Hou, private servant of Emperor Qing=

371
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,310
are hunting him secretly.

372
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,160
Fan Xian has no title.

373
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,760
Shall we protect him?

374
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,350
After all, he is taking over Neiku.

375
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,070
and a talent nominated by you.

376
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,760
How many fish are there in this pond?

377
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,280
Eh...

378
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,230
It's hard to tell with naked eyes.

379
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,590
You can't tell as the water is too deep, right?

380
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,520
How about now?

381
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,310
The bait in your hands

382
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,190
is Fan Xian.

383
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,800
This pool of water is the capital city.

384
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,430
And the fish...

385
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,430
They are the common people.

386
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,430
Thanks for coming, gentlemen!

387
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,310
Find a place for the carriage first.

388
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,400
We will wait for you upstairs.

389
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,000
Sure!

390
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,710
This Yishi House

391
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,920
is a famous house in the capital city.

392
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,760
It's very special.

393
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,950
Since Sizhe will treat us,

394
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,070
then this is it!

395
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,070
Sister,

396
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,160
isn't this a bit too expensive

397
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
for me?

398
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,230
You wanted to be the host yourself.

399
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,430
No one forced you.

400
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,110
Brother, let's get inside.

401
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,160
Let's go and check out what to eat.

402
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,160
Any books?

403
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,430
What?

404
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,430
Do you need any books?

405
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,560
Forbidden books!

406
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,040
This sounds so familiar.

407
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Do you also sell discs?

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,950
What do you mean?

409
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,950
I'm only selling books.

410
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,560
Do you need any?

411
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,310
I need to take a look first.

412
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,280
Red Mansions!

413
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,280
It really is!

414
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,470
This book

415
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,160
is a real masterpiece.

416
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,160
It just got leaked on the streets.

417
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,190
Eight taels of silver for a scroll. No bargaining.

418
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,280
How much again?

419
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,640
Eight taels of silver each scroll.

420
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,230
Do you want it?

421
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,590
What if I want a lot?

422
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,560
You don't seem to carry many with you.

423
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,160
If you really want,

424
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,470
follow me to the rear alley.

425
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,950
Wait for me upstairs.

426
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,920
Are you serious?

427
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,590
Please take the lead!

428
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,680
Brother!

429
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,310
Sister, look at him.

430
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
How disgraceful!

431
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,070
You can't understand it!

432
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,470
That book is written by brother!

433
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,430
By him?

434
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,920
Please help yourselves!

435
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,000
Please!

436
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,160
Is everything ready?

437
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,830
Yeah!

438
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,400
Hurry up!

439
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,710
The guests are waiting upstairs!

440
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,230
Welcome inside!

441
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,800
Let's go to another one!

442
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,950
This way! Please come in!

443
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,110
How far is it?

444
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,070
Close!

445
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,560
You must bargain by yourself when it comes.

446
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,800
Not with you?

447
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,000
You bargain directly with the boss

448
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,350
since you buy a lot.

449
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,230
The books belong to the boss.

450
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,350
Right there.

451
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,560
Remember! If the imperial officials come,

452
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,230
you must leave without hesitation.

453
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,110
So many people

454
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,310
take books from him?

455
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,400
Yeah! You gotta bargain on your own.

456
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,110
I need to get back to the street.

457
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,560
Do you need the book or not?

458
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,520
Thank you!

459
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,430
Can you give me one for free?

460
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Just one!

461
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,400
Remember to run if you see the imperial officials.

462
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,040
Go! Go!

463
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,430
But don't run to me!

464
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,110
Are all these books yours?

465
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,470
How many do you want?

466
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,430
Mr. Fan!

467
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,560
Wang Qinian!

468
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,040
First books, then maps!

469
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,590
You are monopolizing

470
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,680
the literature industry.

471
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,760
What is literature industry?

472
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,640
Shall we talk about the map first?

473
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,000
Mr. Fan, how about...

474
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,230
I'm willing to pay ten times as much

475
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
for the map.

476
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,350
That's delightful!

477
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
I always have the courage

478
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,710
to take the blame for what I did

479
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,800
and behave myself neatly.

480
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,470
Please look back.

481
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,830
What's there to look?

482
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,560
Run so fast!

483
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,640
I don't know when the Young Master

484
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,710
will come back either.

485
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,680
OK.

486
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,400
My Lady, I checked.

487
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,230
Fan Xian is not home.

488
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,230
Where did he go?

489
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,920
It seems he went to the house.

490
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,830
What a merrymaker!

491
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,830
Are you alright?

492
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,950
It shall be fine

493
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,310
to put forward the cancellation of marriage contract

494
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,590
in front of Mrs. Liu in the residence.

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,880
His Majesty finalized my marriage

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,590
without my consent.

497
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm not happy with it.

498
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,430
Don't do to others what you don't want yourself.

499
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,280
Even if I want it to be cancelled,

500
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,400
I should look him in the eyes

501
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,800
and tell him.

502
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,590
I surely will help you.

503
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm so weak physically

504
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,070
and yet so stubborn.

505
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,950
Thank you for helping me.

506
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,430
How stupid you are!

507
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,590
Guess who is the book trafficker?

508
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,520
Who is it?

509
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,350
Wang Qinian!

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,640
Where is he?

511
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,160
He ran away in a flash!

512
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,590
This book is widely spread

513
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,590
among the girls of each household.

514
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,230
We don't know how it got leaked.

515
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,590
Brother, it's all my fault.

516
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,680
That's alright!

517
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,110
Books are meant to be read by people.

518
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,280
What are you looking at?

519
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,880
So many book dealers!

520
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,230
Take a look!

521
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,920
It's the same!

522
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,560
Please take a look!

523
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,110
Sure!

524
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,920
This is the most popular book

525
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
on the street now.

526
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Do you need one?

527
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,110
Why do so many people

528
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,760
carry babies?

529
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,920
Wang Qinian is remarkable.

530
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,800
He is the friend of women.

531
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,710
Fan Xian,

532
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,710
did you really write this book?

533
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,400
No!

534
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,520
It is the Red Mansions of Cao Xueqin.

535
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,160
Brother, don't hold it back.

536
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,680
There is no such person in the world.

537
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,110
It is really not me.

538
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,830
This book is a masterpiece.

539
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,880
How can I steal the honor of it

540
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,590
by claiming to be the writer?

541
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,680
What I did

542
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,160
is only to write it from memory.

543
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,830
In a word,

544
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,280
are you the only one

545
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,000
who knows the story thereafter?

546
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,760
Why do you ask?

547
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Fan Xian, we can take over

548
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,310
the book trafficking business.

549
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,280
Fan Sizhe,

550
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
stop messing around!

551
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,070
No, sister!

552
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,230
I observed very carefully just now.

553
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,160
A lot of people buy this book.

554
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,190
Eight taels of silver for one scroll.

555
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,400
Look at this book!

556
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,590
It has mediocre quality.

557
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,880
The cost is no more than three qian and two fen

558
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,400
for platemaking and printing,

559
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,350
excluding manpower.

560
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,950
So we can make a profit of

561
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,040
seven taels six qian and eight fen

562
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,470
with the sales of each book.

563
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,800
About eight to nine books were sold

564
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,760
in such a short while.

565
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,800
If we spread the network,

566
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,470
hundreds of them can be sold in a day.

567
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,310
With the sales

568
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,070
of a hundred books,

569
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,920
we can make

570
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,190
768 taels of silver.

571
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,070
If we hold a good control of time

572
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,520
and publish one scroll for every 15 days,

573
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,000
that will be

574
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,800
11,520 taels of silver.

575
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,950
If we take out the cost for manpower and network

576
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,950
which should be enough for three fen,

577
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,710
we can still make

578
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,640
8,064 taels of silver

579
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,310
as pure profit.

580
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,710
If you publish 12 scrolls,

581
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,190
it will be

582
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,710
96,768 taels of silver.

583
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,160
This is just a rough estimation.

584
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,710
It's so lucrative, Fan Xian!

585
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,310
What do you call him?

586
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,880
Brother! My most beloved brother!

587
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,070
As long as you give me this business,

588
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,950
I can call you uncle

589
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,000
if you want me to,

590
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,070
let alone brother.

591
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,800
What do you think?

592
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,590
Let's do this together.

593
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,680
You publish the book. I will take care of the network of shops.

594
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,560
And then we split the profit 40/60.

595
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,590
You get 60 and I get 40.

596
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,920
You can get

597
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,350
4,838.4 taels of silver

598
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,950
for every 15 days.

599
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,800
What do you think?

600
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,800
How did you get all these numbers?

601
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Do I even need to calculate?

602
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,710
It's so simple.

603
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,310
Get out of the way!

604
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,040
Get out of the way, all of you!

605
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,950
Stop selling!

606
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,190
Get out of the way!

607
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,070
Who allows you to sell this? Go away!

608
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,560
This is forbidden now. Get out of the way!

609
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,710
What's going on here?

610
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,800
Who allows you to sell it?

611
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,070
Go away!

612
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,680
Sir, they are all gone now!

613
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,780
=Guo Baokun,
son of Nanqing Minister of the Board of Rites Guo Youzhi=

614
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,680
Damn!

615
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,590
What happened?

616
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
This guy is Guo Baokun,

617
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,070
the son of the Minister of the Board of Rites.

618
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,190
What is he doing?

619
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,710
It was he who persecuted your family?

620
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,950
Yes!

621
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,280
Don't you want to beat him up?

622
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
I've got only one life now.

623
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,470
I can't run the risk.

624
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,710
Folks,

625
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,070
I am Guo Baokun!

626
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,280
My father is the Minister of the Board of Rites.

627
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,830
I am too humble to be blessed

628
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,710
with the position of an editor in the palace.

629
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,040
I attended school ever since I was young.

630
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,000
I know rites.

631
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,880
As you are all intellectuals,

632
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
you should read the sages and men of virtues.

633
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,190
It's such a shame to read filthy book

634
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,560
like this.

635
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,430
In my opinion,

636
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,280
this book should be banned from today onwards.

637
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,950
That's bullshit!

638
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,350
Guo Baokun, you're talking non-sense.

639
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,230
Who is talking to me like this?

640
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,430
Your grandpa!

641
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,520
Who is Guo Baokun close to?

642
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,070
He used to be the reading partner for Eastern Palace.

643
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,680
We can take him as on the Crown Prince's side.

644
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,280
It's the Crown Prince again!

645
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,430
He's involved again!

646
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,160
He has been looking towards me

647
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,040
while he was talking just now.

648
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,560
He knows that I am here.

649
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,560
Now that he is against you,

650
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
why would he become so agitated?

651
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,560
That's right!

652
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,310
Fan Sizhe and Guo Baokun are enemies?

653
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,710
I haven't heard of that before.

654
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Hey! Stop messing around!

655
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,310
This book is so popular.

656
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,800
It means

657
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,680
it's a good book.

658
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,590
You want to ban a good book.

659
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,070
What's your title?

660
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,280
Editor in the palace.

661
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,800
That's a small enough title

662
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,560
to even step into the imperial office.

663
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,190
I know who the heck you are.

664
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,160
What a dumbass!

665
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
You are the dumbass!

666
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,160
Your dad is the Minister of dumbasses!

667
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,110
-Mr. Guo, please calm down! -How dare you!

668
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,380
=He Zongwei, a scholar in the capital city of Nanqing=

669
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,640
I've heard you are outstanding in terms of eloquence

670
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,950
and family knowledge.

671
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,560
I didn't believe it at the start.

672
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,400
Now I see you

673
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
defend the honor for scholars

674
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,310
in the world.

675
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,110
It's so admirable!

676
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,000
He Zongwei is well-known as a scholar

677
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,110
in the capital city.

678
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,470
It looks like he has found a wise master.

679
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,070
I've known you well

680
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,640
by your reputation as a talent.

681
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,350
I feel flattered

682
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,950
and regretful to it.

683
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,590
That's all bullshit.

684
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,680
Be careful with your words.

685
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,830
This guy is the son of Earl Sinan.

686
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,430
Earl Sinan is in charge of the Ministry of the Revenue

687
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,160
which has all the silvers.

688
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,710
So definitely his son will be superficial.

689
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
How dare you insult my dad!

690
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,760
I...

691
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,680
It's fine.

692
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Guo Baokun won't recognize me.

693
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,160
But his subordinates may recognize you.

694
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,070
Don't reveal yourself.

695
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,640
What do we do then

696
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,950
other than watching him bullied?

697
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Let me go!

698
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,230
After all, I'm your dad's colleague in the palace.

699
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,070
Kowtow to me for forgiveness,

700
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,880
and I'll forgive you this time

701
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,680
for the sake of your dad.

702
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,560
I won't apologize to a pig!

703
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Throw this dumbass harder!

704
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,560
So here comes the bastard

705
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,280
that Earl Sinan raised in Danzhou.

706
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,430
Hi, Lady Ruoruo!

707
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,160
What a talent you are!

708
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,070
But it's such a pity

709
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,190
that you have these rubbish

710
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,160
as brothers.

711
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,950
I'm afraid you made a mistake.

712
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm just a passer-by.

713
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,920
What?

714
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,950
Do you feel ashamed?

715
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,040
Fan Xian!

716
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,950
How come you're afraid

717
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,880
to admit your own identity?

718
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,000
I really don't expect you

719
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,230
to admire me so much!

720
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,830
That's bullshit!

721
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,280
Of course no!

722
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,640
I just came here from the capital city yesterday.

723
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,760
Today is my first day out.

724
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,590
I barely recognize all my family

725
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,070
before you recognize me with one blink of an eye.

726
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,350
You even memorize my name so clearly.

727
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,400
Is it because you admire me for long?

728
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,280
You...

729
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,800
You may keep silent if you can't think of any words to say.

730
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,590
It looks embarrassing to me.

731
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,760
Let's get back to where we were.

732
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,310
If I hadn't come down to help,

733
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,400
one of his arms would have been broken by now.

734
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,830
Yeah, so what?

735
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,830
What are you waiting for?

736
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,070
Come on!

737
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
He is nothing but a bastard.

738
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,350
Nothing to be afraid!

739
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
You wanted to break his arm.

740
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,430
I'd break your nose in return.

741
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,760
That's a fair treatment.

742
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,880
Countryside rubbish!

743
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,760
Arrogant and overweening.

744
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,000
Why do you look at me?

745
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,110
Just do it!

746
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,190
You have me at your back.

747
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,880
Overbearing Vitality Qi.

748
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,160
Well done!

749
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,280
What do you want to do?

750
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,230
Beat him up!

751
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,230
Did you just say

752
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,000
this is filthy book?

753
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,110
Yes, I did. So what?

754
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,040
Have you read it?

755
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,230
I don't even have enough time to read books from the sages.

756
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,760
How can I have time to read this stuff?

757
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,910
How about you?

758
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,840
I was too afraid it will stain my eyes.

759
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,040
An insult

760
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,470
based on nothing.

761
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,080
The writer of this book is obscure.

762
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,150
What good word could he produce?

763
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,000
Do you read his book

764
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,910
or his fame?

765
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,280
If a writer is not famous,

766
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,600
can't he produce any good works?

767
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,040
Without learning, one cannot increase his knowledge.

768
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,950
Without indomitable will, one cannot finish his studies.

769
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,230
You're too short-sighted

770
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,430
to claim yourselves scholars

771
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
or literary figures.

772
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,470
You don't even have the cultivation

773
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,360
to treat others' works with respect.

774
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,870
Shame on you!

775
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,600
Damn you!

776
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,360
No countryside men like you

777
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,670
can comment on scholars

778
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,520
like us.

779
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Put your tongue straight

780
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,390
before talking.

781
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,910
If all scholars in this world

782
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,710
are like you,

783
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,360
I'll feel ashamed to be one of it.

784
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,320
Well said!

785
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,670
Mr. Fan's words are classic.

786
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,390
Your Highness!

787
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,150
Your Highness!

788
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,150
Without learning, one cannot increase his knowledge.

789
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,000
Without indomitable will, one cannot finish his studies.

790
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,120
I thought about these two sentences.

791
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,670
There is a lot of meaning behind it.

792
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,840
It's one glimpse

793
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,430
of Mr. Fan's knowledge.

794
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,870
Your Highness,

795
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,950
don't get cheated

796
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,080
by this guy.

797
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,280
You two have always been famous

798
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
as talents.

799
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,280
Coincidentally,

800
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,870
there will be a poetry gathering at my residence.

801
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,560
You should come for the sake of making friends

802
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,520
through literature and cultivating yourselves through poems.

803
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,870
You can compete through poem on the poetry gathering

804
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,190
so that all the intellectuals in the world can see

805
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,500
who is the actual scholar.

806
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:31,600
who is the actual scholar.
=Li Hongcheng, Nanqing Prince Jing's son=

807
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,320
What do you think?
=Li Hongcheng, Nanqing Prince Jing's son=

808
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,660
=Li Hongcheng, Nanqing Prince Jing's son=

809
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,470
I'll come for sure!

810
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,470
So will I.

811
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,390
Who are you?

812
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,080
This is Li Hongcheng,

813
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,150
Prince Jing's son.

814
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,320
Who is Prince Jing?

815
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,280
Don't say it out loud.

816
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,560
Prince Jing is the biological brother

817
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,600
of His Majesty.

818
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,950
Royal bloodline!

819
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,390
Scholarship is the origin of mankind.

820
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,950
Bloodline is not worth mentioning.

821
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,520
You've got a good attitude.

822
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,280
By the way,

823
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,320
will there be any girls on the poetry gathering?

824
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,000
There will be a lot of female scholars indeed.

825
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,760
Good job!

826
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
You pick up girl scholars

827
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,470
with sobriety.

828
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,760
What does "pick up" mean?

829
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,120
Then it's a deal.

830
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,150
See you tomorrow at the poetry gathering.

831
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,230
Sure! Will wait you for it.

832
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,560
Li Hongcheng, Prince Jing's son,

833
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,760
has a reputation among the masses.

834
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,040
He likes literature and poetry gathering.

835
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,630
Scholars from different schools join it.

836
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,710
I didn't expect you to join it

837
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,910
as I thought you may not like it.

838
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,710
We can't escape it.

839
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,670
What do you mean?

840
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,840
It's nothing but a meal.

841
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,230
Disciples of the prince and Prince Jing's son

842
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
showed up one after another.

843
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,800
And a newly arrived bastard

844
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,360
got invited

845
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
to the poetry gathering

846
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,670
just because of a few words.

847
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,600
Isn't it a bit hasty?

848
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,520
You don't think it's a coincidence?

849
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,390
He is there to wait for me.

850
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,760
Don't think too much.

851
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,150
He is Prince Jing's son.

852
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,630
Why would he wait for you?

853
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,150
Besides,

854
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,910
who could predict that

855
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,150
you're going to Yishi House today?

856
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,470
It's very easy to find the destination

857
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,670
by following the carriage.

858
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,630
So he sent someone

859
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,000
to wait for you at the gate of our home

860
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,520
just to meet you

861
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,840
and invite you to the poetry gathering?

862
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,360
Is it even possible? Don't think too much.

863
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,120
More or less.

864
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,910
So what about Guo Baokun?

865
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,000
Guo Baokun was sent by the Crown Prince.

866
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,520
So you mean the prince wants to meet you

867
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
and Prince Jing's son wants to meet you too.

868
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I didn't notice

869
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,760
you're such a hot potato.

870
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,870
You have to ask them about this.

871
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,430
Stop woolgathering!

872
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,600
This book is very popular recently.

873
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,390
Unprecedented masterpiece.

874
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,000
Fan Xian

875
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,120
is a bit straightforward.

876
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,120
He is a funny man and extraordinary.

877
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,470
Not many people in the capital city

878
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,870
get praise like this

879
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,670
from you.

880
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,390
How about a meeting with him tomorrow?

881
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,430
No, let's wait a bit more

882
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,870
and see how it goes.

883
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,560
Alright!

884
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,470
What are you doing?

885
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,760
Why did you dash downstairs

886
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,630
just now?

887
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,560
Didn't you notice

888
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,840
he insulted your book?

889
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,390
Why would you care about it while I didn't?

890
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,870
We are going to sell the book together

891
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,000
but he tried to ban it.

892
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,230
Cutting off my road to wealth

893
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,630
is no worse than killing my parents.

894
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,870
Who promised to work with you?

895
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
Don't you think about it? It's lucrative!

896
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,430
You're really quick at calculating.

897
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,520
Just so so.

898
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,080
That doesn't matter.

899
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,710
Think about it carefully.

900
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,230
Shall we work together?

901
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,470
Why do you want to sell books?

902
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,560
To make money,

903
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,430
of course.

904
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,870
Why do you want to make money?

905
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,710
What do you mean?

906
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,390
Do you plan to buy something expensive

907
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,190
with the money you make

908
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,150
or to go to the casino or the brothel?

909
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,910
I haven't thought about those.

910
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,190
I just enjoy making money.

911
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,280
Don't look at me like that.

912
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,280
Do you agree?

913
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,190
You must do me a favor.

914
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,040
What is it?

915
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,840
No one is here. You could get off.

916
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,280
What's going on?

917
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,870
Take the carriage back to the residence directly

918
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,320
and don't let anyone know

919
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,040
I have left.

920
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,040
Where are you going?

921
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,760
Stop asking, or I'll not let you sell my book.

922
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,150
It's pointless to threaten me.

923
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,800
My sister is here.

924
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,520
She is most afraid to lie.

925
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
She can't help you for sure.

926
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,230
Am I right, sister?

927
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,910
Just go, brother!

928
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,280
Don't worry. I'll watch over him

929
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,470
and stop him from leaking.

930
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,230
Eh...

931
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,710
Don't leak!

932
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,600
The way you treat me

933
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,230
is totally different from the way

934
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,280
you treat him.

935
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,800
Turn left at the entrance of the alley

936
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,910
and go east all the way to Tianhe street.

937
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,150
You'll find the Investigator's Office.

938
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,870
Send them back to the residence.

939
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,320
I can find it on my own.

940
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,000
You're the Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

941
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,520
Do you still need to sneak in?

942
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,870
Don't let anyone know

943
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,870
my identity as the Director-General.

944
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,000
The files of your family whereabouts

945
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,080
is D No. 534,

946
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,710
right?

947
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,320
Yes!

948
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,320
Wait for my good news.

949
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,950
Thanks!

950
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,630
Think about where to open

951
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,840
the book shop.

952
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,840
We'll discuss it when I come back.

953
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,840
So you agree with it?

954
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,870
Don't let anyone see you.

955
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,230
Hooray!

956
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,950
Hawthorn on sticks!

957
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,280
Hawthorn on sticks!

958
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,150
Hawthorn on sticks!

959
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,840
Hawthorn on sticks!

960
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,360
Hawthorn on sticks!

961
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,360
Sure, sir!

962
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,080
Hawthorn on sticks!

963
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,150
Hawthorn on sticks!

964
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,320
Gotta pick the store for printing.

965
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
And the paper as well.

966
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,800
All the illegal books

967
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,000
out there

968
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,950
must be collected,

969
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,040
or they will have a bad impact on my sales.

970
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,190
All these must be taken into consideration

971
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,190
and get prepared.

972
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,670
Did we reach already?

973
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,320
We are stuck.

974
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,630
Let's retreat and make way for them.

975
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,560
Sure!

976
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,320
Miss Fan, hold on a second!

977
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,600
Who is it?

978
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,670
The girl from the Ye family

979
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,320
who likes messing around from day to night.

980
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,800
I remember her now.

981
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,800
Is it the girl

982
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,760
who gave you two cases of diamonds and jewelries

983
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,520
every Spring Festival?

984
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,430
No, not she!

985
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,120
It's Ye Ling'er,

986
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,840
the daughter of Chief Guard of the capital city.

987
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,320
Just send her away!

988
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,320
Ye Ling'er is not a big deal.

989
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,120
I feel like she has other companies.

990
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,710
Who else did you see?

991
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,040
It's the carriage from the Fan mansion.

992
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,620
In the river of history,

993
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,820
time goes round and round.

994
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Memories about the former and present lives

995
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,060
join each other in an endless way.

996
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,660
In the long drunken Milky Way,

997
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,380
one season follows another in a flash,

998
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,580
and the wild geese are flying south.

999
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,500
I just can't give up

1000
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
to be with you for my whole life.

1001
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,780
I have been hovering in the dreams
for hundreds and thousands of times.

1002
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,580
I can't even say a word when I watch the flowers falling.

1003
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,460
Year after year in the wandering,

1004
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,020
I count the remaining years.

1005
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,220
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

1006
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,780
even though we have ended up the destiny,

1007
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,460
I never feel regretful.

1008
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,420
In such a chaotic world,

1009
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,180
I still miss you as ever.

1010
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,820
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

1011
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,540
With a gentle heart,

1012
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,100
I cherish our remaining years.

1013
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,940
Even though we have to go through

1014
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,900
all the hardships along the journey,

1015
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:40,220
you always stay by my side,

1016
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,980
watching the falling flowers, speechlessly.

1017
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,900
Year after year in the wandering,

1018
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,260
I count the remaining years.

1019
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,620
Even though we can't meet each other anymore,

1020
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,420
even though we end up the destiny,

1021
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,860
I never feel regretful.

1022
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,780
In such a chaotic world,

1023
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,740
I still miss you as ever.

1024
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,420
I can't fall asleep under the moon.

1025
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,180
With a gentle heart,

1026
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,580
I cherish our remaining years.

1027
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,380
Even though we have to go through

1028
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,540
all the hardships along the journey,

1029
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:20,820
you always stay by my side...
