1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040


2
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,090
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,310
Kitty!  Kang!

4
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,310
Jin Kang!

5
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,170
Yoo Jin Kang!

6
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,580
Liar! I have the umbrella right here.

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,370
I'm heading over to the bus station.

8
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,440
Oppa!

9
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,760
Over here!  Here!

10
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,230
 Episode 5 

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,300
When will the doctor arrive?

12
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,820
When the test results come in.

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,320
Why?

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,170
Oh. It's nothing.

15
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,360
How do you know her?

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,730
Just in passing.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,860
You'll need to feed her.

18
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,750
There's nothing out of the ordinary. She's just malnourished. Should I order a nutrient supplement?

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,790
Yes. So, you're saying there's nothing else really wrong?

20
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,850
The blood results showed signs of sedatives, but maybe about six pills worth?

21
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,340
It would be difficult to say she took enough for attempted suicide.

22
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,150
The two of you seem to need treatment more.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,260
Are you okay?

24
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,410
I'm... Oh!

25
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,220
Why?

26
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,230
It's throbbing.

27
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,550
- Ow, that hurts! When did that happen?
 - Ouch!

28
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,950
You dummy. You didn't even know you pulled a ligament.

29
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,510
There are many people who don't realize for days, until it gets really swollen.

30
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,150
But what should we do? Do we wait until she wakes up?

31
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,130
Please, be more careful.

32
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,020
Do you have Kim Moo Yeong's contact info?

33
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,280
Kim Moo Yeong? Why?

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,260
You have it? Why? Why do you have it?

35
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,050
Why can't I? Why are you asking so suddenly?

36
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,160
He is close to her.  Perhaps he can contact her family.

37
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,710
Please make him hurt more.  A lot.

38
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,540
Okay.

39
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,570
Yeah.

40
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,180
 Thank goodness you're not asleep yet. 

41
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,860
Why?

42
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,580
 You know Im Yoo Ri, right? 

43
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,610
Yoo Ri?

44
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,680
Why are you here? You couldn't contact her family?

45
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,900
Is she okay?

46
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,010
Yes. She's just sleeping.

47
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,000
The test result showed signs of sedatives, but it was just enough to sleep.

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,410
- I'm asking if you're okay, your arm.
 - Oh.

49
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,600
I just pulled a ligament. I have to wear this, that's all.

50
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,860
- It suits you. 
 - Really?

51
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,760
I look good in blue.

52
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,990
Oh, it just came to me.

53
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,400
She's the one who watched the movie with you, right?

54
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,740
Oppa, I've seen her before.

55
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,430
She saw a movie with him awhile ago.

56
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,180
Really?

57
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,590
You were probably shocked after the call.  Can we talk for a minute?

58
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,700
I saw Im Yoo Ri's dashcam video. She was totally intentional.

59
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,450
She was watching near our house entrance for over two hours.

60
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,970
It's lucky I saw her.

61
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,930
If I weren't there, my Jin Kang...

62
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,030
What does this look like? Why did this happen?

63
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,780
Did you tell her to do it?

64
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,250
Wow, look how you jump to conclusions.

65
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,730
This definitely concerns you.

66
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,200
How?

67
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,040
I told Im Yoo Ri a couple of days ago

68
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,290
that I suspect you of Jeong Mi Yeon's murder.

69
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,740
I told her to be careful since she can get into a lot of trouble protecting a criminal.

70
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,900
Jeez, you spread rumors around the neighborhood well.

71
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,800
Even if you didn't order her,

72
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,730
she could have done it thinking I could endanger you.

73
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,260
No way.

74
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,040
I'll stay here, so you can go now.

75
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,420
Kim Moo Yeong.

76
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,160
Whether you believe it or not, I'm curious, too.

77
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,560
Why Yoo Ri did it... I'm as curious as you are.

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,760
When did you get so close to him?

79
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,270
You looked close to Kim Moo Yeong. You even speak comfortably.

80
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm not close to him at all.

81
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,600
Oppa, was it a sudden unintentional acceleration earlier?

82
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,040
No, it wasn't sudden acceleration.

83
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,260
Really? It's because you're so quick to cover me,

84
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,700
I was wondering if that was it. Then what was it?

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,170
She had taken those sedatives.

86
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,950
She must have dozed off driving. Don't worry yourself over it.

87
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
Dozed off driving?

88
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,090
Oh man. I freaked out for nothing, huh?

89
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,980
If you had really been hurt, you would have milked it like crazy.

90
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,430
Ow, it hurts! Oppa, it hurts so much!

91
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,790
You're embarrassed when you think about it, right?

92
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,730
Over a minor scrape. "Ow! Ow! Please be gentle!"

93
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,160
It was a major scrape. When did I?

94
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,790
"Oppa, it hurts! It hurts!"  You were always—

95
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,720
- When did I? 
 - You were always saying that!

96
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,760
You homely girl.

97
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,350
- Welcome.
 - Loyalty!

98
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,750
It's all gotten cold.

99
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,720
- Eat quickly!  There's no time.
 - Okay.

100
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,820
Because only two of us are meeting so early in the morning, it feels like we're on a secret mission.

101
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,920
What's wrong with your arm?

102
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,370
Wow, this was refreshing. This?  I fell down while bicycling.

103
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,340
Oh my, it's not like you're a kid. You should be careful.

104
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,890
Eat a lot. We don't have much time. Eat up.

105
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,310
Oppa.

106
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,460
How do you feel?

107
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,810
What happened? Why am I here?

108
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,530
Let's get out for now. I'll work on the discharge procedure.

109
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,400
Check the black box. You'll find out when you see.

110
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,570
- You're just leaving?
 - I'll call you later.

111
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,790
You should tell me what this is all about.

112
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,620
Ah, really! I don't remember anything.

113
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,160
Why did you bring me here?

114
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,930
It wasn't me. The police brought you here.

115
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,030
Police?

116
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,310
So Kim Moo Yeong has the skill of being able to remember everything after seeing it once.

117
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,050
And he knows Im Yoo Ri well. And his company's beer festival umbrella

118
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,280
was seen on the surveillance video.

119
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,160
Here.

120
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,530
And look at Jeong Mi Yeong's party photo.  The beer glass, it's the same, isn't it?

121
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,760
Yeah.

122
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,540
And the day the scooter was stolen was the day of Jeong Mi Yeon's incident. Street number 37-4.

123
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,410
The distance is only 400 meters away from Hewitt Villa.

124
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,790
Also, Kim Moo Yeong ...

125
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,790
is left-handed even though he says he's ambidextrous.

126
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,730
Then it's certain. Let's go right now.

127
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,010
Where?

128
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,590
We have to catch that punk. Won't something come out if we get him and question him?

129
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:21,680
Do you think we're still in '88? Sit down. Sit.

130
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,770
Questioning won't work with him. We need concrete evidence.

131
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,520
Concrete evidence?

132
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:37,030
What if Kim Moo Yeong is really the culprit?

133
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,950
Does anything seem strange to you?

134
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,760
If Kim Moo Yeong is the culprit?

135
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,830
CCTV.

136
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,630
CCTV?

137
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,200
If Kim Moo Yeong was the culprit, how could such a meticulous guy

138
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,390
have overlooked Jung Mi Yeon's villa's CCTV?

139
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,540
He knew ahead of time, that the villa's surveillance cameras there were fake.

140
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,220
That's right. For someone who cleaned the crime scene so well,

141
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,610
as soon as he opened the door and left, he would have thought of all the CCTV's lined up in a row.

142
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,750
You start by investigating everyone around Im Yoo Ri from the beginning.

143
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,320
Ah, Im Yoo Ri?

144
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,220
Everyone around Im Yoo Ri. Don't directly mess with her.

145
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,700
You know, start with Jung Mi Yeon's reference witnesses who know Im Yoo Ri.

146
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,690
How would Kim Moo Yeong have known the surveillance cameras weren't real?

147
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,100
If it wasn't Im Yoo Ri, then it was Jeong Mi Yeon. The biggest probability was between one of the two of them.

148
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,490
What will you be doing?

149
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm going to the control center.

150
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,590
Fortunately, we still have the public surveillance video.

151
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:48,000
We have to first find that umbrella. I'm sure that umbrella came from Hewitt Villa.

152
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm not going back to the office. Tell Team Leader Lee that I'm working outside, using the scooter as an excuse.

153
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,020
I'm sorry, CEO.

154
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,590
No, I think I'll be better after sleeping for a little bit.

155
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,610
If I feel better, I'll come to work in the afternoon. Okay.

156
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,690
- Will you be okay?
 - Yeah.

157
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm just a little cold.

158
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,290
Is this yours?

159
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,060
No, my brother's.

160
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,590
Thank you. Drive carefully.

161
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,720
 It wasn't me. The police brought you here. 

162
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,600
 Police? 

163
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,170
 The police officer knows who you are. 

164
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,340
 You almost killed his sister. 

165
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,950
  Flying 

166
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,990
What's the matter? Since earlier?

167
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,990
No, it's nothing. Do your work.

168
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,210
You must use this place for yourself?

169
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,780
Yes.

170
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,770
It was remodeled not long ago and the location is good.

171
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,550
Are you sure you want to sell it on these terms?

172
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,720
Yes. How long will it take?

173
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,790
With these terms, it will probably sell right away. As soon as it's listed.

174
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,190
That's good. Please go ahead with it.

175
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,000
 It's me Moo Yeong. You waited long for me, right? 

176
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,770
 We can meet now. Call me soon. 

177
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,990
 Seung Ah 

178
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,390
Moo Yeong? How is it going with Director Jang's wedding recipe?

179
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,760
Oh, do you want to see it?

180
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,030
Finish this up for me.

181
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,140
Has he no pride? Why would he make that?

182
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,160
- Are you working this hard?
 - You startled me!

183
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,300
So, did you catch Kim Moo Yeong?

184
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,450
Eom Cho Rong, that kid.

185
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,700
You know, that kid's this. This...

186
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,450
- This is so loose. So I adore him.
 - I know.

187
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,490
So, did you catch Kim Moo Yeong?

188
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,320
The umbrella should be appearing now, but it isn't.

189
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,630
Oh my gosh, that scared me. What is this?

190
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,200
It's because, I might run off like a crazy person.

191
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Why would you run off like a crazy person?

192
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,630
Because, I might do something to someone else's precious daughter.

193
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,970
What's going on? You're scaring me.

194
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,170
Are you mad?

195
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,590
It's true.

196
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,660
You know that I've stopped taking medicine since I met you.

197
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,720
I only had it once last night, because I really couldn't sleep.

198
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I know. Did that guy not come back? That police guy?

199
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,420
He didn't come.

200
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,510
Seriously though. Why did you do it?

201
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,320
Truthfully?

202
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,860
You promise that you won't get mad.

203
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,630
You know I don't make promises. I won't get mad, so tell me.

204
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,580
Did you want to scold that guy so he won't give me a hard time?

205
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,600
No! Am I crazy to mess with the police?

206
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,900
I'm annoyed as it is.

207
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,150
I didn't know she was that ahjussi's sister.

208
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,500
Then you followed her intentionally from the start, huh?

209
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,330
You did. Why?

210
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,640
What the heck is 'why?' Why are you looking for a reason? You should just lock her up.

211
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,290
If I locked her up, then what?

212
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,130
Ah, that's true.

213
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,050
It'll be over once she says she parked her car in front of your house and fell asleep.

214
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,350
In that case, we might not even be able to get the indictment.

215
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,290
- That's why we should be able to at least guess her motive.
 - Yeah.

216
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,510
It's strange the more I think about it.

217
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,940
I initially thought that she did this to frighten me.

218
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,640
- To convey that I shouldn't mess with Kim Moo Yeong.
 - Yeah.

219
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,420
But it's strange, you see. If I were the target from the start,

220
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,320
then it would've been more effective to wait at the police station; since I'm like clockwork when it comes to getting off work.

221
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,460
- That's true. 
 - So, then why in front of my house?

222
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,760
With no rhyme or reason, why was she in front of my house at that hour?

223
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,530
- And why Jin Kang instead of me?
 - Ah...

224
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,100
Per chance...

225
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,290
Jin Kang was her target from the beginning?

226
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,290
No way. There's no reason for that.

227
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,390
I know.

228
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,530
Kim Moo Yeong. Kim Moo Yeong.

229
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,150
Hey.

230
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,170
Is it because she is an orphan?

231
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,370
Is it because you're an orphan and she is too?

232
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,960
Then what is the reason?

233
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,760
Why are you only like that to her when she isn't even pretty?

234
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,950
What did I do just to her?

235
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,980
You like her.

236
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,380
You like her.

237
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,840
I do?

238
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,620
That's right. You like her.

239
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,350
Don't you even know that when an idiot like me is aware of it?

240
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,140
I'm not sure. I'll think about it.

241
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,540
Hey.

242
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,020
Don't go.

243
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,750
If you leave now, I'm going to tell everything.

244
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,790
I'll tell the police everything!

245
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,190
I remember everything now.

246
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,220
Like what?

247
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,940
What happened that night at Mi Yeon's place.

248
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to say everything.

249
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,540
Since I remember everything now.

250
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,460
Do as you please.

251
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,760
Hey Kim Moo Yeong!

252
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,560
You said you wouldn't get mad.

253
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,450
You're home.

254
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,730
You should eat rice. It doesn't taste good cold.

255
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,280
Potatoes are best when they're cold.

256
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,250
If you're sick, you should have called. You've been eating these all day, huh?

257
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,820
I slept for twelve hours, I didn't wake up once.

258
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,290
How commendable of you.

259
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,210
Where did you get this? I thought I lost it.

260
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,950
You left it in the hospital. Kim Moo Yeong gave it to me.

261
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,450
Where did you meet up with him when you didn't even go to work?

262
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,540
I met him at the bus stop in the morning, and he drove me home.

263
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,130
I told you not to be friendly with him. Geez.

264
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,140
You're like Eun Seung Ah's mom.

265
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,600
What?

266
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,230
She said to Eun Seung Ah, "Don't play with a girl named Jin Kang in class."

267
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,840
You got really mad because of that. Don't you remember Eun Seung Ah's mom?

268
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,060
You're just like that ajumma right now.

269
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,290
Is this the same situation as back then?

270
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,830
If that woman would have seen you at least once and said that, then I wouldn't feel unjust.

271
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,740
That woman had no rhyme or reason!

272
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,360
What aspect can I be similar to her?

273
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,710
I've been curious for a while.

274
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,340
- Why do you dislike him  so much? 
  - That is because...

275
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,960
Well...

276
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,040
He gives off bad vibes. Really bad.

277
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,330
I was right.

278
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,730
- Hello, Eun Seung Ah's Mother. You've been well? 
 - Don't. Stop it.

279
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,470
- Cold potatoes are the best, Eun Seung Ah's Mother.
 - I said to stop.

280
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,920
Oppa. Saying not to play with someone because she doesn't have parents,

281
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,030
or not to play with someone because he doesn't give out a good feeling;

282
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,860
'No rhyme or reason' applies to both.

283
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,570
I better become more friendly with him in the future.

284
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,560
Yoo Jin Kang. Yoo Jin Kang. I'm not joking around.

285
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,360
Oppa, don't be like that to him.

286
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,820
He is also...

287
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,650
 I don't know, because I never had a mother. 

288
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,160
What about him? What?

289
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,560
He is also from Haesan.

290
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,740
Let's not be intolerant when we came from the same hometown.

291
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,360
 You like her. 

292
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,760
 I do? 

293
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,690
- Get in. 
- Get in?

294
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,910
- Put your seat belt on.
 - Okay.

295
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,670
What's going on?

296
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,240
Where's your office?

297
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,110
Sinsadong. Are you going to drive me all the way to work?

298
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,030
Wow, amazing. It works for me,

299
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,740
but why is this neighborhood so nice?

300
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,730
You seem lively today.

301
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,510
Why? You want me to get off if I'm feeling well?

302
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,700
No. I'm not lively at all. Let's just get to the office.

303
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,950
 You like her.  Don't you even know that when an idiot like me is well aware of it? 

304
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,160
Is your friend Yoo Ri doing better?

305
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,010
Seriously, how do you know her?

306
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,270
Yoo Ri is not a woman to me. Got it?

307
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:45,040
Did I say anything? All I asked was how do you know her.

308
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,870
We're here. Just drop me off at the signal.

309
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,950
Come out thirty minutes early tomorrow. Our date was too short.

310
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,050
Thanks for today.

311
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,360
Five minutes with you is usually perfect. No wonder I've been feeling uneasy.

312
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,960
Let's date.

313
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,800
I like you.

314
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,780
Crazy fool.

315
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,380
See, you make me curse at you as usual.

316
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,680
I said I like you.

317
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,700
Crazy.

318
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,010
I know, right? But there's something I need to verify.

319
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,360
I think I might be, but also I don't think so.

320
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,800
We probably should see each other more to be sure, right?

321
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,710
I don't care if you're being mental all on your own, but

322
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,970
when I really think about Seung Ah, it feels hopeless.

323
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,410
You should modify the way you think.

324
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,000
Don't be late tomorrow.

325
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,110
Just so you know, if you don't want to let go of that police officer, you can date both of us.

326
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,960
I don't care at all!

327
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Isn't that a little rude? Didn't you hear? I saved your life and even took you to the hospital.

328
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,930
What's he saying?

329
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,820
Okay. I'll just get to the point.

330
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,600
One is a question and one is a request.

331
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,340
You have to do both for me, got it?

332
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,780
One.

333
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,830
Why did you do that to my sister?

334
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,510
Because I was annoyed.

335
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,970
What?

336
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,230
What made you so annoyed? Was it me? Or was it...

337
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,300
No way.

338
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,800
To my sister?

339
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,730
I was annoyed at your sister. Is that enough?

340
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,740
You...

341
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,190
Hey. Are you saying

342
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,930
that you really tried to kill my sister on purpose?

343
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,080
I guess so.

344
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,250
You guess so?

345
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,060
You said I tried to hit her with my car.

346
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,300
Okay.

347
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,810
Then...

348
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,240
Why exactly?

349
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,080
Let's hear the reason.

350
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,950
I don't want to tell you.

351
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,340
You don't want to tell me?! Hey! You deliberately tried to kill someone and you don't want to tell me?

352
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,190
Your sister was an orphan, wasn't she?

353
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,460
What? An orphan? Who said that?! What orphan when I'm her family!

354
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,620
Where did you hear such a thing?!

355
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,970
I heard the two of them talking.

356
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,860
The two of them, who?

357
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,000
Kim Moo Yeong and your sister.

358
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,160
They were saying how both of them were orphans.

359
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,940
They were two peas in a pod since then.

360
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,790
Then...

361
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,020
Is this why you did it?

362
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,680
Because you misunderstood my sister's relationship with Kim Moo Yeong?

363
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,630
What did I misunderstand?

364
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,120
Of course, it's a misunderstanding! I don't know where you heard such a thing!

365
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,690
His girlfriend is another girl. Not my sister, but a different girl.

366
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,410
Why is that important?

367
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,010
Kim Moo Yeong likes your sister.

368
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,490
What?

369
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,790
Kim Moo Yeong likes your sister.

370
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,860
Okay, anyway...

371
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,690
Anyway, that's not it. You misunderstood that.

372
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:55,240
Second, promise me one thing. This is not a request, but a warning.

373
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:01,200
Don't ever touch my sister ever again.

374
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,290
I can't do that.

375
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,240
What?

376
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,630
I can't keep such a promise.

377
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,850
You little brat...

378
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,250
Hey! Someone like you...

379
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,050
- needs to be jailed to come to your senses!
 - It hurts!

380
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,410
Does it hurt? This is painful? This?

381
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,100
Im Yoo Ri, I'm arresting you for attempted murder.

382
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,740
You have the right to remain silent, and the right to an attorney.

383
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,740
And starting now, everything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

384
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,890
Officer Yoo!

385
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,980
Today's menu is celebration noodles.

386
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,010
Get out.

387
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,530
Who's this?

388
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,260
She's a suspect for an attempted murder. Lock her up.

389
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,570
What is it?

390
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,860
What happened for you to bring her in?

391
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,880
Manager, this is major news. Im Yoo Ri—

392
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,220
Later.

393
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,000
Where are you going?

394
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,590
Why is he like that? Did something happen?

395
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,730
Let's go eat.

396
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,860
What? So Jin Kang almost died because of Im Yoo Ri?

397
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,290
Yeah. That's why he's like that.

398
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,830
Oh.

399
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,030
What should I do?

400
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,950
Hey, hey.

401
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,330
Sit down.

402
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,760
I said sit.

403
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,510
I knew it. What are you going to tell her?

404
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,440
Are you going to say, "Someone tried to hit you with a car!"

405
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,410
Don't say anything. You're just going to make her anxious.

406
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,090
Don't do it.

407
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,370
Don't do it, okay?

408
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,850
Okay.

409
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,240
- Hui Jin, hurry up. Hurry. 
 - Yes, yes.

410
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,180
Here you go.

411
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,150
How about starting the day after tomorrow?

412
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,720
Let's do that.

413
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,330
Director, while you're here, you should check the wedding recipe before you go.

414
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,440
Hold on.

415
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,740
It's really the best of the best.

416
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:35,170
This time Kim Moo Yeong's recipe is completely unique.

417
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,890
- What's wrong? You tasted it. It was good, wasn't it? 
 - It was.

418
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,450
How is Kim Moo Yeong? Is he vital to the company?

419
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,940
Pardon?

420
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,190
What the heck? He picked out Moo Yeong to take charge of his wedding beer not long ago.

421
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,210
I think the wedding fell through.

422
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,800
Wow, really?

423
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,320
Yes, the rumor is going around.

424
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,920
What does that have to do with Moo Yeong? Why does he want us to fire Moo Yeong?

425
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,270
If he is the majority shareholder, then that's all he he is.

426
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,290
Who is he to tell someone to fire their employee? It made me furious.

427
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,310
 To: Moo Yeong 

428
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,730
 Moo— 

429
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,220
Yeah, Jin Kang, just a minute!

430
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,180
- You're here?
 - How have you been?

431
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,340
It's been so long.

432
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,510
- I know, right? 
- I'm going to forget your face at this rate...

433
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,440
What happened to your arm?

434
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,130
- I fell.
 - You should be more careful.

435
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,150
What is all this? Are you moving studios?

436
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,500
No, it's not that.

437
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,980
Then?

438
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,510
Unni,

439
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,930
I'm planning to leave with Moo Yeong.

440
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,520
Leave?

441
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,820
- $2.3 million? 
  - Yes.

442
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,780
How are you going to...? Can you do that behind your parents' back?

443
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,920
They bought this for me anyway.

444
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,880
But still, this isn't right.

445
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,610
What about him? I mean him, does he agree with this?

446
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,670
Um, I'm going to tell him tomorrow.

447
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:57,230
I'm sure he'll be happy. He's had a hard time because of me.

448
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,750
If you leave?

449
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,500
where will you go?

450
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,100
Um, somewhere nobody knows.

451
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,020
Where is that, in this day and age?

452
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,650
Of course, there is. Greece or Morocco.

453
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,630
We can build a house near the sea and live secretly where nobody knows.

454
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,470
Or else, Haesan?

455
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:26,150
Moo Yeong is from Haesan. If he wants to, I'm fine going there, too.

456
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,190
Seung Ah.

457
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,680
Jin Kang, Moo Yeong's family is so funny.

458
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,290
His family?

459
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:38,310
He must have had a really big family when he was young. He lived with his aunts.

460
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,080
He said his mom and aunts wore the same clothes every day.

461
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,590
Really. He said they wore the same clothes all year. Isn't that funny?

462
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,030
Yeah.

463
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,020
Is that what he said?

464
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,410
Yeah.

465
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,200
Yes, Cho Rong.

466
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,550
Yes, it's me.

467
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,720
What are we really going to do with Im Yoo Ri?

468
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,710
 We'll have to arrest her somehow. 

469
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,240
Arrest her? Exactly.

470
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,650
We need something to send her to jail. Did you find anything?

471
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,740
Yeah.

472
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,000
Did you find something? She's dead meat.

473
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,140
Manager, they say she's completely psycho.

474
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,070
Is that so?

475
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,640
Yes, all the reference witnesses I met say that.

476
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,900
And she's been seeing a psychiatrist since she was young.

477
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,260
So, she even appeared in some famous book or something.

478
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,230
The title is,

479
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,840
Yang Kyeong Mo's Living With Trauma.

480
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,300
How do you know that?

481
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,120
Are you sure?

482
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,890
 Yeah. I heard it directly from a reference witness I met earlier. 

483
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,930
Jeong Mi Yeon said that Im Yoo Ri was in some book.

484
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,650
- Is that so? 
 - Yeah. 

485
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,740
 Oh, that's right. Also, this is big news. 

486
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,650
 Im Yoo Ri is the daughter of some big-name family. 

487
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,740
 You know that Hajin Obstetrics? 

488
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,750
 There's one in Gangnam, Ilsan, and Bundang. 

489
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,560
 Anyway, that Hajin Obestetrics. 

490
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,620
 She's their youngest daughter. 

491
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,400
 She had a sister and brother above her, and they both... 

492
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,000
 Soo Jeong first attempted suicide 

493
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,100
 when she was barely nine years old. 

494
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,130
Ms. Im Yoo Ri. Ms. Im Yoo Ri.

495
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:15,470
 She had taken a whole bottle of pain relievers and was discovered in the study 

496
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,090
 by the housekeeper. 

497
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,220
 Yoo Ri! Yoo Ri! 

498
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,060
 After almost two months of therapy, she wouldn't say a word. 

499
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,900
 I would sometimes pick up a brush that she dropped while playing with her doll. 

500
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,420
 And she would accept the doll clothes I held out to her. 

501
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,020
 But the child continuously behaved as if she were alone. 

502
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,570
 Yoo Ri, how do you feel today? 

503
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:50,160
 During our eighth meeting, for the first time, 

504
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,390
 I heard her voice. 

505
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,510
 The first thing Soo Jeong said to me was, 

506
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,500
 Doctor 

507
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,770
 - "Can you see me, Doctor?"
 - Can you 

508
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,260
 see me, Doctor? 

509
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:06,210
 Mom doesn't see me. 

510
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,150
 She said, "My mom doesn't see me." 

511
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,630
I told you to come out thirty minutes earlier.

512
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,280
Now I'm late, too, because of you.

513
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,020
 Kim Moo Yeong 

514
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,880
 Do you even know what Seung Ah is thinking? 

515
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,340
Piss off.

516
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,620
Hey, where are you going?

517
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,110
You need to go to jail. Where are you going?!

518
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,490
Why is she leaving right now?

519
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,760
Officer Yoo said to let her go because there was insufficient evidence.

520
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,720
Insufficient evidence?

521
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:17,580
Evid... What? I'm so annoyed!

522
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,370
What are you doing by yourself?

523
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:24,750
She should have  been locked up. Manager said to let Im Yoo Ri go.

524
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,700
Why?

525
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,370
Insufficient evidence. He said he found evidence though.

526
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:32,770
And can't we just find evidence after locking her up? I'm so mad! Seriously!

527
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,200
Should I go get her again?

528
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,280
Really...

529
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,800
Who's that? Isn't it Oh Ba Reun?

530
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,750
Oh Ba Reun?

531
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,520
Hello. Hello, hi. Why are you here?

532
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,350
Rookie, be good.

533
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,830
I'm not the rookie now.

534
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,590
How about if you go to Eagle Brewery for a little bit?

535
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,690
If you're okay with it, I can work it out.

536
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,630
Don't ask why. It's just for a little while.

537
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,890
 An Shim's PC 

538
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,230
Why did you release Im Yoo Ri?

539
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,950
Release her? We have to have evidence to lock her up.

540
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:36,360
It's a bust. A big bust.

541
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,620
I thought so, too.

542
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,760
So, what do you think I brought for you?

543
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,470
What?

544
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:51,050
Should I give this to you or not?

545
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,190
This.

546
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,450
You punk. I'm your elder. Are you teasing me--

547
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,600
KICS, Korea Information System of Criminal Justice Services.

548
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,420
As I was looking at the college female's murder case in Wonyeong-dong data,

549
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,520
I got it open.

550
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,440
Really? How?

551
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,800
- Oh Ba Reun.
 - Oh Ba Reun?

552
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,670
 Tell him to come out here! 

553
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,380
 Where is that ajussi? 

554
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,780
 Why isn't he looking for my scooter?! 

555
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,710
 Do you know how much it cost me to settle it? 

556
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,530
 Come out! Come out here! 

557
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,380
 Hey... 

558
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,190
 - Do you really want to find your scooter?
 - Yes. 

559
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,000
 So when I said that, that cute punk... 

560
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,850
 Hey! 

561
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,590
 You guys are really... 

562
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,450
 Aren't thieves people? 

563
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,350
 Don't thieves have civil rights? 

564
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,690
 Where is that ajussi? Where did he go? 

565
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:45,890
 Aigo! You can't find it. Officer Yoo stayed in the control center 

566
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,440
 and dug everywhere several days and nights, but 

567
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,020
 there was nothing. Not a thing. 

568
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,810
 It looks like we couldn't never find it with that public surveillance camera. 

569
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,300
 Seriously! Hurry up and find it! 

570
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,070
 Do something about him! 

571
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,020
 What else can I do? 

572
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,220
 Stop! Shh! 

573
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,480
 Should I try looking through Jeong Mi Yeon's folder then? 

574
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,680
So?

575
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,270
I've swiped all the data.

576
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,070
The surveillance cameras within a 1 km radius of the incident.

577
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,120
And even the dashcam videos of the cars in the area.

578
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,830
Eom Cho Rong, you!

579
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,260
It hurts, it hurts.

580
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,200
I'm sorry, sorry.

581
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,430
Hui Joon.

582
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,650
Excuse me, Hui Joon.

583
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,190
What is it?

584
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,020
He got fired?!

585
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,980
Yes. Because of you.

586
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,860
This really isn't right!

587
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,740
Dating and work are separate things.

588
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,370
Are rich people like that?

589
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:25,420
Excuse me, Hui Joon.

590
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:31,130
I'm sorry. But just tell Moo Yeong to call me once.

591
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,450
What was that? You didn't even answer your phone.

592
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,230
I'm sorry.

593
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,350
I got worried thinking you were sick.

594
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,650
Oh? Is that so? I'm sorry for making you worry.

595
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:00,420
No, it's okay.

596
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,160
I heard everything from Hui Joon. I'm sorry, because of me...

597
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,480
No, it's okay. I can just get another job.

598
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,570
No, you don't have to get another job.

599
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,870
Moo Yeong, you don't need to get another job.

600
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,180
You were going to quit working there anyway.

601
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:31,590
I told you that I'm going to be clever from now on.

602
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,160
I've prepared everything now.

603
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,020
Let's leave.

604
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,290
Yes, Seung Ah.

605
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,700
Seung Ha.

606
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,680
Unni.

607
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,830
What's wrong? What happened?

608
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,350
It's all my fault.

609
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,220
What's all your fault?

610
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,460
 We're really rich, aren't we? 

611
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,040
 We are rich. 

612
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,840
 Where do you want to go? 

613
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,880
 I'm not sure. 

614
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,500
 I like some place warm. 

615
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,520
 How about Greece? 

616
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,600
 Greece? 

617
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,810
 When we leave, I'm not going to bring anything. 

618
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,450
 Really. I'm just going to carry one handbag. 

619
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,600
 Should we go? 

620
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,060
 Yeah. 

621
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,280
 But, where to? 

622
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,290
 Home. To write a resume. 

623
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,030
 What? 

624
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,800
 I have to start looking for a job tomorrow. 

625
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,110
 Moo Yeong. 

626
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,640
I hurt his pride.

627
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,780
He has a lot of pride. And I brought up money to him.

628
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,880
I feel so stupid.

629
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,750
Seung Ah.

630
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,700
I hate Oppa Woo Sang so much.

631
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,700
Seung Ah, are you really going to leave with him?

632
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:46,350
No matter how much you like him, how is that possible?

633
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,600
Why not? We can't do anything if we stay here.

634
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:57,030
You know that, too. My mom, and Woo Sang...

635
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,690
At least take your time.

636
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,990
- Learn more about him, too.
 - About what?

637
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,720
Unni, why should I see and learn more about him?

638
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,840
Of course, you should get to know him—if he's right for you.

639
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,190
You met him only two months ago.

640
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,580
Of course, you should get to know each other better.

641
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,650
Okay.

642
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,120
I understand what you're saying. And I know it's because you're worried for me.

643
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,710
But you don't know him. That's why you're saying this.

644
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,620
What is it? After avoiding me all that time.

645
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,520
Have you been waiting for me all morning?

646
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,720
Yeah.

647
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,810
What is it?

648
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,190
What are you going to do about Seung Ah?

649
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,810
What do you mean?

650
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,440
Do you at least really love her?

651
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,810
No.

652
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,530
What?

653
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:29,860
She didn't get the drift after I ignored all her calls, so I told her everything yesterday.

654
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,840
What did you say?

655
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,730
Seung Ah is attractive, but

656
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:41,090
I mean, isn't it a bit much to abandon everything and leave?

657
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:47,660
So I told her there's no such thing as love in this world and that I never loved her.

658
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:53,230
As someone who believes love doesn't exist, why did you mess with Seung Ah's heart?

659
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,260
I was just checking. It's like going to church.

660
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:02,540
Even if you know there isn't a god, if the church is really pretty, you go in and check.

661
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,060
But as you expect, there isn't one.

662
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:12,280
So, what you're saying is that you can go in if you want, and leave when you want.

663
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,060
Because it's how you feel?

664
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,580
Right.

665
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:23,180
Then, you're saying it doesn't matter to you how the other person is left feeling.

666
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,250
It's up to that person to deal with it.

667
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,020
Somewhat.

668
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,380
Have you ever sincerely liked another person even once?

669
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,620
Yeah, you.

670
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,400
A person's heart really means nothing to you, does it?

671
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,420
What kind of look is that?

672
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,030
I feel sorry for you.

673
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,120
Hey!

674
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,730
You're here?

675
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,120
Why are you out here? Is someone in the office?

676
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,120
No, nobody is there on the day off.

677
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,830
Then why are you out here? Let's go inside.

678
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,960
But, my mom made bone broth again.

679
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,700
She's already at the terminal.

680
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,150
- You should go.
 - Seriously. Why are all mothers like that?

681
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:02,560
Kid! You think all mothers are like that?

682
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,580
Hurry up and go. She's waiting.

683
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,760
Manager! Did you find anything?

684
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,380
It's about to get real. Wanna see?

685
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,880
Yes.

686
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,750
Here is Hewitt Villa.

687
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,120
This is the only place the umbrella was recorded.

688
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,820
Look.

689
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:36,130
It takes a while to get there. But there's a route that completely avoids all surveillance cameras.

690
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,770
Like this.

691
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,100
You're right.

692
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,630
This is the central point.

693
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,560
The first side street that intersects Hewitt Villa and the back door.

694
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,250
Fortunately, many cars passed this way at that hour.

695
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,380
7589...

696
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,970
That's a bust.

697
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,830
Next is 286.

698
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,120
7968.

699
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,690
Eight.

700
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,530
 What is that look? 

701
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,560
 I feel sorry for you. 

702
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,170
 License number 18 MYO 7865 

703
01:03:53,110 --> 01:04:00,060

705

 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes
 ~ Preview ~ 

706
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,020
 I might go and ask. 

707
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,390
 Kim Moo Yeong. 

708
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,010
 Do you still think I killed her? 

709
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,270
 Even if he doesn't budge, I feel it for certain, 

710
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,690
 that he feels nervous. 

711
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,400
 There's nothing to see. You've seen a burn scar before. 

712
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,300
 Haesan. 

713
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,070
 You're totally fine. 

714
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,840
 After making me unable to do anything all day long. 

715
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,610
 What are you doing? 

716
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,200
 I was standing guard in case he kisses you. 

717
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,740
 Why? Do you regret it? 

718
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,140
 Do you like Jin Kang? 

719
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,690
 Yeah. 

720
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,360
 Seung Ah. 

721
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,260
 What about you? Do you like Moo Yeong, too? 

722
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,330
