00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,200
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

2
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,050
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,340
 Dad! 

4
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,880
It was a younger sister.

5
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,700
 Episode 15 

6
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,930
What is it at this hour...?

7
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,690
- Tell me.
 - You're sweating.

8
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,490
Tell me. What's so important that I don't know.

9
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,390
Are you shaking?

10
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,680
Why are you shakin—

11
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,480
I said tell me. What's so important that I don't know?

12
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,170
You came already knowing. Why ask me?

13
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,070
That's right.

14
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:53,480
Yoo Jin Kang is the real sister you were searching so hard for.

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,460
She's truly your biological sister.

16
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,240
 Where did you disappear to leaving only the ointment? 

17
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,270
 At this rate, "Waiting for a long time" will become my specialty. 

18
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,920
 Hurry up, and come. 

19
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,170
 Are you really okay with me as I am? 

20
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,900
 Of course. 

21
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,030
 I wish I could be reborn. 

22
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,030
Where were you?

23
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,610
I asked where you were?

24
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,900
You have my keys, right?

25
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,410
Keys?

26
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,010
Did you lose your keys?

27
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,010
It's over. Let's end it here.

28
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,030
What?

29
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,660
You want to break up?

30
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,700
Kim Moo Yeong!

31
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,970
Kim Moo Yeong.

32
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,210
Go.

33
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,920
What are you doing?

34
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,020
We were just at the amusement park 12 hours ago.

35
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,000
And we came home and ate together, and slept together.

36
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,650
And you left to buy me ointment for my injury.

37
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,950
That was just four hours ago.

38
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,600
Tell me.

39
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,000
What happened to you during those four hours?

40
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,550
You don't get it?

41
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm dumping you.

42
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,630
Stop it!

43
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,490
Tell me the real reason.

44
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,130
What reasons are there for people for their feelings to change?

45
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,020
I've seen that expression a lot already.

46
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,770
You're trying to force it and persisting.

47
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,570
You look like that when you say things you don't mean.

48
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,950
When your mind is closed.

49
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,360
So just tell me. What happened to you?

50
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Who hurt you like this?

51
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,410
Wow. You've gotten confidence out of nowhere.

52
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm dumping you.

53
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,950
Why? You think you're the only special one?

54
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,990
Don't you remember Seung Ah?

55
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,770
I'm doing the same thing to you.

56
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,970
Tell me about you.

57
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,740
You can't even talk about yourself.

58
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,980
How dare you bring her up?

59
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,920

90
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,960
 It's over. Let's end it here. 

91
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,190
 So tell me. What happened to you. 

92
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,750
 I'm dumping you. 

93
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,330
 Why? You think you're the only special one? 

94
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,010
You're lying.

95
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,740
You told me not to leave.

96
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,140
You told me to stay no matter what, even if you told me to go.

97
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,580
 Even if you tell me you don't like me, I'm not going anywhere. 

98
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,560
 Don't go even if I tell you I don't like you. 

99
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,150
 You're going to tell me you don't like me? 

100
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,440
 I'm telling you not to go no matter what. 

101
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,760
 Even if I tell you I don't like you, it's a hundred percent lie. 

102
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,980
 Why would you lie lilke that? 

103
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,540
 I won't. 

104
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,200
 Don't. 

105
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
 I won't. 

106
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,320
 You better not. 

107
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,150
 I won't. I won't ever. 

108
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,180
Aren't you going to work? You want to get fired?

109
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,960
Tell me why you're like this. Tell me so that I can understand!

110
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,810
 NJ Corporation Group 

111
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,190
Is the Angel's Tear offer still valid?

112
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,920
Fortunately it still is.

113
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,940
That's good. I'll do it.

114
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,850
Do you really need a job, or are you playing another game with me?

115
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,350
Who could inform me about the progress on the project? I'd like to start right away.

116
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,220
Tell Project Manager to come in.

117
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,920
In any case, welcome.

118
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,060
Accept everything that the company offers, without refusing.

119
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,820
Of course.

120
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,920
We're planning to do a buy one get one promotion,

121
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,140
since the shop is located in the middle of office buildings. An office worker in his 20's or 30's ....

122
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,230
Aren't you curious why Kim Moo Yeong suddenly came back to me?

123
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,270
I am curious.

124
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,870
I found the key.

125
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,910
The all purpose key to get Kim Moo Yeong moving.

126
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,550
Tell me. Why you're doing this.

127
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,810
Just once.

128
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,820
Think about it just once.

129
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,800
The times we've come through together.

130
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,350
From the time we met until we fell in love.

131
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,960
How much we've endured to get here.

132
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,920
Think about it just once.

133
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,430
Kim Moo Yeong.

134
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,610
Kim Moo Yeong!

135
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,530
Kim Moo Yeong!

136
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,200

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,060
Open the door please.

141
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,410

142
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,840
Please open up! Please!

143
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,590

148
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,890
Kim Moo Yeong! Open the door!

149
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,460
Kim Moo Yeong!

150
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,830
 Kim Moo Yeong 

151
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,610
 Would you come get your sister? 

152
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,910
Kim Moo Yeong.

153
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,190
Kim Moo Yeong.

154
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,170
Kim Moo Yeong.

155
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,080
Jin Kang.

156
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,520
Oppa.

157
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,960
Get up.

158
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,510
Something is strange with him.

159
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,220
Get up!!

160
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,290
Let's go.

161
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,520
Oh!

162
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,970
Fever reducer, multivitamins...  It will be 112,000 Won.

163
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,850
Why is the cold so severe nowadays?

164
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,530
Thank you.

165
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,710
Kim Moo Yeong!

166
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,050
 Pharmacy 

167
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,690
Good job.

168
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,790
Good job for breaking up with Jin Kang.

169
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,130
It wasn't because of you.

170
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,620
I ended it with her because I got tired of her.

171
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,270
Whatever the case.

172
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,760
Take care of your sister, because it annoys me when she barges over.

173
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,810
This is the proposal to appoint Kim Moo Young Angel's Tear's CEO.

174
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,200
  Angel's Tears 
 Appointment of CEO Kim Moo Yeong 

175
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,940
Why don't you ask me what the all-purpose key is that I found?

176
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,850
What is the all-purpose key that you discovered?

177
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,170
 Certified Copy of Family Registry
 Kang Soon Goo 

178
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,200
This is Kang Soon Goo's family registry that I gave you.

179
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,080
 Wife: Lee Mi Young - Passed Away
 Child: Seon Ho 

180
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,230
Never mind.

181
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,030
I didn't find it. I created it.

182
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,990
You created it?

183
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,780
Our little friend believes Yoo Jin Kang is his sister.

184
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,590
His biological sister.

185
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,210
Pardon?

186
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,620
 Tell me. 

187
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,120
 What is so important that I don't know. 

188
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,560
 I pushed some buttons wondering what would happen. 

189
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,560
 You came already knowing, so why ask me? 

190
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,980
 That's right. 

191
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:29,140
 Yoo Jin Kang is the real sister you were so desperately searching for. 

192
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,040
 She is truly your biological sister. 

193
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:39,270
 The desperation in his eyes just shattered to pieces. I knew right away. 

194
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,960
 "It must be true." 

195
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,590
It's so exciting.

196
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,520
What am I to do? This is so exciting.

197
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,380
Goodness, Jin Kang.

198
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
My goodness.

199
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,930
The fever went down a little.

200
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,080
Eat some porridge so you can take medicine.

201
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,390
Yeah, just stay here. I'll get it.

202
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,250
 Hyung, let's go. 

203
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,770
 Angel's Tear 

204
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,720
The height of it is...

205
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,190
Clean up that area first.

206
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,840
You can see that this is the area for room 2.

207
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,360
I want to brighten here and make area 3 on the opposite side

208
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,800
darker.

209
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,390
Do you like it? I especially chose it myself.

210
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,100
A lot.

211
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,240
Why are you working so hard? I heard you practically live here.

212
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,710
Isn't it a given? The opening is right around the corner.

213
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,130
Tell me if you need anything.

214
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,390
What about your house?

215
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,180
Your style looks amazing, and the car suits you. What about your house?

216
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,970
Are you planning to keep living there?

217
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,440
I should sleep at my real house.

218
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,320
Then what about everything else? It makes it sound as if everything else is fake.

219
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,090
Don't you have a time like that?

220
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,980
When you are more desperate for the fake?

221
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,330
Wrap up your neck better.

222
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,860
Okay.

223
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,860
Colds pass, you know?

224
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:53,390
Even severe colds all pass in time.

225
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,530
Yeah.

226
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,320
What do you feel like for dinner?

227
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,750
Cod stew. You felt like eating it.

228
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,570
I won't be late tonight, so I'll do the shopping.

229
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,730
Okay! Cod soup it is tonight! Have a good day.

230
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,670
You too.

231
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,740
See you.

232
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,080
Good morning.

233
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,430
Oh! Manager!

234
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,140
Are you okay? Do you feel better?

235
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,580
Sorry for leaving you all the work.

236
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,720
Not at all. It's not that.

237
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,690
Something major happened while you were gone.

238
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,930
Something major?

239
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,300
See? What did I tell you?

240
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,310
I told you Kim Moo Yeong was taking charge of Angel's Tear.

241
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,600
Huh?

242
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,210
It's definite. I heard Kim Moo Yeong practically lives there because it's opening soon.

243
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:11,440
CEO is upset, but what can be done? It's all in the past.

244
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:44,610
 See? What did I tell you? Kim Moo Yeong is taking charge of Angel's Tear. 

245
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,020
What do you want to eat?

246
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,470
I really, really, really hate you, but

247
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,350
I'm letting it slide since you were sick.

248
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,500
Oh, this is my chance.

249
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,690
- I should choose something good.
 - What? What do you want to eat?

250
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,930
No, no!

251
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,430
Why are you so dazed?

252
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,900
Why? Do you want a ride?

253
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,330
Tell me if you want a ride.

254
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,470
 Some days, 

255
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,030
 I really want to believe everything is over. 

256
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,010
 That he was always like that. 

257
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,360
 And I was the one who was deluded. 

258
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,480
 I try to think the worst of him. 

259
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,320
 The face of the worst person in this world. 

260
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,880
But in the end, I just can't.

261
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,720
Because all I can see

262
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,950
is all the other good sides of him.

263
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,860
I'm sorry to show up like this.

264
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,510
Not at all. I was pleased when you called.

265
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,700
I've wanted to meet you, so thank you for coming.

266
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,740
Doctor,

267
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,790
what kind of person is Kim Moo Yeong?

268
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,950
Well,

269
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,560
how could I know everything about him?

270
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,220
But you've known him since he was young.

271
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,720
I don't know about anything else, but

272
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,170
this one thing is for sure.

273
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,630
When Moo Yeong was young,

274
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,640
he had an amazing ability to look at the world with naked eyes. Think about it.

275
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:48,260
An intelligent and sensitive child such as Moo Yeong,

276
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,290
what kind of world he saw through those innocent eyes.

277
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,410
It probably was full of strange things.

278
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,380
And I was one of them.

279
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,980
 One day while fishing, I saw a child sitting there. 

280
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,450
 It was Moo Yeong. 

281
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,870
 You, 

282
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,860
 Hi, what are you doing here? 

283
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,520
 Why are you letting the fish go? 

284
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,860
 So they can return home. 

285
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,820
 So they can go home for dinner. 

286
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,640
 Hi! Would you like a drink? 

287
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,510
 He would come and watch every day after that. 

288
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,410
 He never spoke when I tried to get him to. 

289
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,940
 Bye. See you tomorrow. 

290
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,790
 So I ignored him and I just greeted him as I left. 

291
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,750
 Maybe it was a week after that? 

292
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:36,650
 For some reason, I didn't see him all day. 

293
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,210
 I was about to leave thinking he wasn't coming. But he came. 

294
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,360
 That's when I knew. 

295
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,400
 That he was being critical of me. 

296
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,720
 "You appear to be a good person, 

297
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,870
 and let the fish go as if you were doing a good deed, 

298
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,380
 but the fish died because of you." 

299
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,350
And I realized it was true.

300
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:06,790
As I was letting the fish go, I deluded myself into thinking that I was giving them freedom.

301
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,750
I didn't know I was actually hurting them.

302
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,190
I quit fishing that day.

303
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,340
I heard from the nuns that you went to Haesan with Moo Yeong.

304
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,410
The Sister said she asked Moo Yeong who you were.

305
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,730
 Who is she? 

306
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,510
And Moo Yeong responded,

307
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,290
 Someone I want to impress. 

308
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,200
 "Someone I want to impress." 

309
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,550
If Moo Yeong, who couldn't give his heart to anyone in this world,

310
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,910
learns how to love here even just a little,

311
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,320
perhaps it's because he met you.

312
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,200
 That's what the nun and I thought. 

313
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,180
 Angel's Tear 

314
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,180
Yoo Jin Kang?

315
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:43,140
You must be here to see Moo Yeong. Come inside.

316
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,590
Would you like a drink? Or water?

317
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,390
No thank you.

318
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,110
Isn't it difficult? It's always harder for the person who gets dumped, I hear.

319
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,690
When is Kim Moo Yeong coming here?

320
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,950
If you're curious about anything, just ask me.

321
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:21,120
I know a lot more about you two than you think.

322
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,170
You would be able to get over him, too, if you hear my story.

323
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:00,530
If you don't feel comfortable about hearing from me, then why don't you ask your brother Yoo Jin Gook?

324
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:06,650
About what happened between your brother and Kim Moo Yeong twenty-five years ago.

325
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,280
Twenty-five years ago?

326
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,120
You are deeply involved, too.

327
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,410
Oh, you're here.

328
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,200
What is it?

329
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,730
- Let's talk,
 - Do it here.

330
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,930
You said you wanted to talk.

331
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,150
You can stay.

332
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,920
She knows we dated, too. So say it here, whatever it is.

333
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,160
You look foolish.

334
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,500
You look as if you want to go after her.

335
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,640
What did you tell her?

336
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,960
 If you don't feel comfortable about hearing from me, then why don't you ask your brother Yoo Jin Gook? 

337
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,850
 About what happened between your brother and Kim Moo Yeong twenty-five years ago. 

338
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,960
 You are deeply involved, too, 

339
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,240
Twenty-five years ago?

340
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:52,120
Yes. What happened between my brother and Kim Moo Yeong twenty-five years ago?

341
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,480
Look at you. What would have happened that long ago?

342
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,070
I heard that involves me, too.

343
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,580
Who did? Who said that?

344
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:09,160
Unni, I'm not a child anymore. I need to know.

345
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
Jin Kang, I...

346
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,520
I...

347
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,760
know that I'm not his biological sister.

348
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,330
What?

349
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,360
Jin Kang,

350
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:41,310
when? When did you find out?

351
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,330
In middle school.

352
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:49,450
But that's why he's even more my brother.

353
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,790
So I need to know, too. What happened to him?

354
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:03,120
The reason my brother hated Kim Moo Yeong so much has something to do what that event, isn't it?

355
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,260
What happened twenty-five years ago.

356
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,540
He didn't hate him.

357
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,330
It's not that he hated him.

358
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,170
He felt bad and he was afraid.

359
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,330
Why would he?

360
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,310
Okay, I'll tell you. I'll tell you, but let's make this clear.

361
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,430
I don't know what you heard or from whom,

362
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:41,020
but this is between Kim Moo Yeong and your brother. It has nothing to do with you.

363
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,040
Okay.

364
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:50,220
Kim Moo Yeong's father was a criminal.

365
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,220
I know. I'm aware of it, too.

366
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,950
You knew that.

367
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,530
Your brother was the first at the scene.

368
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,420
The world thinks that Kim Moo Yeon'g's father killed someone,

369
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,110
and fell from a cliff, but actually,

370
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,350
your brother killed him.

371
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,880
My brother killed Kim Moo Yeong's father?

372
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,130
But it was self-defense.

373
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,030
He was holding a weapon and he moved first to attack your brother.

374
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,950
So, your startled brother just reflexively...

375
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,280
You must have been very curious. Asking me to drive you home.

376
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,540
I'm much more jealous than you think. To be so openly...

377
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,970
Would you like to go upstairs? If you do,

378
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,810
I might tell you what I told your sister.

379
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,720
Okay.

380
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,370
She looked so pained, I gave her a teaser.

381
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,570
What did you tease her with?

382
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:24,380
Twenty-five years ago, what happened between you and her brother,

383
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,010
to ask her brother about it.

384
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:33,600
And that she probably was deeply involved in it.

385
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,190
You're mad.

386
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:48,190
You're so cool until I talk about Yoo Jin Kang, and then you become very ordinary.

387
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:55,720
What is it? Are you really mad? Over what?

388
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,000
You probably have no intention of stopping?

389
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,100
No matter what I say.

390
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,030
It's so fun right now. You want to end the game?

391
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,180
It's not a game.

392
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:21,960
Then? What are you doing looking so serious?

393
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,130
I'm regretting it.

394
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,020
Regret?

395
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,080
I know people like you so well,

396
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:40,990
but just because of that stupid anger.

397
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,120
I came on my own two feet,

398
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,110
 What is it? 

399
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:50,070
 I have a favor. I need a gun. 

400
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,630
 Can you get me one? 

401
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,100
 A gun? 

402
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,430
I dragged you into it myself.

403
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,630
Are you composing an apology?

404
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,810
I thought ...

405
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,540
I was only ruining myself.

406
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,780
I was wrong.

407
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,810
I'm requesting a favor.

408
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,990
Don't mess with me.

409
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,210
Stop right there.

410
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,410
The moment you open that door, I'm making a call

411
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,480
to that sister you love so dearly.

412
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:25,750
What is this? Do you really love her?

413
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,780
You must really love her.

414
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,290
That angers me.

415
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,860
What should I start by saying?

416
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,070
Don't worry.

417
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:53,780
Kim Moo Yeong says he loves you. He said he'll love you to the day he dies.

418
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,580
He loves you that much, so why did he leave you?

419
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,920
Because he's your brother.

420
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,450
You really didn't know anything.

421
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:10,280
Did you really sleep with her not knowing that?

422
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,650
Did you really sleep with her?

423
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,050
Manager! News...

424
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,360
Did you see the news?

425
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,020
 Death of NJ Group's Managing Director Jang Se Ran. -

426
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,640
 NJ Group owner's eldest daughter shot to death at home. 

427
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,540
 Managing Director, Jang Se Ran's death following her brother. 

428
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,380
Yeah, Assistant Im?

429
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,370
 Did you see the news? 

430
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,380
The news?

431
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,690
 You must not have. It's total chaos. 

432
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,440
Chaos? What is it?

433
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,390
 Jang Se Ran, the first daughter of NJ Group's chairman Jang, about 8:10pm 

434
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:11,310
 was found dead in her home at Samseong-dong. 

435
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:15,880
 What's shocking about this murder case is 

436
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,600
 the use of a gun which is rare in this country. 

437
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,860
 CCTV videos from her own home and from surrounding area 

438
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,110
 were collected. After analyzing various evidence, 

439
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,760
 - Manager! 
- the police are currently 

440
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,660
 - Manager? 
 - suspecting Jang's business partner Mr. Kim 

441
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,340
 - Manager! 
- and are pursuing him. 

442
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:37,180
 After committing the crime, suspect Kim fled the scene in Jang's car. 

443
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,110
 The police about 9:50pm 

444
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:42,220
 found Jang's car abandoned in the Cheonggyecheon area 

445
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,850
 but failed to arrest suspect Kim. They are securing the areas in the vicinity— 

446
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:50,930
 The police suspect Kim took the gun used in the crime, and 

447
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:55,490
 caution people about possible secondary damage. 

448
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:59,410
 With this gunshot murder incident, our loose national gun laws 

449
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,610
 are put on the chopping block again. 

450
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,130
 The police are doing... 

451
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,790
It's okay, Jin Kang. It's okay.

452
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,770
No, he is not the type of person to do that.

453
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,460
Yeah, yeah. I know. I get it.

454
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,240
Oppa! He can't kill people. Why are you like this?

455
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,340
He hurts even when he sees fish dying!

456
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

457
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,760
I'm telling you this isn't right. Why are you doing this? Oppa, he didn't do it.

458
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,500
He didn't kill her!

459
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,560
Oppa! Oppa, I have to go to him.

460
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,190
Okay, okay.

461
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,000
I have to!

462
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,220
Oppa, he didn't do it.

463
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:34,740
Oppa, I know him!

464
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,830
Calm down.

465
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,650
Calm down.

466
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,290
What happened?

467
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,280
Did you find out anything?

468
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,190
It was that gun, wasn't it? The one he brought to your house.

469
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,980
He still has a gun in his possession.

470
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,620
Shouldn't you be requesting protection?

471
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,430
Protection my butt. It's nothing like that.

472
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:07,750
What do you mean nothing? It's said Jang Se Ran was killed for revenge.

473
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,290
An unstable person on the run has a gun. He has already killed a person.

474
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,800
How do you know where he'll go in the future?

475
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,860
I get it, I get it,

476
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,900
but that won't happen, so calm down, Tak.

477
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,620
Call for protection right away if you feel something fishy.

478
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,520
Okay.

479
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,130
- Hey, Manager, Yoo,
 - What?

480
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:08,030
 I know I'm not his real sister. 

481
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,690
Nothing. Just call me if anything happens.

482
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,010
Go. Get in.

483
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,420
Call me!

484
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,400
Go, okay!

485
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,640
- Call me! Okay?
 - Okay.

486
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,220
Hello?

487
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,730
Kim Moo Yeong.

488
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,970
Taxi!

489
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,700
Kim Moo Yeong.

490
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:55,060


491
01:01:55,060 --> 01:02:01,480
♫   Moonlight, when the light fades tonight   ♫

492
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:08,630
♫   Will these stars fade, too? Will we be like that?    ♫

493
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,360
♫   This dark night    ♫

494
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,690
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

495
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,530
 Did he really kill her? I don't think so. 

496
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,140
 I think he killed her. 

497
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,060
 He could do worse things if he wanted to. 

498
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,680
 Kim Moo Yeong came to your house twice without your knowledge. 

499
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,230
 Once he came carrying a gun. 

500
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,020
 A gun? 

501
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,170
 You know it already! 

502
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:32,930
 What did you tell him? Where is he? 

503
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,530
 Kang Seon Ho, turn yourself in. 

504
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:41,020
♫   Embrace my broken heart.  ♫

505
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:47,370
♫   Moonlight, when this moonlight fades   ♫

506
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,660
♫   Will these stars fade, too?   ♫
