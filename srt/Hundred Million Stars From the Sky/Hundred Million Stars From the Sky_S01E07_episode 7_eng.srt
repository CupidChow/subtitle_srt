00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,500
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

2
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,920
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,220
 There's nothing much to see. 

4
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,750
 It's not your first time seeing a burn scar. 

5
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,830
 He has a burn scar on his shoulder. 

6
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,880
 On Kim Moo Yeong's shoulder and arm. 

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,290
 Just because he has a scar on his arm, you think Kim  Moo Yeong is that... 

8
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,380
 Are you scared? That you'll get slapped by that lady? 

9
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,310
 What about you, Unni?  

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,110
 Do you like Moo Yeong, too? 

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,720
 Go and tell Seung Ah it isn't true!  That it was a joke! 

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,890
 Tell me. You've never thought about me? 

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,530
 Looking for Missing Child 

14
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,310
 Height 110 cm, Weight 20 kg, Short hair, 
 Oval face
 Burn scar on right shoulder and arm 

15
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,400
 Went missing around 11/9/93, 15:00
 Location: Near Myeongsung University in Haesan 

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,320
 Episode 7 

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,850
 Because you don't have a heart to begin with. 

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,520
 That's why you can play around with people's feelings as you please. 

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,700
 And you don't feel bad when you've ruined them. 

20
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,610
 You sit back and watch... 

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,840
 And feel good that you won. 

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,950
 That's why you don't even realize why you're pitiful. 

23
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,640
 Yoo Jin Kang. 

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,240
 Should I tell you why you're so helplessly angry? 

25
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,310
 Tell me. 

26
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,510
 Have you never thought about me? 

27
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,420
  No. 

28
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,480
 You've never wanted to see me? 

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,360
 No. 

30
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,630
 Have you been happy to see me by chance? 

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,180
 No. 

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,090
 Are you really certain 

33
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,580
 that you have no feelings for me? 

34
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,520
 I don't have any. 

35
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,200
It hurts.

36
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,310
Take it easy. Why are you working so hard when you're just doing it for money?

37
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,770
You bastard.

38
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,950
Stand up, you jerk!

39
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,230
You jerk!

40
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,840
Oh, hey, hey.

41
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,790
Sorry! Are you okay?

42
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,420
I'm fine.

43
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,930
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,550
Hello? Yes, I'm on a rooftop here in Wonyeong.

45
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,630
Please come quickly.

46
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,980
Please come as quickly as you can. A person is...

47
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,620
Kim Moo Yeong!

48
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't hit him! Don't hit him!

49
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,590
Why in the world are you hitting him?

50
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,900
Why are you hitting him?

51
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,970
Let's go.

52
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,630
Kim Moo Yeong! Kim Moo Yeong!

53
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,580
Kim Moo Yeong!

54
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,230
Kim Moo Yeong! Come to your senses!

55
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,790
Kim Moo Yeong!

56
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,240
Kim Moo Yeong!

57
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
- You said there were four people?
 - Yes.

58
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,600
One of them is in his late thirties.

59
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,790
I couldn't tell about the rest, because it was so dark.

60
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,770
It totally looked like an one-sided assault?

61
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,710
Yes, they totally looked like gangsters.

62
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,710
You have no idea why?

63
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,200
Right.

64
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,800
Calm down for now.

65
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,140
First, we need to wait until the victim wakes up.

66
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,720
If he's up to it, tell him to come to the police station.

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,380
We'll get a statement from the victim and get a formal complaint filed.

68
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes.

69
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Thank you.   Thank you.

70
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,900
 Jin Gook 

71
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,150
Oppa.

72
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,270
You should have told me if you're working late.

73
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,890
 Sorry, I fell asleep. 

74
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,170
 You couldn't sleep because of me? Go to sleep first. 

75
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,230
Okay.

76
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,870
At least take a nap.

77
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,770
Sit.

78
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,080
Looks yummy.

79
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,670
What's with you? Why are you like this?

80
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,390
The doctor said you should stay the night. Why did you leave on your own?

81
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,630
Take a seat. Don't get mad.  I'm hurting to death.

82
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,590
Who were those guys?

83
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,120
Why did you come? I'm more curious about that.

84
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,220
Why is that important now when you look like this?  Who are they?

85
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,420
What do you go around doing, that those people would...

86
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,920
You came here to argue. That this is what you think.

87
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,970
Go to the police department tomorrow. File a victim's statement and report them.

88
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,900
Why?

89
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,370
Why?

90
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,550
Why would I do that to people who are trying their best to survive?

91
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,060
They don't know why they were beating me up.

92
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,220
If I'm going to sue or put up a fight, I have to do it right.

93
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,950
To the real person who is messing with me. Don't you agree?

94
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,250
Okay.

95
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,000
Why should I care what you do?

96
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,570
Eat before you go.

97
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,920
Hey, Cho Rong.

98
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,390
Did you see Manager Yoo?

99
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,600
He's in the office.

100
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,530
No.

101
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,410
Manager Yoo didn't say anything to you?

102
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,810
What would he say to me?

103
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,530
You know why he's being that way, don't you?

104
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,210
Me? How should I know?

105
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,360
If you don't know, who would?

106
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Hey! Why are you asking me?

107
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,900
You think I could understand all that?

108
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,480
I don't know.

109
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,710
Seriously, it annoys me, too.

110
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,280
Ah, you came.

111
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
Hello.

112
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,010
You came alone? The victim didn't come?

113
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,840
He didn't come?

114
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm asking you since he didn't come.

115
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,880
Can a witness make a report?

116
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,720
Of course, you can, but you already reported it yesterday.

117
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,530
You reported it yesterday. The complaint has to come from the victim.

118
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,850
Directly from him.

119
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,650
I see.

120
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,760
Thank you.

121

132
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,290
What brings you here without any notice?

133
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,260
What do you mean? I figured you'd be drunk all day otherwise.

134
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,380
What is all this?

135
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,990
Make me some stir-fried chicken stew.

136
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,610
I have a taste for it and heard you make it well.

137
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:33,450
Wow. This is different during the day compared to bringing you home drunk at night.

138
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,990
Did Jin Kang go somewhere when it's a Saturday?

139
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,420
She's on a date. I think things are going well with Cho Rong.

140
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,590
Oh, really? That's fantastic!

141
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,020
This one is similar to mine.

142
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,010
It's pretty.

143
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,530
 Sunbae Hwang Geon 

144
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,100
Stay and look around, Jin Kang.

145
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,630
Okay.

146
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,430
Yes, Geon?

147
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,000
 Where are you? 

148
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,590
It's my day off today.

149
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,510
Punk.

150
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,620
Manager.

151
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,470
Manager, I think Eom Cho Rong has lost it.

152
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,350
Why? Did he oversleep?

153
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,510
He said he's resting because it's his day off.

154
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,010
It must be nice to be a rookie.

155
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,900
Hey, is he a crackpot or what? Aren't you training him properly?

156
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,650
Ah, I finally got one done.

157
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,730
I have a list with 100 things I want to do with you.  I've finally done one.

158
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,640
Was riding a bicycle the first on the list?

159
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,890
Not just any bicycle, but a tandem bike.

160
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,490
It's not the first on the list, but it's high up in the ranking; considerably highly ranked.

161
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,190
What's the next one?

162
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,590
It won't be fun if you know already. Just look forward to it.

163
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,070
Should we go?

164
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,870
What do you want to eat?

165
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,870
Something yummy.  Something really delicious!

166
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,260
Wow, that looks delicious!

167
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,760
He seems just fine.

168
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,060
What is?

169
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,390
Kim Moo Yeong, you were all upset about his scar or whatnot.

170
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,880
He seems more normal than you'd expect.

171
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,660
Of course, I'm fine. It's delusional. Delusional.

172
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,000
Like you said, it's completely delusional.

173
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,950
Of course.

174
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,810
Here.

175
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,830
Hold on, hold on.

176
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,510
How is it?

177
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,070
It's just right. You're pretty good!

178
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,080
Now, the soju.

179
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,360
- Okay, the soju. 
 - Okay, okay.

180
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,110
No, we can't leave soju out.

181
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,740
Of course.

182
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,600
Thank you.

183
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,710
Hold on.

184
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,560
You know that Cho Rong is stressing out, don't you?

185
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:06,060
Setting Kim Moo Yeong aside, why aren't you telling Cho Rong about Im Yoo Ri?

186
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,400
According to what you say, there's a good likelihood that Im Yoo Ri killed her.

187
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,620
Nobody knows yet who killed her.

188
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,690
Exactly, so why aren't you saying anything?

189
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,050
If you at least tell him that, something might come out.

190
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,960
Why aren't you bringing Im Yoo Ri in?

191
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm just waiting to see.

192
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,990
Waiting for what?

193
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,670
For her to turn herself in.

194
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,520
Turn herself in?

195
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,220
Let me laugh for a moment.

196
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,440
For that big, huge, queen of rudeness, Im Yoo Ri to...?

197
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,660
It can't be helped if she doesn't.

198
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,100
Is there no other way if she doesn't? I would have to take her in.

199
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,450
For real?

200
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,920
Of course!

201
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,560
What?

202
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,660
Nothing.

203
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,690
What is it? Why are you looking at me like that?

204
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,990
Do you like her, Manager Yoo?

205
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,960
Who? Her?

206
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,510
What nonsense! She's younger than Jin Kang!

207
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,560
Does it matter if she's younger? She's a legal adult.

208
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,190
They say that men are like that. The older they get the younger they like them.

209
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,660
Sheesh.

210
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Don't you agree? That's why you fell with her even if you could have died.

211
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,520
Turn herself in or whatever. You're keeping your mouth shut.

212
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,340
Look.

213
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,650
This is all making sense, isn't it?

214
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,720
Let me laugh for a moment.

215
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,330
Why are you laughing? Making me feel bad.

216
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,790
- Do you feel offended? 
 - Yes.

217
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,170
I feel offended, too!

218
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,550
Stop making me laugh.

219
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,910
Why are you so funny, with such a pretty face?

220
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,790
Hey!

221
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,840
Isn't that the case?

222
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,530
You're the one who's pretty, not Im Yoo Ri.

223
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,390
It's salty.

224
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,030
Salty?

225
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,990
I can't eat this since it's so salty.

226
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,160
Hey, Tak! Tak! Where are you going? Eat before you go!

227
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,910
I'm not eating. Why does food taste bad the more of it I eat?

228
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,080
Tak! Tak!

229
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,390
She called this salty?

230
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,190
It's bland.

231
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,100
 Certificate of Registration 

232
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,560
I just need your seal here.

233
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,920
 We're really rich, aren't we? 

234
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,800
 We are rich. 

235
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,590
 Where do you want to go? 

236
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,320
 I'm not sure. 

237
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,720
 I want to go somewhere warm. What about Greece? 

238
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,270
 Greece? 

239
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,550
 I'm not going to take anything with me when I leave. 

240
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,910
 I'm going to leave just carrying one bag. 

241
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,750
 Should we leave? 

242
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,920
 But where? 

243
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,490
 Home. I have to go write my resume. 

244
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,010
 I said I have to look for a job starting tomorrow. 

245
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,810
 Moo Yeong. 

246
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,660
 We're at the end. 

247
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,880
 There's nowhere more for us to go. 

248
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,030
 But we love each other. 

249
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,350
 I've never felt that way. 

250
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,820
 Then, why did you date me? 

251
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,210
 2 million dollars 

252
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,600
 Yeon Kang University Won Joo Campus phone number 

253
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:20,020
  This is the Won Joo Campus at Yeon Kang University, the intellectual's window into the world. 

254
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,770
Yeah, Hui Joon?

255
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,340
Seung Ah did?

256
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,970
What am I supposed to do? She came already knowing everything.

257
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,690
 Should I have just lied? Saying I'm a college student? 

258
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
Good job.

259
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,900
 You are saying "Good job"? 

260
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,990
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

261
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,220
 Let's meet. It won't take long. 

262
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,650
How do you like it here? I want to end things where we began.

263
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,390
It's nice.

264
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,390
What is this?

265
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,920
How do you feel seeing it?

266
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,650
It's 2 million dollars.

267
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,620
Tell me you did it for money. Then, I can give it to you.

268
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,760
Yeah. It was for money.

269
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,030
Thanks.

270
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,580
Your face... It was Oppa Woo Sang, wasn't it?

271
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,550
It's 2 million dollars. What's more important than that?

272
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,750
 Waist level 

273
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,250
 Why did you lie to me? 

274
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,760
 You said you didn't know any cops in Haesan. 

275
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,690
 You're from Haesan. 

276
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,560
 But you really don't know a single cop there? 

277
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,590
 Seung Ah 

278
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,130
 Call declined 

279
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,860
Here. This is the menu for the Arts collaboration event the evening after tomorrow.

280
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,570
And this is the first draft of your formal greetings.

281
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,530
 NJ Low Sodium Premium Bacon X ARTS Be-Free IPA 

282
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,100
  "Hello, this is NJ group's executive director, Jang Woo Sang." 

283
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,830
 I'll never forgive you. 

284
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,000
 If you bother him one more time, I'll kill you. 

285
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,270
Did you take care of it?

286
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,080
Yes. You won't need to concern yourself anymore.

287
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,290
I believe he has a woman.

288
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,300
A woman?

289
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,530
Her name is Yoo Jin Kang. She's Baek Seung Ah's friend.

290
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,120
- He's dating her?
 - Yes.

291
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,350
What are you doing here alone?

292
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,440
What's with your face? Did you get in a fight?

293
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,180
Can I drink this?

294
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:41,110
I didn't get in a fight, I was beaten. Pretty much one-sided.

295
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,590
Why so serious? Why? Are you going to scold them for me?

296
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,740
Want to see something interesting?

297
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,110
What would you do with it, if it were yours?

298
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,420
What do you go around doing?

299
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,560
Bad stuff.

300
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,320
I feel like doing bad stuff whenever I see you.

301
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm going.

302
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,010
Kim Moo Yeong,

303
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,160
there's no such thing as a free ride.

304
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,310
There's no such thing as a lucky break.

305
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,120
That's good. I really hate taking freebies.

306
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,720
I like stuff like "eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."

307
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,170
 Did you get good rest on your day off?
(Editor's note: formal tone, sarcastically) 

308
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,070
 Was it nice? 
(Editor's note: formal tone, sarcastically) 

309
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,500
Get out. I have no need for you if that's how you're going to be.

310
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,470
I'll rectify it.

311
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,830
Don't you hear me?

312
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,940
I said to get out, bastard.

313
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,720
What do you think you are doing?

314
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,120
Good morning!

315
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,900
You punk!

316
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,020
If you came to work, you should be in your seat. Where are you off to?

317
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,400
It's enough for only me to act that way!

318
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,790
Right, Team Leader?

319
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,110
I'll rectify it.

320
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:27,550
 Yoo Ri, a person can always start over sometime. 

321
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,620
 It might sound obvious, but it's the truth. 

322
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,960
 Tell me when you're ready. I can wait a few days. 

323
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,790
- Yes. 
- May I sit here?

324
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,330
- Yes, the salad tastes good, too.
 - Oh, really?

325
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,690
Tak!

326
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,150
It really is good!

327
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,240
Tak!

328
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,960
Hey, Pig!

329
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,980
It's so good! So good!

330
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,880
Tak!

331
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,410
Tak!

332
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,970
Oh? Manager Yoo.

333
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,330
Now you're slighting me, too?

334
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,070
Slight, who me? What did I do?

335
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,650
I mean, you ignored me in the cafeteria, too.

336
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,780
Ah. Were you in the cafeteria?

337
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,590
I didn't know you were there.

338
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,900
Look at you.

339
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,980
Seriously. I had no idea.

340
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,240
I'm going.

341
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,090
Why did she dress so pretty today?

342
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,340
What's up with your face?

343
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,200
Isn't it really obvious?

344
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,930
It's taking so long to heal.

345
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,200
It's been a while.

346
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,660
So dirty and petty.

347
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,530
What's so great about this place? I couldn't bring myself to come up fearing you'd get mad.

348
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,960
Hey.

349
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,760
Why were you so nice to me?

350
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,850
Because you're pretty.

351
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,880
Pretty, yeah, right.

352
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,980
Why? Because I don't lie?

353
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,060
I heard that's what you said.

354
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,860
That I don't lie.

355
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,750
You've never sincerely liked me, have you?

356
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,330
I do like you.

357
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,960
Isn't she pretty?

358
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,820
This is my first time having a cat. I like it.

359
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,330
I have to feed it and clean the poop, and sometimes it's bothersome.

360
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,050
But it's fun.

361
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,400
She must know it, too, because she doesn't leave, even if I open the door.

362
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,290
I know it, too.

363
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,960
That I'm just like that dumb cat to you.

364
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,800
Yoo Ri,

365
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,060
don't trust people. People don't mean anything.

366
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,260
What about her? Are you going to say that to her, too?

367
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,770
People don't mean anything, so she shouldn't trust you either?

368
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,300
Can I really tell him everything?

369
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,360
What?

370
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,770
Tell that ajussi everything.

371
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,150
Huh?

372
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,510
What brings you here?

373
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,990
Oh.

374
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,080
What's up?

375
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,030
Why are you here this early in the morning?

376
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,400
I came to get my driver's license. And stopped to say hi.

377
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,610
Driver's license?

378
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,460
Yes, I had to renew it.

379
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,290
I'm starting work today.

380
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,230
Want some vending machine coffee before you go?

381
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,680
No. It's tasteless.

382
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,490
I'm going.

383
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,820
You're just going to go?

384
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,390
I said I just stopped to say hi.

385
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,050
There's nothing much going on, now that I'm seeing it for myself.

386
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,900
- Who was that?
 - You startled me!

387
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,620
Why does he seem familiar?

388
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,990
Where did I see him?

389
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,130
It was Kim Moo Yeong.

390
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,410
Kim...? Kim Moo Yeong?

391
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,970
That...  that  Kim Moo Yeong?

392
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,740
 NJ Low Sodium Premium Bacon 
Be-Free IPA of ARTS
 Perfect Pairing 

393
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,250
 Invitation 

394
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,330
 Date &amp; Time
 Location
 Schedule 

395
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,880
Moo Yeong, you're here.

396
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,510
- Oh, yes, hello.
 - Oh my.

397
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,440
Are you alright?

398
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,740
Sorry I'm late for work.

399
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,040
Not at all. I'm sure you'll work harder going forward.

400
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,740
I see you've already seen it. Let's go later.

401
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,840
Would it feel awkward, since it's an Arts event?

402
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,020
No, not at all.

403
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,660
Wow!

404
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,330
Perfect! Who made this?

405
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,910
Who made this perfect poster?

406
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,250
- It's so nice. 
 - It turned out really well. Oh!

407
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,640
Hello, Miss CEO.

408
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,400
- Hello!
 - Have you been well?

409
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,070
Why do you keep following me around all day long?

410
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,490
It's not that I'm following you!

411
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,990
Although you seem close to Kim Moo Yeong, you're not at all.

412
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,680
And just waiting simply, because you don't have concrete evidence,

413
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,920
I understand, but...

414
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,490
So?

415
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,890
Why does he seem familiar to me?

416
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,890
Where have I seen him before?

417
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,440
Why do you keep...?

418
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,570
Why me?

419
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,780
Oh, thank you!

420
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,380
Go on inside and enjoy the evening.

421
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,390
- I'll see you again.
 - Thank you.

422
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,700
Hey! It's been a while!

423
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,290
What do you think?

424
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,900
- Isn't it nice?
 - It looks great.

425
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,720
Go in and find your seat.

426
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,160
 Thanks. 

427
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,950
Hello.

428
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,800
We welcome you tonight for coming to the launching of

429
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,350
the NJ Group's Low Sodium Premium Bacon and Arts Be-Free IPA!

430
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,420
Miss?

431
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,280
There's a delivery for you.

432
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,230
A delivery?

433
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:59,640
 Although I'm not sure if it's love or not, yet, let's go wherever it leads us. 

434
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,500
Hello.

435
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,160
I'm the Director of NJ Foods, Jang Woo Sang.

436
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:26,020
For the last 40 years, NJ has extended its best efforts to develop high quality products.

437
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,770
We pride ourselves on having tried to remain a passionate and fierce young company

438
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:34,940
while preserving tradition and not falling behind the times.

439
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,440
Right now, in the Republic of Korea the very youngest

440
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,640
craft beer brewery collaboration with Arts exemplifies that effort.

441
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:54,760
With this collaboration, NJ Food and Arts will open up our ideas and communication

442
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,680
and will contribute to the national food market that's been quickly advancing...

443
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,160
- It's delicious!
 - So delicious!

444
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,810
Don't you think it tastes different with a different logo?

445
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,090
You think so?

446
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,540
I know, right?

447
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,190
Cheers!

448
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,650
 Director. 

449
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,510
- It's been a while.
 - So it has.

450
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,500
It's Jang Woo Sang.

451
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,920
Jang Woo Sang couldn't it work out with him?

452
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,970
You should take this opportunity to step in and get the NJ Foods design contract!

453
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,420
 I'm so sorry! Are you alright? 

454
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,230
 I'm fine. 

455
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,620
That's all good, but how did you think of this?

456
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,180
Maybe we can extend the period...

457
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,020
It makes me reflect a lot every time I see you.

458
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,920
Why would you do that, President Goo?

459
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,180
Honestly, when I heard you were acquiring Arts, I was a bit doubtful.

460
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,260
I thought you were investing too much in a hobby.

461
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,570
I do have a liking for beer.

462
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,460
Let me know if there's ever an opportunity to invest.

463
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,000
Sure.

464
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,780
Excuse me for a moment.

465
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,410
What are you trying to do?

466
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,260
I just want to play.

467
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,810
I don't like fooling around.

468
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,010
Just get to the point.

469
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,800
The point? Okay.

470
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,300
Here, here,

471
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,420
and here. It hurts getting hit.

472
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:08,950
I understand. There's Seung Ah, too. It must have hurt a lot here.

473
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,290
I heard you guys broke up. Did you get some money out of it?

474
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:20,650
Two million dollars. It wasn't bad for investing two months worth of work.

475
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,160
You trash-like bastard.

476
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,920
Do you want some of it? You had a hand in helping.

477
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,270
It's not a big deal. I'll be generous and go 50/50, a million dollars each. How about it?

478
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,120
I said I don't like fooling around.

479
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,980
Listen to this.

480
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:49,600
I went to work the night of Chairman Do's party. Everyone was talking about Baek Seung Ah.

481
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,050
A total beauty, born with a silver spoon,

482
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,370
with a mega-rich boyfriend.

483
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:00,390
I didn't think much of it since it didn't relate to me.

484
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,390
Nothing would have happened if I had only seen Seung Ah.

485
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,920
But you were there as well.

486
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,940
I knew as soon as I saw you.

487
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,960
"This is going to be too easy."

488
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,880
Everything is thanks to you. Because of you, Seung Ah came over too easily.

489
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,120
 Seung Ah 

490
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,330
Yeah, Seung Ah. I'm at Samseongdong.

491
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,430
Yes, okay.

492
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:38,650
So, take the million and get lost. I'm going to keep dating Seung Ah.

493
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,060
Hello!

494
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,490
What a set of scammers.

495
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,830
I heard she's your woman. Yoo Jin Kang.

496
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,110
You suit each other.

497
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,120
I should've known when she hung around Seung Ah just to get a job.

498
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:10,030
She's got skills, using her boyfriend to get money.

499
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,890
Director!

500
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,950
Yes. Wool Jeo.

501
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:21,130
Try begging instead. Who knows?

502
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,220
Maybe she'll throw you some bills if you hold out your hands.

503
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,590
I'm sorry I couldn't greet you earlier.

504
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,300
- Ah, that's alright.
 - Let's get going.

505
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,460
Ah, Yes.

506
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,130
Whenever you have the time...

507
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,380
 I won't ask you to be understanding. 

508
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:04,030
 He'll probably ask me why I'm abandoning all this. 

509
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,100
 However, I'm not losing anything. 

510
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,570
 I'm just finding myself now. 

511
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:19,390
 The me that I want to be. Love. Freedom. 

512
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,740
 Goodbye. I'm sorry, Mom. 

513
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,900
It was Jang Woo Sang, wasn't it? The one who did that to you.

514
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,700
What did you talk about?

515
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,650
Are you worrying about me?

516
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,820
I was planning to provoke him,

517
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,690
but he got me instead.

518
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,160
Just what are you thinking...

519
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,910
Yes?

520
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,080
 Where are you, Dearie? Aren't you leaving? 

521
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,550
I'm over here.

522
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,610
Over here. On the terrace.

523
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,170
Yes, I'll be right there.

524
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,160
 Okay. 

525
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,010
Hurry up and go.

526
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,290
I'm at a disadvantage with you here.

527
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,930
What are you thinking to go up against someone like him?

528
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm not thinking anything. That's how to win.

529
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,160
Moo Yeong! Have you been well?

530
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,960
Yes, of course.

531
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,610
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

532
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,670
I'll take you home.

533
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,420
You should be ashamed of yourself.

534
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,440
Ashamed? What are you lacking so much?

535
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,810
He took your money and used you. And that wasn't enough, so you crawl all the way here?

536
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,690
Don't speak so carelessly.

537
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,570
Do you know what he said? He said it was too easy.

538
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:57,520
He said it was an acceptable punishment for two months and two bills.

539
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,260
Seung Ah knows that, too.

540
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,340
That I'm trash. Seung Ah knows that, too.

541
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,640
No, you're not.

542
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,370
I said he's not.

543
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,840
Should we go?

544
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:27,950
If you leave now, I won't put up with it.

545
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,770
Let go.

546
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,360
Hello!

547
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,560
Section Chief.

548
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,460
Dearie, aren't you getting in?

549
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,800
I think I need to go somewhere.

550
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
Where?

551
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,490
Dearie!

552
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,850
 Beer Festival 

553
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,730
You came.

554
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,780
Don't get caught.

555
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,160
 Kim Moo Yeong! 

556
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:42,490
♬   In the midst of the fog   ♬

557
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:11,140


558
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:19,690
♬   I know you'll be my own   ♬

559
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:25,520
♬   Someday,    ♬

560
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,730
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

561
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,060
 Are you sure Kim Moo Yeong was in Seung Ah's car? 

562
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,310
 Look at this. But something is strange. 

563
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,510
 Kim Moo Yeong has disappeared. 

564
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,090
 What do you mean by disappeared? 

565
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,070
 I'm sure the whole accident is being kept quiet in the news, too. 

566
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,590
 Do I just need to stamp this? 

567
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,770
 Your case is designated. 

568
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,940
 Designated? 

569
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,770
 Where are you? 

570
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,960
 Do you know Kim Moo Yeong? Is he at least alive? 

571
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,890
 Please tell me where he is. 

572
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,320
 Should I report him missing? 

573
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,040
 Why does this concern you? Why would you do that? 

574
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,510
♬   You belong to me   ♬
