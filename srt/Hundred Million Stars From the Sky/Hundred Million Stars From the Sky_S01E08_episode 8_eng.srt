1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:08,000


2
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,210
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,400
 Episode 8 

4
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 When I came to my senses, 

5
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,000
 I was at Mi Yeon's house. 

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,310
 Hey. 

7
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,840
 - I'm not going.
 -  How can you not go? 

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,160
 It seemed like Mi Yeon and Sang Hoon were fighting. 

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,020
 Just go, what's wrong with you? 

10
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,410
 I said I'm not going! 

11
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,750
 Later, Sang Hoon left. 

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,040
 How can you not go? Let's just go! 

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,010
 And Mi Yeon came back. 

14
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,370
 You piece of garbage! 

15
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,210
 And the thing I remember... 

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,410
 The blood. 

17
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,590
I don't remember.

18
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,330
Yoo Ri.

19
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,310
I don't remember.

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,310
 What are you thinking to go up against someone like him? 

21
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,750
 I don't think anything. That's how to win. 

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
Don't get caught.

23
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,540
 Kim Moo Yeong! 

24
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,570
♬   In the midst of the fog,   ♬

25
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,460
 They will only say that Seung Ah's car was involved in an accident. 

26
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,050
 The police won't tell me anything more. 

27
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,200
 Jin Kang, 

28
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,180
 they said the man who was with her died. 

29
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
 NJ Group's Director Jang Woo Sang dies in car accident. 

30
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,490
 Speeding on rainy road causes tragedy 

31
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,180
 Ms. Baek, who was in the car, is in critical condition. 

32
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,140
Come here. It's okay.

33
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,810
It's okay.

34
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,380
When you came to, you're saying you were inside here, right?

35
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,260
Even if it's difficult, you'll remember once you go inside. Come in.

36
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,390
That's the fake camera.

37
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,220
Yeah, Jin Kang.

38
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,550
The surgery was successful, so she's out of the woods.

39
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,830
But we will just have to monitor her condition afterward.

40
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,010
My Seung Ah!

41
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,390
Executive secretary Choi,

42
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,620
I can reveal Baek Seung Ah's route.

43
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,570
What about Seung Ah?

44
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,860
She's alive. The surgery went well.

45
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,150
That's a relief. What a relief.

46
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,510
Are you okay? You must be in shock.

47
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm all right.

48
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,820
Oppa, but something is strange.

49
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,950
You said it was Kim Moo Yeong?

50
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,270
There's no one by that name.

51
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,860
He's not here?

52
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,550
No, he isn't here.

53
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,730
They say he isn't here.

54
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,160
He's not here?

55
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,870
The only ones who came in early this morning from the accident were the deceased Jang Woo Sang and Seung Ah.

56
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,410
But how...

57
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,630
Are you sure Kim Moo Yeong was in Seung Ah's car?

58
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,660
I'm sure of it. I definitely saw them.

59
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,340
Kim Moo Yeong was sitting in the passenger seat when Seung Ah was driving.

60
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,350
And Jang Woo Sang was following them. He was driving himself.

61
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,790
But there's no word of Kim Moo Yeong.

62
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,410
The news talks as if Seung Ah was riding in Jang Woo Sang's car. But she wasn't.

63
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,530
That's a lie. Even when Seung Ah's mom first called me this morning, she said so. She got a call early this morning,

64
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,230
and she said that Seung Ah's car, Seung Ah's car was involved in an accident.

65
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,760
Jin Kang, I think something happened to him.

66
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,500
Jin Kang, Jin Kang...

67
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,010
Stop trembling and tell me. Slowly, from the beginning.

68
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,390
 A few days ago, Jang Woo Sang beat Kim Moo Yeong. 

69
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,900
 Beat? 

70
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,210
 He ordered thugs to do it. 

71
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,200
 What's wrong with your face? 

72
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,880
 Did you get in a fight? 

73
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,500
 I wasn't in a fight, I was beaten. Pretty much one-sided. 

74
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,560
 I think it started then. I felt nervous, like something was going to happen. 

75
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,780
 He said the thugs that beat him didn't know anything. 

76
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,700
 So whether he sued or fought back, he was going to do it to the person who messed with him. 

77
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,040
 The tragic death of NJ Group Director Jang Woo Sang was caused by speeding in rain. 

78
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,980
 Cho Kang Taek is reporting. 

79
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,820
 This morning at 12:15am, a sedan that lost control in the rain 

80
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,370
 went across the median... 

81
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,200
 This accident was caused by a speeding driver 

82
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,280
 who could not reduce the speed on a curving road in the rain. 

83
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,210
 The driver in the accident died, and we are still investigating the exact cause of the accident. 

84
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,700
Hey, it's Hyung Sang Jin.

85
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,790
- Do you know him?
 - Yeah.

86
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,250
He's a senior who used to be on an old team together.

87
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,580
He's aged a lot.

88
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,860
Old team?

89
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,420
There was one. A team that was disbanded because of someone.

90
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,070
 He was the successor of the management rights. 

91
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,270
 Presently, NJ Group has not released a formal statement. 

92
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,850
 Let's connect to the mortuary at this time. Reporter Park Joo Min? 

93
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,750
 I'm at the funeral of NJ Group's... 

94
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,580
This is such a shock.

95
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,750
I can't believe it. He was just fine yesterday.

96
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,580
I know. It's so scary.

97
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,420
Oh, she's here.

98
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,140
How is  Seung Ah? Is she all right?

99
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,150
Yes. Luckily, she's out of danger and the surgery went well.

100
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,920
That's a relief. Did you get to see her?

101
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,540
Yes.

102
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,530
But she's still unconscious.

103
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,580
Even though the surgery was successful, they said she needs to be monitored. She's still not completely stable.

104
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,070
Of course.

105
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,920
The car fell 10 meters off a cliff.

106
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,010
Isn't it a miracle that she even survived?

107
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,050
What? Are you done eating?

108
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,930
Yeah, take your time and eat, Tak.

109
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,050
You said the surgery went well. How fortunate is that?

110
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,840
Here. So eat some more. Hurry.

111
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,500
Kim Moo Yeong has disappeared.

112
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,130
What do you mean he disappeared?

113
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,370
But, I'm more surprised by that.

114
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,620
I mean, that Kim Moo Yeong and Baek Seung Ah dated. Wow!

115
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,900
I guess it was just briefly. Just briefly.

116
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,260
So? Are you saying that NJ is hiding Kim Moo Yeong?

117
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm not sure, but it's definite that the accident itself is being controlled, even from the news.

118
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,880
According to Jin Kang, two cars fell, including Seung Ah's car.

119
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,300
But nobody is saying that.

120
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,550
Is that really possible if you're that wealthy? Wow.

121
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,150
That's so scary.

122
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,090
You don't think something happened to him, do you?

123
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,160
I hope not. Let's go.

124
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,990
 The phone has been turned off. If you want to leave a message,... 

125
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,150
 Care Veterinary Hospital 

126
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,130
Jin Kang!

127
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,090
Yoo Jin Kang!

128
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,330
Where is she going?

129
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,610
Jin Kang!

130
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,810
What were you thinking that you didn't know I was hollering.

131
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,620
Why the veterinarian?

132
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,310
I was just buying some cat food.

133
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,600
A cat? You're not even raising a cat, why...?

134
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,460
Did you look into Kim Moo Yeong at all?

135
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,030
Not yet.

136
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,920
Should I file a missing person's report?

137
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,760
Why would you?

138
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,000
Because a person is missing, of course.

139
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,070
So, why would you do that? How does it concern you?

140
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,760
Concern me or not, you do it because you're worried.

141
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,000
Report him missing or investigate, I'll do it. So you stay put.

142
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,360
Why aren't you responding?

143
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,320
 Traffic Control Section Chief
 Kim Sang Jin 

144
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,370
 How may I help you? 

145
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,830
Excuse me.

146
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,330
You're Director Jang Woo Sang's secretary, aren't you?

147
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,870
I am.

148
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,140
You know Kim Moo Yeong, don't you?

149
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,360
Kim Moo Yeong?

150
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,140
You were in Wonyeong-dong last Thursday night, weren't you?

151
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,520
I was?

152
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,130
We bumped into each other in front of a building in Wonyeong-dong. In front of Kim Moo Yeong's house.

153
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,330
What are you talking about?

154
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,390
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

155
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,040
Please just tell me where he is.

156
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,590
Is he at least alive?

157
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,420
Hey, hey, hey.

158
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,090
You little brat!

159
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,610
I guess so.

160
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,410
Hey, even if you have no manners,

161
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:06,090
why do I have to hear about your mother's death three years after the fact from someone else?

162
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,340
It just happened, I'm sorry, Hyung.

163
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,550
You're sorry? If you're sorry,

164
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,380
then drink up. Drink and go back tomorrow

165
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,430
or I'll never see you again.

166
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,590
Okay, fine.

167
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,130
I'm sorry.

168
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,900
But, what's up? I'm sure you didn't come just to see me.

169
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,170
Where is Kim Moo Yeong?

170
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,620
Kim Moo Yeong?

171
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,100
The man who was also involved in Jang Woo Sang's car accident the other night. Where is he hidden?

172
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,450
This punk.

173
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,920
Are you investigating me right now?

174
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,590
Did I go too directly?

175
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,100
I was too direct. Sorry, sorry.

176
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,680
It's because you taught me so well!

177
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,820
You're the one who taught me that you have to go straight in. You have to go straight in—

178
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,890
For it to pop right out.

179
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,750
You punk. Someone who learned so well,

180
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,810
you're working for someone who used to work under you?

181
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,150
I heard you're on Lee Gyeong Cheol's team.

182
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,460
Yes, is that embarrassing?

183
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,240
It's not just embarrassing. It's extremely embarrassing.

184
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,230
But, why are you asking that?

185
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,400
Do you know him?

186
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,900
Yeah.

187
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,870
Don't ask about this and that, just tell me what you know.

188
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,230
Where is he right now?

189
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,980
Never mind. I don't know.

190
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,400
I really don't know where he's at.

191
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,830
 He's a witness. 

192
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,230
 Of course, this is a sensitive matter for them. 

193
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,990
 They don't know when he'll wake up. And if he does, they don't know what he'll say. 

194
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,900
Are you saying that he's unconscious?

195
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,810
I don't know about now, but he wasn't conscious after the accident.

196
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,960
I don't think it's serious though.

197
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,070
Hey, but...

198
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,770
have you ever seen a two million dollar check before?

199
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,200
A two million dollar check?

200
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,730
This case is being dictated.

201
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,890
Dictated?

202
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,310
Yeah.

203
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,940
That's why the Group is jumping through hoops to keep things quiet.

204
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,450
A two million dollar check came out of the woman's purse.

205
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,780
There was a note attached to that check.

206
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,240
I think that guy must have written it.

207
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,630
What did it say? "I don't know if it's love or not."

208
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,450
"But let's leave together anyway." Something like that.

209
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,240
In my opinion, I think they were caught secretly running away together.

210
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,520
By that dead, rich guy.

211
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,250
At the time of the accident, Jang Woo Sang was completely drunk.

212
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,400
The woman's car that was in front had slid down the road,

213
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,940
but he just hit her head on.

214
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,610
The collision point of both cars is totally the same.

215
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,470
Are you saying that Jang Woo Sang didn't step on his brakes?

216
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,690
That's right. If he had stepped on his brakes,

217
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,840
the back car would have hit the front car towards the bottom.

218
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,390
The point of impact should have been much lower.

219
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,640
But the collision point is almost horizontal.

220
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,170
"Let's just both die together."

221
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,240
He was determined when he hit her car.

222
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:16,800
♬   How much time has passed? Do you remember me?   ♬

223
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,240
♬   Walking on the disarray of time.   ♬

224
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,070
♬  Again, we are  ♬

225
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,660
Where are you?

226
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,210
♬  When I meet you, all of a sudden   ♬

227
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:47,000
♬  I lose my way  ♬

228
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,710
Thank you.

229
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,460
Thank you. Work hard!

230
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,070
A beer glass?

231
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,060
Yes, the beer glass that was in Jeong Mi Yeon's party photo.

232
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,070
I just met with a classmate of Jeong Mi Yeon's dance class.

233
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,500
 There are two of the identical glasses in the practice room. 

234
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,790
Oh, really?

235
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:19,470
 Yes, she said that they all got it from some beer event this summer with Jeong Mi Yeon. 

236
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,300
That's right. That glass was made for some beer festival.

237
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,190
Oh, that's right. I need to look into it some more. Where are you right now?

238
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,860
I'll be back in two hours, so I'll see you then.

239
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,630
- I'm off.
 - Get in.

240
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,200
What? Why are you giving me money?

241
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,970
What else? I want you to buy snacks for the kiddo.

242
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,010
What snacks? That kiddo is almost thirty.

243
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,930
Just buy some for her!

244
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,630
Hey, the little peanut is almost thirty.

245
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,140
It's because life is unfair.

246
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,990
Fine. I'll buy her the snacks. Sheesh.

247
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,690
I'm going now.

248
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,200
Hey, Jin Gook.

249
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,730
Did Gyeong Cheol say anything to you?

250
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,750
About what?

251
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,740
That the kid had come looking for you.

252
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,630
What kid?

253
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,000
The boy you were looking for.

254
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,330
That boy came looking for me? When?

255
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,770
It was over twenty years ago. Was it about three months after you left for Seoul?

256
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:46,030
He came looking at the police station. I wasn't in that day. Gyeong Cheol saw him though.

257
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:04,670
♬   In the midst of the fog   ♬

258
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,580
Why didn't you tell me that the kid came looking for me at the police station?

259
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,900
What are you talking about?

260
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,100
I heard you met the kid I was looking for!

261
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,180
What are you trying to pull now!

262
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,710
What did you tell him? What did you say to him?

263
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,330
What does it matter now?

264
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,450
I told him to leave.

265
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,410
What?

266
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,230
I told him to leave.

267
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,590
That the person he was looking for wasn't there, so I told him to get lost!

268
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,550
What did you say?

269
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,660
Isn't it true? You ran away to Seoul and weren't there!

270
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,480
Manager, did you even hear what I said?

271
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,350
Manager!

272
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,790
I said that Kim Moo Yeong and Jeong Mi Yeon had met before.

273
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,380
Manager!

274
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,430
What the heck? What am I supposed to do? I don't get it!

275
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,960
Is he going through puberty or what?

276
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,790
Hey!

277
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,140
You, really...

278
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,270
Why did you hit me?

279
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,950
You!

280
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,220
What do you want to eat, punk?

281
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,130
Oh, wow. And then?

282
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,560
So...

283
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,140
- Excuse me, could we order another set of sushi combo?
 - Sure.

284
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,870
- Oh, oh.
- At first I thought I lucked out. The girl I met this morning had the same glass, so...

285
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,390
I went to the place that hosted the event, just in case. And this guy doesn't notice the cup, but...

286
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,180
 Jeez, horrible! 

287
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,560
 Her. She's absolutely horrible. 

288
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,290
 He started talking about Jeong Mi Yeon. 

289
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,400
 You know this woman? 

290
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,080
 - Jeong Mi Yeon?
 - it must have been chaotic that day because everyone was drunk. 

291
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,570
Apparently, Jeong Mi Yeon was drunk and acted like a total jerk.

292
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,900
Even then, I didn't think much of it and then suddenly...

293
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,270
 If it weren't for Hyung Moo Yeong that day, I would have punched her and would have ended up in jail. 

294
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,440
 Suddenly, he mentions Kim Moo Yeong. 

295
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,540
 Kim Moo Yeong? 
 - Kim Moo Yeong  for real?

296
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,210
Th-That Kim Moo Yeong?

297
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,370
That Kim Moo Yeong.

298
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:01,420
He said Kim Moo Yeong took the drunk Jeong Mi Yeon home.

299
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,600
Wow... Amazing for sure!

300
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,310
That's why it doesn't make any sense. Manager Yoo is acting that way even after hearing all this.

301
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:14,770
You're right. You have every right to be frustrated.

302
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,900
I couldn't tell if he was listening or not.

303
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,140
I was explaining all this, but he was in a daze.

304
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,740
It made me really wonder, is he really the Manager Yoo that I know?

305
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,380
Is there any significance to working together?

306
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,420
- Hey, Eom Cho Rong. Who is Manager Yoo?
 - Pardon?

307
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,450
When a person like him does strange things like that, just close your eyes

308
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,550
and you wait for him.

309
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,220
Here. Eat plenty. Eat a lot.

310
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,140
Where are you?

311
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,520
Where did you go?

312
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,380
 Doctor! 

313
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,460
You're home?

314
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,860
Why don't you have the light on?

315
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,920
I just fell asleep. I don't think he's hurt badly.

316
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,640
I don't know where Kim Moo Yeong is,

317
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,550
but he'll return.

318
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,450
He's back.

319
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,260
He's back?

320
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,270
Yoo Jin Kang? How do you know that? Did you just meet with him?

321
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,660
Yeah.

322
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,990
You...

323
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,490
He's returned so it's fine. I have no reason to meet him again.

324
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,330
Oppa, I'm really sleepy.

325
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,560
 Stay a little longer before you leave. 

326
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,690
 Let's not meet again. 

327
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,990
Jin Kang.

328
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,260
It's okay.

329
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,630
 Ms. Baek, known as the fiancee of Jang Woo Sang,  

330
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,300
 who died  from a car accident early in the morning on the 14th of this month 

331
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,820
 was in the same car during the accident and died last night, four days after the accident. 

332
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,180
Wow, did you hear?

333
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,640
Yes.

334
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,870
Agh, what in the world is happening?

335
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,680
I didn't know she was Jin Kang's friend.

336
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,720
Are you sure you're her boyfriend when you don't even know that?

337
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,320
I know.

338
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:43,260
Hey. No, it's because Jin Kang is a private person.

339
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,790
Things will turn out well for you two.

340
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,630
Hey!

341
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,610
You look good, now that you work for me.

342
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,820
The incident with Baek Seung Ah has been wrapped up.

343
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,050
But when you get to work, it might be good for you to express your personal condolences—

344
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,070
That's enough. You said it was all finished.

345
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,700
What did he say when you had him sign the contract? Did he go along with it?

346
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,260
Yes.

347
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,120
 Do I just need to stamp it with my finger? 

348
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,870
 What about the money? 

349
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,430
 He took it without a word. 

350
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,950
One million dollars?

351
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,100
As if it were a hundred dollars.

352
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,440
Like a hundred dollars?

353
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,940
How interesting.

354
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,290
What's going on?

355
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,910
I need to go. Aren't you going to work?

356
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,420
What you want.

357
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,720
Is it this?

358
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,880
That "eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth" that you like so much,

359
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,870
is something like this?

360
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,790
Forget Jang Woo Sang who uses thugs to beat you up.

361
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,110
Se... What was Seung Ah's crime?

362
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,940
What was Seung Ah's crime?

363
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:31,290
Why do you talk like I did it on purpose?

364
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,570
Fine.  You probably didn't know it would go this far.

365
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,110
Let me ask you this way.

366
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,810
If you knew things would turn out like this,

367
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,800
would you have not done it?

368
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,050
Not sure...

369
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,670
You bastard!

370
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,010
Seung Ah is dead.

371
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,710
A young woman who did no wrong is dead because you want revenge!

372
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,400
I would have done it.

373
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,210
I would have done it even knowing the outcome.

374
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,890
You bastard!

375
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,720
You think you've won, right?

376
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,560
You think you won even though two people died because of you!

377
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,830
You had to win since you staked your own life, didn't you?!

378
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,470
Get out of the way!

379
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,300
You're not even human.

380
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,690
You, if you can call yourself human... if you're human even in the slightest...!

381
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,350
What do I have to do then?

382
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:58,550
If I'm even the slightest bit human, huh?

383
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,500
You won't be able to have your way. I won't let you.

384
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,820
Now, regardless of what or who you are, I won't care.

385
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,700
That's out of nowhere.

386
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,960
At some point, was I someone worthwhile to you?

387
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,070
Why are you back?

388
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:10,310
Keep your word that you won't ever see that jerk again.

389
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,310
I came back to tell you that. For him, everything is a joke and a game.

390
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,320
Because nothing in the world is important to him, he would even bet his own life

391
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,990
to play a game.

392
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,920
Oppa...

393
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,170
Listen to me clearly.

394
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,100
Seung Ah died because of him.

395
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,470
He killed her.

396
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,970
How can you say that?

397
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,710
He said he would've done it, even knowing the outcome. Knowing Seung Ah would die,

398
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,550
he said he would have done it, even if he lost his life doing it!

399
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Oppa.

400
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:02,230
Good Morning!

401
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,130
Hello. Good morning.

402
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:17,360
 Jin Kang, did you lay your friend to rest? 

403
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,230
 I'm not sure how to comfort... 

404
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,120
Eom Cho Rong, you do this.

405
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,520
This won't have anything much.

406
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,250
How would you know without even looking?

407
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,070
Aren't these the dashcam videos from the incident?

408
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,590
I know. So?

409
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,460
Manager Yoo had already...

410
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,160
I'll take a look. I'll look at it.

411
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,350
You said you were looking into it.

412
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,290
Let me finish texting.

413
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,440
You!

414
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,860
 Listen to me clearly. 

415
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,720
 Seung Ah died because of him. 

416
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,180
 He killed her! 

417
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,680
 How can you say that? 

418
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,470
 He said he would've done it, even knowing the outcome. Knowing Seung Ah would die! 

419
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,240
 He said he would have done it, even if he lost his life doing it! 

420
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,310
 Eom Cho Rong 

421
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,690
I don't remember.

422
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,860
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't remember!

423
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,770
That's why I'm asking.

424
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,110
Fine, ask.

425
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,450
You said that when you came to your senses,

426
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,580
you saw Choi Sang Hoon and Jeong Mi Yeon fighting through the crack in the door, right?

427
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,740
Yes.

428
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,860
That means you got in there first without their knowledge. Did you know

429
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,290
Jeong Mi Yeon's passcode from the start?

430
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,250
Yes.

431
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,920
You saw the surveillance camera in the hall in front of Mi Yeon's home, right?

432
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,100
Who do you think was captured on it?

433
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,930
How would I know?

434
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,040
How should I know?

435
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,900
It didn't capture anything.

436
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,250
That CCTV is a fake.

437
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,400
You didn't know about it,

438
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,440
but the person who cleaned up the crime scene knew it was fake.

439
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,640
It was Kim Moo Yeong, right?

440
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,520
No, it wasn't Moo Yeong.

441
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:10,970
The day you and I went to Mi Yeon's house, I followed you on your way home.

442
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:20,090
Even though you were hurriedly running away, you used alleys without surveillance cameras.

443
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:32,420
 Road 109
 Seesaw System 

444
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,350
 Building 91
 Wonyeong Market 

445
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:39,320
He taught you that path, didn't he? Kim Moo Yeong did.

446
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,210
No.

447
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,190
Mi Yeon's secret passcode, too.

448
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,960
No! NO! NO!

449
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,800
It wasn't!

450
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,620
Did you save me to do this?

451
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,160
To torture me like this? You act like you're the good guy,

452
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,560
but you trail me in secret and try to receive a good review at work.

453
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,700
You think I wouldn't know? I didn't kill her.

454
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,710
It wasn't Moo Yeong and it wasn't me!

455
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,790
A person was killed.

456
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,660
I didn't! I didn't kill her!  I'm telling you I didn't kill her!

457
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,060
I didn't kill her.

458
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,120
I...

459
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,190
I killed someone

460
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,040
when I was two years older than you.

461
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,040
But still,

462
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,760
you can start over.

463
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,300
I'm proof of that.

464
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,710
I don't have any more time.

465
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,150
Wrap things up here and come to the police station tomorrow morning.

466
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,000
Come

467
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,740
and turn yourself in.

Have you found anything?

470
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,530
 Cho Rong, could we meet for dinner tonight? 

471
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,340
 There's something I have to tell you. 

472
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,660
Something she has to tell me?

475
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,270
Kim Moo Yeong?

476
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:55,420
You knew, just as I thought.

477
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,940
This is the major evidence you were talking about, right?

478
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,660
The evidence that Manager Yoo discovered.

479
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,430
Cho Rong.

480
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,570
Please give me Kim Moo Yeong's personal details.

00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,430
Oh, okay.

482
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,300
 Kim Moo Young
 Personal Inquiry 

483
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,600
Here.

484
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,470
 Manager Yoo 

485
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,900
 Jin Kang, sorry but I can't make it tonight. 

486
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,020
 Have a good dinner anyway. 

487
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,280
 Welcome! 

488
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,650
I'm sorry. There aren't any seats so you'll have to wait.

489
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,230
I'll sit over there.

490
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,820
Please give me hand-pulled noodle soup.

491
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,030
Are you not even going to speak to me?

492
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,020
I guess not.

493
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,600
Why are you like this?

494
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,820
Why are you like that?

495
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,510
What did I do?

496
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,590
Why do you act as if nothing happened?

497
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,530
I got it. You might get indigestion. I surrender.

498
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,970
I enjoyed the food.

499
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:10,860
My brother said that you're playing a game.

500
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:19,450
He said that nothing means anything to you, so you're playing a game with your life.

501
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,760
Are you?

502
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,400
So, even if someone dies,

503
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:35,160
even if it's Seung Ah, you're not sad about it?

504
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,110
So, even if you could turn back time,

505
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:47,640
even knowing Seung Ah would die, or even if you were to die,

506
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,930
you would do it again?

507
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,050
I guess so.

508
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,270
I only thought about you, not realizing that Seung Ah would die.

509
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,960
I was scared.

510
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,670
Afraid they did something to you.

511
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,980
In Seung Ah's hospital room as she lay dying,

512
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,100
I was afraid you were dead.

513
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,350
I hoped you would come back, that you weren't dead.

514
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,100
But Seung Ah died.

515
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,550
I couldn't tell her I was sorry.

516
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,610
I couldn't tell her thank you.

517
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,820
Why aren't you sad?

518
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,720
Why don't you feel anything?

519
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,470
I didn't realize my friend was dying,

520
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,580
yet I was worrying about your life that you don't even care about!

521
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,770
I don't know either.

522
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:03,460
♬ I believe in the miracle of an instant of coincidence.   ♬

523
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:11,150
♬  In the instant I embrace the laughter and the pain   ♬

524
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:18,580
♬   Seasons rush by and the landscapes change too   ♬

525
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:27,410
♬   With only the memorie engraved we again ...   ♬

526
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:33,490
♬  There's no way I would know, when I face you   ♬

527
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:41,120
♬  Before I know it, I lose my way   ♬

528
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:48,850
♬  As if I'm awakening from a long dream, my mind is stunned   ♬

529
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:56,450
♬   Then the tears well up   ♬

530
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,690
Isn't that him?

531
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,650
Kim Moo Yeong!

532
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,070
For the murder of Jeong Mi Yeon,

533
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,570
you're under arrest. You understand, right?

534
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,340
You have the right to an attorney.

535
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,530
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say from now on can be used against you in a court of law.

536
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:45,840


537
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:53,000
♬   I know you'll be my own someday.   ♬

538
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:58,290
♬  No matter what kind of day it turns out to be   ♬

539
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:02,290
♬  I know you'll be my home   ♬

540
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:06,060
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

541
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,330
 He didn't kill her. 

542
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,440
 Officer Yoo! 

543
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,060
 Jeong Mi Yeon's murderer is outside right now. 

544
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:15,330
 What did you do? Were you quietly watching for everything to be over? 

545
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,340
 You don't have to date me, but don't date him. 

546
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,630
 He hurts when he's hit, too. 

547
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:21,500
 He probably enjoys being hurt! 

548
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,130
 He's a monster. 

549
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,100
 Are you scared of me? 

550
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,540
 I'm scared because it feels like you keep going towards the bad. 

551
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,060
  Jang Se Ran's Seongseo-dong pub. 

552
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,250
 Apparently, Kim Moo Yeong will make that. 

553
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,920
 I won't do it if you tell me not to. 

554
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,330
 Promise me that you'll be a good person.
