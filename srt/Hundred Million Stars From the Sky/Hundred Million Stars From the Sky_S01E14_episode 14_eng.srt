1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,940
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,070
 You're just you. 

4
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,430
 No matter what happens, 

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,010
 you are just you to me. 

6
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,590
 I need a gun. 

7
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,600
 A gun? Are you really planning to kill someone? 

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
 Episode 14 

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,000
You're here.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,340
It looks like you know who I am.

11
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,050
Yeah, Kang Seon Ho.

12
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,330
That's interesting. Is that why you hated me so much? A devil or murderer.

13
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,730
Are you really planning to shoot me?

14
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,810
If you're going to, let's go outside. Not in here.

15
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,020
I told you not to inside here.

16
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,410
How does it feel to hear a gunshot?

17
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,920
Thanks to that, I suddenly remember a lot of things I had forgotten.

18
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,500
What do you think of when you hear a gunshot?

19
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,010
If you're asking if I killed your father,

20
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,480
yeah,

21
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,170
I killed him. Your father Kang Soon Goo.

22
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,010
Oh,

23
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,880
his name was Kang Soon Goo.

24
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,130
I ...

25
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,980
shot Kang Soon Goo.

26
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,730
Why?

27
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,420
It was an accident.

28
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,240
Not that kind of answer,

29
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,740
but why?

30
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,160
Tell me. If it was an accident, why? How?

31
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,170
How did you accidentally kill my father?

32
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,510
I learned

33
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,920
for the first time today my father's name is Kang Soon Goo.

34
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,590
I heard it for the first time from you who killed him.

35
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,320
If you talk so big about being a devil or murderer,

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,170
you should at least have a reason.

37
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,800
I was happy before you appeared.

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,300
I remember that it was a dilapidated house in the mountain, but I was happy.

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,840
You ruined it all.

40
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,690
My childhood,

41
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,930
my house, my family. You ruined everything.

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,020
Yeah.

43
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,410
So, why?

44
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,990
Tell me the reason.

45
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,680
If you shoot me,

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,350
you'll really become a murderer.

47
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,470
Please, don't do it for your sake.

48
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,480
How ridiculous. You're telling me not to kill you for my own sake.

49
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,410
For me. As if you're worried about me.

50
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,740
If you want to shoot me, then shoot. But before then,

51
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,350
make me one promise.

52
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,400
Don't let my Jin Kang see it.

53
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,390
People like you are the most repulsive.

54
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,130
Did he go somewhere?

55
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,930
It's so cold.

56
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,750
 Who is it? 

57
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,960
Oh, it's me, Tak!

58
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,360
Why isn't he opening the door?

59
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,370
Why weren't you opening the door?

60
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,120
I wanted dinner with Jin Kang and you...

61
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,930
- What happened?
 - Let's go inside.

62
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,600
Hold on, what's going on?

63
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,160
It smells like gun powder.

64
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,390
A gun, isn't it?

65
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,550
Stop being pushed around by him! What the heck is all this?!

66
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,530
Eat before you work.

67
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,070
CEO!

68
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,870
What's on the menu?

69
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,350
I'm hungry!

70
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,930
Kang Soon Goo.

71
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,490
 Jang Se Ran 

72
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,450
 First, would you like to see this? 

73
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,020
 Tragedy From Fanaticism

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,610
 Tragedy From Fanaticism
 Rage Induced by Wife's False Apocalypse 

75
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,730
 Rage Induced by Wife's False Apocalypse
 Perpetrator commits suicide after murdering three devotees, including his wife. 

76
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,130
 The shocking murder that occurred at Mt. Geumah Jeolgudae on the 1st of this month,  

77
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,900
 was committed by the mailman Mr. Kang (age 32...) 

78
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,430
He was a murderer.

79
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,500
 According to Haesan Police, the suspect Kang was asking as to the whereabouts of wife Mrs. Lee (30 years old), 

80
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,140
  who joined a cult two years ago, took the kid and left home.   

81
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,440
He discovered the location of Mrs. Lee's religious group's meeting place.

82
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,790
 Next, Mr. Kang who went to the religious group's meeting place, found his wife and is suspected to have taken her home. 

83
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,320
 He strangled his wife in rage, and then murdered the other devotees,  

84
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,330
 Ms. Park (age 31) and Mr. Han (age 36), who were calling the police to report. 

85
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,690
Killed my mom...?

86
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,560
 It was an accident. 

87
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,190
 Not that. Tell me. 

88
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,480
 If it was an accident, why? How? 

89
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
 How did you accidentally kill my father? 

90
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,230
 I was happy before you appeared. 

91
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,750
 I remember that it was a dilapidated house in the mountain, but I was happy. 

92
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,390
 You ruined it all. 

93
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,150
 My childhood, 

94
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,030
 my house, 

95
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,020
 my family. 

96
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,470
 You ruined everything. 

97
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,900
 Yeah. 

98
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,860
 Sorry, I'm skipping our morning exercise today. 

99
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,600
 Kim Moo Yeong 

100
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,260
Was this it?

101
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,660
The real reason that you didn't stop me.

102
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,810
I can't believe it.

103
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,530
I thought he was a police officer, but he was a murderer,

104
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,140
who killed his own wife, at that.

105
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,770
Drink the tea.

106
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,470
That was only your father's doing.

107
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,280
In a time that you can't even recall,

108
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,230
something happened that has nothing to do with you.

109
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,680
I feel so dirty.

110
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,500
It has nothing to do with me,

111
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,130
but why does it

112
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,370
seem to explain a lot about me?

113
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,540
That that's why I am the way I am now.

114
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,570
Kim Moo Yeong!

115
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,400
Kim Moo Yeong!

116
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,320
A murderer?

117
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,870
That's the kind of father that suits me so well.

118
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,280
Someone said this to me,

119
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,010
that I'm not even a human. That I'm a devil.

120
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,770
But in the end, he was right.

121
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,430
Are you saying that you have a murderer's genes?

122
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,110
What do you think about me?

123
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,270
I'm like you.

124
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,720
My father was a murderer as well.

125
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,410
The first child that appears in my book,

126
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,550
the murderer's child was me.

127
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,760
That's why I couldn't stop you.

128
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,770
Back then, I thought I was giving you your final chance.

129
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,710
But now I regret it. I was wrong.

130
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Now that I'm over 40 years old, I finally realize it.

131
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,750
That a father's acts belong only to him.

132
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,430
Moo Yeong, your past doesn't define you.

133
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,280
The present,

134
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,590
right now is what makes you, you.

135
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,210
Don't let yourself and others get hurt by things that have nothing to do with you.

136
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,560
Hurt? I don't get hurt.

137
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,180
No matter who your anger is aimed at,

138
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,580
in the end, the rage will only hurt you. You'll inflict wounds on yourself and

139
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,460
it will only hurt those you love.

140
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,180
- Did you see him?
 - Yes.

141
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,780
Seeing how quickly you returned, he must not have resisted.

142
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,390
He didn't.

143
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,650
 What the heck? 

144
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,490
 Personal Assistant Choi Tae Gyeong 

145
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,780
 You worked at Haesan Police Department in the fall of '93, didn't you? 

146
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,820
Here. This is the voice recording file.

147
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,230
Of course, money talks.

148
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,790
Get in touch with our friend.

149
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,730
Wow, it's Yoo Jin Kang.

150
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,700
Did you exercise?

151
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,480
Where were you?

152
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,360
I went to see the doctor.

153
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,090
I'm hungry. I'm making ramen. Will you eat some?

154
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,140
Something's wrong, isn't there?

155
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,780
Nothing's wrong.

156
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,360
Really, nothing's wrong.

157
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,190
I think something is wrong with you though.

158
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,780
What's the matter?

159
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,530
Why did you throw it away?

160
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,350
It's all fake. It's a stupid story that I made up.

161
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,300
How is that fake?

162
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,370
Children's drawings can't lie.

163
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,360
Mine must have.

164
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,980
Kim Moo Yeong,

165
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,960
I want to tell you everything. I want to tell you, but...

166
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:04,630
 Your parents must have been good people. 

167
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,190
 They were definitely good people since they named their son that way. 

168
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,370
But next time.

169
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,370
I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

170
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,630
I'm hungry, too.

171
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,780
What should I do?

172
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,050
I want eggs. You want one, too?

173
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,650
It dropped.

174
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,270
They said my father killed someone.

175
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,720
Three people. He killed them.

176
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,360
People?

177
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,580
You should go.

178
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,740
Kim Moo Yeong,

179
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,790
I want to be alone. Please.

180
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,160
You don't like me being here?

181
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,970
For now.

182
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,790
I'll take the drawing.

183
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,530
 It's all fake. It's a stupid story that I made up myself. 

184
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,390
Excuse me!

185
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,260
Don't be late to the meeting later.  (speaking formally) 

186
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,960
Okay.

187
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,020
Your face doesn't look too good.

188
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,190
You look like you weren't able to use the gun.

189
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,530
Go listen to it.

190
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,790
You'll know when you hear it, but it's an obvious story.

191
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,420
Back then, the newbie out of the five Haesan Police Dept Violent Crimes unit is

192
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,160
now working in Wonyeong Police Dept.

193
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,260
His name is Lee Gyeong Cheol and is currently Yoo Jin Gook's violent crimes team manager.

194
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,400
 Your dad? Who's your dad? 

195
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,390
 My dad. 

196
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,150
 By chance, are you... 

197
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,140
 What's your dad's name? 

198
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,960
 Go! You don't even know your dad's name! 

199
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,410
 Go already, I said! There's nobody here like that. 

200
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,870
Why?

201
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,380
Now that I look, it's someone I recognize.

202
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,050
I'll have a listen.

203
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,540
Want me to take care of Yoo Jin Gook for you?

204
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,510
The gun. Isn't he the one you wanted it for?

205
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,900
If you're wavering because he's your girlfriend's brother,

206
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,110
I can get rid of him for you.

207
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,730
If you lay a hand on him,

208
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,170
I don't think I can sit still.

209
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,330
You said we're alike. So you should know

210
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,990
that I don't like people butting into my games.

211
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,660
I know, of course.

212
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,120
 Truthfully, it's so annoying. 

213
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,530
 Kang Soon Goo, that bastard, would have been executed anyway. 

214
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,000
 It's so annoying that even now, those names Kang Soon Goo 

215
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,680
 Lee Mi Yeong, his wife that he killed, 

216
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,620
 and victims Han Jong Soo, Park Jeong Ae, 

217
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,120
 I can't forget those names. 

218
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,970
 Lee Mi Yeong, his wife that he killed, 

219
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,990
Lee Mi Yeong,

220
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,980
 victims Han Jeong Soo, Park Jeong Ae, 

221
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,150
 I can't forget those names. 

222
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,780
I'm so sick of that guy Yoo Jin Gook.

223
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,600
Why ruin his life over accidentally killing a murderer?

224
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,920
Anyone could see that it was just self-defense.

225
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,900
 Back then, we all tried to stop him, 

226
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,030
 saying it was dangerous in the mountains. 

227
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,400
 We were about to arrive, so we could all go in together. 

228
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,160
 But he said the situation looked so bad that he went in alone. 

229
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,640
 What could be done? 

230
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,220
 When he arrived, Lee Mi Yeong was already dead. 

231
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,860
 And Park Jeong Ae who had reported him, Han Jong Soo, they were all dead. 

232
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,070
 And right then, they faced each other. 

233
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,020
 Kang Soon Goo who was armed. 

234
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,120
 Drop the ax. 

235
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,040
 Do you know what the weapon was? 

236
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,410
 It was a hand axe. A hand axe. 

237
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,780
 Dripping with blood. 

238
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,590
 The supervisors said to cover it up. He said he couldn't do that. 

239
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,600
 The team was disbanded. 

240
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,210
 But this guy said he lost the murderer's kid, 

241
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,190
 and went around for months looking for him like crazy. 

242
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,290
 Come outside. 

243
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,690
Kim Moo Yeong!

244
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,040
You said not here.

245
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,190
Why were you looking for me?

246
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:27,230
Because I killed your father, and I lost you.

247
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,910
So? Why were you looking for me?

248
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,690
Like everyone else, you could have said he deserved to die. He would've been executed anyway.

249
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,600
You could have just said it was unfortunate.

250
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,860
How did you find out?

251
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,300
Don't look at me like that.

252
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,160
Can't you be honest like everyone else?

253
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,170
I tried to be like everyone else.

254
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,540
That is what was unfair. Why did it have to happen to me?

255
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,470
It was justified because he moved first. But...

256
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,830
Clearly,

257
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,750
Kang Soon Goo had moved first.

258
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,560
But later I realized,

259
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,900
that you were there.

260
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:38,740
 Kang Soon Goo wasn't trying to raise his weapon. 

261
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,330
 He was trying to hide it behind his back. 

262
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,630
 Because he didn't want you to see him like that. 

263
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,350
The voice I heard then,

264
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,550
 Dad! 

265
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,300
I couldn't forget your anguished voice.

266
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,770
Even though I tried to justify it any way I could,

267
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,160
I couldn't forget that I had killed a person that day.

268
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,670
I'm sorry.

269
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,470
You shouldn't have done it even if you were sorry.

270
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,680
I thought my father was a police officer since you were looking for me.

271
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,060
The thought that you were the one in my mind whenever I longed for my dad,

272
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,250
I can't deal with it.

273
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,020
Don't think I'm forgiving you just because I didn't shoot you.

274
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,170
I won't ever do that.

275
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,740
Kim Moo Yeong!

276
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:20,990
Your father is at The Bongin Temple in Daegoong quarter.

277
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:28,320
His memorial is September 18 on the lunar calendar,

278
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,580
or November 1 on the solar calendar.

279
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,250
 - But why today?
 - Hmm? 

280
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,420
 Why do you go to the temple every November 1? 

281
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,390
 That's true. 

282
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,850
 Why is it always on that date? 

283
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,740
 We just always did since we lived in Haesan,  

284
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,090
 ever since I was really little, so I never thought about it. 

285
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:15,790
 But I think I just like it. Like a secret annual trip with my brother, 

286
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,500
 because I looked forward to November 1st more than school picnics when I was young. 

287
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,320
 Kim Moo Yeong 

288
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,790
 You should go. I want to be alone. 

289
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,500
 Please. 

290
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,490
What are you doing, not sleeping?

291
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,340
Oh, I came out for some water.

292
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,080
I should sleep.

293
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,050
Go to sleep.

294
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,020
Jin Kang, I'm going to Haesan tomorrow.

295
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,090
Haesan?

296
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,790
Yeah. It's been a long time since visiting Mom.

297
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,600
Should I go with you?

298
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,760
No, it's Sunday. Just rest at home.

299
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,620
You want to be alone, too.

300
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,130
Huh?

301
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,680
Nothing. Good night.

302
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,320
Okay.

303
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,150
Oh, Tak.

304
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,900
 Did you change your entry passcode? 

305
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,560
Yeah, I should change it.

306
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,600
 Don't just say it. Change it now. Should I come change it? 

307
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,590
No, no. I'm not going to be home today.

308
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,590
 Where are you going? 

309
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,750
I think it's funny,

310
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:37,400
that even when we're all grown, the first person we think of when things get us down is our mom.

311
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,210
I can't deny that.

312
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,150
I couldn't help thinking about my mom.

313
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,360
From the beginning,

314
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,220
since I was this high, I was so stubborn.

315
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,160
You know, those kids who don't listen even when they're scolded.

316
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,960
So, I got spanked so much by my mom.

317
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,090
I can just see it.

318
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,050
Right?

319
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,040
Was it because I had a pattern of being hit?

320
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,880
I got hit even when I was over 20 years old.

321
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,650
When I got a job and worked at the police department, in the morning before work,

322
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,400
she would hit my back saying to watch out for cars.

323
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,040
When I returned home, because I didn't put my socks in the laundry,

324
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,790
I got hit on the back.

325
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,960
But...

326
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,060
After that incident, I never got smacked on the back again.

327
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,780
She ...

328
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,250
was worried about me doing something extreme.

329
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,430
I must have had her walking on eggshells.

330
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,960
She was healthy and normal, but in less than three years,

331
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,920
she passed away.

332
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,350
I was lying down to sleep last night,

333
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:15,600
and I suddenly wished my mom would hit me on the back again.

334
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,860
"Hey, kid."

335
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,530
"Get a hold of yourself."

336
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,620

♬   I am wandering over time which has been placed in disarray,   ♬

♬   I believe in the miracle of an instant of coincidence  ♬

 We Can Find Them, If We Do It Together

♬  The seasons rush by   ♬

343
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,430
 How does it look? 

344
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,000
 They all look really happy. They're all smiling. 

345
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,040
 Look, there's even an angel. 

346
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,670
 Since I was little, I always thought my dad was a cop. 

347
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,270
♬   There's no way for me to know ♬

348
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:03,020
 In my imagination, my father is still looking for me.

 From whereever he is... 

352
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:18,100
 Ardently. Me, his lost son. 

353

 That's why 

356
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,250
 I'm not an abandoned child. 

357
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,690
 I'm a child that was lost. 

358
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:55,320
♬   In that instant I embrace the laughter and pain.    ♬

371
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,750
Are you really okay with me as I am?

372
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,010
Of course.

373
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,120
I want to be born again.

374
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:25,090

♫  I know from the time we were one.  ♫

♫  Our fate had begun.  ♫

382

♫  A star that you cannot see in the sky  ♫
Yes, it's all set.

383
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,780
We just need to wait 30 minutes.
♫  A star that you cannot see in the sky  ♫

384
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,580
♫  A star which is living inside of me  ♫

385
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,770
What's the big deal about rice? 
♫  A star which is living inside of me  ♫

386
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,650
You said you want to be born again. 
♫  A star which is living inside of me  ♫

387
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,040
And so? 
♫  A star which is living inside of me  ♫

388
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,890
You have to live in a warm house. 
♫  It's okay if it is just the two of us in the dark night,  ♫

389
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,990
A warm house smells like warm rice. 
♫  It's okay if it is just the two of us in the dark night,   ♫

390
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,200
♫  Close our eyes together.  ♫

391
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,560
It's so easy. 
♫  Close our eyes together.  ♫

392

Right?

Bon appetite!

00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,690

♫  Breathing as one  ♫

399

What's so amusing? 
♫  Breathing as one  ♫

400
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,250
♫  Breathing as one  ♫

401
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:26,550
I thought about the first time I came here. 
♫  One's love.  ♫

402
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,780
 I thought this was one strange house.  
♫  One's love.  ♫

403
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,210
 I thought this room was very much like you.  
♫  Light, your light warm and shining  ♫

404
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,260
♫  Light your light warm and shining  ♫

405
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,730
 It was a really dark and cold room.  
♫  Light your light warm and shining  ♫

406
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,780
 A room that insists that it's over whenever you decide to leave. 

407
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,170
 A room that makes one lonely the more you look at it.  
♫  Light, My light makes me breathe  ♫

408
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,640
 I hope there are more and more things.  
♫  On a dark day you brighten  ♫

409
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,750
♫  On a dark day you brighten  ♫

410
00:48:52,750 --> 00:49:00,470
 If you have a cat, you need to feed it.  If you have flowers, you need to water them.  
♫  Let's close our eyes together  ♫

411
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,490
 If there's food, you need to eat it before it rots.  
♫  The star is us  ♫

412
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,200
♫  The star is us  ♫

413
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,650
 I hope these things will hold you and won't let you go, 

414
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,660
 so you can't go anywhere.  
♫  Let's close our eyes together  ♫

415
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,960
 I'm not going anywhere.  
♫  Let's close our eyes together  ♫

416
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,070
 Even without anything, 

417
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,730
 even if I go far away 

418
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,990
 I'll return to you. 

419
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,990
What brings you here at this hour?

420
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,320
I'm returning this.

421
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,920
You're returning it? Why?

422
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,930
I don't need it any longer.

423
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,580
I used one bullet.

424
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,650
You used a bullet? I didn't hear anything on the news.

425
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,410
Anyway.

426
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,410
You don't want to hear about your younger sibling?

427
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:59,810
You're returning this pretty thing. I'm a little disappointed.

428
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,320
Let me know if you ever need it again.

429
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,890
You look extremely curious.

430
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,230
 What is this? 

431
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,430
 It's Kang Soon Goo's Certificate of Expulsion so it is the family registry. 

432
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:31,440
 So, it's Kang Soon Goo's registry, but what is this? Are you sure this is really correct? 

433
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,950
 Yes. There were two children who were admitted to Haesan Hospital that day. 

434
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,780
The younger sibling that you were looking for doesn't exist.

435
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,790
Doesn't exist?

436
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,280
A younger brother.

437
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,220
 The girl was adopted by Lee Jeong Sil six months after the incident. 

438
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,130
 Lee Jeong Sil? 

439
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:57,250
 It's Yoo Jin Gook's mother Lee Jeong Sil 

440
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:02,310
 Then that child is Yoo Jin Kang? 

441
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,130
What do you mean doesn't exist?

442
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,320
You really don't know anything, do you?

443
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,750
You really don't know at all about the most important thing.

444
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,060
Hurry up and tell me.

445
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,060
This is the first time seeing you so impatient.

446
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,380
Looking at you like this, I don't want to tell you for free.

447
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:30,450
Don't you think you should give me something, too?

448
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,490
We'll have our important discussion here. Okay?

449
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,000
Okay.

450
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,830
Wait a minute. I'll go buy tickets.

451
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,050
Kim Moo Yeong!

452
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,600
When did you buy those?

453
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,640
It's a given.

454
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,170
Let's ride that!

455
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,760
I'm not riding that. Never.

456
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,980
Are you really going to be like this? This is my first time at a theme park with a boyfriend.

457
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,850
What am I supposed to do? You should have done this before.

458
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,860
- Are you riding it or not?
 - I'm not.

459
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,740
I said I'm not riding it.

460
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,590
- You're riding it.
 - I'm not, I'm not!

461
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,670
 Just what did you do to me? 

462
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,040
 I wonder. 

463
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,890
 I don't believe it. How did I get here? 

464
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,750
Look at that.

465
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,230
It's so amazing.

466
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,320
Doesn't it look like it's connected?

467
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,110
It does.

468
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,850
It looks like a map.

469
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,510
We must have followed this map to get to here.

470
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,070
 Is it your first time seeing a burn scar? 

471
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,690
 No. 

472
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,810
 Don't mind her. This woman is weird. Other women aren't like that. 

473
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,460
 Do you really think that works on women? 

474
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,890
 Yeah, of course. 

475
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:18,890
 "Oh no! When did it happen? It must hurt! Ooohhh!" 

476
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,890
 Alien. Reptile.  

477
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,310
 Alien. Crocodile wallet. 

478
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,680
It's boiling.

479
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,170
It's cold. Put something on first.

480
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,190
I'll do it.

481
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,280
No, it's okay.

482
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,780
- Are you okay?
 - I'm fine.

483
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,460
Let me see.

484
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,160
This won't do.

485
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,290
It's okay!

486
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,420
The pharmacy is still open.

487
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,030
Here you go.

488
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,000
Thank you.

♬   A small alley, barely seen.  ♬  

490
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,450
 Dad! 

491
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,690
 My brother said there was a fire at home. 

492
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,390
 It's so amazing. Doesn't it look like it's connected? 

493
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,920
 I'm not my brother's biological sister. 

494
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,950
 You really don't know anything. 

495
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,080
 You don't know at all about the most important thing. 

496
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,620
 The younger sibling you're looking for doesn't exist. 

497
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,320
 A younger brother. 

498
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,240
It was a younger sister.

499
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,160


500
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:28,820
♫  A star that you cannot see in the sky  ♫

501
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:36,440
♫  A star which is living inside of me  ♫

502
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,520
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes  
♫  It's okay if it is just the two of us in the dark night.  ♫

503
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,850
♫  It's okay if it is just the two of us in the dark night.  ♫

504
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:52,360
♫  Close our eyes together.  ♫

505
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,510
♫  The star is us.  ♫
