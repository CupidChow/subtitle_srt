00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:08,530

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,020
  The Smile Has Left Your Eyes

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,190
 Wednesday's Interview with Psychiatrist, Dr. Yang Kyeong Mo 

4
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,400
You must have been very rebellious at this time. When was this?

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,860
I was twenty-seven... No, twenty-eight.

6
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,930
You were very flower boyish. Very handsome.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,470
That person here...?

8
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,320
Pardon?

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,360
No... This person here...

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,010
By chance, is it that boy?

11
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,680
Ah, yes. I didn't know it, either. When I zoomed it in today...

12
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,780
This person is here.

13
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,370
That's fascinating.  My next question was about that boy.

14
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,930
Since we're talking about it, I'll bring it up.

15
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,740
When you couldn't adjust to medical school and were wondering around,

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,870
your meeting with a boy changed your life, you said.

17
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,960
How can an eight-year-old boy change the life of a fully grown adult?

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,190
His gaze was so enigmatic.

19
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,910
Initially, my curiosity made me follow him around, but...

20
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,150
You followed him around?

21
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,750
Ah, yes.

22
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,700
I knew that later.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,050
That I wandered around in order to meet him.

24
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,490
 Episode One 

25
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,540
That's interesting.

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,200
 Then could we say that encountering that boy 

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,960
 was the crucial moment in shaping whom you have become, Dr. Yang Kyeong Mo? 

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,330
 Yes, that's what I think. 

29
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,040
 This is getting more interesting. 

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,430


31
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,000
- Jae Min! 
 - Yes.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,210
What are you doing?

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,400
Excuse me.

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Are there any witnesses who may have heard any strange sounds during the fall?

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,380
So, before you found his body in the morning and reported it, no one knew about it, right?

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,020
No one knows when she fell either.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Right.  No one knew about it at all.

38
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,190
You know, with the rain and thunderstorm yesterday,

39
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,090
it was so loud.

40
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,030
Hey, can we turn the TV off?

41
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,640
Yes, you can.

42
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
Cho Rong!

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,050
 He should be thirty years old by now. 

44
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,200
  What do you think that boy is doing now? Do you know? 

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,500
 I have no idea. 

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,140
  I've always been curious, too, how he turned out. 

47
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,400
Let's go!

48
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,140
Salute!

49
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,860
What brings you here, sir? You are off duty but you haven't left work yet?

50
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,020
I need to know what's going on before leaving. What's going on?

51
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,720
Suicide by jumping off the building. Twenty-two-year-old college girl.

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,610
Why would a twenty-two-year-old do that?

53
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,820
I don't know yet.

54
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,000
I saw the eyes of the dead earlier, and oh my!

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,210
She's so pretty!

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,720
I wonder why a pretty girl like that committed suicide.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,890
Are you sure?

58
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,030
Yes! She's so pretty!

59
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,310
You idiot! I'm asking if it's confirmed that it's suicide.

60
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,010
- That's probably...
 - Say it with your eyes properly opened.

61
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,950
Chief.

62
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,690
What is it, huh?

63
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,870
That's you're saying, "whoa"?

64
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,100
Whoa, you must really be going somewhere nice, huh?

65
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,500
 Light and Clay 
 Wow...

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,300
Maybe because they're rich, even the invitation looks fancy.

67
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,360
Seung Ah is not super rich.

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,760
My phone, wallet, and

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,230
I've got this also.

70
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,990
Department Head, this is for you!

71
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,180
- I have the invitation, too.
 - Good luck!

72
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,220
I'm leaving.

73
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,340
Have a good time.

74
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,950
- Are you going now? You have the portfolio, right? 
 - Yes.

75
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,960
Okay! Then, hurry and change into this!

76
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,570
What is this?

77
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,240
You know that the fate of our company depends on you today, right?

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,330
And you're going to go looking like this?

79
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,310
But the department head is late.

80
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,290
That's right, I'm late! I'll go and change there!

81
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,250
- Let me leave. 
 - Oh? Okay.

82
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,820
Alright, alright. Get changed as soon as you get there.

83
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,450
Before you meet Jang Woo Sang!

84
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,180
I heard NJ's chairman's son is in charge of today's event.

85
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,010
From the exhibition to the party. The whole deal! It's a birthday gift for his girlfriend.

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,350
What a good life.

87
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,210
What's going on? It's not even rush hour. Was there an accident?

88
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,550
I don't know and I don't care. I'm off duty.

89
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,450
I can't see anything.

90
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,520
I called the Insurance company—

91
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,160
- Why are you driving here like that? 
- Alright. I called the Insurance company, so someone from—

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,230
I'm not talking about the insurance company!

93
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,750
Get your car out.

94
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,480
Go forward.

95
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,030
- Stop fighting. 
- Okay. 
 - I wasn't trying not to fight, but he is...

96
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,950
Alright. Move the car.

97
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,920
Let's get moving.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,280
 Please date 

99
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,730
- Ah!
 -  Where are you? Are you on your way? 

100
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,660
I left, of course. I'm speeding my way there. Are you on your way?

101
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,510
Yeah.

102
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,950
I'm opening my car door. I'm getting out now. I just opened my door. Yes, right now.

103
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,000
 Light and Clay 

104
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,740
Seung Ah...

105
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,310
Oh, Unni...

106
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,640
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

107
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,510
No. I should go inside.

108
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,250
You must be nervous, huh?

109
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,380
I want to die.

110
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,720
What's the matter? Is there something wrong?

111
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm just kidding! Did I scare you?

112
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,300
Hey! You really scared me!

113
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,910
Why do you have so much stuff? Leave it in the car.

114
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,880
Should I?

115
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,050
Let's go.

116
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,550
Wow, Hyung. Take a look at this.

117
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,920
This is crazy.

118
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,860
Hyung, isn't this car awesome?

119
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,210
She hasn't shown up at all during the display, and she is still called an artist.

120
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,500
She was born with the silver spoon in her mouth.

121
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,010
But this is just too much.

122
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,150
She is pretty though.

123
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,630
But I'm a bit envious of the car.

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,310
780S White?

125
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,840
That was a Valentine's day gift from her boyfriend.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,640
Baek Seung Ah is pretty though. Super pretty!

127
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,340
Did you hear that? That was Baek Seung Ah's car.

128
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,710
You can come down after 20 minutes. The reception and the party is from 8 PM.

129
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,990
The party will be the end of all parties.

130
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,850
Because it's a surprise, he told us not to tell you—

131
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,040
Yes, you've worked hard.

132
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,880
From 7:30 PM, for thirty minutes, there'll be an artist talk with reporters.

133
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,710
Artist talk?

134
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,810
There's such a strong interest from the reporters

135
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,640
that they prefer you personally attend to it rather than me.

136
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,850
Why was it decided without any discussion?

137
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,350
Because it was a direct order from Executive Director Jang.

138
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,110
Oppa, where are you?

139
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,870
 What about Executive Director Jang?  Did he arrive? 

140
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,360
Oh, not yet.

141
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,510
 Did you change? 

142
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,090
Of course! It fits well and it's so pretty!

143
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,580
 Great!  Are you ready to charge ahead? 

144
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,950
 Just pack up and offer it to Jang Woo Sang. 

145
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,150
 Executive Director, please accept this. The designer brand's new standard design 

146
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,820
 L Room! Push, push. Please push it a little. Okay? 

147
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,900
Okay!

148
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:29,040


149
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,990
Executive Director, okay?

150
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,070
Yeah, doing that is ... well. it's being cute.

151
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,670
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

152
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,640
Are you possibly an Arts employee?

154
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,470
- Yes.
 - Oh!

155
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,170
Will they be serving beer here today? What will you be serving?

156
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,480
Ramée Belgian Ale, Sunshine Golden Ale, Live Lime Pale Ale,

157
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,420
Blue Neville Light Stout, Clove Weizen.

158
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,170
How about Something You Brown Ale and Last Dance IPA?

159
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,510
We didn't have those today.

160
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,310
I see.

161
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,320
Well, I'll get going!

162
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,830
Is this your car?

163
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,160
Oh, no, it's my friend's.

164
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,530
Oh. I knew it.

165
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,100
Knew what?

166
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,050
It's that you don't seem to be very pretty.

167
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,750
Hey, do you know me?

168
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,380
No, not at all.

169
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,820
You must have bought that recently.

170
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,710
What the... What did I buy recently?

171
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,820
You said you were flying over here, so why are you walking?

172
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,950
I'm running over here. Whoa!

173
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,410
Who is this? Is this perhaps the person I know, Yoo Jin Kang?

174
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,040
Don't say it. Don't say anything. I know it, too.

175
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,590
It is Yoo Jin Kang, the person I know.

176
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,210
Oh, this...

177
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,650
Oh, that's why... that's why!

178
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,930
This is embarrassing!

179
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,310
I'm more embarrassed.

180
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,720
Spreading the word all over the neighborhood that you bought new clothes.

181
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,480
- "I bought clothes!"
 - What are you doing?!

182
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,160
Ajussi.

183
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
Congratulations, Artist Baek.

184
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
Oh, thank you!

185
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,750
Wow, this is great!

186
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,020
You made all these?

187
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,150
It's amazing!

188
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,980
It's really amazing. I heard you're having a party afterwards too.

189
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,270
Woo Sang has set up fireworks too, for her birthday present.

190
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,780
Oh my. It must be great to have a boyfriend giving someone that kind of present.

191
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,940
Is she possibly going to be forever alone?

192
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,140
No way. Dating is something one does without their family being aware.

193
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,980
Please! I wish that would happen!

194
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,340
Oh, he's here.

195
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,120
In real life he is a lot better looking.

196
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,240
Ajussi, please give me a minute.

197
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,370
Oh, okay.

198
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,380
See me for a minute.

199
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,370
What's with her expression on this wonderful day?

200
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,370
I know, right?

201
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,100
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

202
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,780
What's your dissatisfaction this time, Baek Seung Ah?

203
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,050
Cancel it, the artist talk.

204
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,400
Why?

205
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,220
To what extent must I be the fool?

206
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,700
Professor Hong will be attending.

207
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,920
How can I do that when the professor is coming here?

208
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,170
Why can't you? That's more the reason why you should.

209
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,800
Oppa!

210
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,530
Let's exclude what the professor made.

211
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,350
'The White Shadow' 'The sound of Cherry Blossoms' They make me feel suffocated, just by looking at them.  Hmm?

212
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,950
This is really not right. How can I have an exhibit with what I didn't make?

213
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:02,280
You wanted to have your own exhibition. But your skill alone was not enough, you said.

214
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,910
Weren't you in agreement with this?

215
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,650
I didn't know that it would go this far?

216
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,330
Who do you think proposed it first?

217
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,300
Hong Ji Won. It was her.

218
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,350
What?

219
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,130
She is the one who wanted to sell it first. So, what's the problem now that it's yours?

220
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,040
Hey there.

221
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,620
What are you doing?

222
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,810
Kim Moo Yeong.

223
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,380
Are you an Arts employee?

224
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,820
You know what I mean, right, Kim Moo Yeong?

225
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,560
Yes.

226
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,540
So, what is being demanded?

227
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,010
- Right now?
 - Oppa.

228
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,720
I need to go to the company for a while.  You can handle it well, right?

229
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,100
- Oppa.
 - Aren't you going to take it?

230
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,820
You must really not want to do that, huh? The artist talk?

231
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,600
If you don't want to do it, then don't. Is it really that difficult?

232
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,290
Look here. Just keep your promise.

233
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,100
Promise? Oh, I promised.

234
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,730
What are you doing?

235
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,790
I'm not going to keep it. What I promised you.

236
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,760
You're not going to keep it?

237
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,690
Why? Why all of a sudden?

238
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,050
Tell me what you want? What is it that you want?

239
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,130
Don't do it. The artist talk.

240
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,120
What is it?

241
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,440
You  do  really want to do it, then?

242
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,210
Ah, I guess it's possible that you would want to.

243
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,580
Pretending to be won over, pretending like you made it all by yourself.

244
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,200
What are you saying now?

245
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,270
Just because you know my weakness, am I an easy target?

246
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,970
Just a bit.

247
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,650
What do you think that you know?

248
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,180
What is it that you think you know, that you would...

249
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,700
Even without your interference,

250
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,050
I feel most pathetic. I already feel pathetic to the point of wanting to die.

251
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,580
But I've come this far. So what am I supposed to do at this point?

252
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,790
I understand.

253
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,950
Look here. What do you think you know—

254
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,320
I learned that you don't want to do the artist talk.

255
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,250
Now that I know, you don't have to do it anymore.

256
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,830
Look here.

257
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,170
Oppa. Ah.

258
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,640
Have you seen  Seung Ah?

259
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,270
I haven't seen her in a while.

260
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,210
Right. Where did she go?

261
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,130
 You really don't want to do the artist talk? 

262
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,340
 If you don't want to do it, then don't. Is it really that difficult? 

263
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,870
  Pretending to be won over, pretending like you made it all by yourself. 

264
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,620
  You really do want to do it, then? 

265
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,870
When is it starting?

266
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,180
When is she coming?

267
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,300
The time is getting late.

268
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,510
They said it would start at 7:30.

269
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,910
 We'll begin the artist talk. 

270
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,660
What's happening?

271
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,090
It-it's not, it's not me.

272
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,680
It was him!

273
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,960
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

274
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,900
What the heck is this?

275
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,810
Hurry up and bring out the desert, so we can clean this up, okay?

276
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Security team! Security team!

277
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,290
 Sir! It wasn't suicide! It is a murder case. 

278
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,720
- Please give me a refill of the Sunshine Golden Ale.
 - Yes, a refill.

279
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,760
- The same thing.
 - Of course, the same thing.

280
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,830
- Thank you!
 - Of course.

281
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,140
Drink this.

282
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,380
You were asking for Something You Brown Ale.

283
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,980
Don't if you don't  like it.

284
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,020
- Here you go. 
 Thank you.

285
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,410
- Thanks. 
 - Please enjoy it.

286
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,290
Another beer, please.

287
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,860
Here.  We just pour this in.

288
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,810
Yes.

289
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,930
- Did something happen?
 - No, just...

290
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,830
Am I that ugly?

291
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,840
What?!

292
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,530
I said, "Am I that ugly?"

293
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,340
Yes.  Very ugly.

294
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,590
- Oppa! 
 - Your temperament is even worse. Really.

295
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,200
Why? Did someone say you are ugly?

296
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,610
Him! The one on the right in the black shirt.

297
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,760
Right? All people see the same thing.

298
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,120
Good, then!

299
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,900
That your carefully raised youngest sister is very ugly, no matter who looks serves you right.

300
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,590
But ...  have we seen the guy over there somewhere?

301
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,170
Well, do we know him?

302
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,500
We saw him earlier. He broke the pottery.

303
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,520
No, before that.

304
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,640
No. I've never seen such an annoying guy before.

305
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,710
Is that right?

306
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,510
By the way,  when will there be fireworks?

307
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,620
Ah ... any minute.  Let's find good seats.

308
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,760
Over there, over there!

309
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,120
Over there. Jin Gang. Jin Gang. 
  - Yeah.

310
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,800
But, what's this?  You  have been holding on to it continuously. Are you attached to it?

311
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,770
- Right.  Jang Woo Sang. 
 - Huh?

312
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,730
Whatever.  I haven't seen him since before.

313
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,790
- Let's just have a drink. 
 - Yes, let's go.

314
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,990
Let's go!

315
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,690
Let's go that way.  That way.  Pour some more. Again and again.

316
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,530
How many times have you changed it?

317
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,240
When you weren't here, I changed it three times.

318
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,510
Hui Joon.  Take over for a bit.

319
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,060
Hyung.

320
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,310
That ...

321
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,080
Earlier ...  you did that deliberately, didn't you?

322
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,770
Why?

323
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,300
Well...

324
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,240
You were so pretty.

325
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,750
What?

326
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,560
What are you...

327
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,590
Wasn't it a shame?   I heard it was expensive.

328
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,190
Ah, no...

329
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,980
No. I feel like I can fly.

330
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,130
Then that's fine. Then go and enjoy now.

331
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,420
Seung Ah! Baek Seung Ah!

332
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,610
He's looking for you.

333
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,020
Cheers! Cheers!

334
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,940
 Oppa Woo Sang 
 What do I do?

335
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,180
 Oppa Woo Sang 

336
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,520
 The person you called is not available. 

337
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,590
He's gone.

338
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,480
It's a present since it's your birthday.

339
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,020
Congratulations.

340
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,180
Hey!

341
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,020
That's so loud!

342
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,940
That's loud! Hey!

343
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,600
I said it's loud! Get up!

344
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,580
Get up! Get up!

345
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,280
You didn't eat the breakfast I made. You are just so lazy!

346
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,200
Do you even wash your hair once every three days?

347
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,290
That's why you can't be dating.

348
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:57,380
You don't know.  I do date. And at that, very intensely.

349
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,600
Dating?

350
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,550
For the last two years, there haven't even been any suspects for a date showing up.

351
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,850
For the last two years, there hasn't been any suspicious night out.

352
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,900
There's been no purchase of naughty underwear.

353
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,380
You've never secretly snuck out holding your cell  phone to take a call.

354
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,590
Birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's Day, rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, etc, etc, etc!

355
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,910
You've never come holding any male-smelling object.  That's you.

356
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,770
I thought you were a rapper.

357
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,400
Peace!

358
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,860
Why is this?   The best natural detective

359
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,620
among the veteran detectives is here, that's me.

360
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,170
I just walked into the police station and the sunbaes stopped dead.

361
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh, welcome, come on in, man. Just that.

362
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,720
You are it. You were born to be it.  Just compliments.

363
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,330
While being  Manager Yoo.

364
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,350
What?!

365
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,620
What is it now?

366
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,510
The brother I know has never been a veteran detective.

367
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,350
As a result, your nickname is Manager Yoo. Why?

368
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,940
Because you're not like a detective.   You are like a white-collar employee, a manager for years.

369
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,420
How did you know?

370
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,810
- That's just what Unni Tak said. 
 - Brat.

371
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,750
Go lost! I'm late. Have a good day.

372
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,410
You too!

373
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,650
Manager Yoo, fighting!!!

374
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,150
What did Jang Woo Sang say?

375
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,740
What is it? Don't tell me you couldn't even deliver it?

376
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,390
That's not it, right? Tell me that's not it!

377
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,590
Really! We are talking about 300 million ($300k) in annual sales!

378
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,510
The bidding is so fierce.  How can you not even use the connection you have!

379
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,960
- How can my friend's boyfriend be a connect—
 - Aish!

380
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
It's a connection.  It's a valuable connection.

381
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,930
Ugh, really?!

382
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,540
President, I think we will be fine.  Even if I didn't do that,  I think we will win.

383
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,510
I have complete confidence in our presentation this time.

384
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,630
I don't know. I hate you.

385
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,420
I hate myself too.

386
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,580
The victim is Jeong Mi Yeon

387
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,590
Twenty-two years old, a third-year dance major at Seong Min University. She is taking time off from school.

388
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,550
The result of checking the black box of the vehicle in front of the flower bed where the victim landed

389
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,960
shows that the exact time of the crash was 3:04 am yesterday morning.

390
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:56,130
Although the immediate  cause of death  was  just injury to the cervical vertebrae

391
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,900
based on the many bloodstains identified by the Luminol response,

392
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,920
prior to the fall, the victim had already sustained a fatal injury to the occiput (back of head) from a blunt instrument.

393
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,750
While moving to the veranda,

394
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,950
it appears she was deliberately pushed by someone.

395
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,820
After the perpetrator very thoroughly cleaned  the scene of the crime, he fled.

396
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,140
This is a picture of the scene of the crime when you first enter.

397
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,660
As you can see, it's almost perfectly in order.

398
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,890
This is a picture of the Luminol reactions to blood.

399
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:30,980
Gosh, I'd rather turn myself in then clean all that up.

400
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,430
Cleaning blood is  heavy duty labor.

401
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,530
What is it?

402
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,260
Salute.

403
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,720
I've arrived.

404
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,900
- A blunt instrument?  
 - Yes.

405
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,970
During the primary examination, metal fragments were extracted from the victim's occiput.

406
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:57,120
We are analyzing the material which is similar to the victim's dance contest trophy.

407
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,640
No trophy was found at the scene of the crime.

408
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,850
Based on the position of the injury to the victim's occiput,

409
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,180
the perpetrator is left-handed.

410
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,260
Left-handed?   Are there any specific suspects?

411
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,000
Yes.  For now, the boyfriend  Choi Sang Hoon is the prime suspect.

412
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,730
This is Choi Sang Hoon.

413
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,140
There is a small amount of male DNA from the victim's fingernails and

414
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,080
the neighbors say the couple were frequently fighting recently.

415
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,510
Also, Choi's car on the morning of the incident,

416
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,280
that ... Jae Min?

417
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,520
Yes.  We secured the records  which show

418
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,200
that on the day of the incident from 2:08 a.m. to  4:24 p.m. his car stayed in the villa parking lot.

419
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,210
What about him?

420
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,190
Oh, that.   He's abroad.

421
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,200
He left on a flight for Canada  that morning so right now we are out of contact.

422
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,130
Canada?

423
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,650
Could I get some eggs?

424
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,790
Yes. Thank you.

425
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,820
Thank you!

426
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,600
Enjoy your meal.

427
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,600
What's this?  Eating by yourself?

428
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,320
Eyy, because it's allowed to eat alone.

429
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,050
You may not.  I heard it's a homicide.

430
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,190
The time of the receipt of the report is 8:47.

431
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,510
Too bad.  If the report had been made just 13 minutes later.

432
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,820
If it had just come in at 9, Team 4 would have it.

433
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,760
That's what I was thinking.

434
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,380
Have a little conscience.

435
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,990
In any case, even without doing any work, you are Sliced Radish Kimchi Manager Yoo.

436
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,760
Yeah, that "Manager Yoo."

437
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,770
Manager Yoo, Manager Yoo, did you tell Jin Kang that?

438
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,780
Oh my.  I shouldn't have done that? Why?

439
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,680
Is she disappointed?

440
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,870
Disappointed?  I am a hero to her.  Her hero!

441
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,120
- Hero?
 - Yup.

442
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,510
Oh this.  I can't eat this anymore.

443
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,320
- How is he? Him? Him? 
 - Who?

444
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,850
The guy who looks wrongfully accused.  Him.

445
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,060
Eom Cho Rong? He's cute.

446
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,180
Should I teach you something?

447
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,570
Why?  What is it?

448
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,050
- That Eom Cho Rong, that guy.
 - Yes?

449
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,970
He's an idiot.

450
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,720
Is he really?

451
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,390
Why? What about him do you like so much?

452
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,290
How did you know?

453
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,210
You can run but you can't hide, Manager Yoo. You're in the palm of my hands.

454
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,940
You saying he's an idiot means you like him.  He's cute.

455
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,990
- Isn't that right? 
 - Right.

456
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,120
I'm going to catch him.

457
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,440
What is it?  What are you up to now?

458
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,560
- That guy with my Jin Kang.
 - Ouch!

459
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,550
He's not her style!

460
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,960
Are you sure?

461
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,390
Wait a second.

462
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,700
Even so, after coming out of the police university he is already a Grade Seven civil servant.

463
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,520
If you consider qualifications, he is the best groom ever.

464
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,210
That's what I was thinking!

465
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,730
But, will he like Jin Kang?

466
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,120
What?!

467
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,340
So, that, that, that idiot Eom Cho  Rong to my Jin Kang ...

468
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,330
Are we on the losing side?

469
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,900
 Do you know me? 

470
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,960
 No, not at all. 

471
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,510
 Drink this.  You were looking for Something You Brown Ale. 

472
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,870
 Have we seen him somewhere? 

473
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,130
 'Arts' Kim Moo Yeong 
 010-924-0129 

474
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,780
 It's Arts.  It's a very hot handmade beer company. 

475
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,330
 He said he is on the brewery crew which makes the beer.  That person. 

476
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,290
- This is all, right?
 - Yep.

477
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,110
Where are you going?

478
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,620
Didn't you come to see me?

479
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,460
What are we going to do?  I still have some work to do.

480
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,690
Then do that.

481
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,390
Come with us.

482
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,930
Hello!

483
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,370
He's not introducing us. I'm No Hui Joon.

484
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,230
He's my friend that I work with.

485
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,170
You're Seung Ah, right? I saw you at the exhibition yesterday.

486
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,460
You were so cool.

487
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Oh Mommy!

488
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,420
"Mommy?" Are you a mama's boy? Go.

489
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,040
Where to?

490
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,770
Just go.

491
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,410
I'm going to the crime scene. Should I drop you off somewhere on the way?

492
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,980
Wasn't it rough? This is the last of the deliveries.

493
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,390
Give me a second, give me a second.

494
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,510
Wow, this is seriously no joke!

495
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,620
Just stay here, okay?

496
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,390
More beer, please!

497
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,350
 More beer, please! 

498
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,870
Let's go.

499
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,660
What about Hui Joon?

500
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,370
He works here part-time.

501
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,230
Are you leaving? You, too?

502
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,870
- Thank you!
 - Of course.

503
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,970
- I'll do it! 
 - Over here.

504
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,100
You still don't feel like helping out?

505
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,190
Not at all.

506
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:27,080
So, how many times have you... dated someone?

507
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,640
I said I've dated as much as the next guy.

508
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,300
Is that a dummy cam, too? I heard the surveillance cameras are a mess here.

509
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,720
That's a real one.

510
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,420
That one, the one by the garage and the garbage cans are real.

511
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,820
This is a dummy.

512
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,000
- This one?
 - Yeah.

513
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,320
The first-floor backdoor is a dummy.

514
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,360
And since there aren't any surveillance cameras in the stairways, there are a lot of blind spots.

515
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,240
So, you haven't registered for one of those places?

516
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,480
Where?

517
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,050
You know,

518
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,290
where they introduce you to people, for guys and girls to

519
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,230
help you date, and arrange marriages—

520
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,630
Oh, those matchmaking companies?

521
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,020
I can't stand those.

522
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,400
People aren't merchandise,

523
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,420
and you should marry someone you love.

524
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,080
What is your mother's personality like? She's pretty tough, isn't she?

525
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,820
No, my mom is very nice.

526
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,780
My sister is really nice, too.

527
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,590
I said my sister is nice!

528
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,510
I'm sure she is.

529
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,340
My sister is really pretty.

530
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,760
But, Chief, why did you come here?

531
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,400
Why else? A detective came to a crime scene, why do you need a reason?

532
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,290
Geez.

533
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,750
Snowglobes.

534
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,450
A sailboat, Rudolph...

535
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,530
A snowman!

536
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,140
My sister really loves making snowmen!

537
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,630
She's really pretty and really nice.

538
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,690
I'll go take a look over there at something.

539
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,560
You can't go around touching things like that.

540
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:23,230
Bottle ... mask ... that S.O.B. ...

541
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:40,350


542
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,070
What are you doing?

543
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,480
Are these all the photos of the blood?

544
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,990
No, there's more in the office. Why?

545
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,870
Is it fixed?

546
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,770
What is it? Isn't it the same?

547
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,680
Your bracelet.

548
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,780
Wasn't it hard? I would have died if it weren't for you.

549
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,390
It was fun, but it seems like it'd be hard to do every day.

550
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,990
He works three of these every day for his tuition.

551
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,590
Even though he looks like this he's a computer engineering student at Yeonkang University.

552
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:16,380
Yeonkang University? You must be really smart.

553
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,600
I might give it all up.

554
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,900
Right? What's the use of going to college?

555
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,090
Why? Is it going to be difficult to return to school again?

556
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,690
I can go next semester. It's not just hard on me.

557
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,420
Over there. That's my house.

558
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,670
Go in.

559
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,990
I thought you'd ask me why I went there.

560
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,070
When you saw me earlier,

561
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,820
I thought you'd ask me why I came.

562
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,340
Me? Why? I was very happy to see you.

563
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,850
You were glad?

564
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,470
Yeah.

565
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,520
Liar.

566
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,000
I didn't call you even after getting your number

567
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,270
because I was worried you would ask why I called.

568
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,220
You didn't think about me at all, did you?

569
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,130
I wanted to see you.

570
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,630
- Really?
 - Yeah.

571
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:44,150
Then, is it okay if I like you?

572
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,990
While you have a boyfriend?

573
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,420
Woo Sang is—

574
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:24,310
Team Manager, Choi Sang Hoon is a leftie.

575
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,870
We've got him now.

576
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,810
He won't be able to do anything if the DNA results match.

577
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,330
When are the DNA results coming out?

578
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,860
The person who cleaned up the crime site was right-handed.

579
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,830
Look at the blood spatter.

580
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:43,830
It's true the trophy hit her with a left hand. But a right-handed person wiped down the place.

581
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,540
Oh, it's true. It's someone right-handed.

582
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,710
You use both hands to wipe up though.

583
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,690
No, take a look.

584
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,470
The direction is wrong. A right-handed person goes to the right.

585
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,590
A left-handed person has larger strokes to the left.

586
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,310
It's stronger towards the end of the strokes.

587
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,550
You use your strength and push out, like this.

588
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,360
Isn't that right?

589
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,070
Team Leader Lee, take a look at this.

590
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,780
I saw something strange when I went to the site yesterday.

591
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,360
The snowglobes on the shelves...

592
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,990
Why are you doing things you don't normally do?

593
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:38,020
Detective Yoo, I told you when the guys weren't around.

594
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:44,750
Our violent crimes Team 3 is: me, these two, and these two. The five of us.

595
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,930
So just keep managing things like you were doing.

596
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:54,870
You know the scooter theft incident, Manager Yoo.

597
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,490
Scooter? You're right, the scooter.

598
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,540
Here you go.

599
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,290
Thank you.

600
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,020
The scooter.

601
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,380
Don't you think that Team Manager is too much?

602
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:24,900
I mean, when he's asking for cooperation from the other teams because it's a homicide case,

603
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,340
why have him look for a scooter?

604
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,290
I'm sure he said snowglobes.

605
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:36,330
What could it be? It was the crime site photo and a photo of Jeong Mi Yeon's birthday party.

606
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,660
Stop being so curious.

607
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,620
I have something that I was curious about...

608
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,590
Why does our team manager hate Manager Yoo so much?

609
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,720
Is it sad because he's older and not getting respect?

610
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,530
It won't help you at all to be close to him so stop with your interest.

611
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,220
Detective Yoo is going to be let go in three months anyway.

612
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:03,120
Team Manager is going to do whatever it takes to get rid of Detective Yoo.

613
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,730
Come on out.

614
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,110
 You fixed it. Isn't it the same? 

615
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,770
 The bracelet. 

616
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,830
Hui Joon...

617
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,200
 This is Yeonkang University's Seoul campus, the intellect's window into the world.  

618
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,500
 #1 for Admissions information, 
#2 for administration services information 

619
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,910
 Manager, I'm dying of curiosity. Why the snowglobes? 

620
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,980
Manager! Manager! Over here, over here!

621
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,880
You're here?

622
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:42,190
What about Hui Joon? Is he going to attend school?

623
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,980
No.

624
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:49,190
I want to help too. Could I do that?

625
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,930
I'm afraid it might needlessly hurt Hui Joon's pride.

626
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,780
I'll try to persuade him. He'll take it since it's for tuition.

627
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,640
Liar...

628
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,540
They said that there was no student with that name.

629
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,750
There isn't a student named No Hui Joon studying computer engineering at Yeonkang University.

630
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,040
Interesting.

631
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,360
Interesting?

632
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,630
All for this stupid money.

633
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,590
Aren't you ashamed?

634
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,440
Maybe it wasn't because of money.

635
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,920
What?

636
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,900
 This is Yeonkang University's Wonjoo campus, the intellect's window into the world.  

637
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,670
Wonjoo?

638
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,190
Take a look.

639
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:14,160
Sailboat, Rudolph, snowman, flower, angel.

640
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,830
Here, sailboat, Rudolph, snowman, flower, angel.

641
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,510
Yes...

642
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,650
The sequence is the same.

643
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,210
Okay.

644
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:30,170
Okay, but... What about it?

645
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,140
How many times do I have to say it.

646
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,570
Look, the blood is only on the floor and the table, right?

647
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,970
But when we were there, blood was collected on the bottom of the snowglobe.

648
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:46,420
It wasn't just splashed on it. It had been sitting in a pool of blood.

649
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,510
That means the shelf had been knocked over and someone put it back together.

650
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,960
Yes, I know what that means.

651
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,620
I know, but I can't get what's weird— Ah! Ah!

652
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:01,680
I understand, I get it, I get it.

653
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,180
So, that means that someone cleaned it

654
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,630
and put it up there?

655
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,870
Now you get it?

656
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,490
How is that? They're exactly the same.

657
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,610
Even the front row is the same. There are so many of them, but

658
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,130
How can it be exactly the same?

659
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,780
That's why it's strange.

660
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,740
Who is this guy? It's not like you can remember it after seeing it just once.

661
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,570
Or, that person's IQ must be 1000?

662
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,450
Or else, he took a photo beforehand? Before killing her?

663
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:42,780
There's no need for that. It wouldn't be strange if the decorations were to be out of order.

664
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,210
Who would take the time to arrange it in order during that hectic time?

665
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,000
Right...

666
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,790
Could he have automatically put them in order, without even realizing it himself?

667
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:57,160
It wasn't necessary at all, but he just happened to put them like that.

668
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,720
How can a person by oneself

669
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,870
"just" do it?

670
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:08,620
No way that that person can just remember it all with just one look.

671
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,040
I don't know.

672
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,610
The only fact is that that person is a strange person.

673
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm missing eight bills.

674
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,650
I'm sorry.

675
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:51,330
I'm really sorry, I must have been crazy.

676
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,410
Are you crying? Because you're missing 400,000 won?

677
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,710
You wanna just look for it one more time?

678
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,140
I'm sorry.

679
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,080
You got uglier because you cried.

680
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,800
Yeah.

681
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,810
You threw it away.

682
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,390
Huh?

683
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,400
A bad guy gave it to you so you threw it out.

684
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,340
No, I didn't throw it out.

685
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:47,110
How could I throw it away? Who was it that gave it to me?

686
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,640
It looks pretty.

687
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,390
I have something that's really interesting.

688
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,700
Who the heck are you?

689
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,840
It's exactly the same!

690
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,830
Look, you fixed it exactly like the original.

691
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,640
There are over 20 beads, how could you do that?

692
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,810
I don't know.

693
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:31,610
My boyfriend must be a genius.

694
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,580
Boyfriend?

695
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:39,060
Yes. That's how I feel.

696
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,450
He remembers after seeing it once.

697
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:36,290


698
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,020
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

699
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,240
 Who are you seeing these days? 

700
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,650
 I have someone I like. 

701
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,620
 The pottery? 

702
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,310
 - It was a gift.
 - I was wondering who it was? 

703
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,530
 They caught Choi Sang Hoon. 

704
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,880
 Is that right? Is that person really the killer? 

705
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,700
 Strange... 

706
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,520
 But what's strange? 

707
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,160
 No kidding. 

708
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,270
 This is Moo Yeong. My boyfriend. 

709
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,310
 I'm asking if you're serious about her. 

710
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,170
 I am serious. 

711
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,410
 You're doing it deliberately, aren't you? 

712
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,380
 What? 

713
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,840
 To pique my interest. 

714
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,930
 What about you, Yoo Jin Kang?
