1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,060
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,620
 Episode 4 

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,590
It's the police officer.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,900
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,700
Why do you think? I'm waiting for you.

7
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,210
Why?

8
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,630
You asked me a question last time.

9
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,560
How would I feel if someone died because of me?

10
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,490
Let me ask you something today.

11
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,650
How did it feel when you killed someone?

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,990
It's a fantasy.

13
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,150
Even that day at the police station, the murderer you were looking at was you.

14
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,580
Not Choi Sang Woon, but yourself in the mirror.

15
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,090
Yes. I'll killed her.

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,660
Man, I want to do this, really. Ahjussi, stop watching dramas.

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,600
I was talking about a movie.

18
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,120
It's a fantasy. Yeah.

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
I have to go to work.

20
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,730
Kim Moo Yeong.

21
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,980
Are you left-handed?.

22
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm ambidextrous. Perfectly so.

23
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,900
It's a snow globe.

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,160
Where would you have put that?

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,270
Would you have put it next to the sailboat or the angel?

26
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,370
Angel.

27
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,220
Angel, of course. Let me tell you an interesting story.

28
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,510
You know my sister, right? My sister has a close friend.

29
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,750
Her boyfriend fixed a bracelet she broke.

30
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,170
When she looked at it later, the bracelet was exactly the same.

31
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,680
Even though there were over 20 beads,

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,730
it was put back exactly the same as before.

33
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,090
Wow, that's amazing.

34
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,830
There is something even more amazing. The building right off the Wonyeong intersection,

35
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,470
the female university student who was murdered.

36
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,980
She had collected a ton of snow globes.

37
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,600
They all fell definitely fell at the time of the murder, but

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,530
someone definitely put them back in the same original order.

39
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,680
This time with over 50 items.

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,290
Do you think it's the same person?

41
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,330
Right.  It's you.

42
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:02,440
Me?  It's not me then. I only fixed Seung Ah's bracelet.

43
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,370
Angel.

44
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,960
Sailboat.

45
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,500
Rudolph.

46
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,650
Snowman.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,490
Flower.

48
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,900
Angel.

49
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,120
Next to the angel would be best since it's a merry-go-round.

50
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,820
Is it fun making fun of me?

51
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,800
You're now a suspect. You've made it onto the suspect list as of today.

52
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,490
Look forward to it. I've got you in my sights now.

53
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,140
Good luck!

54
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,640
Tell me who it is when you catch him.

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,890
If it's over 50... wow!

56
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,740
I'm really curious as to who it is.

57
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,280
Why are you only just coming now? Why do you want to see me be late?

58
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,060
You said Kim Moo Yeong is dating Seung Ah, right?

59
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,990
- I told you pretend not to know.
 - Dissuade her,

60
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,380
so she doesn't ever meet him again.

61
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,900
The rest are in the car, all the things I received from you.

62
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,920
I asked if you forgot our dinner date yesterday. Is this your answer?

63
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,570
- This is everything you received from me. 
 - I was with that person.

64
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,170
I slept with that person.

65
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,660
I don't regret it.

66
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,190
You don't regret it?

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,870
Seung Ah, you don't know what regret is yet.

68
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,130
What regrets do you have or not have, huh?!

69
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,140
Seung Ah, look at me.

70
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,140
You should apologize first if you forget a promise.

71
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,320
That way I can factor that in and go easy on you. Understand?

72
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,140
Get out.

73
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,080
Hey, he's finally being passed to the prosecutors.

74
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,900
Wow! Violent Crimes Team 3 finally got one.

75
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,570
Oh, you must feel great, really great.

76
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,400
 Dissuade her so she doesn't ever meet him again. 

77
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,300
Seung Ah, what are you doing?

78
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,990
Oh yes. Seung Ah's Mother, were you well?

79
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,560
Aren't you answering?

80
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,030
Hello?

81
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,990
Unni.

82
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh right Unni. It's because of the exhibition?

83
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,730
The exhibition? What exhibition?

84
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,230
Just a moment, let me check.

85
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,100
I think it may be until the end of this month. Just a minute.

86
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,870
Seung Ah, what are you talking about?

87
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,310
 Baek Seung Ah 

88
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,140
 Unni, help me. I'm confined to the house. 

89
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,840
 Confined? Why? 

90
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,450
 I stayed out last night. 

91
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,270
The design here that uses Art Nouveau style,

92
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,300
I think it expresses well how I felt

93
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,450
when I first established this company.

94
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,600
So it is very important to maintain that meaning but it seems so similar.

95
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,190
- I'd rather... 
  -  I have to meet Moo Yeong.  

96
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,230
 You are the only one who can help me. 

97
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,770
Or what do you think Manager Jin Kang?

98
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,010
Pardon?

99
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,080
For Sister Theresa Chung

100
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,590
who has gone into God's embrace,

101
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,480
let us pray to

102
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,780
Almighty God with our whole hearts.

103
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,590
Oh Lord,

104
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,960
Having called Your servant from this world,

105
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,230
please receive Sister Theresa Chung's soul.

106
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,130
Having forgiven her all her sins,

107
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,610
forever provide her with Your shelter

108
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,720
and Your radiant happiness.

109
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,040
Honey, is there something wrong today?

110
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,950
Do you want to make us nervous, being so "out of it"  during such an important meeting?

111
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,830
President, I'm really sorry. Just a minute.

112
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,930
Ah ... Section Head ...

113
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,590
Could I speak to Kim Moo Yeong?

114
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,240
He's not here right now.

115
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,630
Then could you tell him...

116
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,540
No. Could you give me his contact info?

117
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,100
Moo Yeong. Moo Yeong!

118
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,160
Moo Yeong!

119
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,770
Who is it? Someone you know?

120
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,600
It's Moo Yeong.

121
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,320
Moo Yeong?

122
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,170
Yes.  I don't know how he found out Sister Theresa passed away.

123
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,320
It's definitely Moo Yeong.

124
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,630
 This is Yoo Jin Kang. 

125
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,680
 Seung Ah asks you come to the Han River front on Saturday at 4pm.  

126
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,730
 Why are you telling me this? 

127
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,660
 Seung Ah is confined to the house.  Her cell phone has been taken as well. 

128
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,610
 Why? 

129
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,360
 Why do you think? Because she stayed out all night with you... 

130
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,100
 Make sure to keep your appointment. 

131
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,460
 Yoo Jin Kang
010-2988-522 

132
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,320
  Guitar Lessons   

133
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,350
You, your-

134
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,350
Ahjussi!

135
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,400
What?

136
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,920
You didn't come here to learn the guitar, right?

137
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,560
It's true. I heard there were a lot of teachers here.

138
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,750
Who said that?

139
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,900
Kim Moo Yeong.

140
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,440
Who are you, Ahjussi?

141
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,630
Kim Moo Yeong's neighbor.

142
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,560
Kim Moo Yeong dated Jeong Mi Yeon, didn't he?

143
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,180
What?

144
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,550
Who are you saying dated whom?

145
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,900
Then are you dating him? You like him, right?

146
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,610
Am I crazy enough to like a 30-year-old geezer?

147
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,390
Geez- Thirty years old is too much.

148
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,010
Kim Moo Yeong would cry if he heard you.

149
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,700
Mister, you said you're a police officer.

150
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,310
Should I show you again? See? It's me.

151
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,720
Then why are you asking about Moo Yeong?

152
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,770
To tell you to be careful.

153
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm suspecting Kim Moo Yeong in Jeong Mi Yeon's murder. Be careful.

154
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,340
You can get into a lot of trouble by protecting a criminal.

155
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Moo Yeong... You suspect Moo Yeong?

156
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,030
Why?  He didn't know even her that well.

157
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,500
Really?

158
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,700
- Re-investigate? 
- Uh huh.

159
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,240
How can we re-investigate now, and just the two of us?

160
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,560
What if the real culprit wasn't Choi Sang Woon and a different punk?

161
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,730
In the worst case scenario, a second victim could appear.

162
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,200
What would you do if it turned out to be Im Yoo Ri?

163
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,530
A second victim?

164
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,570
I think Choi Sang Woon is the right guy.

165
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,470
- Are you saying you'd like for him to be the guy or are you saying he really is the guy? 
 - It's both.

166
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,500
Are you saying you'll re-investigate or not?

167
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,350
I'm saying I can't.

168
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,810
A message. I got a message. I'll get going, then.

169
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,780
Oh, it's Jin Kang.

170
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,080
We were supposed to have dinner, but she's asking to eat lunch instead.

171
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,560
Hey, is that important right now?

172
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,580
It's important.

173
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,710
I don't know if this is the right thing to ask in this mood, but

174
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,610
when is Jin Kang's birthday?

175
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,680
Oh, you punk... Aigoo.

176
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,820
April 7th.

177
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,500
April 7th! April 7th.

178
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,600
April 7, April 7.

179
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,810
But, what time was she born?

180
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,330
Hey kid! You're so superstitious, you're going to check your compatibility fortune?

181
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,420
Then what about you?

182
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,170
What day? What year, date, and time?

183
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,020
Hey, isn't that Eom Cho Rong?

184
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,710
Oh, you're right.

185
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,720
Why is he wearing his uniform on his day off?

186
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,700
I guess he wanted to look cool for his girlfriend.

187
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,550
I'm sorry when it's been so long since we saw each other.

188
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,150
Well, we got to eat and even drink coffee.

189
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,010
We can just see each other on my next day off.

190
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,990
Now that we've closed a big case I'll get to rest on my days off.

191
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,590
Eom Cho Rong!

192
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,590
Oh, loyalty!

193
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,000
Nice to meet you for the first time, Sister-in-law?

194
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,310
Oh Hyung, she's not Sister-in-law.

195
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,580
Hello!

196
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,250
Hello!

197
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,950
Jin Kang, he's the leader of our team.

198
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh, are you the leader of Violent Crimes Team 3?

199
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,470
Please take good care of my brother.

200
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,950
Oh, she's Officer Yoo's younger sister.

201
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,750
Officer Yoo?

202
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,370
Yes, I'm Yoo Jin Kang, Yoo Jin Gook's younger sister.

203
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,560
Oh, really? Nice to meet you.

204
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
Let's go.

205
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,860
- Loyalty!
 - Take care!

206
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm really flustered.

207
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,450
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

208
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,640

 Violent Crime Team 3
 Team Leader Lee Gyeong Cheol 

213
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,300
Then, we'll be going.

214
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,020
Yes, let Seung Ah get some fresh air.

215
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,270
Yes, Mother.

216
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,370
I'll be back.

217
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,170
Have a good time.

218
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
Seung Ah, that girl,

219
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,540
can't have friends who are more like herself.

220
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,350
Wow! I'm finally alive again!

221
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,940
Thank you, Jin Kang!

222
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,570
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or not.

223
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,000
What about your car?

224
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,060
I don't have a car anymore.

225
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,580
Let's take the bus. I want to ride a bus.

226
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,350
Seriously, I'm not sure if I should be doing this or not.

227
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,340
It's because you don't know Moo Yeong.

228
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,590
It's because you don't know what Moo Yeong gave me.

229
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,130
What did he give you?

230
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,710
The Jeong Mi Yeon case.

231
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,130
Why don't you unlock the info? There is no reason to prevent additional investigation just because he's been passed to the prosecutors.

232
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,120
You know full well that I have no intention of doing that.

233
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,270
Ah. Yoo Jin Kang?

234
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,510
Yoo Jin Gook, Yoo Jin Kang?

235
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,160
You're using matching names to pretend to be real siblings.

236
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,600
It's that child from back then, right?

237
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,580
She's grown up a lot. I didn't recognize her.

238
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,720
Why are you acting so nervous?

239
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,640
Are you afraid that I said something?

240
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,680
I didn't say a word. I totally lost my appetite, hearing that she is your sister.

241
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,040
What would I say?

242
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,960
Hey! Manager Yoo!

243
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,190
What are you doing here on your day off?

244
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,290
Oh...  Just because.

245
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,190
It was because of him. I was wondering why you were so fixed on Jeong Mi Yeon's case.

246
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,440
It was because of Kim Moo Yeong.

247
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,610
Why are you so attached to him?

248
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,000
You think so?

249
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,900
The way I see it, a few coincidences happen to overlap.

250
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,610
Really?

251
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,480
He seems like a normal person.

252
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,560
 If I were to find something odd about him, what should I say? He seems a bit unique compared to an average person? 

253
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,300
 You are overly sensitive about it. 

254
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,990
Moo Yeong!

255
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:43,140
 It's because you don't know Moo Yeong. You don't know what he gave me. 

256
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,260
 What did he give you? 

257
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,970
 - Me.
 - You?
 - Yes. 

258
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,880
 Now I only feel like my real self when I'm with him. 

259
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,060
Is 7 PM okay?

260
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,230
7:30?

261
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,780
Alright. Here at 7:30 then.

262
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm off since there isn't a lot of time left.

263
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,000
Thank you, Unni!

264
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,600
What have you been up to?

265
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,110
Nothing much. Just stuff.

266
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,800
Here you are.

267
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,120
And for me.

268
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,380
Cheers!

269
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,160
Let's see if you drink or not.

270
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,050
I'm not drinking. How can I drink when you dragged me here during work hours?

271
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,390
Should I give you the urge to drink?

272
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,320
I heard everything Lee Gyeong Cheol said earlier.

273
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,690
Why didn't you just give him a knuckle sandwich?

274
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,350
Even if he's a jerk, how dare he say that about Jin Kang?

275
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,030
Oh, seriously.

276
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,670
This is really good.

277
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,910
I

278
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,860
have something I really really really really really want to tell you,

279
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,060
but only as soon as I've finished this drink.

280
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,950
- Gosh.
 - Oh? What are you doing?

281
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,110
Don't do that.

282
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,440
Whatever it is you're about to say, don't say it.

283
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,520
Forget everything, Manager Yoo.

284
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,350
You said it anyway.

285
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,270
No...

286
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,680
Is it such a big deal to be human?

287
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,880
It's not. Everyone makes mistakes in life.

288
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,230
Mistakes?

289
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,140
It's been twenty-five years already. It's enough now.

290
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,020
You're allowed to forget after this long. It's enough.

291
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,530
And how beautifully did Jin Kang turn out?

292
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,580
Even for raising Jin Kang so beautifully, Manager Yoo, you have every right.

293
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,590
You have every right to be happy.

294
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,040
Okay, I get it.

295
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,030
I'm craving a drink, so that's enough.

296
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,880
Drink some alcohol.

297
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,150
Here you go.

298
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,630
Please pour it.

299
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,910
Cheers.

300
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,250
This is what they meant by "take a rest before going?"

301
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,460
It's really fun, right?

302
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,030
Are you okay?

303
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,860
Of course. I'm the one who wanted to come here.

304
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,150
Then, all we need to do is rest before going.

305
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,750
What's wrong with you?

306
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,420
Let's go out.

307
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,590
You'll be too apprehensive to even touch the sheets.

308
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,320
No.

309
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,670
I can touch them without any problem.

310
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,270
But I don't want to in a place like this.

311
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,460
I love you.

312
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,930
Unni!

313
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,640
Weren't you bored? What did you do?

314
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,050
Just stuff. I looked at the river, took a walk, and had some coffee. Time went by really fast.

315
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,270
Did you have fun?

316
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,630
Yep. Thanks to you.

317
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,930
Mom!

318
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,990
MOM!

319
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,850
Mom, are you crazy?

320
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,700
It's all your fault, you fundamentally lacking wench!

321
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,400
- Let's go.
 - Let go of me!

322
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,300
- Let's go!
 - Let go of me! Let me go!

323
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,110
Moo Yeong!

324
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,120
That woman is no joke.

325
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,010
Is that your first time being slapped in the face?

326
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,680
It must be your first time. Wanna go eat?

327
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,480
You haven't eaten yet.

328
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,890
It feels really crummy eating alone on a day like this.

329
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,730
So? You're going to eat with me?

330
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,080
Yes, it's my first time being slapped in the face. And I don't know what's going on.

331
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,550
I feel embarrassed and wronged and it hurts like crazy.

332
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,340
And I'm supposed to eat with you?

333
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,310
You're enjoying this so much that I should let you be entertained even more? Why? Why should I?!

334
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,690
- Forget it if you don't want to.
 - I don't!

335
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,460
I don't want to and

336
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,650
this is your fault.

337
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,940
It's a given for Seung Ah's mom to behave that way. I wouldn't like it if I were her either!

338
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,430
What mother would want her daughter to date a guy like you?

339
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,660
- You think so?
 - Yes.

340
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,350
So, go. Just please leave!

341
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,910
Okay.

342
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,820
My homely little girl.

343
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,980
Look at her sticking her tongue out. My ugly duckling.

344
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,870
Seriously, look at how you adore her.

345
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,270
Just stick her in your eye and it wouldn't hurt.

346
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,760
I've never tried putting her in my eye before. Should I?

347
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,270
Like this?

348
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,410
Ah, it hurts!

349
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,610
You're such a fool.

350
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,720
She's so immature.

351
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,670
You're the one who is immature, and Jin Kang matured early in her life.

352
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,280
Is that right? Did she mature early in her life?

353
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,840
That's right. She is pretending to be immature

354
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,430
so that you can feel at ease.

355
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,040
Right. That's right. You know so well. It's all good.

356
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,240
Listen to this.

357
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,970
She knows I would be upset if I knew she was mature,

358
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,870
so she's pretending to be immature.

359
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,780
And if I act as if I know she's mature,

360
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,310
she's afraid I'll be upset by that.

361
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:41,860
And because that upsets me, I treat her as being immature.

362
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,100
- So she pretends to be immature,
 - Yeah.

363
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,610
and I treat her like a little child.

364
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:55,300
- That's what being immature means!
 - Oh, yeah.

365
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,940
Is this all just a bunch of hot air?

366
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,070
And why does this make sense to me?

367
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,750
Manager Yoo. Manager Yoo.

368
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,740
You've aged, too.

369
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,970
You're aging, and yet you don't think about yourself.

370
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,350
Why haven't you left yet?

371
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,640
Look.

372
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,760
There are so many strange things in this world, aren't there?

373
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,940
- What is this?
 - It seems like the managing director did...

374
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,000
Tell the head of the human resources to come by.

375
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,830
Yes, sir.

376
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,890
Mrs. Baek is here to see you.

377
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:24,000
I know I'm not the one to say this. But, you should really know.

378
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,780
Money is a very scary thing.

379
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,360
Oh my. Who could it be?

380
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,590
Please reconsider. This will never happen again.

381
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,670
What are you doing?

382
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,880
Seung Ah wants to come to an agreement.

383
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,140
But it's taking some time to determine the conditions.

384
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,060
You can go now. You'll be called when we're ready.

385
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,190
 Jin Kang Unni, it's Seung Ah. Text me now at my housekeeper's number. 

386
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,100
 You fundamentally lacking wench. It's all your fault. 

387
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,290
 I feel so embarrassed and wronged and it hurts like crazy. 

388
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,460
 It's all your fault. Please just go! 

389
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,540
What is it? Did you throw it away?

390
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,870
Agh, it's broken.

391
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,610
It's expensive. You could have given it to me. Did Seung Ah dump him?

392
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,600
You can't win against the rich. You can't win.

393
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,370
Why didn't you thank me for the gift I sent you?

394
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,770
I saw Seung Ah in a new light.

395
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,940
To be honest, she's so boring and dull,

396
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,130
I wondered why you dated her for so many years. But she's got guts.

397
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,560
That's pretty attractive. She might even be too good for you.

398
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,980
Things aren't going to go as you wish, you brat.

399
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,070
Oh, really? Then you're going to be cool about it and marry her?

400
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,200
This is going to be interesting to watch.

401
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,770
 Unni, it's me, Seung Ah. 

402
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,040
 Kim Moo Yeong 

403
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,170
 I don't want to! I don't, 

404
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,060
 and this is all your fault. 

405
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,430
 It's a given that Seung Ah's mom would react that way. I wouldn't like you either. 

406
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,860
 What mother would want her daughter to date someone like you? 

407
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,230
 - Is that so?
 - Yeah. 

408
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,260
 So go. Please just go! 

409
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,530
 Can we meet up this evening? 

410
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,120
What's up? You're even asking me on a date.

411
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,900
Seung Ah wanted me to relay this to you.

412
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,100
Is this all? You could have texted it to me.

413
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,060
You're right.

414
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,000
I wanted to apologize. I'm sorry about that day.

415
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,120
I was too harsh when it wasn't your fault.

416
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,210
What are you doing?

417
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,030
You can't apologize with just words.

418
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,280
Buy me dinner.

419
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:47,560
Hold on. Hey! Hold on.

420
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,350
 I realized something important. 

421
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,750
 I'm going to be smarter from now on. 

422
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,590
 I'm going to find a way that we can be together forever. 

423
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,440
Ajumma, please give me some dinner, too.

424
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,020
I'm not going to see that guy anymore.

425
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,490
I was wrong.

426
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,370
 Moo Yeong, my heart for you will never change. 

427
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,850
 So please wait just a little longer. 

428
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,470
You said you already ate.

429
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,700
Excuse me, could we get two more orders of meat!

430
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,540
Who said I can't eat again?

431
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,930
Slow down.

432
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,480
Do you really want to keep doing these favors when it gets you slapped in the face?

433
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,110
I'm not going to anymore. This is really the last time.

434
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,360
- The order is messed up.
 - What is?

435
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,650
"Jin Kang, this is Seung Ah. Text me now at my housekeeper's phone. Relay this to Moo Yeong."

436
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,380
There's no apology.

437
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,290
It's because she feels rushed. She was  barely able to send it using someone else's phone.

438
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,640
Ajumma, too. If she were going to hit someone it should be #1 her daughter Seung Ah,

439
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,030
#2 the man Seung Ah is dating. The order is strange.

440
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,370
Don't talk about that. It makes my heart pound.

441
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,460
It's because her daughter is precious.

442
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,980
What about you? You're not precious?

443
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:12,170
Stop it! Even without you saying it, I keep thinking of it.

444
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,670
I don't want to think about it,  but I did. More than 10,000 times.

445
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,160
Still, if I think of it I, feel as sad and pathetic as I did before.

446
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,410
I feel sorry.

447
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:29,230
I can understand the sad and pathetic but what are you sorry for?

448
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,230
My brother.

449
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:38,410
Being so sloppy as to get slapped in the face. I feel sorry towards my brother.

450
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,430
Then I'll uselessly be resentful of Seung Ah.

451
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,420
Yay! It's meat.

452
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,510
Eat. It's on me.

453
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,080
What? There's no reason to look at me like that.

454
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:06,810
Your mom would have done the same if it were you. All moms are originally like that.

455
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,320
I don't know since I never had a mom.

456
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,290
- What about a father? 
- I don't have one.

457
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:29,430
- When? 
- When I was young.

458
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,250
Hey, let's not feel sorry for ourselves over that. We're going to be thirty before we know it.

459
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,540
- I don't have parents either. 
- I know.

460
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,450
You heard from Seung Ah, huh?

461
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,110
I think I knew from the beginning.

462
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,280
Does it show that I grew up without?

463
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,540
- Who raised you then? 
- A facility.

464
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,490
You said let's not feel sorry for ourselves.

465
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,260
Who did? Who felt sorry for you?

466
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,890
Enjoy your meal.

467
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,740
And I'm thirty. Not "before I know it" thirty, but already thirty.

468
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,520
So what?

469
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,930
Call me oppa.

470
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,840
Oppa, there's a strange kid making fun of me over here.

471
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,710
When did that happen?

472
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,100
You sure asked early enough.

473
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,670
You don't remember?

474
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,440
I don't remember either, but my brother says there was a fire at home.

475
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,020
What about your parents? When?

476
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,360
My dad passed away before I was born and my mom when I was seven.

477
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,350
My sister emigrated before I went to elementary school.

478
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,090
So I lived with my brother, just the two of us.

479
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:25,130
My brother raised me by himself.

480
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,880
But you're so strong without emotional scars.

481
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,200
It's a lie.

482
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,250
I'm saying it's a lie that I never received any emotional scars.

483
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,870
It's obvious. A child without parents who has a scar on her arm.

484
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,330
How could I grow up without emotional scars?

485
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,870
I think I know why.

486
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,860
What?

487
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,870
Why I feel like fighting whenever I see you.

488
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,070
When I see you, it reminds me of being in elementary school.

489
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,940
My hellish elementary days.

490
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,910
Actually, that's a lie, too.

491
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:24,100
I've been slapped in the face before, once. By my teacher when I was nine.

492
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,560
Only once, then you had a good life.

493
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,240
Whatever!

494
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:38,530
But I was too young, and like a fool I told my brother about it.

495
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:45,060
That night my brother cried alone under his covers.

496
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,610
He sobbed like crazy.

497
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,570
Eat a lot. You worked hard telling all those lies.

498
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,200
Okay.

499
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,640
Alien. Reptile.

500
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,240
Alien. Crocodile wallet.

501
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,140
I had a ton more nicknames than that.

502
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,700
When I lived in Haesan, the kids took my bag and threw it in the chicken coop.

503
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,870
Haesan?

504
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:26,400
Oh, in elementary school. Why?

505
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,230
I used to live there too.

506
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,070
Really? The orphanage was in Haesan?

507
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,730
Yeah.

508
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,210
Why are kids so cruel?

509
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,410
Adults are the cruel ones.

510
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,510
But there are a lot more good people, too.

511
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,520
You're all twisted, huh?

512
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,470
Don't be twisted.

513
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,610
I'm going.

514
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,970
Is your cat doing well?

515
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,820
Of course.

516
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,110
What's it's name?

517
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,820
Name?

518
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,200
- Kang.
 - Kang?

519
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,310
It's pretty!

520
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,540
Last name Jin, first name Kang. Jin Kang.

521
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,140
I guess I'm the dumb one for asking.

522
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,910
You know this? You're really a little kid.

523
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,890
It doesn't have a name.

524
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,420
How can it not have a name? What if it gets lost?

525
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,150
It's not mine anyway, who cares if it gets lost. I tell it to scram every day.

526
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,030
I think I'm going to keep hating you.

527
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,070
Good luck with that.

528
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,600
I will.

529
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,660
  Are you going to jump? 

530
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,620
 Play with me. I'm a lot of fun. 

531
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,270
The man is lunar calendar Jan 11, 1990, Hour of the Monkey.

532
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:34,970
The woman is solar calendar 1990, April 7th.

533
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,160
Would you like to see their compatibility?

534
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:43,360
It's not that. Could you make up a time for a woman for me?

535
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,440
One that would be most compatible with a man.

536
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,750
What's wrong with this person?

537
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,840
 Yang Gyeong Mo 

538
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,710
 Meet Dr. Yang Geyeon  Mo, Pediatric and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Specializing in Trauma 

539
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,370
Yoo Ri,

540
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,720
I couldn't sleep for three days.

541
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,290
But, no more medicine for you.

542
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,290
You already know I won't prescribe you any more.

543
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:06,170
If it were just the prescription, you could have gotten one at any other hospital, right?

544
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,860
You want to tell me something, don't you?

545
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,510
You ruined my life.

546
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,950
You.. and that woman.

547
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,710
Your mother wants you to become healthy, too.

548
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,240
Don't call her my mother. I'll kill her.

549
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,570
I'm going to kill you and that woman.

550
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:31,200
I wish you were dead.

551
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,140
That kid, too.

552
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:39,620
That kid? You want to tell me something, don't you?

553
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,400
Don't call him "that kid."

554
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,900
He isn't that kid.

555
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,050
 I've never seen that kind of expression on him. 

556
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,170
 - What about your dad?
 - I don't have one. 

557
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,930
 - Who raised you then?
 - An institution. 

558
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,580
He never told me anything like that.

559
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:14,760
He told someone else something he's never even told you about, didn't he?

560
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,850
Right?

561
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,220
Do you like him?

562
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,610
I don't like him.

563
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,840
Why is everyone asking me that?

564
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,660
I really don't like him. Why is everyone asking me, I really don't like him.

565
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,350
Do you think I wouldn't know?

566
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:42,060
You're trying to get me to talk so you can sell my story?

567
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,240
I won't be fooled by you again.

568
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,940
Meds. Give me my meds.

569
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:56,790
Doctor, give me my medicine. Please give my medicine.

570
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:01,270
I said I want my meds. I want my meds!!!

571
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,140
Are we eating pork or beef?

572
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,480
Let's all say, "beef!"

573
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,180
Beef!

574
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,120
It's Manager Yoo.

575
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:17,060
Loyalty!

576
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,870
Just go and rat to Manager Yoo that we're having a team dinner.

577
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,240
Are you going to screw up the work dinner atmosphere?

578
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,560
Why would I?

579
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,290
Let's go!

580
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:45,010
Didn't I tell you to change that light bulb already?

581
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,420
Hurry up and go buy one!

582
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,100
It's raining. What's wrong with you these days?

583
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,840
  Living with Trauma  

584
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,130
 Beer Festival  

585
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,020
 Oppa? 

586
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,550
 Beer Festival 

587
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,280
Kitty!

588
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,180
Kitty! It's raining!

589
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,430
Kitty! Kang!

590
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,310
Kang!

591
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:48,430
Jin Kang! Yoo Jin Kang!

592
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,010
Are you Yoo Jin Kang?

593
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,940
Cho Rong, Cho Rong.

594
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,650
 So you need me, don't you? 

595
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,840
Look at this guy's drunken babbling.

596
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,600
So what you're saying is that because I'm so capable,

597
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,510
you definitely need me, right?

598
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,990
I'll do the reinvestigation then.

599
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,100
Okay.

600
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,940
Loyalty. Gosh, I'll see you tomorrow.

601
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,220
Kid, kid. Hold on.

602
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,720
Your elder hasn't hung up yet.

603
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,940
It's Jin Shi (Hour of Dragon).

604
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,880
King Jin Shi?

605
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,110
Ja, Chook, In, Myo, Jin.
 (Hour of Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon)

606
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,790
Jin Kang was born during the Hour of Jin  (Dragon) .

607
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,890
Thank you!

608
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,700
Hour of Jin
  (Hour of Dragon: 7am- 9am) 

609
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,860
 What are you doing? I'm going home after a fun team dinner. 

610
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:54,530
 I'm in a really good mood today. Good night to you, too. 

611
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,340
Team dinner?

612
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,830
Thanks.

613
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,940
Yeah?

614
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,560
 You were drinking, weren't you? 

615
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,260
You must be psychic.

616
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:30,350
I heard you had a team dinner. If you drive after drinking, you're dead meat.

617
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,480
You sure do worry about everything.

618
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,490
Don't come out. I have an umbrella, so don't come out!

619
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,780
Liar. I have the umbrella right here.

620
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,110
I'm heading over to the bus station.

621
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,670
Don't come...hello? Hello?

622
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,810
Seriously.

623
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,640
Boo!

624
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,980
Oppa! Are you okay?

625
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,430
I'm okay. Are you all right?

626
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,040
- Are you okay?
 - I'm fine, too.

627
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,370
Stay there for a moment.

628
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,020
Don't go.

629
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,240
- Don't go.
 - Just a moment. Stay here and don't come.

630
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,510
Stay right here, Jin Kang.

631
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:47,610


632
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,690
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes
- Preview ~ 

633
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:02,210
 Did you make her do it? 

634
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,740
 Of course, not. 

635
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,180
 Why did you do that to my sister? 

636
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,200
 - I don't want to tell you.
 - What? 

637
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,310
 You deliberately almost killed someone and you don't want to tell me?! 

638
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:13,550
 Come out thirty minutes earlier tomorrow. Our dates are too short. 

639
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,410
 I'm planning to leave. 

640
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,210
 You're leaving? 

641
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,390
