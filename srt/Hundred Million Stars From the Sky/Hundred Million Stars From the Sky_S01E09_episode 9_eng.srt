00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,800
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

2
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,100
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,490
 Kim Moo Yeong! 

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,870
 It looks delicious.  Eat before you go. -

5
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,230
 What do you go around doing? 

6
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,680
 Bad stuff. 

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,500
 What are you thinking, to go up against someone like him? 

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,200
 I don't think anything.  That's how to win. 

9
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,170
 Don't get caught. 

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,050
 Kim Moo Yeong disappeared. 

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,790
 Where are you? 

12
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,490
 Baek Seung Ah is dead. 

13
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,520
 A young woman who did nothing wrong 

14
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,310
 is dead because you want revenge! 

15
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,350
 Keep your word that you won't see that jerk again. 

16
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,220
 Episode 9 

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,080
 My brother said that you're playing a game. 

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,830
 He said that because nothing is important to you. 

19
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,420
 You're playing a game even betting your own life. 

20
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,050
 Kim Moo Yeong! 

21
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,650
 Let's go. 

22
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,210
 Why aren't you sad? 

23
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,990
 Why don't you feel anything? 

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,300
 I didn't know if my friend was dying or not, but I was worried about your life,  

25
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,730
 and yet you don't even care about how precious your life is! 

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,750
 I don't know either. 

27
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,300
 I really wanted to die. 

28
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,540
 Deputy Tak 

29
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,410
Yes?

30
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,030
 Why don't you answer when I call you? 

31
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,240
I was working.

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,350
How about my texts? What work are you doing?

33
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,690
Aish. Why don't you even check your texts?

34
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,370
Eom Cho Rong went just now to go arrest Kim Moo Yeong...

35
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,550
They're here. They just got here.

36
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,220
What was your motive for the murder?

37
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,080
What made you do it?

38
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,840
Give us a statement!

39
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
 Manager Yoo 

40
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,260
What is this?

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,180
Hey, I found it!

42
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,210
You know what this is, don't you?

43
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,350
Yes.

44
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,680
 You must know where it was found. 

45
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,990
 Did you hide it yourself? 

46
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,280
 Yes. 

47
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,410
 Where did you get it? 

48
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,820
You said you brought it to your house yourself.

49
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,020
So, where did you get it?

50
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,520
At that girl's house.

51
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
Jeong Mi Yeon?

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,580
Yes.

53
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,350
He's not fighting it.

54
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,790
The evidence is right there. What else could he do?

55
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,050
Now, we can finally sleep at night.

56
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,870
Let's talk for a moment.

57
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,650
 Did you kill Jeong Mi Yeon yourself? 

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,740
Yes.

59
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,930
Why did you kill her?

60
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,510
For money?

61
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,070
He's lying.

62
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,930
He didn't kill her.

63
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,860
What are you talking about?

64
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,950
Jeong Mi Yeon's killer is outside right now.

65
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,170
She turned herself in this afternoon. And I have her statement recorded.

66
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,460
Turned herself in?

67
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,970
Officer Yoo!

68
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,640
You know that Manager Yoo cares a lot about you?

69
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,880
He could be put in a difficult position because of you.

70
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,710
So, gather your courage and testify truthfully.

71
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,520
Right? Do you understand?

72
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,530
Are you the one who turned herself in?

73
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,920
This is a video recorded when Im Yoo Ri was in the US playing around with her boyfriend in middle school.

74
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,630
Somehow Jeong Mi Yeon got a hold of it.

75
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,460
And for over a year since then, she's been blackmailed.

76
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,270
At first, she asked for purses and accessories.

77
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,050
But since June, when Jeong Mi Yeon's father's company went bankrupt,

78
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,970
the demands got bigger and at the time of the incident, it was 100,000 dollars.

79
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,000
So, you're saying that she killed her?

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,910
She says she killed her. He says he killed her. Who really killed her?

81
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,090
And what are you going to do about the reporters?

82
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,830
As quickly as possible, we'll find the real culprit.

83
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,160
I'll be responsible and make sure nothing leaks before then.

84
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,230
 I sold my car and my handbags. 

85
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,720
 I sold everything I could possibly sell. 

86
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,330
 I gave her 20,000 dollars and begged her. But she said I was a bitch. 

87
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,440
 She said that words wouldn't get through to me. 

88
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,360
 And she told me to look at the hospital's online bulletin board. 

89
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,850
 Are you talking about Hajin Obstetrics website? Your mother's hospital? 

90
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,440
 Yes. 

91
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,500
 At first it was the hospital's webpage. Then, it was the chat room. 

92
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,640
 And then, she said she would post it on any other website. 

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,460
 I really wanted to die. 

94
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,390
 I couldn't sleep because of it, so I took some pills and went to bed. 

95
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,780
 I took quite a few and slept a long time. 

96
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,200
 When I woke up that evening, the police came 

97
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,800
 and said Mi Yeon had died. And they asked about Sang Hoon. 

98
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,630
 That it seemed as if her boyfriend Choi Sang Hoon had killed Jeong Mi Yeon. 

99
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,680
 But, Sir, hearing that conversation, 

100
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,400
 I was really glad. 

101
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,030
 Mi Yeon died. 

102
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,210
 I really didn't know that I had killed her. 

103
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,650
Wow, I'm glad to see a face I know.

104
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,800
Why are you just getting here now?

105
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,700
How does it feel? To be here as a suspect?

106
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,350
It doesn't feel good. Awfully so.

107
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,300
I know that you didn't kill her.

108
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,000
What the? Not long ago while you kept saying I killed her when you were bugging me.

109
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,820
You said it doesn't feel good, so why lie, saying you killed her when you didn't?

110
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,280
Is it because you want to leave some evidence that you're covering up for Im Yoo Ri?

111
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,160
No way!

112
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,710
Because I wanted it to be over quickly.

113
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,180
Have you never had a day like that?

114
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,990
When you have so many thoughts going on,

115
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,210
that you feel like boring a hole through your head?

116
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,920
So?

117
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,590
Did you do some thinking?

118
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,170
I couldn't find an answer.

119
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,710
 I don't know, either. 

120
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,950
 I'm so stupid. 

121
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
I should have said it wasn't so.

122
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,290
Im Yoo Ri turned herself in.

123
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,370
I'm saying there's no point in wracking your brain.

124
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,800
You knew that Im Yoo Ri was being blackmailed by Jeong Mi Yeon, didn't you?

125
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,520
Roughly.

126
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,700
On August 26 late on Sunday night, you brought a drunken Jeong Mi Yeon home. Two days before the incident.

127
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,500
It was the 27th to be precise, since it was past midnight.

128
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Did you ever meet with Jeong Mi Yeon after that?

129
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,990
Not at all.

130
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,150
Fine. On the day of the incident, Im Yoo Ri said you couldn't be reached all day by phone.

131
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,800
I was busy with work that day.

132
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,570
 There was an event the next day. All day long. 

133
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,490
 I called her when I was done with work, but she didn't answer. 

134
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,550
 I called her again, when I got home. 

135
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,890
 Hello? 

136
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,770
 Oppa... 

137
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
 It seemed as if she took medicine. But she does that from time to time. But... 

138
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
 Where are you? 

139
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,580
 Mi Yeon is here. 

140
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,840
Are you saying you saw Jeong Mi Yeon fall?

141
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,090
I didn't see it, but I heard it. The sounds.

142
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,300
You're lying.

143
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,170
The times don't match.

144
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,900
2:34 am. The time you were captured at the back exit of Hewitt Villa.

145
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,370
The time of Jeong Mi Yeon's fall was exactly 3:04 am.

146
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,400
From there to Hewitt Villa is 3 minutes, even if you were to crawl.

147
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
Twenty-seven minutes is missing.

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,500
Right. That means you were already at Jeong Mi Yeon's house. What were you doing?

149
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Were you quietly watching for everything to be over?

150
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Because heavily medicated Im Yoo Ri wouldn't be able to remember when you got there.

151
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Whether you were there or not at the time of Jeong Mi Yeon's fall

152
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,780
is critical to clear your name from being a murder suspect.

153
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,590
What time is it?

154
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,960
You can't question someone after 10 without their consent, right?

155
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,100
Sit down.

156
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,440
I don't consent.

157
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,660
 At around 6:40pm last night, police arrested without warrant 

158
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,910
 Mr. Kim who resides in Wonyeong-dong,  

159
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,450
 who is the prime suspect for the murder of the female college student in Wonyeong-dong. 

160
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,130
 They found the murder weapon in Mr. Kim's residence, 

161
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,210
 and sent it to the National Forensic Service for identification. 

162
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,250
 Police have obtained testimony from Mr. Kim, that money was the motive for the murder. 

163
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,190
 As soon as the investigation is completed, as early as tomorrow morning, 

164
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,100
  police will request an arrest warrant on a charge of murder. 

165
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,000
 It was the dashboard video that helped to solve the case 

166
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,700
 that was destined to become an unsolved mystery. 

167
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:16,780
 They analyzed the dashboard videos of residents cars at the same time frame. 

168
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,400
 They narrowed down to Mr. Kim as a suspect, and arrested him without a warrant last night,  

169
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,530
 - and started the investigation. 
 - Oh, you were watching the news.

170
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,990
You must be happy

171
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,280
because your boyfriend is a cop there...

172
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,130
Why is she like that again?

173
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,700
Although Im Yoo Ri's memory is hazy, her statement is consistent.

174
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Up to this point, there isn't any testimony from Kim Moo Yeong and Im Yoo Ri that conflicts with each other.

175
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,900
The same video was found on Jeong Mi Yeon's cell phone,

176
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,060
and it's been verified that Im Yoo Ri received the same video from Jeong Mi Yeon several times.

177
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,330
By examining the recently acquired records,

178
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,600
per Kim Moo Yeong's testimony, it's highly probable that Kim Moo Yeong arrived at the scene after 3 am.

179
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,200
Also, before arriving at the scene,

180
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,900
at the nearby convenience mart, he used his credit card for 1550 won at 2:39AM.

181
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,460
1550 won.  ($1.50) 

182
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,750
Yes. He said he charged his cellphone and bought a yogurt?

183
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,500
Yogurt?

184
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,840
Yes. We haven't confirmed if he stayed there while his cellphone was charging.

185
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,280
So, medicated Im Yoo Ri was hiding in Jeong Mi Yeon's apartment and killed her.

186
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,010
And it appears that Kim Moo Yeong who arrived later cleaned up the scene.

187
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,240
Have you checked whether they were colluding? Is there anything?

188
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,370
Are they still checking, did they say?

189
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:35,690
If Kim Moo Yeong was simply destroying the evidence, all of us here made a mistake yesterday.

190
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,300
What is their relationship? Were the two of them dating?

191
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,600
No, it doesn't seem so. They both stated that they're not as well.

192
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,780
Ah, yes. If  you look at Kim Moo Yeong's and Im Yoo Ri's call logs,

193
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,100
the two of them never corroborated their stories after the incident.

194
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,960
We'll start the briefing on the woman murdered in Wonyeong-dong.

195
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,790
Oh, Jin Kang?

196
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,550
 Yes, Unni. 

197
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,080
What's wrong with your voice?

198
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,950
By any chance, was the  name of the Mr. Kim arrested yesterday ...

199
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,780
Kim Moo Yeong?

200
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,980
Oh, you saw the news?

201
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,070
Yes, it's Kim Moo Yeong.

202
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,420
Did that person really say that he killed her?

203
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,580
 Yes. 

204
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
But it seems like he's lying.

205
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,900
- He's lying?
 -  It will be on the news soon. 

206
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,720
 Kim Moo Yeong didn't actually kill her. 

207
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,250
Okay, Unni. Thank you.

208
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,160
Okay. Please tell the CEO.

209
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,900
And Ming Yoo too.

210
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,600
Yes, yes.

211
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,370
Yes, thank you.

212
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,060
Okay.

213
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,540
Ah. Could I make one more call?

214
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,320
Never mind. I'll go in.

215
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,130
Wait a moment!

216
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,670
Why did you do that yesterday?

217
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,010
What was the reason for releasing the false information?

218
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,570
I'm never going to let this slide.

219
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,080
I will absolutely make you lose your job.

220
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,300
Did you get the two people's call history data?

221
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,230
Oh, yes.

222
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,870
Did you have it sorted by the most frequently called and texted numbers?

223
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,300
Yes.

224
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
What are you doing? Hurry up and give it to me,

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,500
-  so that I can make the calls and narrow down the list of reference witnesses. 
- Yes.

226
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 Kim Moo Yeong Communication Frequency List 
Im Yoo Ri Communication Frequency List 

227
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,400
I'll narrow down Kim Moo Yeong's list and give it to you.

228
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,700
Will you? Break it down into parts.

229
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,500
 Kim Moo Yeong Communication Frequency List 

230
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,650
 Jin Kang♡ 
  010-409-0745 

231
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,720
 010-409-0745 

232
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,270
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

233
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,210
That's Jang Se Ran.

234
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,850
Since Jang Woo Sang died,

235
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,460
all the stocks must have gone to Jang Se Ran.

236
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,680
She's his older sister, not younger.

237
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,460
Executive Director Jang Se Ran is Managing Director Jang Woo Sang's older sister.  (Editor's note: Executive Director is lower position than Managing Director) 

238
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,580
She was divorced years ago and returned.

239
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,580
They were fighting fiercely over the management rights.

240
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,200
And this is how she won in the end.

241
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,050
But still, her younger brother died.

242
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,380
Would she really consider it "winning?"

243
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,520
Who knows? They live in a different world from us.

244
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,290
I suppose.

245
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,560
We received an inquiry about a check from the bank.

246
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,870
A check?

247
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,460
Yes, regarding the check Kim Moo Yeong received.

248
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,260
Why? Is there a problem?

249
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,350
It's not that.

250
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,510
It appears he anonymously sent it to an orphanage.

251
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,610
But since the amount was so large, the orphanage sent the bank an inquiry--

252
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,170
He gave the million dollars to an orphanage?

253
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,120
Yes. It's called Jamyeong Orphanage in Haesan.

254
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,230
It's where Kim Moo Yeong lived until he was 15.

255
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,460
Is that so?

256
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,580
What is that person doing these days?

257
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,460
 010-409-0745 

258
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,220
You know that number, right?

259
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,750
We've seen each other before, right? In front of Jin Kang's house.

260
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,540
 - I'll get going, Jin Kang.
 - Alright. 

261
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,770
 - I have to move my car.
 - Sorry. 

262
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,270
Why Jin Kang was at such a loss over what to do,

263
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,280
I know now.

264
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,510
From what I see, you want to fluster Jin Kang.

265
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,920
 Eh? So you're saying Jin Kang almost died because of Im Yoo Ri? 

266
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,250
or endanger her,

267
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,360
or make her cry.

268
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,870
If that's not it,

269
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,490
you want to make her testify in a murder case.

270
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,010
You have no right to do that.

271
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,510
If you have a bit of sincerity left,

272
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,260
you won't contact her anymore.

273
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,750
Hey, girls. When we were at Arts earlier,

274
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,720
you heard that Jang Se Ran will open up a pub in Seongseo-dong, didn't you?

275
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,810
Yes! Angels Tear!

276
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,650
That's right! Angels Tear.

277
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,100
It's supposed to be the largest pub and brewery in the country. So, what shall I do?

278
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,110
Let's do it!

279
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,620
We must get the bid!

280
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,750
Yes, I like that attitude!

281
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,250
Hey!

282
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,260
CEO, today is the day for Manager Jin Kang to get drunk.

283
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,200
Really?

284
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,700
Let's drink!

285
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,430
Boyfriend, boyfriend!

286
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,030
- Boyfriend?
 - It's okay. To be honest,

287
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,650
when my boyfriend upsets me,

288
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,080
the alcohol tastes so much sweeter.

289
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,130
It's not because of my boyfriend.

290
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,040
Why? Your faithful boyfriend Cho Rong, Cho Rong

291
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,480
is being irritable, because his work isn't going well?

292
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,280
No, that's not it! I'm not saying.

293
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,960
What is this? If it's not him, that's not good, either.

294
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,220
Honestly, if the guy doesn't cause any trouble at all, it gets too boring.

295
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,350
Girls like this end up marrying the most stable men.

296
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,210
What kind of man is a stable man?

297
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,750
I'm an expert at that. Come in close.

298
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,560
A stable man is someone who faithfully brings you money,

299
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,920
is not much to look at, and he is

300
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,860
just dim enough to be thankful.  Dim-head, dim-head.

301
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,290
What is that? Then it's an ugly blockhead.

302
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,340
Good-looking guys know that they are good-looking.

303
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,550
The ugly ones are better.

304
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,950
Poor, good-looking,

305
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,370
complicated men are the absolute worst then.

306
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,370
Yeah, I have one of those at home. If you meet someone like that,

307
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,490
you have to run away at all cost!

308
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,940
Hey, seriously! You liked him so much that you ended up marrying him.

309
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,720
That's why I'm qualified to say these words.

310
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,130
Does a person go that direction because you don't know that you shouldn't go there?

311
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,000
As you're going, you realize you've gone too far to turn back.

312
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,920
There's a timing for everything. When you're still able to turn back,

313
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,810
at that moment, if you run away without looking back,

314
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,170
- then you survive.
 - Wow!

315
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm so confident because I'm such a great runner!

316
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,510
Ah, really. Drink up, drink up!

317
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,690
Yes!

318
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,530
So sweet. Drink up!

319
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,110
Why are you home so late?

320
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,020
Oppa, the one I love.

321
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,860
- You reek! How much did you drink?
 - You drink even more than me!

322
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,600
You! You, you, you! Don't!

323
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,020
- Don't relax your legs!
 - I'll relax my legs.

324
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,320
Don't relax your legs! Why are you so heavy?!

325
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,300
- I'm here. 
 - Don't relax them.

326
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,900
Oh, my back!

327
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,820
Oppa, Oppa, you know that I came in first in sports, don't you?

328
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,130
I came in first in every running race there was! Wham! Wham!

329
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,260
You have nothing better to brag about

330
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,730
than winning a race in grade school?

331
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,060
Okay! Hurry up and go to sleep!

332
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,190
- Bye bye!
 - Bye. Sleep well.

333
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,490
Let's get some sleep, please.

334
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,750
Jin Kang.

335
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,380
 Does a person go in that direction, because you don't  know you shouldn't go there? 

336
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,460
 There's a time for everything. When you can still turn back, 

337
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,010
 at that moment, 

338
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,450
 if you run away without looking back, then you survive. 

339

♬  I am walking over time  ♬

340

352
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,450
 Are you absolutely sure,  
 ♬   I lose my way   ♬

353
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,050
 you don't have any feelings for me?

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,690

355
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,550

359
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,250
 Wonyeong Police Station

360
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:49,330
♬   I am overwhelmed with sadness  ♬

361
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,020
♬   Then the tears well up.  ♬

362
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,730
 Cho Rong! 

363
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,630
Jin Kang!

364
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,340
You came on your bike?

365
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,280
Yeah.

366
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,930
I was at the sauna.

367
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,580
You want me to call Manager Yoo?

368
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,080
No, it's fine!

369
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,480
I'm just exercising a bit. It's Saturday, so...

370
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,970
Okay...

371
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,560
How was dinner the other day? I'm really sorry we couldn't eat together.

372
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,930
No! It's fine!

373
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,300
I know you've been busy. I saw the news.

374
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,730
It's just how police work is. It'll be wrapped up soon.

375
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,190
Let's eat together when this gets finished. We can see a movie, too.

376
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,680
Okay.

377
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,730
Cho Rong!

378
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,730
Something other than a movie.

379
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,370
You said you had a 100 item bucket list. Let's do the most exciting thing on it.

380
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,280
Should we go see the sea?

381
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,050
Sure, I like the sea.

382
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,570
Yes.

383
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,810
Ah, Officer Yoo. Do you want to go to Im Yoo Ri's warrant examination?

384
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,340
Sure, I will.

385
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,330
Where are you going? Im Yoo Ri is this way.

386
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,390
What about Kim Moo Yeong?

387
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,700
He was released.

388
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,340
Released?

389
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,250
Even if may not be the murderer, the evidence tampering and abetting the criminal to escape is clear.

390
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,100
Without even an examination of the facts?

391
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,330
How should we know? The prosecutor is telling us to let him go.

392
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,380
They always say "Lightning speed prosecutions are the rule" at times like this.

393
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,300
So what?

394
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,120
So he left. You should go.

395
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,960
Gosh.

396
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,740
What is it?

397
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,280
Oh.

398
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,060
Have you seen the cat? I came back home in two days and I can't find it.

399
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,560
It must have left home.

400
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,100
Why are you looking over here for a cat that left your house?

401
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,820
You're so cold.

402
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,820
Try looking at the playground. There were a lot of cats there.

403
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,330
Did anyone try to contact you?

404
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,870
From the police station?

405
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,410
Me?

406
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,670
If not, just forget it.

407
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,800
I was brought in by the police.

408
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,500
I know.

409
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,210
I was released, but they're still investigating me more.

410
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,240
And I have to go to court.

411
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,370
I didn't kill her.

412
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,780
I know that too. I saw the news.

413
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,960
Can I go now?

414
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,320
I'm hungry.

415
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,810
Do I scare you?

416
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,960
Yes.

417
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,930
I'm scary?

418
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,310
Yes.

419
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,680
You're scary.

420
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,120
Because, the police took me away?

421
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,130
Yes.

422
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,390
And I can't figure you out.

423
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,770
You can ask me. Ask me anything. If you're curious.

424
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,040
I don't want to know.

425
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,770
I don't believe you.

426
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:18,090
♬   I give you the heart that I can't I touch   ♬

427
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,480
♬   I watch you grow further and further away   ♬

428
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:43,880
♬   Now, I hold the heart that I can't let go   ♬

429
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:56,450
♬   I close my eyes again and wait for tomorrow   ♬

430
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,180
Moo Yeong was released, wasn't he?

431
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,800
That won't change anything. He still needs to be questioned.

432
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,540
I know Moo Yeong was good to you.

433
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,370
And I know you don't want to give a statement that could incriminate him.

434
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,360
But you have to.

435
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:44,040
That Kim Moo Yeong told you the passcode to Jeong Mi Yeon's house or stuff like that.

436
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,790
In return,

437
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,580
I have a request.

438
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,390
♬   That which is covered in misty haze   ♬

439
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,960
 Dad! 

440
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,240
 Kim Moo Yeong! Kim Moo Yeong! 

441
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,990
 They said he sat there the entire 20 minutes his phone was charging. 

442
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,140
 The part-time worker from that night remembered clearly. 

443
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:51,360
 Excuse me.
 - While he was charging his phone, his clothes were so wet, she gave him a towel. 

444
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,690
 He sat there looking out the window the whole 20 minutes, 

445
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,840
 so she thought he was waiting for someone. 

446
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,630
 It's me. 

447
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,970
You even call me out to places like this. Should I say it's banal or refreshing?

448
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,550
Drink it.

449
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,260
This is banal.

450
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,080
While twenty minutes passed as you were charging your phone as an excuse.

451
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,480
I thought about what was going through your head.

452
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,420
And so?

453
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,800
It's terrifying.

454
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,940
I doubt I was thinking anything much.

455
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,180
If charging your phone was really the problem, in a rush, five minutes would have been plenty.

456
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,950
Or you could have borrowed the part-time worker's phone.

457
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,100
Oh, someone like Yoo Ri,

458
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,360
you felt so sorry for her that you couldn't report her.

459
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,140
And so you helped her. You could probably fool a prosecutor into believing that.

460
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,500
But you know why you did it.

461
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,170
Ajussi,

462
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,790
do you always know why you do things?

463
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,400
There are more times when I don't know.

464
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,350
Three times five equals

465
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,190
Fifteen.

466
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,040
3515. I, at least, know when I do things out of the ordinary.

467
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,710
To Im Yoo Ri who gets into trouble when she is heavily medicated,

468
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:13,280
you gave Jeong Mi Yeon's passcode. Times like that.

469
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,000
 3x5=? 

470
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,190
Fifteen?

471
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,830
 She's interesting. Your friend Mi Yeon. 

472
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:24,070
 Her house passcode is 3515. 3515. 

473
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,310
 You were a devil. 

474
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:43,450
 At least for the twenty minutes you were sitting here. 

475
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:58,490
 Why did you stop in your tracks and decide to watch? 

476
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,050
 To see what was happening to Jeong Mi Yeon? 

477
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,590
 Bitch! 

478
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,790
 Am I some beggar? 

479
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,110
 Give it to her. But you don't come. 

480
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,360
 That's a fake. 

481
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,580
 She's pretty... 

482
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,940
 She's pretty? Is being pretty all that? 

483
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,160
 - Do you know her?
 - She's someone I know. 

484
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,910
 But, you know, she's my money tree. 

485
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,000
 When did this happen? 

486
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,720
 It must have hurt. 

487
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,010
 What are you doing? 

488
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,790
 I should go, since I've seen all there is to see. 

489
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,940
 Hey! 

490
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,230
 Hey! 

491
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,610
 Where are you going? 

492
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm Jang Se Ran. Woo Sang's older sister.

493
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,480
You shouldn't just recklessly come here.

494
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:17,500
Because of you, I lost my only sibling.

495
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,110
If you're sorry, come see me.

496
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,520
I have something to discuss with you.

497
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,360
I heard from my brother.

498
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,720
But why did you want to see me?

499
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:16,150
Your brother said this,

500
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:23,070
that "a person can always start over."

501
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,790
That "although it's a given, it's true."

502
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,220
I wanted to apologize, before I went to prison.

503
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,810
Apologize?

504
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,170
To me?

505
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,610
Back then, when I tried to hit you with my car.

506
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,210
It's fine. It wasn't on purpose.

507
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,610
It was.

508
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,860
What?

509
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:59,890
 Although I was medicated, it's the same as doing it deliberately. 

510
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,850
Why?

511
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,230
I was jealous.

512
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,860
 I don't know because I never had a mom. 

513
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,880
 -Your dad?
 - I don't have one. 

514
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,520
 - Who raised you then?
 - An institution. 

515
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,080
 It was the first time hearing it. 

516
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,160
 Because he isn't the type to talk about those kinds of things. 

517
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:34,950
 He never told me things from long ago. 

518
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,170
I'm here!

519
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,140
We hit the jackpot!

520
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:49,650
Angels Tear. Jang Se Ran's Seongseo-dong pub. I heard Kim Moo Yeong will be in charge of it.

521
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,350
Angels Tear...?

522
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,560
It's still just a rumor.

523
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,480
To that degree it's totally a fact!

524
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,390
I just spoke to Hui Joon earlier about the samples.

525
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,840
And Hui Joon said he heard it directly,

526
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,100
about Jang Se Ran and Arts CEO Jeong talking about Kim Moo Yeong.

527
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,450
It's awesome, right?

528
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah, it's awesome. So awesome.

529
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,870
Dear!

530
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,420
This isn't the time for you to be so out of it.

531
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,230
- What?
 - You said you'd get it no matter what.

532
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,150
This is totally good news for us!

533
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,230
You're close to Moo Yeong!

534
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,650
Yeah, you live in the same neighborhood!

535
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,720
I've lost my mind. Where is my cellphone?

536
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,050
- What's this?
 - You scared me!

537
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,570
You said you had a ton of work to do. This is what it was?

538
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,260
 Looking for Lost Cat 

539
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,510
Let's go together. Hurry up and call it a day. Everyone will think I'm a slavedriver.

540
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,400
Of course.

541
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,180
Let's go!

542
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,430
But, do you have a cat, dear?

543
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,180
No, I just wanted to try it.

544
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,730
 Wonyeong Mart 

545
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,460
Please ring these up.

546
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,210
This, too.

547
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,530
What should we eat later? Since it's the sea, do you like gizzard shad?

548
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,050
Yes.

549
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,110
 Kim Moo Yeong Witness List 

550
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,120
 Kim Moo Yeong Call Frequency List 

551
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,850
( Yoo Jin Kang's name and phone number are crossed out )

552

 Kim Moo Yeong Witness List 

553
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,470
 Angels Tear
 Grand Open 
11.2018  

554
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,360
 I don't think it will be visible from here. 

555
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,290
If you look this way, the kitchen will be on the left.

556
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,280
 The bar will go on this side. 

557
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,770
We will finish up the construction, but the building owner wants us to...

558
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,670
You've waited a while, right?

559
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,020
It took a while because I was getting freshly cooked ones.

560
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,840
Shall we see the sea next time?

561
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,180
I'll call you.

562
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,830
I'm sorry.

563
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,020
I really

564
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,070
didn't want to hear those words.

565
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,910
I'm sorry, Cho Rong.

566
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:03,110
I think I really did you wrong.

567
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,760
I'm so sorry.

568
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,410
Jin Kang.

569
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,800
You don't have to date me.

570
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,150
You don't have to date me, but

571
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,120
it can't be that person.

572
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,600
You said you cry if someone cries,

573
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,200
and if someone laughs, you laugh, too.

574
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,500
A person like you can't be with a person like that.

575
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,300
Because you are that kind of person,

576
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,510
you can't do that.

577
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,140
I'm home!

578
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,670
What's with your face?

579
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,810
What's wrong with my face?

580
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,730
Why are you digging through the trash?

581
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,600
What is this?

582
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,460
And what's wrong with your face?

583
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,150
It's just scribbles. Just scribbles.

584
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:59,120
Why is this jerk's face on some scribbles? This face?

585
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,940
I'll take care of my own business.

586
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,960
What are you going to take care of??

587
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,090
Oppa...

588
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,520
You're in this state because you're taking care of it?

589
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,560
What state am I in?

590
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,200
Kim Moo Yeong's Communication data!

591
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,830
It's in order of who he called and texted the most!

592
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,800
You're lucky Cho Rong got to this first. Otherwise, you'd already

593
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,740
be at the police station being questioned as a reference!

594
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,450
- So what?
 - So what?

595
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,360
What's the big deal about being a reference witness? If they call, I can just go tell them what I know.

596
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,490
It's a murder case!

597
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,500
What do you know about murder that you're going to go tell them what you know?!

598
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,130
You know he didn't do it.

599
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,560
So if he didn't, everything is fine? Huh?

600
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,630
If it weren't for him, this wouldn't even have happened to begin with!

601
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:59,580
He is in a different world than yours!

602
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,760
What do you mean a different world?

603
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,020
Then, was he born in a different world from the start?

604
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,010
Yes!

605
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,990
How can you say that?

606
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,110
You said people can always start over.

607
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:16,550
"Although it's a given, it's true." You said that to Yoo Ri.

608
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,930
Everyone can start over, except for him?

609
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,580
That's right! He can't.

610
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,030
Why? Why can't he?

611
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,290
Because he's not human!

612
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,020
He is someone who cannot be punished by anything in this world!

613
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,570
If you do wrong, you feel sorry. You are afraid of dying.

614
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,430
And you hurt if you get hit! That's being human!

615
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,660
If you hit him, he hurts, too.

616
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,800
He probably enjoys hurting!

617
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:44,430
And he'll remember it, and get excited thinking about repaying them twice, threefold as much as he wants!

618
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,750
He is ...

619
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,050
a devil!

620
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,150
Oppa!

621
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,130
Jin Kang, look at what happened to Seung Ah.

622
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,900
Look at what happened to Seung Ah when she got involved with him!

623
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,860
Oppa! Please don't talk like that!

624
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,660
You aren't asking even to the end.

625
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,800
"Why me?"

626
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,060
Why me?

627
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,240
At least you are showing some effort.

628
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,980
You weren't curious, but you asked anyway.

629
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,810
There is no reason anyway, is there?  It's up to your feelings anyway.

630
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,460
That's right. It's how I feel.

631
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:17,000
Because everything is about how I feel and it will turn out how I choose.

632
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,890
Think carefully about my proposal.

633
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,350
You're really bad, aren't you?

634
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,350
Right?

635
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,550
Everyone says you're bad.

636
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,330
They say everyone in the world can change, but you'll never change.

637
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,230
They say that bad things will happen to me if I'm with you, so I should never get involved with you.

638
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,940
So, why?

639
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,890
So, why do I keep...? Why?

640
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,040
Are you really that kind of person?

641
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:52,250
I don't like you being bad.

642
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:57,110
I'm scared because it seems like you keep going towards bad.

643
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,900
Are you going to do that work?

644
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,970
I won't if you tell me not to.

645
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,780
Don't do it.

646
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,790
Promise me you'll be a good person.

647
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,970
Teach me how.

648
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:46,450


649
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:54,660
♫  I know you'll be my home Someday  ♫

650
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,960
♫  No matter what type of day it'll be,  ♫

651
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,110
♫  I know you'll be my home  ♫

652
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,360
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 
♫  Someday  ♫

653
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,290
 Who is it? 

654
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,720
 Someone I want to look good to. 

655
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,350
 What's a good person? What kind of person is a good person? 

656
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,420
 Did you tell them you aren't doing it? 

657
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,500
 What do you think? 

658
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,220
 You did. 

659
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,890
 Why are you so against me doing that job? 

660
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,630
 Because, those people are people who can do anything. 

661
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,280
 You said that a long time ago, some cop came looking for a boy similar to me, didn't you? 

662
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,030
 I thought he was my dad. 

663
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:30,210
 If Kim Moo Yeong is really the child you're looking for, he can't be with Jin Kang, can he? 

664
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,590
 You! Don't see my sister. 

665
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,120
 This isn't a request,  it's a warning. 

666
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,790
♫   I am always gazing at you   ♫
