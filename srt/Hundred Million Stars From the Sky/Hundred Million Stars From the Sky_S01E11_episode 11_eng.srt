1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,000


2
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,060
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,700
 Who is she? 

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,440
 Someone I want to impress. 

5
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,360
 I'm not my brother's real sister. 

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,000
 I thought I would never be able to tell anyone. 

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
 I want to sleep with you. 

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,400
 It wasn't suicide. 

9
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,660
 And he didn't fall to his death from a cliff, 

10
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:10,840
because he wasn't on the run from the start.

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,380
I shot him with my gun.

12
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,000
 Episode 11 

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,620
- Manager Yoo.
 - Yeah?

14
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,600
Why? What is it?

15
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:46,200
How did you live with yourself, keeping that buried inside for twenty-five years?

16
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,450
How did you endure that long eternity?

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,970
I had Jin Kang.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,960
It's because I had Jin Kang.

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,340
That's right. You had Jin Kang.

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,810
A person's fate is such an amazing thing.

21
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,090
Only if you hadn't lost that child at the hospital,

22
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,570
Jin Kang wouldn't have ended up at your house.

23
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,420
That's true.

24
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,710
In the beginning, I convinced my mom and Jin to somehow bring the child home.

25
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,350
But she wouldn't let anyone get close.

26
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,230
She wouldn't talk or laugh or anything.

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,340
I got scared and didn't know if we were doing the right thing.

28
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,340
But one day, I woke up.

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,170
And this kid was holding onto my finger.

30
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,800
Such a tiny, cute, poor thing,

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,760
was holding tightly to my hand.

32
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,560
And that got ahold of my heart.

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,680
You're not sleeping?

34
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,240
I can't sleep. We don't have much time left to sleep either.

35
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,390
But how did you know that your brother wasn't your real brother?

36
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,590
My second year of middle school,

37
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,420
I was supposed to get a scholarship at school,

38
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,150
so I had to bring some documents.

39
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,770
My date of birth was on it.

40
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,290
It said May something 1994.

41
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,150
And it was strange since my birthday was April 1990.

42
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,990
But my registration was done in 1994.

43
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,640
So I was planning to ask my brother when he got home,

44
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,230
but he had the night shift that day.

45
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,320
So I thought about it all night, and realized,

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,980
"Ah, that's how it is. So that's what happened."

47
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,590
But there had been so many other strange things before then.

48
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,010
I think it would have been hard to just let it pass by.

49
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,370
You must have been in shock. It was during adolescence, too.

50
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,820
Of course, I was.

51
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,630
I struggled so much all on my own, without letting anyone else know.

52
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,550
I had an extreme emotional rollercoaster.

53
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,100
The funny thing is, the day I found out

54
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,210
was the day before I was supposed to go to the hospital.

55
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,530
The day before I was scheduled to get this removed.

56
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,510
Oh.

57
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,030
You were planning to get rid of it.

58
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,500
But, after finding out,

59
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,540
I didn't think I should get it removed.

60
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,820
I thought they would never be able to find me if I got it removed.

61
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,700
♫   Star, you are a star   ♫

62
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,630
It's weird.

63
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,690
We came here to find your memory.

64
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,370
♫   Star, my star that’s living in me   ♫

65
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,610
But for some reason, I feel like I'm finding myself.

66
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,050
♫   It’s fine even if we are left alone in a dark night   ♫

67
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,270
♫   Let’s close our eyes together, star, us   ♫

68
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,510
Do you want me to show you something really, really cute?

69
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,430
- Something really, really cute?
 - Yeah.

70
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,640
Ah, what a shame.

71
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,520
It was really, really cute. But my battery is dead.

72
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,940
What is it? Something really, really cute?

73
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,820
Me.

74
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,670
You?

75
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,500
When I was young.

76
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,010
Wow, you're becoming more shameless by the day.

77
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,590
Aren't I really cute?

78
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,600
Hello! I apologize. I got lost.

79
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,990
- No, thank you so much just for coming. Thank you. 
 - Yes.

80
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,560
 010-2988-52 

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,820
Who could it be? Hello?

82
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,960
 I'm sorry for calling so late. 

83
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,210
 Hello, I'm Hwang Seon Hwa, Jin Kang's company's CEO. 

84
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,070
 I'm so sorry! I didn't know it was here! To call her brother this late at night! 

85
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,160
 I didn't wake Jin Kang did I? She worked all night because she had to go to the temple today. 

86
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,090
Hey, I was wondering what time Kim Moo Yeong's 2 pm questioning ended.

87
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,560
 It got postponed. 

88
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,740
Postponed?

89
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,790
 Yes. We got a call at 1 that he was in the countryside. 

90
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,480
Countryside? Where is that?

91
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,360
 Haesan. 

92
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,820
Haesan?

93
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,960
 What could we do? We couldn't go all the way there to get him. 

94
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,220
 It's delayed until tomorrow afternoon. Is something wrong? 

95
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,370
No, no. Okay, I understand. Hanging up.

96
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,320
What is it?

97
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,860
I think Jin Kang went to Haesan with Kim Moo Yeong.

98
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,570
With Kim Moo Yeong? Haesan?

99
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,170
If that's really true, what do I do?

100
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,950
 Wonyeong Coin Laundry 

101
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,600
It's late.

102
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,380
Go. You'll be late for work.

103
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,520
Go. I'll text you.

104
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,160
Go.

105
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,350
You're up?

106
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,710
Did I wake you?

107
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,000
Did your date with Tak go well yesterday?

108
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,880
Jin Gook, your kimbap was so popular!

109
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,780
My CEO said you could open a kimbap shop.

110
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,520
I got a call from your CEO.

111
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,910
She couldn't find a presentation board you had made.

112
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,360
Oh.

113
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,590
My CEO did?

114
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,810
I see.

115
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,020
I told her I was leaving it on my desk.

116
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,670
I'm sorry for lying to you.

117
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,130
Truthfully, I went to Haesan yesterday.

118
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,580
With Kim Moo Yeong...

119
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,860
No need to get into it. Just tell me what you're going to do.

120
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,240
I clearly told you I was against it. And you promised you'd never see him again.

121
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,530
Oppa, I like him...

122
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,130
How dare you say that?!

123
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,000
Are you out of your mind?

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,310
How can you say that you like someone like him?!

125
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,630
Is liking him such a bad thing?

126
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,460
Do you really think that makes sense?

127
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,310
Like you say, why don't you listen to what I have to say—

128
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,160
Listen to what? Just ask anyone on the street!!

129
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,560
Ignoring a good kid like Eom Cho Rong,

130
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,380
and liking scum like him.  Who would understand that?! Who?!

131
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,290
I don't care what other people think.

132
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,830
I know you don't like him, either.

133
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm not asking you to understand right away.

134
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,710
But, reacting like this...

135
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,980
Without listening to what I'm thinking or what his plans are...

136
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,510
Why are you like this with no rhyme or reason?

137
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,600
Forget "no rhyme or reason." It just can't be, got it?

138
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,850
Answer me!

139
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,970
Sit down.

140
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,960
Sit down!

141
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,960
You little!

142
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,510
Why are you really like this?

143
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:18,470
You, seriously... Why are you rebelling when you aren't even in puberty!

144
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,540
Are you really not going to listen to me, Jin Kang?

145
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,350
Even if I'm begging you like this?

146
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,400
Who raised you this whole time?!

147
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,150
I'm asking you this earnestly! I'm practically begging you!

148
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,310
Please, stop, Oppa! Please!

149
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,990
What can I say when you say that?

150
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,040
I felt so bad back then, what could I say?

151
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,850
My adolescence. Do you know how my adolescence was?

152
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,400
I felt so bad, just seeing your face.

153
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,140
I felt so sorry even seeing the back of you, I couldn't breathe. That's how my adolescence was!

154
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,480
You...

155
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,850
I know that I've always been baggage to you.

156
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,980
I know that I grew up thanks to you.

157
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,690
I know it too well, so please stop.

158
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,380
I feel bad enough as it is! So please stop showing off your good deeds!

159
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,360
Showing off?

160
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,510
Yeah, showing off.

161
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,580
You... kid!

162
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,490
How could you be baggage? You're not baggage, and how am I...?

163
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,920
Jin Kang, you don't really think that, do you?

164
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,320
I really do think that way.

165
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,340
I'm so suffocated.

166
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,490
And I'm tired of it.

167
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,310
 Seoul Wonyeong Prosecution Office 

168
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,000
What time did you say Kim Moo Yeong's questioning is today?

169
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,160
Four pm.

170
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,360
I see.

171
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,830
Just do your own work. Mind your own business.

172
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,940
Why don't you mind your own business!

173
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,170
Who do you think you're talki—

174
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,010
What's wrong with a police officer asking about a suspect's investigation schedule? Did I say something wrong?

175
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,070
No.

176
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,600
Hello.

177
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
Enjoy your lunch.

178
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,030
Enjoy!

179
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,690
He said he's not having lunch.

180
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,690
But, is something wrong with Manager Yoo?

181
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,770
All day long, he's been... It's the first time seeing him like this.

182
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,770
Enjoy your lunch.

183
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,630
Eat before you go. Don't just hem and haw because of him.

184
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,120
Did I do that?

185
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,020
What is this, Eom Cho Rong!

186
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,520
Are you being considerate of me?

187
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,380
Yes.

188
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,260
Thanks.

189
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,150
I heard it didn't work out with Jin Kang.

190
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,540
No.

191
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,550
Goodness.

192
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,760
I know. Nothing is fair in this world,

193
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,770
but the most unfair thing in this world is dating, isn't it?

194
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,190
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,760
Ugh, what can you do even if it's unfair, and you just can't forget?

196
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,250
Head on in.

197
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,820
Okay. Bye.

198
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,830
 If you charged your battery, show me that really, really cute thing. 

199
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,190
Unni.

200
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,220
Welcome!

201
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,200
Jin Kang!

202
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,630
I hesitated because I didn't want to pressure you, too.

203
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,710
But your brother seemed depressed all day.

204
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,780
I've never seen him so dejected.

205
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,260
You really did go to Haesan yesterday.

206
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
Yes.

207
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,520
Your brother said something, didn't he? Was he harsh to you?

208
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,160
I was harsh to him.

209
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,800
I told him not to brag about it and that I am sick of it.

210
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,310
Jin Kang,

211
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,540
I know.

212
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,650
It's okay. Your brother knows you didn't mean it.

213
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,690
Jin Kang, even though he knows, those words would hurt.

214
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,250
Did my brother eat?

215
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,290
What about you?

216
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,310
Goodness, I'm the fool for asking. As if you guys aren't siblings! I should have known.

217
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,030
Let's go. Let's eat first.

218
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,270
It's okay. Hurry!

219
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,350
Come on. Let's go eat.

220
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,530
You were at fault, but it's okay.

221
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,310
Your brother knows you didn't mean it.

222
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,970
And kids are allowed to be that way.

223
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,010
No.

224
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,490
No, really, you can.

225
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,000
He's the saddest one that you matured so quickly.

226
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,390
Why? Do you think your brother is having a hard time because of you?

227
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,600
Of course, he's supposed to when your parents aren't here.

228
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,050
It's okay. It's okay.

229
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,710
It isn't a given, Unni.

230
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,690
It isn't a given, Unni.

231
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,830
I shouldn't do this to my brother. Ever.

232
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,440
Why not... just hurry up and get up.

233
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,050
Let's go eat. Hurry. Get your bag.

234
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,790
Unni, I have something to ask you.

235
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,870
It's the first time

236
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,470
seeing my brother hate someone this much.

237
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,820
It started before Kim Moo Yeong and I started dating.

238
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,220
For some strange reason, he disliked him every time he saw him.

239
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,500
Why do you think my brother is like that?

240
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,190
This finishes the police investigation.

241
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,650
You'll get a warrant from the prosecution soon. By phone or mail.

242
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,790
Okay.

243
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,960
You can't change the prosecutor's schedule as you wish like this.

244
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,040
Kim Moo Yeong, it will only hurt you.

245
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,540
 I'm on my way to meet my Sojung Unni. 

246
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,800
 I told you about her, didn't I? She's closest to my brother. 

247
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,200
 My brother found out I went to Haesan with you. 

248
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,680
 I was mean to my brother this morning. 

249
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,590
 I think that's why she wants to meet. 

250
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 Police Civil Servant Open Recruitment 

251
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,060
I just stopped by your office.

252
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,490
What for?

253
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,770
Just because. I couldn't just leave when I'm all the way here.

254
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,980
Want this?

255
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,290
Wow, laser beams will come out of your eyes.

256
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,960
Why don't you listen to me? I'm sure I told you not to see my sister.

257
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,570
Do I have to? Can't you let it slide?

258
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,960
I'm thinking of trying out for that.

259
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,110
I told you that it was my dream to be a policeman when I was little.

260
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,170
What do you think? I'm confident I can pass.

261
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,330
You are confident you will pass?

262
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,720
You must clearly be mistaken.

263
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,400
Can you become a cop just by being smart and passing a test?

264
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,420
Police work is done by humans. Not murderers like you.

265
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,530
You are a murderer.

266
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,780
Luckily you just got indicted for helping the criminal escape and destroying the evidence instead for a murder

267
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,160
You better not pretend to forget.

268
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,820
Who caused Seung Ah to die? Why did Yoo Ri become like that?

269
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,030
How dare someone like you... to my Jin Kang.

270
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,240
I can't watch Jin Kang's life become ruined because of someone like you. I won't let it.

271
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,760
So, stop messing around and get away from my sister.

272
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,170
Until just now,

273
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:01,240
I must have wanted to impress you.

274
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,960
Seeing how bad I feel right now.

275
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,470
Okay, I get it. No need for us to reconcile.

276
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,070
I must have been mistaken about the brother of the woman I like.

277
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:21,980
You're you and Jin Kang is Jin Kang. What's the big deal about her brother?

278
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,120
Big deal about her brother?

279
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,560
You're not afraid of anything, are you?

280
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,460
Because nothing means anything to you, you'll do anything, won't you?

281
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,120
Because I'm terribly, terribly afraid, I'll do anything.

282
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm afraid of my sister getting hurt, so I'm willing to do anything.

283
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,970
I'm saying that I'll no longer discuss this with you.

284
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,120
I don't care what you do.

285
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,670
I'm going to keep dating Jin Kang, so do whatever you want.

286
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,630
You do what you want, and I'll do what I want.

287
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,650
Ah, I'm curious what you're talking about.

288
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,700
 Couldn't you change your mind? 

289
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,920
 There might be a reason we don't know about. 

290
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,330
 So, what could that be? Can you think of anything? 

291
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,090
 Me? I can't. 

292
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,220
 Just because you said he's been like that from the start. I'm just saying because it's weird. 

293
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,560
 Jin Kang,  

294
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,600
 don't be like that. 

295
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,800
 Honestly, I'm against Kim Moo Yeong, too. 

296
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,580
 I don't think he is suited for you. 

297
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,290
You're here.

298
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,930
I'm here.

299
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,770
How could you not eat all day because of that?

300
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,320
It's not that I didn't eat, I just couldn't.

301
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,510
I went all the way home,

302
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,170
but I couldn't bring myself to go inside.

303
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,890
I'm glad I came here. It tastes better with you.

304
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,150
Does your brother concern you that much?

305
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:38,350
Of course. Hearing my brother was like that all day.

306
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,190
It's so complicated.

307
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,430
Why?

308
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,240
Does it bother you that my brother doesn't approve of you?

309
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,950
But from my brother's perspective, of course, he'd be that way.

310
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,060
I wish time would just go by quickly.

311
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,690
I wish this present time would pass by quickly,

312
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,360
and my brother would like you. Right?

313
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,330
Not sure.

314
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,570
Not sure?

315
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,770
Is it that important?

316
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,150
You're not a minor who needs permission.

317
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,700
Who said I need permission? You know that's not what I meant.

318
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,750
I hate complicated things. You're you,

319
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,760
and that person is just himself.

320
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,640
That person?

321
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,400
Is my brother is "just that person" to you?

322
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,590
Why? Can't I?

323
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,880
That's mean.

324
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,010
Whatever.

325
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,890
My brother is like that because he doesn't know you well.

326
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,370
He doesn't know that you're making an effort.

327
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,600
I don't have any intention of impressing your brother.

328
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,590
You must not know this, but I'm really used to being rejected.

329
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,190
It doesn't bother me, so don't force it on me.

330
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,340
"Your brother, your brother"

331
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,930
How can you talk as if it doesn't concern you?

332
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,560
When you know everything.

333
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,320
Although no one else knows, you know all about it.

334
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,240
You know what my brother means to me, you know so well and still,

335
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,190
how could you speak that way?

336
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,790
I should go.

337
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,710
Bye.

338
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:33,960
♫   I believe in miracle in the moment of coincidence   ♫

339
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:41,590
♫   I embrace the laughter and pain in that   ♫

340
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:49,050
♫   Though seasons pass quickly and change the scenery    ♫

341
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:57,970
♫   The memories burnished and come again   ♫

342
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,920
♫   I don’t understand. When I look at your face   ♫

343
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,850
 Yoo Jin Kang 

344
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:12,750
♫   I've lost my way   ♫

345
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,660
♫   As though waking from a long dream   ♫

346
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,700
♫  I feel overwhelmed with sadness,   ♫

347
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,860
♫   Then the tears well up  ♫

348
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,240
Liar.

349
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,140
Who is used to something like that?

350
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,950
Who doesn't care about being rejected?

351
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,560
It hurts me if you're like that. I'm on your side.

352
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,190
I was scared that you left.

353
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,190
You're so bad.

354
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,150
How far did you go?

355
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,290
Your house.

356
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,340
Did you run?

357
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,000
Did you run like crazy?

358
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,100
You won't do that again, will you?

359
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,850
Next time, even if I say I'm leaving, you'll stop me, right?

360
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,310
Yeah.

361
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,120
I'm thirsty.

362
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,190
I was so upset I didn't drink any water.

363
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,980
My bag.

364
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,460
Never mind.

365
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,860
I'm thirsty.

366
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,260
I am.

367
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,630
I'm thirsty.

368
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,030
Up you go!

369
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,990
There aren't any cups here.

370
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,560
No.

371
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,350
That's right. It's not just cups that are missing.

372
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:46,290
You don't have a gas stove. No rice cooker. Or washing machine.

373
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,540
I know why the cat left home.

374
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,910
What?

375
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,640
There.

376
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,510
He didn't think this is a home.

377
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,240
There's nothing here, so how could he think of it as a home?

378
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,260
It is a home.

379
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,890
Hey. Do you have any money?

380
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,650
You at least have some money, right?

381
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,910
Money? I have some, but not a lot. Why?

382
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,710
That's good enough.

383
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,780
What is it? I get scared when you're like that.

384
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,050
No, I can't tell you yet.

385
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,170
- What is it?
 - No, no. It's a secret.

386
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,640
Your alarm is ringing.

387
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,320
Oh. I went to the market to get some milk.

388
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,540
Want some bread?

389
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,400
Wash up, so we can eat some bread.

390
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,560
Okay.

391
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,830
It tastes good.

392
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,540
Does it? Want some more?

393
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,360
Okay, sure.

394
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,610
I'm sorry about yesterday.

395
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,040
I know. You think I don't know that?

396
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,960
Give me some time.

397
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,820
I'm going to try, he and I,

398
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,370
to make you accept us.

399
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,390
So, if you could watch over us.

400
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,140
It doesn't look like things with Jin Kang will go well.

401
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,750
Why not?

402
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,350
Did you not reconcile yet?

403
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,310
She didn't apologize?

404
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,290
She did.

405
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,920
But, she won't say she'll break up with him even if it kills her.

406
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,970
That's a big problem.

407
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,270
Nothing.

408
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,400
What is it? Tell me, what you were about to say.

409
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,150
Jin Kang doesn't know anything, does she?

410
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,720
What doesn't she know?

411
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,410
About you bringing her home when she was young. That she's not your real sister.

412
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,980
She was distraught at the idea of upsetting you.

413
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,790
She said she couldn't do that to you. That she shouldn't ever do that to you.

414
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,930
I was wondering if she knew something.

415
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,920
Do you remember what you said before?

416
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,560
What?

417
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,780
You said this.

418
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,390
 Your sister is an orphan, isn't she? 

419
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,180
 What? Orphan? Who said that?! 

420
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,370
 She has me as her family, what orphan?! 

421
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,140
 Where did you hear such a thing?! 

422
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,380
 Kim Moo Yeong and your sister, 

423
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,250
 they were saying they were both orphans. 

424
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,200
 They were two peas in a pod since then. 

425
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,080
Could you tell me specifically what they said?

426
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,410
I'm just curious about what being an orphan meant.

427
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,960
You said your parents weren't living.

428
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,500
Yeah, but?

429
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,630
She has another sister besides you,

430
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,270
but that sister emigrated when she was young.

431
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,510
So the two of you grew up together.

432
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,290
You and your sister.

433
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,990
That's right.

434
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,110
That's all I heard.

435
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,800
Why? Is something strange?

436
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,170
No.

437
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,110
No, no. That's right.

438
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:52,130
I was wondering what she meant about being an orphan when she has me.

439
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,500
Wow, this is so annoying.

440
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,130
You came here to ask that? Not to see me?

441
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,770
No, no.

442
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,230
I came to see you.

443
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,110
The trial is starting and I was curious to see how you were doing.

444
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,430
You're such a bad liar.

445
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,510
Is it obvious?

446
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,130
You're better than I expected.

447
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,180
It looks like you're doing well here.

448
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,240
Yes.

449
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,720
But the time doesn't move.

450
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,660
Moo Yeong and your little sister are dating?

451
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,010
Dating? I'm against it so it won't ever happen!

452
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,770
You think your sister could stop just because you're against it?

453
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,900
She won't be able to stop herself.

454
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,970
Maybe if Moo Yeong dumps her.

455
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,250
If a woman falls for him, she can't ever get herself free.

456
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,290
You definitely said you had money.

457
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,290
The money that I can spend, $2000?

458
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,480
What are you going to do that you keep saying $2000, $2000.

459
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,490
What else? I'm planning to spend all of it.

460
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,300
What are you planning to buy?

461
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,790
Cups, a microwave oven,

462
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:29,660
a washing machine, a rice cooker, rice bowls, soup bowls, pots, a frypan, dishes, a cutting board, knives,

463
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,080
etc, etc, etc.

464
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,700
I'm in trouble. $2000 won't be enough. Do you have $3000?

465
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,170
 Visitation Application 

466
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,140
Thank you for your work.

467
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,270
It isn't possible for a visitation with Im Yoo Ri today.

468
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,060
Pardon? What's the reason?

469
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,270
She already has a visitor. She isn't allowed more than one visitor per day.

470
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,940
Oh, I see.

471
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,400
What brings you here?

472
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,830
I heard the news and felt troubled. Yoo Ri's mother called me.

473
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,870
She said Yoo Ri was refusing an attorney, so she asked me to come here.

474
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,340
I picked the wrong day.

475
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,360
I didn't know that you still had investigations happening.

476
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,690
It wasn't for an investigation, I had a personal question to ask her.

477
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:17,060
The case has been turned over to the prosecutor. As well as the accomplice's case.

478
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:21,320
Ah, the man who helped get rid of the evidence?

479
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,970
What relationship did he have with Yoo Ri?

480
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,970
Oh, Kim Moo Yeong?

481
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,530
It appears Yoo Ri had a crush on Kim Moo Yeong.

482
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,860
Kim Moo Yeong?

483
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,670
Yes, Kim Moo Yeong.

484
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,580
How old is he?

485
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,150
He's 30; born in 1989.

486
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,360
It sounded like someone I knew.

487
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,730
Do you know him, Doctor?

488
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,340
Yes, I'm not sure, but...

489
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,610
Oh, I have some things to do, so I'll get going.

490
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,140
Thank you for your time.

491
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,480
Are you sure this is all necessary for a home?

492
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,420
The cart doesn't move because it's so heavy.

493
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,420
I'm only buying the necessities though.

494
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,880
I'm saving the rest to order off the internet.

495
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,650
There it is.

496
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,820
-Where are you going?
 -To pay.

497
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,440
We still have one more floor to visit. We bought appliances upstairs and bought miscellaneous items here.

498
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,180
We have to go downstairs to buy food.

499
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,440
Food?

500
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,480
Yes! Rice, ramen, kimchi,

501
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,720
eggs, red pepper paste, soybean paste, soy sauce, olive oil,

502
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,570
and so on, etc.

503
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,660
We can just order take-out.

504
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,760
When are you going to have a housewarming?

505
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,480
The microwave and washing machine are arriving the day after tomorrow, so maybe in three days?

506
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,040
What yummy food will you make me?

507
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,810
Housewarming? Yummy food?

508
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,790
You must not know this, but I don't do this. Where are you going?

509
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,120
Look at this!

510
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,970
Put it back.

511
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:18,480
Where have you been, Kitty? Come home with Unnie.

512
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,930
This is not my style...

513
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,330
 At about 6:40 pm last night, the police  

514
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,500
 arrested 30-year-old Mr. Kim residing in Wonhyeong-dong, without a warrant 

515
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,980
 as a prime suspect of Wonhyeong-dong murder case and 

516
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,590
 found a part of weapon used in the crime in his home which 

517
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:01,750
 was sent to national forensic service for analysis. 

518
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,370
 What are you doing? Aren't you going to put stuff away? 

519
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,610
 Look at this. 

520
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,390
 And bring me the knife. 

521
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,310
 You're the one who asked for it. 

522
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:14,050
 What did I ask for? 

523
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:18,820
 The really, really cute thing. You asked for it. 

524
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,560
 I'm really, really cute, right? 

525
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,320
 You were big. 

526
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,890
 Then give it back. 

527
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,970
 You gave it to me. 

528
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,950
 But can you really give this to me? 

529
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,750
 Yeah, I scanned it. The original is at home. 

530
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,190
 I'm giving it to you to get closer with my brother. 

531
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,950
 The photo taken of me and my brother. 

532
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,500
 We should hurry and clean up. 

533
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:40,600
 Haesan Myeongseong University Hospital 

534
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,550
 Seoul Wonyeong Police Station 

535
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,510
Officer Yoo, someone is looking for you outside.

536
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,690
- Me?
 - Yes

537
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:18,790
I am surprised you are here because of Kim Moo Yeong and not for Yoo Ri.

538
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,340
But I'm not sure what I can tell you.

539
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,740
I can't tell you about the culprit.

540
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,200
Yes.

541
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:36,820
When you came to see me about Yoo Ri, you said you read my book, didn't you?

542
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,520
Yes.

543
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:46,200
The Myeong Ho that appears in Chapter 2 is Moo Yeong.

544
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,810
Moo Yeong is the first child I met.

545
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:59,030
I returned to medical school to study pediatric psychiatry because of him.

546
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:04,480
And in any case, Moo Yeong is an extremely special child to me.

547
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:12,400
Then, since he was young when he was in Haesan?

548
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,460
Yes. I'm actually surprised.

549
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:23,090
I didn't expect you to know that Moo Yeong had grown up in Haesan.

550
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,820
I think it's a good thing I came to you.

551
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:33,140
No, I just happened to find out that he was from Haesan.

552
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,170
Please, I beg of you. There are too many things I have questions about.

553
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,630
It's shocking enough that Yoo Ri did such a thing. But the fact that Moo Yeong is involved...

554
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:51,810
If Moo Yeong isn't living a proper life, I have some responsibility in that,

555
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,030
because I made the wrong decision.

556
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,720
- Decision?
 - Yes.

557
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:07,300
I made it... a long time ago.

558
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,340
Isn't that Yang Gyeong Mo?

559
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,120
How did you know?

560
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,860
Was it really Dr. Yang Gyeong Mo?

561
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,620
I'm a big fan. I should have gotten his autograph.

562
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,810
He's that famous?

563
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,840
Of course, he's that famous! He comes out on TV.

564
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,520
I read his book and searched for his videos.

565
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,690
Wow. Im Yoo Ri is the child in Chapter 7 of "With Trauma"?

566
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,800
And Kim Moo Yeong is in the second chapter?

567
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,610
That's what he said.

568
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:54,710
What does it say? I only read the parts about Im Yoo Ri.

569
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,200
It's so sad. It was so sad I cried.

570
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,400
I don't remember though. I should look it up again.

571
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,050
But why did he want to meet you?

572
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,030
He said there are a lot of things that he is curious about.

573
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,370
From how Yoo Ri and Kim Moo Yeong came to know each other.

574
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,680
He seemed a bit uneasy.

575
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,090
He must be since he treated both as children.

576
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,660
Yep.

577
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,730
What did Im Yoo Ri say?  Did you meet her?

578
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:38,340
Yeah, but it's not that. I don't think Jin Kang knows anything.

579
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,000
- Oh, that's a relief.
 - Exactly.

580
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:51,150
But if she knew up to there, wouldn't it be okay for Jin Kang to know?

581
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,320
She's not a child and is grown up now.

582
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,010
What?

583
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,000
That should never be!

584
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,930
No, not about long ago.

585
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:05,220
She could know that you brought her in and raised her when she was young. She should know in time.

586
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,350
I said she can't!

587
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:12,600
Okay. No need to get worked up.

588
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,730
Do you know how sensitive you are? You're getting so sensitive.

589
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:23,420
I know. I know it too, but I don't know what to do.

590
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,790
She should never have met him from the start.

591
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,230
Since she met him, I've had this suffocating feeling.

592
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:38,750
Whether he just passes me by or not,  they are both some kind of karma.

593
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,000
But the thought that it could affect Jin Kang as well,

594
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,970
I can't handle it. I think I'll go crazy.

595
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,930
300 grams of beef, Napa cabbage,

596
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,580
perilla leaves, oyster mushroom, king oyster mushroom.

597
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,960
Enoki mushroom.

598
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,080
Aren't you going to lunch?

599
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,220
Oh, yes, I'm going.

600
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,670
What are you looking at so intently?

601
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,150
Ten best housewarming foods that are simple but luxurious.

602
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,480
Are you having a housewarming?

603
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,670
Let's just go and eat.

604
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,690
 White wine or red wine? 

605
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,730
 White! 

606
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,440
 Oppa 

607
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,060
Oppa...

608
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,560
Cod stew?

609
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,360
I came to the market since it's been so long.

610
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,260
The cod looks good. If you're going to be home for dinner, I was thinking of making it.

611
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,230
Cod...?

612
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,350
I think I'm going to be late.

613
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,470
 Are you going to very late? Working all night? 

614
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:41,790
I'm not sure if we're working that late tonight yet. But I think it'll be after dinner.

615
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,960
Well, then, let's eat cod stew another time.

616
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,240
Make sure to eat.

617
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,420
Yeah, I'm sorry. You too.

618
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,030
This is too small, right?

619
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:19,080
Do you have something larger? I'm planning on eating it with my girlfriend.

620
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,300
For Shabu Shabu?

621
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,280
Thank you!

622
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,610
Yes, thank you!

623
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,370
Have a nice day.

624
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:12,850
 Just because you're opposed to it, do you think your sister can stop? 

625
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:18,580
 Women who fall for him will never be able to get out of it. 

626
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,950
What's this?

627
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,940
Toilet paper rolls and detergent. Housewarming gifts.

628
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,480
Do you know why these are housewarming gifts?

629
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,020
So things will go smoothly.

630
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,230
Hope things will go smoothly for you, my Kim Moo Yeong.

631
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,370
The house is really coming together. It's almost there.

632
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,030
Oh, It's that...

633
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,020
That! That!

634
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,750
That. Mille-Feuille hot pot.

635
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,200
That's right! Mille-Feuille thing.

636
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,690
I really wanted to try this!

637
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,970
Aren't you going overboard for a first time?

638
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,820
I'm going totally overboard.

639
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,190
The simplest and yet luxurious looking food is so complicated to make.

640
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,140
Should I help you?

641
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,190
Not at all.  Just sit there like that. Just like that.

642
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,230
Just like this.

643
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,430
Oh, you've been well, haven't you?

644
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:43,340
Look at this. The house is all done.

645
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,140
I did all this.

646
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,690
Look at him. He has become a person, right?

647
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,570
He still has a long way to go?  You're right.

648
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,420
I'll have to try harder.

649
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,120
Where is the picture?

650
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,140
Where did my brother go?

651
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,270
Where did the picture go?

652
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,210
I really need to focus right now.

653
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,150
I asked where the photo went.

654
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:52,310
Did you put it away because of my brother? Because you didn't want to see him?

655
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,000
I put it away because of you.

656
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,950
In here.

657
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,550
Good job!

658
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,800
You're so adorable!

659
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,350
But, where is this?

660
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:24,030
Here? Haesan Myeongseong University Hospital.

661
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,720
Haesan Myeongseong University Hospital.

662
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,680
 Hey, kid. 

663
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,590
 Where are you going? 

664
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,230
Why?

665
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:54,800
I don't know.  I remember something, but I'm not sure what it is yet.

666
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,690
Was I there?

667
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,710
There?

668
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,150
That's right! That's possible.

669
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:13,500
That's the largest hospital in Haesan, so it's possible you also got treated there.

670
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:19,020
Before I left Haesan, I was being treated for my burn there, until I was seven.

671
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,240
It's boiling! It's boiling!

672
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,880
Oh, it looks so good!

673
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,720
Let's eat.

674
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,950
Hold on, just a second.

675
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,140
You're doing all sorts of things as if it's a big deal.

676
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,270
Of course, I'm doing all sorts of things. I would do even more.

677
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,880
Come here.

678
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,430
One, two, three.

679
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,380
Your head is so big.

680
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,690
What are you doing?

681
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,120
Give it to me.

682
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,900
Wait. Your head is really big.

683
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,580
Hey!

684
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,250
Give it to me.

685
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,740
Give me my phone.

686
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,650
Last one, last one.

687
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,750
One, two, three.

688
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,540
You like it?

689
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,590
It's fine. I'm satisfied.

690
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,530
You have something like this in this house when you didn't even have any cups?

691
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,950
It's really difficult to eat a meal.

692
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:03,940
I forgot to buy the corkscrew.

693
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,300
No, it's fine. Let's just eat like this.

694
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,300
Housewarming needs alcohol.

695
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,820
Start eating. I'll be right back.

696
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,260
It's fine! Let's just eat.

697
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,320
No, you eat. I'll go get it.

698
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,380
I'll be quick. You eat.

699
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,560
But you can't eat it all!

700
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,250
Do you think I'm a pig?

701
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,170
I'll stuff my face.

702
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,230
No, let's wait.

703
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:03,230
 Wonyeong Mart 

704
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,620
Do you have a wine opener?

705
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,430
We don't.

706
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,320
Oh, I understand.

707
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:30,450
In that way ...

708
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,950
He's really something.

709
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:06,000
I'm hungry, right?

710
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,870
He will be back soon.

711
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:13,000
He says he is running.

712
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:55,360


713
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:03,510
♫  I know you'll be my home  ♫

714
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,880
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 
♫  Someday  ♫

715
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,850
 What is it? 

716
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,240
 It's really nothing.  I'll explain later. 

717
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,880
 That guy contacted you. 

718
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,190
 Do you know something? 

719
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,130
 I stabbed him with a knife. 

720
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:19,550
 Oppa!  I don't know about anyone else, but you are my brother! You can't be acting like that! 

721
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,860
 Stop seeing him. 

722
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,620
 Are you really quitting? 

723
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:26,050
 Either properly verify if Kim Moo Yeong is the kid you're looking for. 

724
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,120
 Or If you can't, then forget about it. Just make a firm decision. 

725
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,890
 If you want to leave, you can go anytime. 

726
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,580
 But if you want to return, come back anytime. 

727
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,320
 You did well. 

728
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,840
 Go. 

729
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,730
♫  You belong to me  ♫
