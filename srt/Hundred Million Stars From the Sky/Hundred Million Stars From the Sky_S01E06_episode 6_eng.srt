1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900


2
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,090
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes

4
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,810
You look just fine.

5
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,350
You made me unable to do a thing all day,

6
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,000
but you're completely fine.

7
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,960
That look again. "I pity you."

8
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,580
Jin Kang!

9
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,890
Cho Rong!

10
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,070
That's good. I got here just in time.

11
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,490
Yes.

12
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,040
Did I surprise you?

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,450
My mom kept telling me to bring you some bone broth.

14
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,420
- My goodness. Thank you. I'll eat it well.
 - Hope you enjoy it.

15
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,080
Did you eat yet?

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,330
No, I haven't.

17
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,980
I'll go put it inside. Then we can eat together.

18
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,880
Okay. Take your time.

19
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,220
She was so insistent. She froze them into individual servings, so just heat one up when you eat.

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,720
Okay. I'm going to eat so well.

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,850
She worked so hard to make it and even shared with me.

22
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,780
Not at all. So enjoy it.

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,220
Thanks.

24
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,630
Thank you.

25
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,850
It looks delicious.

26
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,810
Welcome!

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,040
One order of hand-cut noodle soup.

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,850
Sure.

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,590
 Mom 

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,950
Answer it. It's your mother.

31
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,800
I don't have to answer now.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,570
But still.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,560
- Yes?
 - Did you catch her?

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,460
Catch? Catch what? I'm going to hang up now.

35
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,170
Bad guys. To catch the bad guys.

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Is she waiting to eat together with you?

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,240
No, no. It's not that, so don't worry.

38
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay.

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,790
Go ahead and eat.

40
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,620
Let's eat.

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,690
  Eom Cho Rong, I didn't give birth to a fool.  

42
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,450
 In any case, if you can't hold her hand by tonight, 

43
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,120
 I'm going to disown you. 

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,400
Aren't you eating?

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,210
I'm eating.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,370
Go ahead.

47
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,270
The sweat... I'm sweating.

48
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,250
What's wrong with some sweat?

49
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,760
Should we date?

50
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,740
Not just flirt.

51
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,630
Not just flirt.

52
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,380
Not just flirt.

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,410
- Jin Kang. 
- Yes?

54
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,170
- I'll get going, Jin Kang.
 - Okay.

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,140
Excuse me. I have to get my car out.

56
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,530
Sorry.

57
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,430
I'll call you!

58
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,780
Drive carefully.

59
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
What are you doing?

60
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,530
Oh, I was standing guard in case he kisses you.

61
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,740
Why? Do you regret it? Did I stop you from kissing when you wanted to?

62
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,620
Yeah, I regret it.

63
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,140
Then we need to talk some more.

64
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,350
What for?

65
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,400
You said you wanted to kiss him. If we don't talk tonight, I'll be here again tomorrow.

66
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,440
That look of yours was such a nuisance, "I pity, pity, pity you," following me around all day.

67
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,820
It was so loud, I couldn't do a thing all day.

68
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,350
Even now. Do you want to visit my home? That look is probably still floating around there.

69
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,690
When I walk in the door, "Come in. I pity you, I pity you, I pity you."

70
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,950
So, I need to know the reason.

71
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,480
What do you mean by that? Why do you pity me so much?

72
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,390
Is this all because of that? Because I said some things you don't want to hear?

73
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,950
It's not even a big deal.

74
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,000
If it's not a big deal, why do I feel like this?

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,190
How do you feel?

76
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,080
I feel crappy.

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,650
Really? That's good. It serves you right!

78
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,570
Why? You mess with other people's feelings, but you're not supposed to feel crappy?

79
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,760
It's so ridiculous, I can't even.

80
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,360
Is that the first time you heard those words?

81
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,290
It's not a big deal, why did you come all the way here?

82
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,860
Of course, I've heard it countless times before.

83
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,300
Those words, that look.

84
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,360
How do you think I felt each time?

85
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,700
Nothing much. It didn't faze me at all.

86
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,360
Because when others pitied me, all they meant was that they were glad it didn't happen to them.

87
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,550
"Poor thing, he doesn't have parents. Good thing my children have me."

88
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,110
"My goodness, what a big scar on his arm. Poor thing."

89
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,460
"It's a good thing I don't have a scar like that on my arm."

90
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,900
But what you said doesn't translate.

91
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,440
Because you really meant what you said.

92
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,060
You sincerely pitied me, didn't you?

93
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,960
I did.

94
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,170
Why?

95
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Why are you asking me?

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,030
I must have said it because I really pity you.

97
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,970
If you have time for this, try thinking of how you treated other people.

98
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,780
It's not even a big deal, and he follows me all the way home.

99
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,330
You're home?

100
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,370
Yeah. By any chance, did you just meet up with Kim Moo Yeong?

101
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,330
Why would I meet up with him?

102
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,900
When was it that you said, "I should be friendly with him!" Never mind then.

103
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,710
Oh, if you're hungry, we have bone broth. Cho Rong dropped some off earlier.

104
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,880
Cho Rong did?

105
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,060
Yeah, his mother said to bring me some.

106
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,520
How do you like Cho Rong? He's pretty nice, huh?

107
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,880
Mind your own business. Always in everyone else's dating life.

108
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,560
Dating? Dating, dating, dating?

109
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,360
Jin Kang. Jin Kang!

110
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,220
 Because, you sincerely pitied me. 

111
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,000
 Because, you really meant what you said to me. 

112
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,430
Seriously? For real?

113
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,170
You really saw Kim Moo Yeong on the dashcam video from the night of the incident?

114
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,900
Yeah.

115
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,920
Oh! I'm totally getting goosebumps! Look at this!

116
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,130
Manager Yoo. What's up with you?

117
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,390
What?

118
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,230
You know, you said you felt weird about him from the first time you met him.

119
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,790
You said he made your heart race and he made you feel anxious.

120
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,030
For real. Can you really see things that others can't see?

121
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,560
Can you tell just by looking at criminals?

122
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,590
What do you mean?

123
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,840
Kim Moo Yeong was strangely familiar from the start. And it made me feel weird.

124
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,420
Oh, sheesh. What did Eom Cho Rong say?

125
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,210
If I'm like this, he must be totally shaken.

126
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,490
I haven't told him yet. How could I tell him when he was rushing to the ER?

127
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,310
Ah, that's right.

128
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,520
His mother was burned, wasn't she? How did it happen?

129
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,240
She burned her leg on a steam iron.

130
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,950
Oh dear.  Getting burned is hard to endure for an elder.

131
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,650
What are you planning to do?

132
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,200
I think I'll go and ask him.

133
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,330
Ask what to whom?

134
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,170
To Kim Moo Yeong.

135
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,230
You're going to go and directly ask him?

136
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,560
- Saying that you saw his face on a dashcam video from that incident? 
 - Yes.

137
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,100
Oh my gosh.

138
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,250
Then, do you think he'll easily say,

139
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,490
"Yes, I went there that night to kill someone."

140
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,130
He just might.

141
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,970
No, he really might. He's the most unthinkable person I've ever met.

142
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,520
 How did it feel when you killed a person? 

143
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,060
 It's just a fantasy. 

144
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,320
 He acts like it doesn't faze him, but 

145
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,610
 I definitely felt it. He was nervous. 

146
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,150
 I wish I could try it. Quit watching dramas. 

147
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:59,090
 Kim Moo Yeong. Where would you have put it if it were you? 

148
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,210
 Would you have put it next to the sailboat or the angel? 

149
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,080
 The angel. 

150
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,540
 But he was toying with me. 

151
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,230
 Those had all definitely fallen on the ground during the murder. 

152
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,090
 But someone put them all back exactly the way they were. 

153
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,290
 This time there were over fifty of them. 

154
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,800
 Was it the same guy? 

155
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,850
 Right? Precisely you. 

156
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,350
 Me? 

157
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,560
 It wasn't then. I only fixed Seung Ah's bracelet. 

158
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,710
 At first I thought he was only toying with me, but... 

159
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,200
 Sailboat, Rudolph, 

160
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,610
 snowman, flower, 

161
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,890
 angel. 

162
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,330
 The angel. 

163
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,340
That wasn't it. He put himself as a piece in the game he was playing.

164
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,360
Why? Why would he do something so dangerous?

165
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,290
That's why I said he's unthinkable.

166
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,990
 In the most dangerous moment, 

167
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,600
 wouldn't it arouse the biggest thrill for him? 

168
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,230
Could you deliver this to the director's office?

169
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,820
Excuse me!

170
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,560
Thank you.

171
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,030
Who was that person?

172
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,830
You're saying it was Kim Moo Yeong from Arts, correct?

173
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,900
Yes. He said Director Jang Woo Sang had this beer personally made.

174
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,690
You may go. I'll deliver this to Director Jang.

175
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,130
Yes.

176
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,840
 Beer for Wedding Anniversary
 

177
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,030
Wedding beer?

178
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,990
 from Kim Moo Yeong :)  

179
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,560
What are you doing here?

180
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,430
What the heck? Making me feel bad.

181
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,560
- Loyalty!
 - Loyalty!

182
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,280
- Are you just getting to work?
 - Yes.

183
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,540
I heard your mother was burned. Is she okay?

184
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,830
It seemed like it was a slight burn, but she still has to get a skin graft.

185
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,890
My sister and brother-in-law just came and took her to Daejeon.

186
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh dear. Oh dear.

187
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,200
But have you not seen Manager Yoo?

188
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,950
I haven't seen him since this morning.

189
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,800
- Okay.
 - Hey! Wait.

190
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,120
Don't get too excited, when you hear what Manager Yoo has to say.

191
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,760
Stay cool and collected.

192
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,160
What?

193
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,440
Did he find something?

194
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,040
Some major evidence.

195
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,590
I don't know! Hear it directly from Manager Yoo. Go.

196
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,750
Yes!

197
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,720
Is he going to be like Manager Yoo when he grows up?

198
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,560
He gets cuter and cuter.

199
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,960
 Eom Cho Rong 

200
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,570
I'll be in soon, so I'll see you then.

201
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,890
Wow, this place.

202
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,180
It's kind of romantic.

203
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,170
What brings you here?

204
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,140
Ah, that's right. Im Yoo Ri was waiting for you out front.

205
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,660
Yoo Ri was?

206
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,210
Yeah. She took off as soon as she saw me.

207
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,760
Ah. I handcuffed her a few days ago.

208
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,810
I put her in a holding cell. Didn't she tell you?

209
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,790
Why would you do that to Yoo Ri?

210
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,090
Why? She didn't show any remorse after almost killing a person.

211
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,830
I put her in there to scold her, why else?

212
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,620
Ah. That's right. Your sister.

213
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,160
But, Yoo Ri didn't have any remorse?

214
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,890
None at all. I wasn't planning to arrest her.

215
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,340
But she spoke as if it were someone else's business.

216
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,150
She wouldn't even promise not to do it again, even when I told her to.

217
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,640
Why are you laughing?

218
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,050
That's so like Yoo Ri.

219
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,720
Is it so like Yoo Ri to be that mannerless?

220
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,930
No. Not being able to lie even in that situation is so like Yoo Ri.

221
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,390
What?

222
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,430
Why are you here anyway?

223
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,250
Ah, that's right. On September 12,

224
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,420
at 2:34 am, where were you and what were you doing?

225
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,350
What did I do September 12?

226
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,320
The night Jeong Mi Yeon died at Hewitt Villa.

227
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,830
Do you still think that I killed her?

228
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,130
Yeah. And I'm going to keep thinking you killed her. Isn't this fun?

229
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,040
Who would have fun because of that? That's ridiculous.

230
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,280
What did you do that night?

231
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,620
If it was past 2 am, I was probably sleeping. At home.

232
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,260
No, you went to Hewitt Villa that night.

233
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,560
You even got splashed by a passing car on the way.

234
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,010
There aren't any surveillance cameras there, are there?

235
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:08,760
No. As you know, they were fake. As a matter of fact, I came here to ask about that.

236
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,780
If you investigate all of the nearby roads ahead of time,

237
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,400
let's say you could move only through the CCTV blind spots.

238
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,280
But that doesn't apply to inside the building.

239
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,950
If they were fake, you couldn't tell just by looking at them.

240
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,110
But how did you know? Who told you?

241
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,740
Jeong Mi Yeon.

242
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,970
Im Yoo Ri, the security guard.

243
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,790
Ahh, you're so funny!

244
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,820
Since, you brought up the dashcams along the street,

245
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,520
I just threw it out there that the surveillance cameras must be a mess.

246
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,420
You heard from Jeong Mi Yeon, didn't you?

247
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:58,930
Acting like you're joking, yet you always told the truth. Why is that?

248
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,330
Because that's the most dangerous. And the more dangerous, the more thrilling it is.

249
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,200
I did? Wow, I'm pretty awesome.

250
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,180
Thanks.

251
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:20,040
Why would you use those smarts to harm a person?

252
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,660
I don't know about the smarts,

253
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,940
but your legs look good. Why would you use those good legs to waste a trip?

254
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,940
You should leave now.

255
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,870
There's nothing to see. I'm sure you've seen a burn scar before.

256
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,620
Oh. Sorry, sorry.

257
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,160
 Jin Gook, don't be so harsh on him. You know, he also... 

258
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,760
 What about him? 

259
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,340
 He is also from Haesan. Let's not be like that when we're from the same hometown. 

260
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,350
Haesan?

261
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,160
What is that awesome evidence?

262
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,720
Awesome evidence?

263
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,780
Yes, Deputy Tak said you found something incredible. What is it?

264
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,030
Oh, that.

265
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,350
That... that isn't such awesome evidence.

266
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,790
What is it? What's captured in here?

267
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,900
It's Im Yoo Ri's black box chip. She threw it away in the field near her building.

268
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,750
Im Yoo Ri?

269
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,070
Why would this be awesome evidence when she isn't the perpetrator?

270
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,340
That case is more important but in this one Jin Kang almost got hurt.

271
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,660
But... she wasn't even remotely remorseful.

272
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,950
That is true, but—

273
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,490
I would have let it go if she would have promised to never do that again.

274
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,170
But she was so brazen and wouldn't promise...

275
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,270
What is it?

276
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,170
 Not being able to lie even in that situation is so like Yoo Ri. 

277
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:08,990
So that's why she can't make a promise? Is that it?

278
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,420
What promise can't be made?

279
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,190
Manager?

280
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,930
Manager?

281
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,890
Cho Rong, get out. Hurry up and get out.

282
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,990
Why?

283
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,820
Get out, quickly. There's no time to waste.

284
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,790
What is wrong with him?

285
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,490
Hello, I'm a police officer. Patient Im Yoo Ri who was here last Thursday night.

286
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,760
I need to see her blood test results again.

287
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,020
Yes, just a minute.

288
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,310
 Pediatric Youth Psychiatry 

289
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,550
 Sinha University Hospital 

290
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,340
 We are going out to search for a missing child. Please head over to Wonyeong 1-dong, Manager. 

291
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,920
- Go on inside. - Hello.

292
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,800
Where are you all going together?

293
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,120
Eom Cho Rong. Where are you going?

294
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,750
I'm totally disappointed. How can you call that awesome evidence?

295
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,920
Hey.

296
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,990
If he found it by straining his eyes, then it's awesome. He has presbyopia.

297
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,200
Ugh, hey! Hey! Hey! Don't you know how to thank someone?

298
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,990
Yes, I know that he has presbyopia, but...

299
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,280
What?

300
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,070
What's so great about finding the black box chip Im Yoo Ri threw away?

301
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,680
What did you say? What about Im Yoo Ri?

302
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,020
Black box chip from Im Yoo Ri's car.

303
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,520
Black box chip?

304
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,690
What is it exactly that you want to verify with me?

305
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,640
This is Im Yoo Ri's blood test result from that night.

306
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,560
I'd like to know what the sedatives listed there have to do with this case.

307
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,760
I think that Im Yoo Ri cannot remember this current incident.

308
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,750
I'm not sure. With just this,

309
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,100
there's a lot of talk about Zolpidem out there. But truthfully, Zolpidem

310
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,720
is the first thing prescribed for insomnia.

311
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,280
It's the most common sleeping pill.

312
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,040
If used as prescribed, it shouldn't cause any problems.

313
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,640
According to the emergency room intern, she took about six pills. Is that the correct amount?

314
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,930
About 10 pills, more or less, at this level.

315
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,670
Is Im Yoo Ri ...

316
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,830
a drug addict?

317
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,440
As you're aware, I can't speak about a patient's treatment.

318
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,690
I'm sorry, but it's difficult to be of any help.

319
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,950
"Together with Trauma."

320
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,800
I read your book.

321
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,200
I also know that the child referred to as Soo Jeong in Chapter 7 is Yoo Ri.

322
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,910
Kim Moo Yeong. Looking forward to working with you.

323
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,090
I put myself under your care.

324
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,410
Arts CEO Jung praised you immensely.

325
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,030
Why did you leave there, although it's good for us?

326
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,720
It's me. Where was the location of the missing child search site?

327
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,950
Wow, awesome! In Wonyeong, right now?

328
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,150
Okay. I got it. I'll be there shortly.

329
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,960
Oh my gosh. She might really fall.

330
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,560
What if she jumps? Oh my.

331
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,170
Oh no! What do we do?

332
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,990
 Are you planning to jump? 

333
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,360
 Hang out with me. I'm really fun. 

334
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,550
Lies.

335
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,130
Im Yoo Ri!

336
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,390
Don't, Yoo Ri.

337
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,890
No!

338
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,820
Yoo Ri.

339
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,380
Grab it.

340
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,130
Yoo Ri.

341
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,830
Please.

342
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,160
 Police 

343
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,340
Officer Tak, this is Cho Rong.

344
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,660
Just the basic information needs to be filled out.

345
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,050
Yes. Thank you.

346
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,750
Here. You have to write a statement.

347
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,280
All you have to write are, when, where and why you did it.

348
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,520
Also, at the end, write that you won't do it again.

349
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,820
You can do it, right?

350
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,720
It's alright. Do it slowly.

351
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm sorry, Ahjussi.

352
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,700
It's alright.

353
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,540
For now, don't think about anything and get some sleep.

354
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,080
Hey! That ...

355
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm coming over tomorrow. You know what that means, right?

356
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,480
I won't die.

357
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,100
You can't just leave.

358
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,320
How can a person be like that? How can you?

359
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,950
Why are you being like this?

360
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,090
You should have let go.

361
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,270
You held on and fell together? So you can die together?

362
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,280
I wasn't going to die. I saw the air mattress below, so I fell over.

363
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,140
Oh. You did well.

364
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,510
You would have died if the air mattress was 10 seconds late, they said.

365
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,860
Then, what was I supposed to do?

366
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,410
Should I have let go of the kid, just so I could survive?

367
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,130
That's why I said you did well!

368
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,150
Who said otherwise?

369
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,220
Hey, Tak!  Tak! Tak...

370
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,590
Don't even call my name. I won't see you again.

371
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,840
Hey, Tak! Tak!

372
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,840
She's pretty when she's mad.

373
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,380
Over there.

374
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,330
She was giving me a hard time to tell her where you live.

375
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,110
She can't even drink. And yet, she doesn't know to stop?

376
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,300
Hyung.

377
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,160
- Hui Joon,
 - Yeah?

378
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,240
Will you get me another warm washcloth?

379
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,080
Oh? What brings you here?

380
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,040
Please give it here. I took too long getting here after hearing from Seung Ah.

381
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,500
Do you know Baek Seung Ah?

382
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,060
Sit down.

383
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,560
What is it that you're telling me to come or go?

384
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,210
Is beer okay?

385
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,250
Here.

386
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,870
How does the beer taste?

387
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,410
Just get to the point.

388
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,710
Love Forever.

389
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,700
That's the name of this beer. Does it taste like love's alcohol?

390
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,330
Amber ale, alcohol content 6.4%.

391
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,090
Oh, what else did it say?

392
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,380
Oh, it says it's perfect if you drink it at 7.5 degrees C.

393
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,800
- What are you doing?
 - I'm reading you the recipe.

394
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,810
Beer for Wedding Anniversary. Love Forever.

395
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,140
The recipe for Baek Seung Ah's and your wedding beer.

396
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,000
 From Kim Moo Yeong :) f 

397
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,390
I get it.

398
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,130
Of course, firing Seung Ah's father wouldn't be enough to assuage your anger. But still...

399
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,670
First, you ask your nemesis to make your wedding celebration beer.

400
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,140
then you have him fired from his job for stealing your girlfriend.

401
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,790
Why are you so cute these days?

402
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,440
Must be nice

403
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,340
not having anything to do.

404
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,680
Kim Moo Yeong is even cuter than you.

405
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,980
He personally delivered it to the NJ Group headquarters reception desk.

406
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,810
I heard Seung Ah got dumped.

407
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,100
If you regret it, why don't you try clinging to Seung Ah again.

408
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,380
Dumped?

409
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,820
Is Seung Ah feeling better?

410
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,160
Yeah. I think so.

411
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,210
They're calm today.

412
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,460
Your eyes. They're calm today for once.

413
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,750
It's so calm that it's boring.

414
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,250
Weren't you happy to see me earlier?

415
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,320
There it is. That look in your eyes.

416
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,860
It steals your breath. Makes my heart stop.

417
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,070
Just drive. The signal changed.

418
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,430
You get out and wait over there. I'll talk to Seung Ah's mother.

419
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,670
Get out.

420
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,390
I told you to wait over there. Her mom will be mad.

421
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,350
That's why I'm saying to get out.

422
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,890
Hurry up and go.

423
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,840
Your daughter is pretty drunk.

424
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,650
Were you scared? That I might get slapped in the face by her?

425
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,080
Are you doing this on purpose? I just can't understand you.

426
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,560
What? You can't understand if I'm doing it on purpose?

427
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:38,580
You know, you always end up being good and doing the right things.

428
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,240
So why do you act like you're such a bad boy?

429
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,290
So, to you, that was being good.

430
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,500
Wasn't it?

431
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,700
What was it then?

432
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,940
What's so good about that?

433
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,450
Some days you just force yourself to do things even if they're bothersome.

434
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,510
And some days you just don't bother.

435
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,710
Don't you?

436
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,120
That in itself is being good.

437
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,910
Don't go out too far.

438
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,040
Hey!

439
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,940
Get out of the street.

440
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,530
We missed the taxi because of you. It's hard to catch one here.

441
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,020
Your renewed license will come out in 3 days.  Here's a temporary license.

442
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,670
 Manager Yoo 

443
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,730
Agh! I'm crazy, I'm crazy.

444
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,390
Hey, he's no longer in your life now.

445
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,900
Were you looking for Daddy and Mommy a lot?

446
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,990
We were so worried about you.

447
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,950
That's a relief.

448
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,730
Thank you! Thank you!

449
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,380
Say thank you and goodbye.

450
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,830
Thank you.

451
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,770
The missing child? It's a relief they found him.

452
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,950
What would have happened to the kid if they hadn't found him?

453
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,680
Ah! Choi Sang Hoon's verdict is supposed to come out today. Did you hear?

454
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,390
Did you hear...

455
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,470
Who was I talking to?

456
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,190
Why did you drink so much?

457
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,400
How did I get home last night?

458
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,170
Why do you upset your mother? You said you weren't going to see him again.

459
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,790
He brought me home?

460
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,090
Tak.

461
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,600
I'm sorry. Please give me one chance.

462
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,160
When you were going to get over it anyway. You're already over it.

463
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,790
It's mine.

464
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,850
Ma'am, this man would like a separate bottle of soju.

465
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,240
Separate tabs, too.

466
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,100
Yes.

467
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,940
He has a burn scar on his shoulder.

468
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,790
On Kim Moo Yeong's shoulder and arm.

469
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,980
Thank you.

470
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,330
Here.

471
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:49,500
Am I being sensitive again?

472
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Of course.

473
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,950
This is so ridiculous.

474
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,690
Manager Yoo, why are you like this over a scar? What's the big deal about a scar?

475
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,130
That's right, Cho Rong's mother. She has a burn scar, too.

476
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,460
It's on his right side. His right shoulder and arm.

477
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,620
At this rate, it's not just being hypersensitive. It's become an obsession.

478
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,350
Where do people get burned the most? Other than arms and legs? On the left side or right?

479
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,830
Manager Yoo, what are you really thinking?

480
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:29,610
Just because he has a scar on his arm, Kim Moo Yeong is the one at that time...

481
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,810
Is that why you hid the story from Eom Cho Rong?

482
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:41,100
About seeing Kim Moo Yeong on the dashcam video?

483
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,740
Yeah.

484
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,670
Manager Yoo, come to your senses.

485
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,040
You're a cop. What does a cop do? If there's a charge, you have to catch the perpetrator no matter what.

486
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,570
Stop thinking useless thoughts and tell Cho Rong.

487
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:03,960
That's your job. And it's a courtesy as his partner.

488
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,890
- Are you looking down on Eom Cho Rong because he's young?
 - That's not it.

489
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,220
I think I've got the wrong person.

490
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,190
What?

491
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,900
It's true that Kim Moo Yeong is involved with this case. That's for sure.

492
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,140
But, while I was fixed on Kim Moo Yeong, I missed something I should never have missed.

493
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,210
Even after looking at it countless times.

494
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,390
What do you mean?

495
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,130
Im Yoo Ri is left-handed.

496
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,540
 It's okay. 

497
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,000
Ah, I really can't believe this.

498
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,020
How did Choi Sang Hoon get a not guilty verdict?

499
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:56,110
We have do what we're told and re-investigate if they tell us to.

500
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,630
Manager. Manager.

501
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,610
Should we meet?

502
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,160
Why?

503
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,960
What are you doing? Won't you move?

504
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,390
You won't move?

505
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,850
Review everything on Jeong Mi Yeon's case.

506
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,940
Jeong Mi Yeon, Choi Sang Hoon, Geum Eun Gyu!

507
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,250
Communication records.

508
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,370
All the reference witnesses! Get out!  Get out!

509
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,540
The surveillance cameras in the area! The dashcam videos!

510
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,830
Why are you doing this?

511
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,950
I have somewhere to go.

512
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,280
Manager, if the prosecution tells us we have to formally re-investigate, isn't that good for us?

513
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,070
Now we can investigate all we want. Why won't you do it?

514
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,130
It's not that I won't, but I can't.

515
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,900
Ah, really!

516
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,970
Wait a minute, Manager.

517
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,800
Ah, really!

518
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,480
 To hear Yoo Ri's story, it's going to take some time. 

519
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,090
 And it needs to be someone she can completely trust. 

520
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:34,460
 A mother makes eye contact with her baby, smiles at her, and brings comfort when she cries. 

521
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,460
 A child grows with such seemingly insignificant things. 

522
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,660
 But they teach such extremely important things. 

523
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,760
 But Yoo Ri never had those things from the beginning 

524
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,570
 because Yoo Ri's mother never gave her any of them. 

525
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,020
Kim Moo Yeong had said that you don't know how to lie.

526
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,070
So, I'm just going to ask you.

527
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,500
You may not answer today if you don't want to.

528
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,100
I mean, so, you should,

529
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,360
but you don't have to today.

530
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,690
You actually couldn't remember, right?

531
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,520
Hitting my sister with the car that night.

532
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,060
Honestly, you knew from seeing the dashcam video, right?

533
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:40,600
That's why you said you couldn't promise me. Because you couldn't make that promise.

534
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,030
But, truthfully,

535
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,560
there's another day you can't remember, isn't there?

536
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,520
You can't be helped then.

537
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:07,520
What am I supposed to do then?

538
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,990
Let's do this.

539
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,730
They say crying is really good for your health. So cry,

540
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,410
and I'll get some sun.

541
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,770
They say the sun is really good for you, too.

542
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,920
Cry. Cry.

543
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,520
Seung Ah.

544
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,470
Get in.

545
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,160
 Is Seung Ah feeling better? 

546
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,760
 Yeah. I think so. 

547
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,220
 They're calm today. 

548
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:11,320
 Your eyes. They're calm today for once. They're too calm that it's boring. 

549
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,390
 You were really happy to see me earlier, weren't you? 

550
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,360
 There they are. That look in your eyes. 

551
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,960
 It steals your breath. Makes my heart stop. 

552
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,260
 Just drive. 

553
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,320
Seung Ah, it's normal to feel upset.

554
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,680
It's easy to get the wrong idea. But it's not. He was just joking.

555
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,200
I upset him a few days ago...

556
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,690
 Do you perhaps like Jin Kang? 

557
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,300
 Yes. 

558
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,160
What about you?

559
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,400
Do you also like him?

560
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,930
Seung Ah.

561
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,160
Since when?

562
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,750
Why are you running away?

563
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:40,970
That's crazy. Why would I run away?

564
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,570
I heard you saved Yoo Ri.

565
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,530
What do you mean I saved her?

566
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,410
Thank you.

567
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,330
- Ahjussi.
 - What?

568
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:58,370
But why did you lie to me?

569
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,640
L... Lied?

570
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,160
- You said you didn't know any cops in Haesan.
 - Huh?

571
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,160
You're from Haesan.

572
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,200
But do you really not know any cops?

573
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,390
There aren't any.

574
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,570
You must have had a late start, becoming a cop.

575
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,530
Right.

576
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,700
That's a pity.

577
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:49,030
 Yoo Jin Kang 

578
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,000
Yeah?

579
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,220
 Where are you? Come out right now. 

580
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,860
You said to meet a long time ago. I've been waiting forever.

581
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,550
What's your deal?

582
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,740
What?

583
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,710
Why did you tell Seung Ah such a thing?

584
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,560
Seung Ah.

585
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,760
- Kim Moo Yeong.
 - I'm not going to talk about Seung Ah with you anymore.

586
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,280
Kim Moo Yeong.

587
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,140
This is my home.

588
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,780
The roof at the very top.

589
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:48,160
Leave after having some cake. It's my birthday today.

590
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,130
Why did you do it?

591
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,520
It's my birthday, and it's sad to spend this one day alone.

592
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,160
Tell me. Why did you do it?

593
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,440
Because it's the truth.

594
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,220
I have fun when I see you, and it's not boring.

595
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,170
I like it a lot.

596
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,440
How could— How could you say this right now?

597
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,490
I'm hungry. Are you really not going to eat?

598
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,760
Okay. Come if you change your mind.

599
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,320
You're welcome until I blow the candles out.

600
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,710
Go and tell Seung Ah that it's not true. That it was a joke.

601
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,270
Do you know what you've ruined?

602
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,480
It may be just a joke to you, but to me...

603
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,970
Go tell her it's not true.

604
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,450
Okay.

605
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,880
"It's not true. It was a joke."

606
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,700
"I did it because I love you so much."

607
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,060
"I thought I would be able to forget you like that."

608
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,400
What are you doing?

609
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,960
I get it now.

610
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,300
Why you are such a pitiful human.

611
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,390
Is that so?

612
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,980
Because you don't have a heart to begin with.

613
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:41,390
That's why you can play around with people's feelings as you please.

614
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,890
Then you don't feel bad when you ruin them.

615
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:47,850
You sit back and watch, and then feel good when you win.

616
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:51,270
That's why you don't know why you're so pitiful.

617
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,710
I'm sorry.

618
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,690
Yoo Jin Kang.

619
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,120
Do you know why you're so mad that you don't know what to do?

620
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,000
Because you know full well.

621
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,220
Because you already knew that I wasn't joking with what I said to Seung Ah.

622
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,470
Tell me.

623
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,050
Have you not thought about me?

624
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,910
No.

625
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,740
Have you never missed and wanted to see me?

626
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,840
No.

627
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,090
You weren't happy when we met by chance?

628
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,680
No.

629
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,490
Are you absolutely sure,

630
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,300
you don't have any feelings for me?

631
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,620
No.

632
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,760
Okay.

633
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,470
Is it pitiful not to have any feelings or is it pitiful to ignore the feelings you do have?

634
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,810
I'd rather not have feelings.

635
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,350
 Looking for Missing Child 

636
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,890
 Height 110 cm, weight 20 kg
Short hair, egg-shaped face
Burn scars on right shoulder and arm... 

637
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,820
 Went missing: 11-9-93 15:00
Location: Haesan... 

638
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:56,240


639
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,240
♬   I know you'll be my home   ♬

640
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,690
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

641
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,480
 Stop! 

642
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,230
 How could you beat a person?! Why are you beating him?! 

643
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,520
 How do you spend your time? 

644
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,330
 Doing bad things. I feel like doing bad things whenever I see you. 

645
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,380
 What were you thinking to go up against that kind of person? 

646
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,010
 Are you worrying about me? If you are, then do it properly. 

647
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:24,080
 That's right. Isn't she your woman? Yoo Jin Kang? 

648
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,270
 You look good together. 

649
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:28,280
 If you bother him one more time, I'll kill you. 

650
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,380
 Let go. 

651
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,640
 I don't know if it's love or not yet. But let's go for it.
