00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,980
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes  


2
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,900
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,140
 Give it back to me. 

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,580
 Give it to me! Come on! Hand it over! 

5
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,390
 Oh! 

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,290
 Post Office 365 

7
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,560
 He's really something, that Ajussi. 

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,500
 Episode 12 

9
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,680
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but has a man come by looking to buy a wine opener?

10
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,350
Ah, that young man. He left immediately when I told him We don't have a wine opener.

11
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,380
Has a man come by looking to buy a wine opener?

12
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,780
 Oh, the wine opener, yes. He came by earlier. 

13
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,800
 When? How long has it been? 

14
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,190
 About 50 minutes. I think it's been that long ago. 

15
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,720
Excuse me? Excuse me?

16
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,060
Oh, my! Are you okay? Excuse me?

17
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,490
Oh, hold on. Hold on. Hey there. You ...

18
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,190
It's been a while.

19
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,980
Moo Yeong? Moo Yeong! Wake up, Moo Yeong! Hold on.

20
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,610
Just hold on, Moo Yeong.

21
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,800
You...

22
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,790
Moo Yeong! Stay here for a second, just hold on.

23
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,660
-  Hello, this is 119. 
 - Yes, 119?

24
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,980
 - Yes, hello. Please tell me, sir. 
- Moo Yeong!

25
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,650
For now, I think it would be better if you go home and wait.

26
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,540
There's no one in the district by the name Kim Moo Yeong who was reported in today.

27
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,630
But I definitely heard a siren in the area.

28
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,800
Oh, that!

29
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,460
A drunkard assaulted a taxi driver and raised a ruckus briefly.

30
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,360
Oh...

31
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,820
 Letter of Resignation 

32
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,020
 Yoo Jin Gook 

33
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,710
You're here?

34
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,030
Yeah.

35
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,360
 Letter of Resignation 

36
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,990
Where are you?

37
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,940
 You? 

38
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,880
 Letter of Resignation 

39
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,420
What's this annoying thing from early in the morning?

40
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,540
I'm the culprit of yesterday's incident at the Wonyeong crossroad.

41
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,150
Incident at the Wonyeong crossroad? Hey, didn't we already catch the culprit?

42
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,470
Yes, they got him at the scene.

43
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,300
Why would people bother taxi drivers so much?

44
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,620
The other incident. At the crosswalk in front of Wonyeong crossroad at 9:30 pm.

45
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,950
I stabbed someone with a knife.

46
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,820
Hey, go check on what was reported in yesterday.

47
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,430
There should be nothing. I checked earlier when I came to work and there was nothing significant.

48
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,560
I'll check again.

49
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,810
With a knife?

50
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,850
Yes. Really, what in the world is going on?

51
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,110
Hyung Jin Mi checked and he says there's nothing that was reported.

52
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,530
Where's Manager Yoo?

53
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,570
I don't know. He is not in the office.

54
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,210
Shall I look into what is going on?

55
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,920
No. Let me hear what Manager Yoo has to say first.

56
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,790
Okay.

57
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,920
What are they taking about?

58
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,460
That you stabbed someone? Is that true?

59
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,100
Yes.

60
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,050
I stabbed that jerk with a knife.

61
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,080
Manager Yoo!

62
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,680
Are you insane? You're a police officer! How could a police officer—

63
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,170
No, how could  you  stab someone?

64
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,250
There was no other way.

65
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,190
No other way? You're crazy! How could this be the way?

66
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,980
My goodness. Ah, seriously! You!

67
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,110
You are not in your right mind. You know that?

68
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,910
Are you feeling sick?

69
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,490
No, I'm fine.

70
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,020
You keep dripping cold sweat.

71
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,290
I'm back!

72
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,320
You're here.

73
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,710
- CEO...
 - Yeah, what is it?

74
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,060
I'm really sorry, but can I leave early today?

75
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,070
Leave early?

76
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,830
She looks like she's been sick from earlier.

77
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,150
Really? Then you should've stayed home and gotten rest. Why'd you come?

78
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,740
We're past our rush season. Go home quickly.

79
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,050
I'm sorry.

80
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,910
He didn't show up without notice, so we're in a difficult position too.

81
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,150
If you get in contact with him, please tell him to call us.

82
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,310
Okay, I understand.

83
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,230
Unni, it's Jin Kang.

84
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,640
Oh, Jin Kang?

85
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,070
 Kim Moo Yeong has disappeared. 

86
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,960
Kim Moo Yeong?

87
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,210
He suddenly didn't come home last night.

88
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,460
I didn't know what else to do.

89
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,300
Bye, Ji Eun. I'll see you next week.

90
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,980
Goodbye!

91
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,530
Bye. Yes.

92
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,010
 What happened? 
Call me when you see this. 

93
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,270
 You must've been so surprised. 

94
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,450
  But I haven't heard anything about an incident.  

95
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,920
  Don't worry and just stay calm. I'll look into it.  

96
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,370
Are you feeling better?

97
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,710
Yes.

98
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,710
How could you scare someone like this?

99
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,080
What time is it?

100
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,610
It's ten. What exactly happened yesterday?

101
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,350
This is night?

102
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,010
Ah, 10 o'clock...

103
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,820
 010367843 

104
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,410
Hello?

105
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,610
Hey, it's me.

106
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,410
Hello?

107
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,630
What's wrong with you?

108
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,210
I'm sorry. You were worried, weren't you?

109
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,510
I'm sorry. I'm at a friend's house.

110
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,030
It had been a long time since we last saw each other.

111
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,880
A friend's house?

112
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,120
Do you really expect me to believe you?

113
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,370
You went out to buy a wine opener and even left your cell phone here.

114
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,110
I know it's weird.

115
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,160
It's really nothing. I'll explain everything later.

116
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,460
Tell me, right now. What's going on?

117
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,050
Are you hurt somewhere?

118
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,460
No, it's nothing like that. I called because I knew you'd be like this.

119
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,050
I'm not hurt or anything, so you don't need to worry.

120
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,420
Really, why are you like this?

121
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,210
What's going on?

122
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,630
Huh?

123
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,710
I know it's hard for you to understand, but it's really nothing.

124
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,100
It's really a friend that I haven't seen in a while, so I can't leave him right now.

125
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,790
It's so hard to be like this.

126
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,650
Really hard.

127
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,260
Jin Kang. Yoo Jin Kang?

128
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,630
Your clothes are not dry yet. Lie back down.

129
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,820
It's been 20 years since I sutured someone.

130
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,110
If you just move like that, the stitches are going to burst. Lie down.

131
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,350
Now that you're at my house, stay until I tell you that it's okay to leave.

132
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,860
Otherwise, I would have to call 911. I know that you are involved in a criminal case.

133
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,900
If it weren't for that, I would've taken you to the hospital whether you stopped me or not.

134
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,400
There we go.

135
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,670
It looked like a wound from a knife. What happened?

136
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,510
Perhaps, is it relevant to that incident?

137
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,540
Yoo Ri and you. That case.

138
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,750
No, nothing like that.

139
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,260
Then?

140
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,200
I came here because I didn't want to say things like that.

141
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,920
How did you know? About that incident?

142
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,110
I met the detective in charge coincidentally when I was visiting You Ri at jail.

143
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,340
How do you know each other?

144
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,330
I guess, ultimately, it would be because of you.

145
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,150
But which detective?

146
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,350
- Detective Yoo Jin Gook.
 - Ah.

147
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,360
Why? What about him?

148
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,270
No, just...

149
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,700
Interesting.

150
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,630
Do you happen to know that detective personally too?

151
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,630
A bit? That man and I. How do I put this?

152
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,200
We're not enemies, but we're not friends. That kind of relationship.

153
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,030
I'm here.

154
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,910
Has he contacted you?

155
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,450
That guy?

156
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,120
Do you know anything about it?

157
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,300
Sit down.

158
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,530
You know something, right?

159
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,660
Do you know what happened to him?

160
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,740
I got a call from him, but he won't tell me what happened.

161
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,460
I...

162
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,620
stabbed him with a knife.

163
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,000
What?

164
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,370
I said I stabbed him.

165
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,860
Oppa!

166
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,700
I don't regret it. It was the only way.

167
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,720
You're crazy.

168
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,600
How could you stab a person with a knife?

169
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,850
I can stab things greater than a human.

170
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,930
I can do worse things. So,

171
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,570
stop seeing him.

172
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,120
You're crazy.

173
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,250
You're crazy, Oppa.

174
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,830
To me, you're first.

175
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,030
Don't say that it was because of me. He got hurt because of people like you.

176
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,770
People who didn't care about what happened to other kids,

177
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,920
because their own kids are so precious. He got hurt by those people.

178
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,740
Oppa, you know.

179
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,170
Oppa, you shouldn't be like this. Because Oppa, you're my brother.

180
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,790
I don't know about other people, but you can't do things like that because you're my brother!

181
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,450
Oppa, he's a really pitiful guy.

182
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,280
He grew up in circumstances far worse than mine.

183
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,740
He already has lots of wounds and scars. You don't need to add on to that!

184
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,850
Wash up and get some sleep

185
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,180
 Tak So Jeong 

186
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,490
 I'm at Encounter Food Tent. 

187
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,590
 If you don't come here, I'm going there, just so you know. 

188
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,020
 Take care! 

189
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,560
I got a call from Jin Kang today.

190
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,690
I had no words for her.

191
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,340
It took everything in me to pretend I didn't know.

192
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,050
Did you at least find out how he is?

193
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,150
He took a taxi.

194
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,860
Are you even curious? Are you at least worried?

195
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,580
No. I have nothing to say for myself for what I did.

196
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,060
Oh boy! Since when were you so vicious?

197
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,140
I went to the control center and saw the surveillance video.

198
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,450
 You can't tell it was a knife. It just appeared like he stumbled because he was drunk. 

199
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,990
 He took a taxi a little later, but I haven't checked yet where he went. 

200
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,950
Do you want me to check for you?

201
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,290
He contacted Jin Kang.

202
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,470
What did he say to Jin Kang?

203
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,700
I didn't ask. I just heard that he called her.

204
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,050
Don't say it.  You didn't tell Jin Kang, did you?

205
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,800
Did you?

206
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,460
That you stabbed him?

207
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,650
Oh, Manager Yoo...

208
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,360
Hey, you— Oh my...

209
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,970
 Tell me, right now. What's going on? 

210
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,160
 Are you hurt somewhere? 

211
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,280
 No, nothing like that. 

212
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,530
 I 

213
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,510
 stabbed him. 

214
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,890
 I'm not hurt or anything, so don't worry. 

215
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,770
 How could I explain the relationship between him and me? 

216
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,560
 We're not enemies, but we are not friends, either. 

217
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,860
 Truthfully, it's a little unexpected. I didn't expect you to know that Moo Yeong grew up on Haesan. 

218
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,290
 No, I just happened to find out that his hometown was Haesan. 

219
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,870
Yoo Jin Gook, Yoo Jin Gook...

220
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,480
Hello?

221
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,320
Hello.

222
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,250
Umm ... I know it's late, and I'm sorry.

223
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,060
I got a call from this number earlier.

224
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,190
 By any chance... 

225
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,550
Oh, you were talking about Moo Yeong, right?

226
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

227
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,920
 But Moo Yeong is asleep right now. 

228
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,720
Oh, is this a hospital?

229
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,930
This isn't a regular hospital, but I am a doctor.

230
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,890
Okay.

231
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,740
I'm Kim Moo Yeong's friend, Yoo Jin Kang.

232
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,690
I heard he was hurt badly and was wondering if he was okay.

233
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,210
Yes, he was hurt, but he's not in a dangerous state.

234
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,610
 He needs to be monitored to make sure his wound doesn't fester. 

235
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,130
 But it isn't serious, so you need not worry. 

236
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,860
Okay.

237
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,670
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

238
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,450
Yes, I'll have Moo Yeong call you in the morning.

239
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,440
- You said your name was Yoo Jin...
  - Oh, no! 

240
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,630
It's okay.

241
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:10,110
I'm sorry but,  please don't tell him that I called. 

242
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,670
Yes, of course.

243
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,460
Yes, thank you. I'll let you handle it, then.

244
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,070
Yoo Jin Kang.

245
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,490
Yoo Jin Gook.

246
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,900
I thought about it and you should decide between two options.

247
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,800
What decision?

248
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
You said this, didn't you?

249
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,180
Ever since you met him, you felt like something was strangling you.

250
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,550
It's true. You've become strange ever since he appeared.

251
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,130
I was on edge worried that something bad would happen,

252
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,150
and in the end, it did. A police officer stabbed someone!

253
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,670
It can't get worse than this.

254
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,160
So, either you confirm if Kim Moo Yeong is the person you've been looking for,

255
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,770
or if you can't, then just forget about it.

256
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,170
Make a decision.

257
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,540
How could I forget?

258
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,610
How?

259
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,900
You said Kim Moo Yeong is the child who is in chapter 2, didn't you?

260
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,330
Do you know what the title of chapter 2 is?

261
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,680
A kid who lost his memory.

262
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,850
A kid who lost his memory?

263
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,760
Yes.

264
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,310
It means Kim Moo Yeong can't remember his childhood.

265
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:01,810
At some point, you believed Kim Moo Yeong is the child you've been looking for, didn't you?

266
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,590
But nothing has been confirmed. Everything is just speculation.

267
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,080
And even if Kim Moo Yeong is that kid,

268
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,210
he can't remember anything.

269
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,630
As long as you forget, you can live pretending it never happened.

270
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,130
Jin Kang won't be able to date Moo Yeong any longer.

271
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,940
Then everything is solved.

272
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,730
You just have to forget.

273
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,650
 It's so hard to be like this. 

274
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,350
 So hard. 

275
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,270
 Myeongseong University Haesan Hospital 

276
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,440
 Kiddo. 

277
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,650
 Moo Yeong? 

278
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,750
 Moo Yeong! 

279
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,850
What were you dreaming about?

280
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,740
I left your clothes over there.

281
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,460
I'll be back up in about an hour.

282
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,100
Doctor.

283
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,520
Do you know anyone at Haesan Hospital?

284
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,070
Haesan Hospital?

285
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,780
Yes. Myeongseong University Haesan Hospital.

286
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,160
Since you were at the same Myeongseong University, I feel like you might know a doctor there.

287
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,850
I'm sure there is if I look into it. But why?

288
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,410
I feel like I was there.

289
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,880
Really?

290
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,360
Do you remember something?

291
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,790
I'm not sure, but

292
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,220
I think I was caught in front of the hospital.

293
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,620
I'll look into whether there's a colleague I know at Haesan Hospital.

294
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,610
Are you really quitting?

295
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,180
Hey, come see me.

296
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,750
How have you not changed a single bit from then?

297
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,020
No matter how much I dig, they say there isn't a case like that.

298
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:12,030
Alright. Like you said, while you were going around like a crazy person,

299
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,490
let's say you did in fact stab him.

300
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,210
So let's say that you can't do this job anymore because of your conscience.

301
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,610
Okay, that's you. But

302
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,760
then what becomes of us?

303
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,020
It's already bad because of the Jeong Mi Yeon case.

304
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,940
What do you think you're doing?

305
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,610
Let's just be honest here. You should feel really sorry for me for

306
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,110
what you did back then.

307
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,880
- I'm sorry. 
 - If you're sorry then—

308
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,730
Be quiet and stay put.

309
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:00,380
D-Do you think I'm keeping a hold of you because I like you?

310
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,950
If you're going to resign, do it somewhere else! Please!

311
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,520
Don't wipe your sh*t on me! Got it?

312
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:41,220
  I can stab things greater than a human. I can do things much worse.  

313
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,530
 So stop seeing him. 

314
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,760
 Sympathy and Healing 

315
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,270
 Where did the picture go? 

316
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,150
 I asked where the picture went. 

317
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,050
 Did you get rid of it because of my brother? Because you didn't want to see him? 

318
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,880
 I put it away because of you! It's right here. 

319
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,410
  You put it away nicely.  

320
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,260
 So adorable! 

321
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,410
 It's too hard to be like this. Too hard. 

322
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,400
Why are you out here when it's cold?

323
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,750
 Yang Gyeong Mo 

324
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,990
  Kid, where are you going?  

325
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,590
Doctor, was it you?

326
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,520
The one who grabbed me that day at Haesan Hospital?

327
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,600
You asked me.

328
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,800
Asked me where I was going.

329
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,010
 With Trauma 

330
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,650
 Chapter 2
 The Kid Who Lost His Memory 
 To imagine his past 

331
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,370
Yes.

332
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,450
Why? Why didn't you tell me?

333
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,900
Because if I were planning on doing that, I wouldn't have let you go.

334
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,160
Let me go?

335
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,840
Yes, on purpose.

336
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,740
On purpose.

337
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,530
Whether it be fortunately or unfortunately, you lost your memory,

338
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,930
and I knew that you had lost your memory.

339
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,270
  I first met the kid, Myeong Ho, by the lake.  

340
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,330
  I had quit my internship and was stuck in the countryside, spending my time fishing,  

341
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,330
  so it was before I began to study pediatric psychiatry. 

342
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,250
  While I was releasing the fish I had caught that day and was turning back,  

343
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,490
  I met the eyes of a young boy who was staring at me.  

344
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,340
  His eyes made my heart drop.  

345
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,030
 They were bright, yet empty eyes.  

346
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,560
I could recognize you even though it had been three years.

347
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,520
Your eyes were unforgettable.

348
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,000
Three years?

349
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,590
That's right. But I still couldn't believe that I had met you,

350
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,180
  so I looked at your arm. For a burn scar.  

351
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,170
 Doctor! 

352
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,310
I was the one who treated your burn.

353
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,790
So ...

354
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,340
You didn't first see me at Haesan Lake.

355
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,370
That's right. After it had been three weeks since I started treating you,

356
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:04,470
I saw you leave the hospital when you weren't even done getting treated.

357
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,370
 Hey, kid! 

358
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,550
When I saw your eyes, as empty as a blank white sheet of paper.

359
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,030
 Where are you going, kid? 

360
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,660
I thought that it might be the last chance.

361
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,530
The last chance?

362
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,800
Your last chance to be completely

363
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,100
free of your past.

364
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,980
Wow. I guess my past was just that horrible.

365
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,850
So horrible that you would let a young boy

366
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,850
who has lost his memory to leave the hospital on his own.

367
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,590
To think that that was the last chance.

368
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,460
Please tell me about my past.

369
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,760
I have to go see a patient.

370
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,960
Let's stop here for today.

371
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,800
I don't think that you must know your past. So let's give it some thought.

372
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Both you and I.

373
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,460
You did well.

374
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,630
 Looking for a missing boy 

375
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,220
Yes?

376
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,150
I won't see that person anymore.

377
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,580
Okay.

378
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,000
 Mail Delivery
 To: Kim Moo Yeong 

379
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,790
 I'm sorry. 

380
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,660
 Please forgive my brother. 

381
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,540
You startled me.

382
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,480
You're home today. This is a registered mail so...

383
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,380
Kim Moo Yeong?

384
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,050
Please sign here.

385
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,340
If you're here because of Moo Yeong, then he left not long ago.

386
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,030
I'm glad to hear that he was here.

387
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,180
I thought you came knowing that. What brings you here?

388
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,790
I'm sorry. I came without contacting you.

389
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,330
No, it's good that you came.

390
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,810
I have a few appointments left. Would you like to go in a wait a little bit?

391
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,750
- Yes
 - Okay.

392
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,590
 Wonyeong Mart 

393
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,600
It's you, right?

394
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,950
It's really you!

395
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,390
Have you been okay?

396
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,510
Meow!

397
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,320
Meow!

398
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,080
I've caught you, Meow!

399
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,420
Where did you go without saying anything?

400
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,060
Your hyung was looking for you and was worried about you.

401
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:39,170
♬   How much time has passed? Do you remember me?   ♬

402
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:47,030
♬   Walking on the disarray of time.   ♬

403
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:54,280
♬   I believe in a miracle at the moment of coincidence   ♬

404
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,120
♬  The laughter and the pain inside there,  ♬

405
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,100
It's really you.

406
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,850
Where did you go?

407
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,910
♬   The seasons may quickly pass and circumstances may change   ♬

408
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,290
Were you having fun without me?

409
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:14,090
♬   By giving the season we can remember, again we're able to   ♬

410
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,350
It's okay.

411
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,230
You can go whenever you want to.

412
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,060
♬  There's no way that I can know ♬

413
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,070
But if you want to come back,  then come back anytime.

414
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:31,390
♬  When I face you, I lose my way  ♬

415
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:39,530
♬   As if waking from a long dream, my heart becomes mute   ♬

416
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:46,750
♬   And then the tears rise up within me   ♬

417
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,850
It's fine now.

418
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,390
Go.

419
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,800
Where?

420
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,490
Where can I go?

421
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,420
You said you would stop me.

422
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,980
You said you would stop me the next time I said I was leaving.

423
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,210
I won't go anywhere. I can't.

424
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,320
Anyway, there is no use going.

425
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,260
Because I'll come back again.

426
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,890
♫   There's no way for me to know   ♫

427
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,990
♫   All of sudden when I see you,   ♫

428
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,590
♫  Somehow, I lose my way  ♫

429
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,810
♫  As if awakening from a deep dream  ♫

430
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:31,880
♫  My heart becomes sad, my dear  ♫

431
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,430
I thought you would say that we should break up.

432
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:50,080
I told my brother that I will break up with you.

433
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,190
That I would never see you again.

434
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,820
I lied.

435
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,930
If I really could break up with you, then I would have.

436
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,580
But there's no use in trying.

437
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,730
If you don't tell me that you hate me, then I'm not going anywhere.

438
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,680
Even if I tell you that I hate you, don't go.

439
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,030
You would say that you hate me?

440
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,360
I'm telling you not to go, no matter what.

441
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,370
Because it's a 100% lie, even if I say that I don't like you.

442
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,000
Why would you lie like that?

443
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,490
I won't.

444
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,320
- Don't!
 - I won't!

445
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,110
I said don't.

446
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,960
I won't.  I won't ever.

447
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:12,010
But...we really have to see each other in secrecy now.

448
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,400
I don't have the confidence to see my brother going further into ruin.

449
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,700
I have total confidence...to see you in secrecy.

450
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,130
Then me too.

451
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:48,280
This is the child I was looking for...

452
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,170
 Yoo Jin Gook 

453
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,690
 Burn Injuries
 Officer Yoo Jin Gook 

454
00:48:54,690 --> 00:49:00,150
I thought the name was familiar. You're the police officer from back then.

455
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,550
Excuse me?

456
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,890
 Have you perhaps seen a child this tall with a burn mark on the right side? 

457
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,000
 I haven't seen him. 

458
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,900
The fall of 1993, I was also at the Haesan Hospital.

459
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,120
Haesan Hospital emergency room, first-year intern.

460
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,470
You're going to escort me home?

461
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,000
And yet, you said you're totally confident to see me in secrecy.

462
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:00,820
- I'll text you.
 - Okay

463
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,770
I'm planning to take a leave from work momentarily.

464
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,190
- Are you going to quit?
 - Yes.

465
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,550
I'm still being investigated, and there're things I want to look into.

466
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,860
I thinking the doctor knows something about me.

467
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,320
What about you?

468
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,530
About my past. But he won't tell me.

469
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,100
Why is he not telling you?

470
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,840
I don't know.

471
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:38,940
Maybe it's... not so great? My past.

472
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,190
Not so great?

473
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,140
What if

474
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,190
it's so bad that it would be better off not knowing?

475
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:00,870
Better off not knowing?

476
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,110
Bad...

477
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,520
No, don't think about it.

478
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:18,230
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.

479
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:26,800
It's my problem. You don't need to think about it.

480
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:35,360
If it's something bad that it really is better off not knowing?

481
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,260
I would rather you not know. Actually.

482
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,060
Just follow where your heart leads you.

483
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,590
There might be things about me that I don't know.

484
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,680
It's okay.

485
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,810
Because I'm going to hold on tightly to your heart.

486
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,560
Instead, promise me.

487
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,920
That you won't disappear again without telling me.

488
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,080
That you'll make sure to carry your cellphone.

489
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,670
And that you'll never get hurt.

490
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,750
I promise.

491
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:34,330
♬   I like it even if it's only two of us in the dark night  ♬

492
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,760
♫   Let’s close our eyes together,   ♫

493
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,260
♫   star, us  ♫

494
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,190
It's late. I need to go before my brother comes home.

495
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,380
Byebye.

496
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,560
You're home? It's late.

497
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,970
What are you doing this late at night?

498
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,610
I'm deep cleaning so it's totally sparkling.

499
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,620
If you're hungry, there's bread on the table. Have some.

500
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,200
Okay.

501
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,980
I can't help that I'm so curious.

502
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,200
What is it? This incredible past of mine that you know?

503
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,470
Should we start with some tea?

504
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,680
My father was murdered, wasn't he?

505
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,480
Murdered?

506
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,630
Yes. With a gun.

507
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,050
A gun? Where would a gun be? It's not some movie.

508
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:05,630
From some point, I've been having this recurring dream.

509
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:09,960
A dream that my father is being killed by a gun.

510
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,720
I thought it must be from my past.

511
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,770
Thanks to you, I am well prepared.

512
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:22,590
So tell me. My father was murdered, wasn't he?

513
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,310
No. Your dad

514
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,260
committed suicide.

515
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,590
Suicide?

516
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:44,700
To be exact, he fell from a mountain. But they say it was suicide.

517
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,420
Why did he commit suicide?

518
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,810
I don't know.

519
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:59,210
If it were you, would you be able to stop here?

520
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:02,570
I've never stopped anything that I've started.

521
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,810
Suicide.

522
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,950
 I don't know about anything else, but I've never heard of a gun. 

523
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,020
 i don't know the details either. 

524
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,400
 I only heard what the nurses said. 

525
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:34,310
 That you're the son of the man who committed suicide on Geumah Mountain. 

526
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,840
 Geumah Mountain 

527
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,720
 Are you awake yet? 

528
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,450
 Are you going to work to turn in your resignation? 

529
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:18,050
 Yeah. I'm on my way home from meeting with the doctor. 

530
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:21,020
 I'm planning to grab the stuff I need to return to work and then go. 

531
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,090
 Already? 

532
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,290
I'm going to go first. There will be traffic so I can't drive you.

533
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,890
Oh, it's okay. I can go in a little late today.

534
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,830
Have a good day.

535
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,020
- You too!
 - Yep.

536
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,990
 You already came back? What did they say? 

537
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,860
 I'm not sure yet. I'll tell you later. 

538
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,750
 But, do you know my name? 

539
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,510
 Your name? 

540
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:15,890
 Yes. My real name. 

541
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:25,110
 I'm trembling a bit. What's your name? 

542
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,880
 Seon Ho. 

543
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:43,050
 Is Moo Yeong Seon Ho? 

544
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,130
 Yes. 

545
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,880
 Seon Ho. 

546
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,460
 My name is Kang Seon Ho. 

547
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,530
Kang Seon Ho.

548
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,390
Kang Seon Ho.

549
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,840
 Moo Yeong is Kang Seon Ho. 

550
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:33,410


551
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:40,270
♫  I know you'll be my home someday.  ♫

552
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:45,820
♫  Someday will come again  ♫

553
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:53,130
♫   I know you'll be my home someday.  ♫

554
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:58,040
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

555
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,560
 If it were you, would you be able to stop now? 

556
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,280
 I've never stopped anything that I've started. 

557
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,100
 What more do you think is left? 

558
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,970
 A gun. 

559
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:07,950
 A gun? 

560
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,400
 It concerns only your father.  Something that had nothing to do you with you. 

561
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,180
 It has nothing to do with me. 

562
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,280
 But why do I feel like it explains a lot about me? 

563
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,440
 Someone told me once, that I'm not human, but a devil. 

564
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,640
 Are you really okay if this is how I am? 

565
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,790
 Of course. 

566
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,070
 I want to be born again. 

567
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:33,910
♫  I'm holding onto a heart which can't be filled again  ♫
