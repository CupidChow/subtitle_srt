1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:08,220


2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,310
 Seo In Gook 

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,300
 Jeong So Min 

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,300
 Park Seong Woong 

5
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,000
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,790
Stop right there.

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,150
The moment you open that door, I'm going to make a phone call

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,980
to your beloved younger sister.

9
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,320
Oh my. Did you actually love her?

10
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,490
I guess it's true.

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm a bit angry.

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,350
What should I tell her first?

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,330
Don't worry, child. Apparently, Kim Moo Yeong loves you.

14
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,400
He's going to love you until he dies.

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,350
Why did he leave you if he loves you that much?

16
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,460
Because he's your brother.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,070
Oh, my. You really didn't know anything, did you?

18
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,780
Did you, perhaps, sleep together not knowing that?

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,950
Oh, my. You really slept together?

20
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,770
 Final episode 

21
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,740
Kim Moo Yeong.

22
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,370
Was it really

23
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,740
your doing?

24
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Why the hell would you... kill someone?

25
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,510
I didn't come out to talk about that.

26
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,350
Then what?

27
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,020
Jin Kang.

28
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,850
She can live like she does now, right?

29
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,180
Jin Kang?

30
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,690
Yes.

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,100
Like now. And in the future too.

32
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,900
What do you mean—

33
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,860
Is what happened today related to Jin Kang?

34
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,990
No, it's not like that.

35
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,690
Thanks.

36
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,350
I came to tell you that.

37
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,930
What are you grateful for?

38
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,400
My sibling Yoon ...

39
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,180
for protecting her.

40
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,800
Your younger sibling Yoon? Yoon?

41
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,290
Jeong Yoon? Jin Kang is your younger sib—

42
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,190
No, no way.

43
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,560
Who said that? How is Jin Kang your younger sibling?

44
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Jin Kang— You don't have a younger sibling. Kang Soon Goo only had one child, you.

45
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,950
Who the hell said that kind of...

46
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,160
I guess not.

47
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,560
  Why are you asking me if you came here already, knowing everything?  

48
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,050
  It's true. Yoo Jin Kang is yout real younger sibling whom you have been searching for,  

49
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,730
  the one you've been looking for so hard. She is truly your biological sister.  

50
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,860
What's your name?

51
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,190
Yoo Jin Kang.

52
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,100
Your resident registration number?

53
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,510
900407-2819518.

54
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,480
What's your relationship with Kim Moo Yeong?

55
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,990
I was his girlfriend.

56
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,560
I'm his girlfriend.

57
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,560
  Manager Yoo. You're going to Dowon Police Station to get Jin Kang, right?  

58
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,930
  Yeah.  

59
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,130
  I think you need to know this.  

60
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,800
  What?  

61
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:27,480
  Jin Kang. She knows that she's not your real sister.  

62
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,170
  What?  

63
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,620
  She said she knew since she was in middle school.  

64
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,180
When did you know that Kim Moo Yeong killed Jang Se Ran?

65
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,250
Did he really kill her?

66
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,130
Then do you think he didn't?

67
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,740
No. I don't think so.

68
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,330
Wake up and smell the coffee, will you?

69
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:05,390
Do you think he's just a suspect because the news keeps saying he's a suspect?

70
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,550
Kim Moo Yeong is already the perpetrator here. His identity is already confirmed.

71
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,140
J-Jin Kang!

72
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,140
Huh? I said you didn't have to pick me up.

73
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,350
- Get in.
 - Okay.

74
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,610
They didn't give you a hard time?

75
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,520
No. I just answered whatever I knew.

76
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,690
  She knows that she's not your actual sister. She said she knew since she was in middle school.  

77
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,780
  What should I say if you say that?  

78
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,610
  I feel so sorry to you. What should I say, huh?  

79
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,970
  My adolescence. Do you know how my adolescent years were?  

80
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,800
  I felt so sorry for you, Oppa. Just seeing your face,  

81
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,700
  watching your back, made me so sorry that I felt like I couldn't breathe.   

82
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,050
 That was my adolescence. 

83
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,690
Oppa.

84
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,070
What?

85
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,420
If everybody says so, it's correct, right?

86
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,480
What is?

87
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,330
Kim Moo Yeong.

88
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,770
They all say that he killed her.

89
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,890
  Jin Kang knows about that too. You and Kim Moo Yeong's father.  

90
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,420
  You're saying that Jin Kang knows about Kang Soon Goo?  

91
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,150
  Sorry. I told her. But I had no other choice.  

92
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,330
  She already knew half of it.  

93
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,640
Jin Kang. Your name

94
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,950
is Jeong Yoon. Han Jeong Yoon.

95
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,970
I'm sorry. That I didn't tell you earlier.

96
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,130
First, let's find Moo Yeong. Then

97
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll tell you everything you need to know.

98
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,680
  Wake up and smell the coffee, miss.  

99
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,650
  Do you think that Kim Moo Yeong is just a suspect because the news keeps saying that he's a suspect?  

100
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,390
  Kim Moo Yeong is already the perpetrator here.  

101
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,500
  Do you want to ask your brother, Yoo Jin Gook, about it,  

102
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,310
  25 years ago,  

103
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,790
  what happened between your brother and Kim Moo Yeong.  

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,100
  Oppa didn't dislike the kid.  

105
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,360
  He felt sorry for him and fearful of him.  

106
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,360
  Your oppa made him die.  

107
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,780
  Who is Jin Kang? If she isn't my sister, then  

108
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,750
  why is Jin Kang in my memories  

109
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,640
  and in my picture of my family?  

110
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,300
  Because you cared for Jin Kang.  

111
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,710
  You loved and cared for her more than you would a family member.  

112
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,830
  I did?  

113
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,660
  That's right. Jin Kang's name is Han Jeong Yoon.  

114
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:25,760
  She had a name, but she had no birth certificate even when she was 4.  

115
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,230
  Jin Kang's parents were obsessed with a cult.  

116
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,090
  Jin Kang's parents persuaded your mother,  

117
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,120
  and your mother left the house with you and even the house deposit without her husband knowing.  

118
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,990
  So that's why Dad did that to Mom.  

119
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,350
  That's right.  

120
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,540
  And killed Jin Kang's parents.  

121
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,770
  Jin Kang. 

122
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:16,000
 She's the daughter of Han Jong Soo and Park Jeong Hae, the ones your father killed.  

123
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,980
  Jin Kang can continue living without knowing like now, right?  

124
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,010
  Her past?  

125
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,230
  Promise me. That she can live like she does now.  

126
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,630
  Then it's all good. I'll be leaving.  

127
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,180
  Turn yourself in.  

128
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,420
  Let's go. Turn yourself in. That's the only way.  

129
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,210
  I'm so furious.  

130
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,730
  It's like something has toyed with me for so long  

131
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,300
 that I just can't hold my anger in. 

132
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,540
  I need to give it some thought.  

133
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,570
  Moo Yeong.  

134
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,560
  It's not your fault, Ahjusshi.  

135
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,160
  It's not your fault, Ahjusshi, and neither is it the doctor's fault.  

136
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,820
  Ahjusshi, you can't fight and defeat me anyway.  

137
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,370
  You haven't been able to win once because you felt so sorry for me.  

138
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,210
  Just give me three days.  

139
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,730
  I'll contact you after three days.  

140
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,010
 Will 

141
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,510
No, Moo Yeong, no!

142
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,670
Jin Kang.

143
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,750
What are you doing there?

144
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,380
Oppa, why did you do that to him?

145
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,940
Huh?

146
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,750
Why did you stab him that time?

147
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,220
Huh?

148
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,760
Oppa, you said that you felt sorry for him, not that you disliked him.

149
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,420
If you felt sorry, you should've said sorry.

150
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,830
If you felt fearful, you should've asked for forgiveness.

151
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,440
How could you... stab him with a knife?

152
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,350
Alright.

153
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,610
Alright, I was in the wrong.

154
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,060
Yeah, you were.

155
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,250
Yeah.

156
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,590
Oppa, he isn't the person you knew from before.

157
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,890
He said to me, that he would like to be born again, so why would he kill a person?

158
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,770
I don't believe it. Unless I hear it directly from him, I won't ever believe it.

159
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,100
Oppa, for me,

160
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,250
this isn't something like a cold.

161
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,930
This isn't something that I can just suffer with for a little bit and then get over.

162
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,880
I don't think I can live without him.

163
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,710
I think I'm going to die without him.

164
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,310
Don't worry.

165
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:10,560
Oppa will find Kim Moo Yeong. Oppa will find him for sure.

166
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,830
Don't worry.

167
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,250
Don't worry, don't worry.

168
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,900
I should've stopped him no matter what.

169
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,090
When he found that that his father was a murderer, I saw that the fury and disappointment he felt

170
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,990
turned into hatred for himself.

171
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,710
So if he did commit murder, he would not be able to stand himself.

172
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,650
So we must find him.

173
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,870
We will find him.

174
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,990
Yes. I'll go check once more the places where Moo Yeong might be.

175
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,710
Thank you, Professor.

176
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,130
 CEO Jang Il Geos, who has lost both his eldest son, Jang Woo Sang, followed by his eldest daughter, Jang Se Ran 

177
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,520
 could not hide his sorrowful face 

178
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,350
 as he left the airport without answering a single question from the reporters. 

179
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,580
Jin Kang!

180
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,600
Oppa isn't here.

181
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,760
I know. I visited the office and came here for a little bit to see you. I wondered how you were doing.

182
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,390
I'm fine.

183
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,070
Jin Kang, have you changed the passcode to the main entrance?

184
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,860
No.

185
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,690
- Let's change it now. 
 - The passcode?

186
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,600
Manager Yoo kept saying he would change it, but never did, making me so anxious.

187
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,360
Now I'm finally relieved.

188
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,280
Is it done?

189
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,190
It's not a birth date or any number related to a personal information, is it?

190
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,920
Unni. Is it because of Kim Moo Yeong?

191
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,670
Huh?

192
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,480
Actually,

193
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,010
Kim Moo Yeong has come into your home before.

194
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,180
Home? Our home? Here?

195
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,070
Yeah. He came twice, without anyone knowing.

196
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,080
Once, he came holding a gun.

197
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,300
A gun?

198
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,200
I don't think something like that will happen, but just in case.

199
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,390
Perhaps... was it because Oppa did that to his father?

200
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,610
When?

201
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,860
  The day you told me to come here to eat dinner because you had to work overnight.  

202
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,130
 So Jeong Unni 

203
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,860
  Until what time is work tonight?  

204
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,710
  If it ends really early, 10?  

205
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,540
  A police officer rotates, right?  

206
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,600
  Yeah. It's weekly.  

207
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,920
  There are a lot of police officers who are busy during weekends and holidays, but  

208
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,900
  not my brother. He rests no matter what.  

209
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,420
  - When are his off-days? 
- This month, it's the 4th, 8th, and 12th. Multiple of 4 days.  

210
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,090
 Then he must work during the daytime today. 

211
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,110
You came because of Oppa Moo Yeong, right?

212
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,050
Well, it makes sense. Even I was shocked out of my wits after watching the news.

213
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,360
Yoo Ri, do you think he killed Jang Sae Na?

214
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,420
How about you, Unni?

215
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,870
I can't believe it.

216
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,360
I think he killed her.

217
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,020
Oppa ... he can do whatever he puts his mind to.

218
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,900
Once he decides on it, he'll do something even worse.

219
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,410
  Why is food so important?  

220
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,140
  You said you wanted to be reborn.  

221
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,010
  Yeah, and?  

222
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,230
  Then you have to live in a warm home.  

223
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:25,100
  In a warm home, there's the scent of warm rice.  

224
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,140
 I'll eat well. 

225
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,350
 In the midst of a difficult interrogation ... 

226
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,190
  But if he killed a person,  

227
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,850
  isn't Kim Moo Yeong just being Kim Moo Yeong?  

228
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:15,500
  Oppa doesn't touch anyone who hasn't done something bad.  

229
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,790
Driver, I'm sorry, but could you go to Dowon Police Station?

230
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,450
 As a countermeasure, he revealed that they will enforce the search and seizure warrant for the NJ Group executive assistant office. 

231
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,300
He's coming out!

232
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,800
Please make a comment!

233
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,820
Chief Secretary, it's Yoo Jin Kang.

234
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,310
Chief Secretary Choi, what did you say to him?

235
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,480
Chief Secretary Choi! You know!

236
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,170
Chief Secretary Choi, what did you say to him? Where is he?

237
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,010
Chief Secretary Choi!

238
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,650
Chief Secretary Choi!

239
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,360
Chief Secretary Choi!

240
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,700
 CEO Jang 

241
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,040
Yes, President.

242
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,810
  You were neglected children.  

243
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,060
  The adults were crazy about religion,  

244
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,860
  and you took care of Jin Kang then.  

245
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,660
  To Jin Kang, you were her whole world.  

246
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,280
  I guess that's why Jin Kang stopped talking after you went missing.  

247
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,640
  Even when she came to our house,  

248
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,160
  it took over three months.  

249
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,210
  She sat on the floor, looking at the main gate, all day long 

250
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,470
and cried when the sun set, and cried again.

251
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,950
  When I thought she might've placed her heart with us,  

252
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,040
  if she saw a boy around that size, she followed him like crazy.  

253
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,330
  Why, why? It's okay. It's okay.  

254
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,270
  You did that.  

255
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,930
  You were the one to place love into her heart.  

256
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,440
 It would be nice if it's true.  

257
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,890
 Although I can't believe it.  

258
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,870
  The burn scar on your right shoulder  

259
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,600
  is the evidence.  

260
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,530
  When your father fell forward because of the gun I shot,  

261
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,810
  perhaps it was because of the sound of the gunshot,  

262
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,890
  but Jin Kang, who had been playing in the yard, came in.  

263
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,630
  Jin Kang, who didn't know anything, knocked over the stove  while running in,  

264
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,000
  and the kettle that was boiling on top toppled over.  

265
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,370
  You  

266
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,300
  protected Jin Kang  

267
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,740
  from the boiling water that was coming her way.  

268
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,480
  By throwing your tiny body over her.  

269
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,930
  That's why your burn scar now  

270
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,470
  is bigger than Jin Kang's.  

271
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,600
  How impressive.  

272
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,410
 That ugly scar. 

273
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,450
  I'm sorry.  

274
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,430
  that I did that to you.  

275
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,720
 Why are you crying? 

276
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,010
 Are you crying because you're sad, or because you're happy? 

277
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,390
 Because I'm happy. 

278
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,830
 About what? 

279
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,600
 The sky. 

280
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,370
 The sky? 

281
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,300
 Yeah. 

282
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,070
 It's so pretty. 

283
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,000
 Why didn't I realize it before? 

284
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,010
 The world 

285
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,250
 is full of so many pretty things. 

286
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,040
 Yeah. 

287
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,910
 I don't know. 

288
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,550
 I heard 

289
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,960
 we were here a long time ago. 

290
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,780
 Really? 

291
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,550
  heard I was really good to you back then. 

292
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,730
 Really? 

293
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,090
 Yeah. 

294
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,330
 If you knew all about it, then you'd want to be filial toward me. 

295
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,360
 Filial? 

296
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,120
 I'll do that. 

297
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,810
 So, 

298
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,460
 let's live a long, long time together. 

299
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,160
 Kim Moo Yeong. 

300
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,670
 I went to my house. 

301
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,300
 You went to your house? 

302
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,250
 The house you grew up in with your family? 

303
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,690
 Yeah. 

304
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,860
 Where? How did you find it? 

305
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,620
 Just. 

306
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,130
 Passing by. In the woods. 

307
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,020
 In the woods? 

308
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,280
 Yeah, like the house in the picture. 

309
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,450
 Like the house in the picture. 

310
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,730
 Mt. Geumah, Jeolgudae 

311
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,100
 Mt. Geumah, Jeolgudae 

312
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,090
 I'm lying. 

313
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,320
 I'm just saying that I felt a house like that would be there as I was walking. 

314
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,120
 What the? 

315
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,870
 I was about to be happy for you, thinking you found it. 

316
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,060
 It would have been nice if I had found it. 

317
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,420
He had found the house.

318
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,300
 Go Korail
 General Ticket 

319
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,930
 Departure: Seoul
 Arrival: Haesan

323
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,820
 Tragedy Produced by Cult
 Enraged by his wife who was into cult, he killed three devotees, including wife  

324
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,480
 Nov 1, 1993. Murder case at Mt. Geumah 

325
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,450
 Culprit: Kang Soon Goo 

326
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,750
 Victims: Lee Mi Young, Han Jong Soo, Park Jeong In 

327
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,910
 The culprit was upset about his wife falling for the cult, leaving home with their son. 

328
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,870
 He finds the cult members' hideout and goes and murders his wife and the other couple devotees. 

329
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:15,660
 The culprit Kang Soon Gook is shot to death by Haesan police officer Yoo Jin Gook onsite. 

330
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,730
 Kang Seon Ho, son of Kang Seon Goo, was sent to Haesun Hospital for a burn injury. 

331
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,320
 Han Jung Yoon, daughter of Han Chong Sook and Park Jeong Ae 

332
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,470
 was sent to Haesun Hospital for a burn injury. 

333
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,020
Jin Kang?

 Mt. Geumah Jeolgudae 
5:35 (Moogoonghwa Line)
 8:36 KTX 

335
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,720
 Mt. Geumah Jeolgudae 

336
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,500
 The customer is not answering the call, 

337
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,140
Hello?

338
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,600
 Excuse me, 

339
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,180
 is this Officer Yoo Jin Gook? 

340
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,620
Speaking.

341
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,700
 I'm a guy who knows Moo Yeong. 

342
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,280
Yes, go ahead.

343
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,810
 He told me to be sure to call you in three hours, 

344
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,910
 but I felt too anxious. 

345
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,900
 He told me to tell you to go where you first met Kang Seon Ho. 

346
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,370
 He said you would understand. 

347
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,460
 In order to say what I want to say, I should probably finish what I need to say first. 

348
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,780
 I don't feel wronged by the things you said. 

349
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,140
 If being heartless is being a devil, then I really was like that. 

350
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,160
 I don't know exactly why. 

351
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,910
 I always thought people were strange. 

352
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,110
 The strangest things made them happy, while other strange things made them sad. 

353
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,870
 And they would get angry at the oddest things. 

354
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,950
 Do you understand what I mean, Kim Moo Yeong? 

355
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,040
 Some days I hated people. 

356
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,780
 And some days they were interesting. 

357
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:46,000
 If I wanted to touch something, I did. And I just sat back and watched at other times. 

358
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,250
 I fought when people picked fights. 

359
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,090
 So just take million dollars and get off. 

360
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:55,190
 During those times, I had no interest in Yoo Ri or Seung Ah. 

361
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,890
 Don't get caught. 

362
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,560
 Because I knew that I would win in the end. 

363
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,750
 Jin Kang told me to become a good person. 

364
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,000
 Promise me you'll be a good person. 

365
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,050
 Teach me how. 

366
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,140
 I wanted to become a good person, but 

367
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,890
 Wanted: Murder Suspect for Shooting the Victim 

368
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,690
 I became a murderer instead. 

369
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,790
 Although nobody would understand, I wanted to at least say this. 

370
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,510
 I'm regretting it. 

371
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,450
 Regret? 

372
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,840
 Are you composing an apology? 

373
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,280
 I tried to ruin things 

374
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,850
 but I was only ruining myself. 

375
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,920
 I was wrong. I'm asking this of you. 

376
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,250
 Please don't mess with them. 

377
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:24,130
 I truly felt like I was human that day. 

378
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:28,390
 While I was feeling more like human than ever before, I killed someone, 

379
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:33,050
 and because of that, I realized that my life is also over. 

380
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,480
♬  As though waking from a long dream  ♬​

381
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,530
♬  I am overwhelmed with sadness.  ♬​

382
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,670
♬  Then my tears well up  ♬​

383
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,080
 Yoon! 

384
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,410
 Yoon! 

385
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,120
 I'm hungry. 

386
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,810
 You're hungry? 

387
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,110
 Just a moment. 

388
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,930
 (Indistinct praying) 

389
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,680
 We pray to you... 

390
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,320
 We pray to you... 

391
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:01,260
 Yoon, how many peanuts do you want to eat? 

392
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,600
It's impressive that you came all the way here.

393
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,230
I have a question to ask you.

394
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,790
You got this because of my brother, didn't you?

395
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,270
Yeah.

396
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,660
To kill my brother?

397
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,370
Yeah.

398
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:02,330
- You went to my house with this gun, didn't you?
 - Yeah.

399
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:08,520
And you asked how late my overtime would be,

400
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,400
and asked about my brother's shifts, all because of this, right?

401
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,370
Yeah.

402
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,520
Were you really planning to kill my brother?

403
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,380
Yeah.

404
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,610
But I couldn't kill him, because someone showed up.

405
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,610
And that's why you told me to break up, right?

406
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:41,550
Because my brother killed your father.

407
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,800
Yeah.

408
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,500
Is there anything more to add?

409
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:01,700
What other lies do you have prepared besides these?

410
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:09,650
With such mean expression, saying, "Yeah, yeah."

411
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,230
What is it that you're trying to hide by it?

412
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,140
There's no such thing.

413
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,110
What are you doing?

414
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,760
This will kill someone, won't it?

415
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,980
That's not a toy.

416
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,680
Exactly.

417
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,760
Don't aggravate me. Give it here.

418
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,850
Because I'm sorry towards you.

419
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:01,670
Since my brother caused your father to die, I feel bad.

420
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,300
I'll die instead.

421
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,830
Give it here.

422
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,400
Tell me you won't kill yourself.

423
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,380
Give it here.

424
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,610
This is your last chance.

425
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,840
Promise me you won't kill yourself.

426
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,310
Yoo Jin Kang!

427
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:46,430
Are you out of your mind? Do you really want to die?

428
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:51,280
No. I want to live.

429
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,140
I want to live with you.

430
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,520
Kim Moo Yeong.

431
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,400
Go.

432
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,000
I won't leave alone.

433
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,020
Your father killed my parents, didn't he?

434
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,070
It made me scared when I heard it.

435
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,650
Both that my parents died that way,

436
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,470
and it was because of your father's doing,

437
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,810
that's how I realized it.

438
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:46,560
When you found out my brother killed your father,

439
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,650
you must have felt this way.

440
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,980
That's why you spoke to me that way, right?

441
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,080
 You are just you. 

442
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,070
 What? 

443
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:12,760
 No matter what happens, to me you are just you. 

444
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,420
To me, you are just you as well.

445
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,850
I killed a person.

446
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,380
All you have to do is turn your self in.

447
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,010
Accept the punishment and start over again. It'll be alright.

448
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,400
I came too far

449
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,790
and I can't turn back.

450
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:47,570
I just want to... die as I am.

451
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,530
You are really terrible.

452
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:57,410
You are really horrible.

453
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,120
Then, what about me?

454
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,070
What about me?!

455
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,410
Go back.

456
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,920
To where?

457
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,130
Before you met me.

458
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,300
But we were together from the beginning?

459
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,500
This was me.

460
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,810
If you die, I'm going to die too.

461
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,130
From the start, I existed because you do.

462
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,150
Can I really go somewhere alone?

463
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:26,110
Do you still want to die when I'm like this?

464
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,990
No.

465
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,300
I want to live.

466
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,020
Jin Kang!

467
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,740
Jin Kang!

468
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,070
I love you.

469
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,100
 I love you, too. 

470
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,980
I love you.

471
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,520

472
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,220

473
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,310

474
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:58,230

475
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,290

476
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:06,190

477
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,120

478
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:14,210


479
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,560
Jin Kang!

480
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,170
Why?

481
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,530
 Goodbye, Ajussi. 

482
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,820
 Stop being apologetic to me now. 

483
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,560
 Twenty five years is just too much.

 November 22, 2018 

485
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:07,900
 Kang Seon Ho. 

486
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,930
 P.S. 

487
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,310
 One day in the afternoon,  

488
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:34,160
 I was longing for something so I left. I walked and walked and walked some more. 

489
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:38,700
 I collided, bumped, and encountered... 

490
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,370
 I'm sorry. Are you alright? 

491
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,020
 I arrived at Jin Kang's side. 

492
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,600
 I'm sorry. 

493
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,580
 No wonder. 

494
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,410
 What do you mean, "no wonder"? 

495
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:51,650
 No wonder you don't look that pretty. That's why. 

496
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,340
 Excuse me. Do you know me? 

497
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,550
 And... 

498
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,180
 No. Not at all. 

499
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,360
 I was able to breathe again. 

500
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:13,650
♬   A star that you cannot see in the sky    ♬

501
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,100
 You came. 

502
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,480
 Yup. I'm here. 

503
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,270
♬  A star which is living inside of me     ♬

504
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:30,680
♬  Even if it is just the two of us in the dark night, I like it.     ♬

505
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:37,240
♬   Close our eyes together    ♬

506
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,620
♬    The star is us   ♬

507
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:51,300


508
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,110
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

509
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:09,210
♬   Light your light warm and shining    ♬

510
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:18,880
♬   Light My light makes me breathe    ♬

511
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:27,280
♬  On a dark day you brighten      ♬

512
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,720
♬    we close our eyes together   ♬

513
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,790
♬   The star is us.    ♬
