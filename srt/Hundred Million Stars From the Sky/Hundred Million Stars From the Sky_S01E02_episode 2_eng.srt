1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:10,610


2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,740
 He had an unusual gaze about him. 

4
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,540
 Kim Moo Yeong 

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,540
  Let's go. 

6
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,930
  Chief, it is a murder case. 

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,300
 It appears that the fall of victim Jeong Mi Yeon was because someone deliberately pushed her. 

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,950
 Have we seen him somewhere before? 

9
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,160
 Excuse me! Do you know me? 

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,710
 No, not at all. 

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,500
 Excuse me. Just keep your promise. 

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,680
 I don't want to keep it. The promise. 

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,010
 You did it deliberately, didn't you? 

14
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,020
 I wanted to see you. 

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,220
 Really? 

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,140
 Should I let you in on something? 

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,990
 Can someone really remember everything after seeing it only once? 

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,600
 - You fixed it.
 - Isn't it the same one? 

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,270
 He remembers everything after seeing it just once. 

20
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,010
 What ever happened to that boy? 

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,200
Thank you. 
   Episode 2 

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,700
Somehow I'm already finished with dinner and dessert.

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,360
You don't have to finish that if you don't like it.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,990
I'm savoring it because it tastes good.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,140
Savoring?

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,290
If you eat it like that, it dissolves and doesn't taste very good.

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,480
Why are you so impatient, as if you were a puppy needing to poop?

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,590
Me?

29
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm not. No, I'm not.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,900
Cho Rong, how about some nammaek?

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,220
Nammaek?

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,840
Sounds good. Yes, yes, let's.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm still not finished with this.

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,330
You can take all the time you want.

35
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,360
What? You're not taking me along, Kids?

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,160
Cho Rong! Jin Kang!

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,750
 You were at fault. 

38
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,660
You're making me sadder.

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,500
Are all youngsters like this these days?

40
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,700
 Why are you so dense? 

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,910
 Once you've done the introduction, you should get out immediately.  The kids will take it from there. 

42
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,500
- Is that it?
 -   Where are you? Do you want me to hang out with you? 

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,650
No! No! I'm in front of my house.

44
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,650
I'm almost home. Almost there.

45
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,330
 What the heck? Don't tell me  you did not get the hint and are following them? 

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,470
Am I crazy?

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,190
Am I that crazy? To have no pride?

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,010
By the way,  what is nammaek?  Nammaek?

49
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,000
But will you be okay? I haven't been able to try these last five.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,300
Of course. What should we start with?

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,750
This one?

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,690
Cheers.

53
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,950
But, in order to design, do you really have to taste all of these?

54
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,550
Yes.

55
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,480
Product design makes

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,530
people wonder what this is.

57
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,930
So, I need to feel it first for things to turn out well.

58
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,060
That's a true professional!

59
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,160
- I  personally also very much believe that. 
 - Yes.

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,940
What else should we try?

61
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,340
- How about this one this time? 
 Yes, this one.

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,370
Oh god, oh god.  Those two are just going crazy.  Are they just going to drink?

63
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,220
This was a surprising turn of events.

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,480
What?

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,230
I came out tonight without any expectations

66
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,820
because you're Manager Yoo's sister.

67
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,320
Do you really dislike my brother that much?

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,070
No, no. That's not what I'm saying. That is ...

69
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,970
I thought you'd be like a grandmother.

70
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,270
A grandmother?

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,940
So, I didn't expect such a young sister,

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,620
and because you're his sister, your looks...

73
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,240
Heol! I totally look like my brother though.

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,560
No, not at all. You don't look alike at all.

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,180
That sounds strangely like a compliment.

76
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,160
It totally is.

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,170
But, do you still call my brother "Manager Yoo"?

78
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,680
No, no.

79
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,500
That ... Oh, that's a nickname, right?

80
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,830
So, our Manager Yoo...

81
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,860
Officer Yoo is such a good person.

82
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,170
It's okay. I already heard everything from Tak Unni.

83
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,100
You heard?

84
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,890
That's a relief.

85
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,270
But, this is also strange.

86
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,510
Don't you think Manager Yoo is secretly a martial arts master?

87
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,180
- He makes people shiver at least once. 
 - I doubt it.

88
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,160
No way! I can't imagine my brother catching bad guys.

89
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,140
He never has anything interesting to say.

90
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,170
Do you like hearing about catching murderers and scary stuff?

91
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,880
Of course, I do.

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,300
- Then should I tell you some from time to time, when we meet? 
 - Yes!

93
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,020
- Then should we date? 
 -  Pardon?

94
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,930
I didn't say that right, you and I... So what I mean is,

95
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,430
I'd like to start something with you. Officially.

96
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,870
So, what y-you're saying is,

97
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,100
you'd like to start something with me. Officially.

98
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,310
Yes.

99
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,490
- Casually.
 - Casually.

100
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,790
We can eat out and watch movies and play dating games.

101
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,910
Everything you've never done. Anything.

102
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,930
All the things you've wanted to do, all of it!

103
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,460
Oh, I'm sorry!

104
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,670
- Are you okay? 
 -

105
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,770
- I'm okay. 
 - Please wipe it up quickly, quickly.

106
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,490
- Jin Kang, are you okay? 
 - Yes. I'm okay.I'm okay. I'm fine.

107
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,870
Here you go.  Here. Use this to wipe up.

108
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll do it. I will. It's okay, I'm fine.

109
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,400
- Are you okay?
 - Yes, I am.

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,100
- I'll go to the restroom. 
 - Yes.

111
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,730
Just a moment.

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
Seriously.

114
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,520
  H... Hello. 

115
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,700
  Stay still. 

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,190
- Why... 
 - I told you to stay still.

117
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,530
  Why are you doing this? 

118
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,470
  I told you to stay still! 

119
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,370
Did you have a fun time without me?

120
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,260
I think I drank too much.

121
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,450
Yeah, why were the drinks all lined up like that ...

122
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,000
lined...

123
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,100
What did Eom Cho Rong say?

124
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,460
Were you rejected by him, too?

125
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,470
Mind your own business.

126
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,440
What business?

127
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,270
  Your manners are good! 

128
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,860
  I can't have manners? 

129
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,540
  I can't be a super rich! 

130
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,630
They say that technique has improved a lot. Is there a way to completely get rid of it?

131
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,800
What?

132
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,940
- (That.) 
- Oh.

133
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,860
Why? It gets cuter the more you look at it.

134
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,890
Cute, my foot.

135
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,840
Look. You start liking it the more you look at it.

136
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,140
Liking it? Yeah, right. Move over!

137
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,800
What is that? I've never seen it before.

138
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,570
It's nothing.

139
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,830
 Arts Since 2007 

140
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,530
Does it make sense that it's cute and she's attached to it?

141
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,060
Maybe it really doesn't matter? Jin Kang is relatively easy and carefree.

142
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,780
Listen to this. When Jin Kang was in middle school, she secretly saved up money to get rid of that scar.

143
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,830
So we finally went to the hospital and even had the surgery scheduled.

144
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,070
Then suddenly, on her own, she wouldn't go through with it.

145
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,230
Why not?

146
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,670
That's what I don't know. She's been like that since then.

147
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,170
She says it's cute. That she's attached to it.

148
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,100
That's a weird way to live.

149
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,530
But does it concern you that much?

150
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,430
Of course, it does.

151
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,930
Maybe she's okay, but her in-laws or other people might be turned off.

152
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,620
She already doesn't have parents. To have a scar on her arm.

153
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,050
Seriously.

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,870
You're already worrying about her in-laws.

155
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,930
He's coming, he's coming. Eom Cho Rong. Eom Cho Rong.

156
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,130
What is it? Are the DNA results out?

157
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,090
It's 99.9% a match for Choi Sang Hoon.

158
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,390
Then all you have to do is catch him. Has Interpol put out a "Wanted"?

159
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,240
Yes, he's dead meat.

160
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,330
Then hurry up and report back. Everyone is waiting.

161
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,560
-Yes. Loyalty!
 - Loyalty!

162
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,230
Aren't you going?

163
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,010
-  I should go. 
 - Let's go.

164
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,950
Chief, I have an apartment.

165
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,610
I still have a lot of loans, but an apartment is an apartment. In any case, I have an apartment.

166
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,210
So what?

167
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,920
True.

168
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,660
Strangely, since earlier,...

169
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,550
I've been wanting to say that.

170
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,880
He said he has an apartment. Why do I find this so funny?

171
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,590
He must like Jin Kang. Oh my.

172
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
You're here?

173
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,450
Were you waiting long?

174
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,970
I just got here, too.

175
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,890
Ah, I'm so hungry! What should we eat?

176
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,950
- Unni Jin Kang, 
 - Yeah?

177
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,480
- Do you have anything to give me? 
 - Hmm?

178
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,600
Earlier Director Hwang called. Don't leave things out when they're important.

179
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,850
Oh, that. I didn't want to burden you pointlessly.

180
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,110
Who cares about a burden? This is your life on the line.

181
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,890
It' not my entire life, but it is a pretty important matter.

182
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,910
Oppa Woo Sang makes the decision on this?

183
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,390
This time, Woo Sang purchased a lot of Arts company shares.

184
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,350
Since he's a major shareholder anyway.

185
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,990
- Arts? 
 - Yes.

186
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,820
You didn't know?

187
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,420
I don't know much about that stuff.

188
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,240
It must be urgent then.

189
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,870
A bit. It was already happening. Why?

190
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,300
Nothing. I've been avoiding Oppa Woo Sang lately.

191
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,070
But I'll have no choice but to see him for your sake.

192
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,750
Because of me? Hey.  Forget it then! It's okay—

193
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,720
I'm kidding.

194
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,850
It's for the best. I have to see him once anyway.

195
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,600
Did something happen between you and Woo Sang?

196
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,670
Unni, I want to introduce you to someone.

197
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,940
Someone you want me to see?

198
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,190
He's here.

199
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,460
This is Moo Yeong, my boyfriend.

200
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,970
- I told you about Jin Kang. My closest friend. 
 - Yeah.

201
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,580
It's nice to meet you. I'm Yoo Jin Kang.

202
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,120
- Why are you doing that? 
 - Huh?

203
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,830
Don't you remember or are you pretending to not remember?

204
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,170
Is this really the first time meeting me?

205
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,230
We've met three times already.

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,300
Today's the fourth time.

207
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,980
Really? When?

208
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,420
Was yesterday the last time?

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,970
At a pub in Itaewon. It was more like running into each other.

210
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,920
Arts Pub? You've been there?

211
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,570
Yeah. I had a date.

212
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,210
A date?

213
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,680
My brother was... You know my brother.

214
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,760
- Did Oppa Jin Gook set you up? 
 - Yes.

215
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,910
You looked good together.

216
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,690
Really? What is he like?

217
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,500
What does he do?

218
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,160
Just...

219
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,770
What should we eat?

220
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,380
You should hop in. He said he would drop you off after me.

221
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,680
There's no need to trouble him.

222
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,620
No, Moo Yeong lives in Wonyeong, too. Right? Where did you say?

223
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,870
No, no. Seung Ah, Wonyeong is really big.

224
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,890
It's probably far. Bye now!

225
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,790
Take care.

226
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,530
What is it?

227
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,700
Can you give this to just anyone like this?

228
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,000
I can give it to just anyone because it's this. I made this one myself.

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,830
It's pretty.

230
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,220
What is this? You didn't kiss me.

231
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,940
The audience is too big.

232
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,760
You didn't know. I don't care anymore about that now.

233
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,230
Her? So that's why she was hanging around you.

234
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,800
Jin Kang isn't someone who deserves to hear that from you.

235
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,590
You're pretty when you're mad. I'll let it go because you're pretty.

236
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,550
Never mind. She won't approve of doing it this way.

237
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,060
Let's go to Japan next week.

238
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,230
It's better to make things clear, right? For your sake, too.

239
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,770
Let's stop meeting.

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,500
What?

241
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,220
There is someone I like.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,400
I like him much more. I came to tell you that.

243
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,390
- You're dating?
 - Yeah.

244
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,800
It's my first love.

245
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,220
First love?

246
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,220
Why are you so cute?  Seriously.

247
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,980
I'm leaving.

248
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,930
Go ahead and date.

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,700
One cute and pretty date. It doesn't seem so bad.

250
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,480
Go ahead. Just don't sleep with him.

251
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,070
Date?

252
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,850
Hello.

253
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,240
Hello.

254
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,950
Did you get home okay the other day?

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,970
Here. Thank you.

256
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,050
You could have just kept it.

257
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,930
That's okay.  See you, again.

258
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,340
You must live nearby.

259
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,720
Well, yes...

260
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,750
Wonyeong must not be that big after all.

261
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,650
I guess not.

262
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,760
It's the weekend, aren't you going to see Seung Ah?

263
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,150
She said she's going to visit her grandmother.

264
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,360
Yes, Cho Rong.

265
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,450
Are you free tomorrow night?

266
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,800
Would you like to see a movie with me?

267
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,240
Yes. No, I wanted to see that movie, too.

268
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,140
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

269
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,820
Okay

270
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,230
It looks like you're finally dating.  Officially.

271
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,220
Coolly...  Eating and watching a movie together. What else did he say?

272
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,620
And play dating games.

273
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,990
What's so funny?

274
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,950
Are you mad?

275
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,450
Yes, I'm mad.

276
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,180
What are you doing now, eavesdropping?

277
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,290
I only heard because I could hear. And I saw what I saw.

278
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,600
Since we keep running into each other. Sorry if you're upset.

279
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,340
Excuse me.

280
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,450
You said you saw me three times, didn't you?

281
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,550
Once was at Seung Ah's exhibition. And once was

282
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,690
when you loaned this to me at the beer house.

283
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,360
Then when was the other time?

284
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,750
No matter how much I think about it, I can only remember two times.

285
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,470
You're wrong.

286
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,330
You're doing this deliberately, aren't you?

287
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,570
What?

288
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,650
To pique my interest.

289
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,430
- Ey.  No way.
 - Then when was it?

290
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,800
A long, long time ago. Somewhere...

291
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,300
some place.

292
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,060
Like,

293
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,050
like a long, lost sister?

294
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,100
A cute, little sister?

295
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,000
- How old are you?
 - Same as you.

296
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
How old am I?

297
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,360
I don't know.

298
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,290
I think I get it now.

299
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,910
You're someone I'm seeing for the first time, and I don't really know you,

300
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,120
but I didn't have a good feeling from the start.

301
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,130
I know what kind of person you are.

302
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,450
You're presumptuous and think you can do whatever you want,

303
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,970
messing with people wherever you go.

304
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,560
You mistakenly think all women like you, don't you?

305
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,930
You're a jerk.

306
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,950
Am I?

307
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,720
Probably so. Although, you would know better.

308
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,580
Ajussi, wait! Just a moment! I'm sorry.  Just a moment.

309
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,820
It's okay. I can do it.

310
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,510
Do you want to keep it?

311
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,850
Are you going to keep it?

312
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,310
Have you raised one before?

313
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,920
Not really.

314
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,710
Here! Your hoodie!

315
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,550
Keep it!

316
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,410
Through various infrastructures and lots of experience,

317
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:45,160
we promise you ideas and designs that finally go to branding.

318
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,490
Wow, wasn't that nice?

319
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,610
This is great.

320
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,410
Aren't these all of our beers?

321
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,960
That's correct. For the last month, while preparing for the presentation,

322
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,930
these are the beers I've bought with my own money and drunk.

323
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,120
Initially, I was deliberately drinking one or two bottles,

324
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,930
but as I was drinking them, I realized that they were really tasty.

325
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,750
There's an old saying, "you can't catch up to someone who is enjoying themselves."

326
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,350
The design is well done but if you love the product itself,

327
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,260
what better design will manifest itself?

328
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,660
We intend on showing you the best design in order to have more people drink Arts beer.

329
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,460
Thank you.

330
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,060
This is great.

331
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,300
Thanks so much. You really worked hard on this.

332
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,720
It's wonderful.

333
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,620
It's for tuition.

334
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,170
What's with Baek Seung Ah?

335
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,370
It's bewildering. Even though I said it's okay, she gave it to me and left.

336
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,540
Use it for tuition.

337
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,200
You're telling me to play the part of a fake student?

338
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,290
What's up? Why lie about that?

339
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,620
I was just curious how to stir the heart of a rich girl.

340
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,270
What do I do with this?

341
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,390
So great!

342
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,860
You did great!

343
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,260
You better not burst our bubble! Or else.

344
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,800
- Really 
 - They wouldn't.

345
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,680
- I'm hungry.
 - You're hungry? What do you feel like?

346
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,930
- Loach soup? 
 - Great idea!

347
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,090
Agreed!

348
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,280
Let's go.

349
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,800
Isn't that Jang Woo Sang?

350
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,820
- Really? 
 - Heol.

351
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,570
- He must be here to support us.
 - Wow.

352
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,430
Please help us a lot!

353
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,230
This is where we make our beers.

354
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,460
It's the heart of our brewery.

355
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,020
- You should try tasting it.
 - Sure, bring it over.

356
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,630
Moo Yeong. Moo Yeong!

357
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,300
A tasting.

358
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,560
Let's go.

359
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,050
I was wondering who this was.

360
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,510
It's okay.

361
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,250
What do you do over there?

362
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,620
Uh, this is our storage and office.

363
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,800
We grow our yeast cultures and develop new recipes.

364
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,080
It's that kind of space.

365
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,920
What's the pottery? Is it Moo Yeong's?

366
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,540
It's pretty. Where did you buy it?

367
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,140
It was a gift.

368
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,900
It's pretty.

369
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,150
Although it doesn't suit you.

370
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,220
Then, what you said then

371
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,610
is that someone stole your scooter,

372
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,910
so you did the same thing and stole someone else's?

373
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:49,150
I didn't do the same thing and steal someone else's. I just brought the same one.

374
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,680
- The same scooter as mine. 
 - Oh, really?

375
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,680
Hey, Oh Ba Reun.  How much your parents must have

376
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,700
wanted you to live the right way to name you Oh Ba Reun ( meaning: right way .)

377
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,840
So I should take a loss even if it's frustrating?

378
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,930
Oh really.  This guy's calculation is quite fair.

379
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,480
- Stop!
 - Okay!

380
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,070
If you lost yours, you should report it.

381
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,000
Instead, you steal someone else's?

382
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,540
I'm going to report it. I'll report it.

383
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,630
Since he stole it first, start by catching him.

384
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,660
I'm speechless. Hey, listen, bud.

385
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,280
The day you stole the scooter, someone died.

386
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,230
What's more urgent? Catching a murderer or finding a thief who stole a scooter?

387
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,520
Stop!

388
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,850
- Eom Cho Rong!
 - Yes?

389
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,750
- What are you doing?
 - Well,

390
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,890
I'm going home.

391
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,560
Isn't he the youngest?

392
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,850
He's going to fool around.

393
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,600
If you who are crying smile, no, no, if you who are smiling cry—

394
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,470
That's brainless.

395
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,240
Oppa always says that's brainless.

396
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,760
If others are laughing, just laugh and if others are crying, just cry.

397
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,290
Hey, that's because he is innocent.

398
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,090
That's not so, but shall I say so?  That's a compliment.

399
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,450
Let's say so.

400
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,660
Oh my god, that tattoo...

401
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,240
It's nothing.

402
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,710
That's bad news.

403
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,590
What do you mean?

404
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,220
That loser who just passed.

405
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,040
Do you know him?

406
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,620
The police officer who came searching last time.

407
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,180
Did he come searching because of your friend who died?

408
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,880
What friend? She's not my friend!

409
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,990
Look, even after she's dead, she's annoying.

410
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,670
Whatever.  It has nothing to do with me.

411
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,140
Yes! I'm going!

412
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,430
I am so busy I could die and you say are you going?

413
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,410
 Sorry.  I mean it can't get wrinkled. 

414
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,030
Oh, how could you remember that?

415
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,360
If the blouse didn't get wrinkled in the wash last night,

416
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,020
then there's no doubt it's in the washing machine.

417
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,220
 I'm so smart, aren't I? 

418
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,970
That's great.  Our Jin Kang is great.

419
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,160
I'm hanging up. I'm driving! Bye, bye, bye!

420
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,680
Wow.

421
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,710
Hah, are you alright? You're not hurt anywhere?

422
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,850
I'm sorry. He just jumped out there.

423
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,480
He got his first shots.

424
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,790
As long as you didn't get hurt, it's okay.

425
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,190
That was your kid sister then, wasn't she?  At the Itaewon Beer  House.

426
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,880
How did you know that she was my little sister?

427
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,220
Well, it just happened.

428
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,010
- Then, were you stalking her? 
 - Pardon?

429
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,730
Rather than stalking it was, whatchamacallit,

430
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,520
this is, that was ... gosh. Jeez ...

431
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,210
What a  good memory.

432
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,660
It's because you're young, young. Jeez.

433
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,250
Should I go straight?  Turn right? Huh?

434
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,940
It will be okay if you stop there.

435
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,490
I'll take you home. You have a lot to carry and we live in the same neighborhood.

436
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,970
Oh.  Then please go straight.

437
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh, straight?  Okay.

438
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,090
You are very kind.  Are you  a police officer?

439
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,610
The people's staff!

440
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,460
When I was young it was my dream to become a policeman.

441
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,840
- Oh, really?
 - Yes.

442
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,290
My father was a policeman.

443
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,380
Really?   Where did he work?

444
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,010
At Haesan. The Haesan station.

445
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,970
Haesan.

446
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,370
What is it? Do you know any officers there?

447
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,820
No. No, I don't.

448
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,740
0h, you can stop there in front of the Wonyeong printshop.

449
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,260
Over there?

450
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,130
Sir, do you own a gun?

451
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,820
- A gun?
 - Yes.

452
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,910
I forgot to bring it.

453
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,590
Just kidding.  I don't have it on me.

454
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,020
Have you ever fired it?

455
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,590
I shot it many times.

456
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,240
Even now, I  have to shoot once a year, because I have a test. Bang! Bang!

457
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,450
I'm not talking about that.

458
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,650
Have you ever actually shot anyone?

459
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,020
Tell you what.  This is for one's lifetime.

460
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,980
By the time they retire, how many police officers have ever fired a gun toward a person?

461
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,730
It's less than ten percent.

462
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,970
You shot someone.  Ajussi.

463
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,110
You seem really interested in that.

464
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,130
Yes. A lot.

465
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,990
But did you ever really shoot someone? I'm just saying that.

466
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,810
What happened to him?

467
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,240
Did he die?

468
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,070
How did it feel?

469
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,560
If someone died because of you?

470
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,590
You really want to know?

471
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,920
It feels like it's all over.

472
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,320
I'm just kidding, just kidding!

473
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,590
Even just imagining it,  I tell you.

474
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,520
I don't think that's how you feel.

475
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,180
What do you think?

476
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,760
It feels strange.

477
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,450
Very.

478
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,720
You know there are murderers.  The feeling is of becoming a god.

479
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,900
Is that how it  really is?

480
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,580
God?

481
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,230
Going to become a murderer?

482
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,090
If you kill a person,

483
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,560
it's not god that you become, but a vicious murderer.

484
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,780
That's right. A murderer.

485
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,670
That's obvious.

486
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,610
Thank you!

487
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,770
May I ask you something?   What's your name?

488
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,510
I'm Kim Moo Yeong.

489
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,910
Have we seen each other somewhere?

490
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,350
Yes. Not long ago, we saw each other.  Itaewon.

491
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,680
Not then but long before.  A long time ago.

492
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,650
I don't think so.

493
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,340
Yes, Seung Ah.

494
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,750
Hey, Tak.  Look into this guy who is about thirty for me.

495
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,640
He lives in Wonyeong-dong but I'm not sure of the exact address.

496
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,770
You must know it's wrong to do.

497
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,830
No, like this. Be natural.

498
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,990
A-age a-about th-thirty.  L-Lives in Wonyeong-dong.

499
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,450
Hey, when have  I-I-I?

500
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,510
But  checking out a citizen without a case number, whose uniform will be removed?

501
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,500
What did I just say?  Did I strip?

502
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,640
No, that was a mistake, Manager Yoo.

503
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,860
No.  It's not like that.

504
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,230
It can't be a misunderstanding!  Hurry and go. Hurry.  Go already.

505
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,750
Did you eat something bad?

506
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,370
I'm so busy I'm dying.  What are you talking about?

507
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,420
Kim Moo Yeong?

508
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,380
  Meeting Report 

509
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:20,200
General Manager Oh, can I look at Seung Ah's buyer list at the exhibition?

510
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,420
Oh, Seung Ah! It's me!

511
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,200
What is it, Unni?

512
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,500
 We got the Arts deal! 

513
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,750
Really? You did so well!

514
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,480
 My president must be so thankful. She's buying me lunch. 

515
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,780
No, you didn't get it because of me.

516
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,250
Actually, I haven't even given it to him yet. I haven't seen Woo Sang yet.

517
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:54,520
Really? That's even better! I didn't feel right about it.

518
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,440
You think so?

519
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,780
Keep it a secret though. We can ask her to buy us a meal.

520
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,430
Do you have time tomorrow night?

521
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,310
Tomorrow?

522
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,170
Tomorrow isn't really...

523
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,140
You have a date?

524
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,890
Yeah.

525
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,210
- Seung Ah?
 - Yeah?

526
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,480
It's about the person that was there.

527
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,730
Moo Yeong?

528
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,000
What about him?

529
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,630
Really?  Where?

530
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,220
Alright.

531
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,540
Jin Kang said that she saw you.

532
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,330
What?

533
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:10,850
All of it. You must know you did wrong?

534
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,390
You still don't know?

535
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,990
What the! You still don't know?

536
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,890
Know what?

537
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,760
You watched a movie alone!

538
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,450
She said she saw you. She said you looked bored.

539
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,890
Of course, I was bored.

540
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,630
What are you doing? You have to go with me.

541
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,560
Were you wrong to do that or not?

542
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,310
Yeah, I was wrong.

543
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,900
  Criminal Department 

544
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,730
- They caught Choi Sang Hoon.
 - Really?

545
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,900
He was using his credit card at a convenience store near Toronto. He was arrested by police there.

546
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,200
We're going to the foreign affairs department.

547
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,500
Loyalty! Loyalty!

548
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,300
He used a credit card?

549
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,700
  Suspect Choi Sang Hoon  Wonson Evidence  Number 8 
 Suspect Choi Sang Hoon Couple Evidence  Number 9 

550
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,910
 Suspect Choi Sang Hoon  Home Evidence  Number 10 ... 11 

551
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,850
 Suspect Choi Sang Hoon  Home Evidence  Number 12 ... 13 ... 14 ... 15 ... 16 ... 17 

552
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,190
What took you so long to come down?

553
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,000
Director Jang is going to treat you to a meal.

554
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,060
Why don't you join us?

555
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:02,310
Just buy a lot for Seung Ah. I don't have much of an appetite lately.

556
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,500
Is something wrong?

557
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:10,320
No. Her father can't sleep these days, so it affects me.

558
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,670
You're a salaried worker, too. You know how it is.

559
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,650
Don't worry about it.

560
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,860
What I'd like to tell you is that you'll hear some good news soon.

561
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,970
Don't worry and sleep well.

562
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,900
I had no idea. Hey, we had no idea.

563
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,170
Where are you going? Seung Ah!

564
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,610
I'll tell my mom. Just go.

565
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,620
Who are you seeing these days?

566
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,570
Do you know when you're the cutest?

567
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:05,700
I don't need any of this. I'm different.

568
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,420
At least I'm not shallow like you. When you think that way.

569
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,700
Right now ... you're so adorable.

570
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,880
But, in reality, you can't live without these.

571
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,340
Because you're just as shallow as I am.

572
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,690
I don't care what you think.

573
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,560
Cancel that. I cancel giving you permission.

574
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,350
End it.

575
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,380
My father is coming back next week.

576
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,110
Let's have a formal greeting and get married.

577
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,880
Oppa, I'm not your object.

578
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,170
I'm a person.

579
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,150
Whether you're an object or a person, you're mine.

580
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,610
Come down looking pretty.

581
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,270
 Arts Since 2007 

582
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,560
- Welcome!
 - An order of soup noodles!

583
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,440
Yes!

584
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,820
Who was that girl at the theater?

585
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,260
My younger sister.

586
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,750
You must think all girls are your cute little sisters.

587
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,760
No. I only have one cute, little sister.

588
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,440
Seung Ah has real feelings towards you.

589
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,940
So?

590
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,100
I'm asking if your feelings are serious, too.

591
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,380
How about you?

592
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,150
It seemed like that guy had real feelings towards you.

593
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,710
Don't change the subject.

594
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:21,000
He has a stable job since he's a cop. He seemed nice, too.

595
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,770
But could I love someone who is so naive?

596
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,120
It's just dating.

597
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,350
I'll just date for now. Is that the sincerity you're asking about?

598
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,500
What would you prefer?

599
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,840
What about?

600
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,310
A close, dear little sister was dating some guy.

601
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,760
You're asking if that guy is sincere in his love for her, aren't you?

602
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,370
Yeah.

603
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:52,170
Are you really curious about that?

604
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,360
What will happen if that guy isn't sincere?

605
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,750
I'll be really mad.

606
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,820
I don't believe you.

607
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,840
What can't you believe?

608
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,580
You might be happy about it, in a way. I knew it.

609
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,580
That must be how you feel.

610
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:20,100
Seeing someone you care about being hurt must bring you some sick sense of pleasure.

611
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,250
Maybe.

612
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:32,750
Just maybe, you might be interested in me?

613
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,110
Without realizing it yourself.

614
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:45,040
Sorry, but those tricks don't work on me.

615
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,140
Enjoy your meal.

616
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,710
I'm serious.

617
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,380
You asked me. If I was serious about Seung Ah.

618
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,980
I'm serious.

619
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,800
They're getting bloated. Eat up.

620
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,110
Have you never seen a scar before?

621
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,310
No.

622
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,910
You should go if you're done eating.

623
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,170
That is heartless.

624
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,670
Do you care?

625
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,760
I think you're the one who is bothered. You were totally flustered in from of him.

626
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,110
It's because it was a blind date.

627
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,810
Me.

628
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,090
What about you?

629
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,040
You aren't concerned about me?

630
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,370
So it would seem.

631
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,670
I wonder why? You don't concern me at all.

632
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,050
What's so strange about that? You use your credit card if you run out of cash.

633
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:30,210
It's too careless for someone who ran off to Canada after killing someone.

634
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,970
Is that so?

635
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,800
His house, too. Even for a guy,

636
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,670
the mess it was belonged to someone who doesn't know how to organize.

637
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:47,430
You're saying he isn't someone who could arrange over 50 snowglobes in perfect order.

638
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,360
How did you know?

639
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,790
Eom Cho Rong.

640
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,960
Eom Cho Rong can't keep his trap shut.

641
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,510
But it was pretty surprising.

642
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,840
Can someone really remember after seeing it just once?

643
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,990
No kidding.

644
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,430
What time is it? When is the food going to be out?

645
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,300
You must be waiting for Choi Sang Hoon.

646
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,400
Look. He just arrived at Incheon Airport, there's still time for him to get here.

647
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,930
- Oh, It's here! 
 - It's here.

648
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,170
Here.

649
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,420
I'm the only one who buys you stuff like this, right?

650
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,750
You're paying?

651
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,440
No, Manager Yoo is going to pay.

652
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,560
I'm off.

653
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,550
Don't eat it!

654
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,700
Fine, fine. This time, I'll especially

655
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,840
for you, go Dutch pay.

656
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,740
Forget it. You're so cheap, if I'm going to pay, I'll just pay for it all.

657
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,350
- This guy, really. 
 - Fine.

658
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,860
Fine, let's go half-half.

659
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,600
 Have you never seen a scar before? 

660
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,010
Kim Moo Yeong, Kim Moo Yeong,

661
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,910
Kim Moo Yeong.

662
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,710
It's none of these.

663
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,680
Really?

664
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,240
Then he's clean. The Kim Moo Yeong you're looking for.

665
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,180
At least he doesn't have a prior record.

666
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,470
It's a relief.

667
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,470
Who is it? Huh?

668
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,610
Why are you looking for him?

669
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,700
He lived in that neighborhood.

670
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,710
I thought I'd seen him somewhere. That's all.

671
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,010
What the heck!

672
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:44,870
Who are you going to capture that you would ask about innocent citizens?

673
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,310
- Ow! That hurts! 
 - Did you ask about him? You're crazy!

674
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,340
Fine, I get it.

675
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,890
But, it's strange.

676
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,180
What?

677
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:06,130
This is really weird. But strangely, he makes my heart race.

678
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,840
Whenever I see him,

679
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,920
I get strangely anxious.

680
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,990
 Oppa, my sink must be clogged. 

681
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,410
 It won't drain. 

682
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,300
Seriously!

683
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:46,280
You're so cheap! I bought you expensive food. You can't even buy me coffee?

684
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,460
I will! I'll buy you some tomorrow!

685
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,500
Hey you cheapskate! You close-minded brat!

686
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,810
Get out.

687
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:20,660
He's coming! He's here!

688
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,640
What was your motive for killing her? Why did you do it?

689
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,400
Please say something to the victim's family!

690
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,910
Did you kill your girlfriend? Why did you kill her?

691
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,300
Doesn't he look too normal?

692
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,390
Is that person really the murderer?

693
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,200
Oppa.

694
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,310
 Moo Yeong 

695
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,000
How far away are you?

696
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,680
 I never said I was coming. 

697
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,080
Agh, it's really clogged.

698
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,970
I can't even wash my face now.

699
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,720
 You're pretty even without washing up. 

700
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,770
What are you doing? What are you doing that you can't come here?

701
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,740
 I'm looking at you. 

702
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,080
Really?

703
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,170
Where?

704
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,630
Maybe the sushi was bad, this diarrhea.

705
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,050
Where?

706
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,220
I don't see you.

707
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,250
What's going on? Where are you really?

708
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,640
I said I'm looking at you.

709
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,340
What are you doing here?

710
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,130
The door was open.

711
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,830
You can't just come in here like that.

712
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,600
Let's go.

713
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,950
I told you to wait in front of the restroom. Why did you go in someone else's office?

714
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,780
I didn't know I wasn't allowed in there. I'm sorry.

715
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,670
What were you looking at? You were completely absorbed in it.

716
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,400
The murderer.

717
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,170
- Murderer?
 - Yes, on the wall.

718
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:25,680
On the wall? Ah, the photo? Of Choi Sang Hoon?

719
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,130
Yes.

720
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:48,970


721
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:00,430
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

722
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:01,840
 You know they caught Choi Sang Hoon? 

723
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,800
It's not me.

724
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,810
 Where do you think this was put? 

725
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,030
 Where did you hide it? 

726
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,330
 It was definitely it. 

727
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,640
 I don't think it was Choi Sang Hoon. 

728
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,020
 Did you send Im Yoo Ri away deliberately? Nobody else is here. 

729
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,360
 One by one, they're gone and we're the only two left. 

730
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,710
 Why are you doing this? 

731
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:16,960
 I'm with another woman. 

732
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,700
 If I catch you doing questionable things again, I'm going to tell Seung Ah. 

733
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,340
 I won't marry Oppa Woo Sang. 

734
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,240
 Woo Sang is a scary guy. 

735
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,610
 What kind of joke is that?! 

736
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,260
You're really out of line!
