1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,550
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:10,000


3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,500
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

4
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,380
 Strangely my heart races. 

5
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,380
 When I see him, strangely I feel nervous. 

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,700
 Doesn't he look too normal? Are you sure he is the murderer? 

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,180
 Where? I don't see you. 

8
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,210
 Seriously, where are you, Oppa? 

9
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,310
 I'm looking at you. 

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,480
I told you to wait in front of the restroom. Why did you go into someone else's office?

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,720
 Episode 3  
I didn't know I shouldn't enter. I'm sorry.

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,640
What were you looking at that you were so absorbed in it?

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,240
The murderer.

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,300
Murderer?

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,060
Yes, on the wall.

16
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,530
The wall? Ah, the picture of Choi Sang Hoon.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,770
Yes.

18
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,050
 On Sept. 12th, early morning, in Seoul, near Wonyeon-dong, 

19
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,010
 This is the prime suspect in a murder case of a female in her 20s which occurred in an upscale villa. 

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,890
 Boyfriend, Mr. Choi, was apprehended  twelve days after the incident.  
 It's Cho Rong.

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,110
 The suspect who went into hiding right after the crime can look forward to a rough road. 

22
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,550
 'First of all, he is safe, since he is a police officer.' 

23
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,590
 'He seems nice, but he is too naive, so would I be able to love him?' 

24
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,020
 'I'm just seeing him, that's all. Let's just date him for now.' 

25
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,580
 Are you asking about this kind of truth? 

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,290
You really don't even know what you're talking about!

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,370
What are you doing so immersed in TV that you don't even know I'm home?

28
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,610
Should I push you right into the TV? What, what, what?

29
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,130
Oppa, come here and look. It's  Cho Rong.

30
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,420
 This is Kim Nam Soo from YBN 

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,960
It's over.

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,380
Oppa, Cho Rong must have captured the murderer.

33
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,800
Cho Rong didn't capture him, they all captured him together.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,330
All of Violent Crimes Team 3... Damn it.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,790
Why aren't you appearing, when all of you captured him, huh?

36
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,860
Most likely you skipped out.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,620
This...what is this, huh?

38
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,820
A fully grown single woman, a well-spoken single,  who doesn't even clean.

39
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,700
Are you like that too?

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,730
What? What did I do again? I didn't do anything.

41
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,250
Coming on to anyone and being so ridiculously full of yourself.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,280
While having a perfectly good girlfriend, going to the movies with another woman. Are all men like that?!

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,180
What? He has a girlfriend? That bastard, I will...

44
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm not talking about Cho Rong.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,820
Not Cho Rong? Then who?

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,080
There's someone.

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,790
Who?

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,150
I'm just saying he exists. Some bastard.

49
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,190
Where did you hide it?

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,280
Where did you hide the trophy?

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,120
It's in Mi Yeong's room. It's her favorite possession.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,510
It's not in her room, because

53
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,050
you killed Jeong Mi Yeong with it,

54
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,370
with your girlfriend's favorite trophy.

55
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,650
Where did you throw it away?

56
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,030
Time is running out. It wasn't me.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,660
I didn't kill her.

58
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,810
You guys don't have the time to waste like this. Instead,

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,900
go out there and capture the murderer, please.

60
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,620
The bastard who did that to Mi Yeong,

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,760
please go capture him.

62
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,320
Oh, you're here.

63
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,060
- He's been like that all night.
 - What was his first reaction?

64
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,380
They said he kept laughing initially, saying, "Is Mi Yeong really dead?"

65
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,670
"Are you sure the dead person is really Mi Yeong?" Then,

66
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,730
all he did was cry for the last three hours.

67
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,490
I didn't know it was this hard to get a confession.

68
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,620
How about the DNA that came out of Jeong Mi Yeong's fingernails?

69
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,400
That too is typical. "We fought a little bit, but I didn't kill her."

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,280
According to Choi Sang Hoon,

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,570
originally, Jeong Mi Yeong was to go on the trip with him. But, they fought often.

72
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,660
On that day, Jeong Mi Yeong was again insisting that she wasn't going on the trip.

73
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,750
So, they got into a big fight. He was angry, so he went on his own.

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,660
Tomorrow's warrant review won't be dismissed, because we didn't get a confession, right?

75
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,240
Ah seriously! If that happens, it'll get complicated.

76
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,700
Since he was caught after coming in from out of the country, we'll most likely get it.

77
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,640
Is it true that he was supposed to go to Canada with Jeong Mi Yeong?

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,170
Well, the reservation was made two months ago under both names.

79
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,170
But it seems like it's all an act. He's majored in acting in college!

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,670
Jin Kang was thrilled that you were on the news.

81
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,230
Really? Jin Kang watched it?

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,680
Oh right! Policewoman Tak was looking for you earlier.

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,940
As for the proposals that arose today, we'll give you our opinions after having an internal meeting.

84
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,060
I can contact Section Chief Jin Kang, right?

85
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,220
Yes.

86
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,840
And now that we're family you should introduce yourselves to the brewery professionals' family also.

87
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,530
Of course.

88
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,550
Also, someday please show beer making to Section Chief Jin Kang.

89
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,420
I was planning to mention it. Why don't you schedule a slot today?

90
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,430
Yes, that would be great.

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,510
It is different than seeing it in a book.

92
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,060
That's great.

93
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,720
Let's go.

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,620
Everyone, please gather around. I want to make introductions.

95
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,530
Come over here, please.

96
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,420
Everyone, come over.

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,400
This lady will be in charge of the design.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,990
Hello.

99
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,690
From this end, CEO Hwang Seon Hwa.

100
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,710
Nice to meet you.

101
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,310
Section Chief Yoo Jin Kang.

102
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,910
Please look on me with favor.

103
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,780
And this is Assistant Manager Im So Yeon.

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,380
Hello. Please look upon me with favor.

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,330
They design really well, so speak to them frequently. Now, they are our family.

106
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,290
Our brewery's pride,  Brew Master Gil Hyeong Joo.

107
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,090
Yay!

108
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,360
And over here is our foreign educated Manager Tony.

109
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,830
- Hi. 
 - Now you know each other.

110
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,850
Our youngest, Yoo Jin Hee.

111
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,680
Hello.

112
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
And, isn't he really handsome? Hui Joon.

113
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,220
I'm No Hui Joon.

114
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,650
Standing at the end, our First Assistant Moo Yeong.

115
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,580
Hello.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,230
Now, since we're working together, let's enjoy ourselves while working.

117
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,980
Okay.

118
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,390
Is it lunchtime already? Today's menu is pollack soup.

119
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,590
No. Coffee.

120
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,130
Let's go out today and have brunch.

121
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,170
What brunch?

122
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,680
You said you'll buy coffee. Are you going to be petty?

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,430
You have so much money. Are you begrudging me that one plate of sushi? Is that it?

124
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,870
- Why would I have a lot of money? 
  - You have a lot. No reason not to have a lot.

125
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,350
Tak is freely solo. Do you have a husband or children you have to feed?

126
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,390
Are you extravagant in your tastes?

127
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,020
Even if you wanted to put money in there, there's just nowhere to put it.

128
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,850
That's right. I got divorced because I can't have children. I don't have a child or a husband to feed.

129
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,680
Satisfied? Seriously.

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,250
Thank you for telling me something I was just barely forgetting. I feel so crappy I'm not going to eat.

131
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,540
Oh hey! Tak, Tak!

132
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,790
Why is the conversation flowing that way? Let's go. Let's go right now.

133
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,170
Come on. Why are you being like that? I only complimented you, because I like that about you.

134
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,610
How is that a compliment?

135
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,350
Come on. Our Tak, have you ever dressed fancy in your life?

136
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,010
Or do you like luxury items?

137
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,870
Do you get the Botox injections that everyone else does?

138
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,210
You're forever and constantly easy going and humble.

139
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,190
Who are you calling easy going and humble?

140
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,300
Dress $480

141
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,920
Cardigan $350, the shoes were on 30% off sale, so they were $280.

142
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,250
Nail art, fingers and toes together, $100.

143
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,150
Oh my, they were all that expensive?

144
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,940
Who are you talking to about being or not being fancy?

145
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,270
And w-w-what? Botox?

146
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,850
It's not Botox anymore, but Fillers!

147
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,880
Why would I not get the fillers that everyone else gets?

148
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,860
Why wouldn't I, when it's been ages since my wrinkles have reached my toes?

149
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,750
- You got them? 
- I got them!

150
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,410
That's right! I got them! I got them twice!

151
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,650
Oh, seriously! Should I scratch you with these $100 fingernails?

152
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,850
How much of a scratch would result?

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm going to restrain myself.

154
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,950
Geez, a lunch is ruining my life!

155
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,070
I'm so sorry. I couldn't answer because I was working.

156
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,740
Oh, that's why. We caught a criminal last night also,

157
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,350
 so I was busy all night. 

158
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,370
I saw you on the news.

159
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,800
Cho Rong, you were on a lot.

160
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,790
Is that so? I...I didn't know I was on.

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,050
You are a designer?

162
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,950
Yes.

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,970
You have such a combative attitude.

164
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,170
If I catch you behaving dubiously one more time, I'm going to tell Seung Ah everything.

165
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,920
Tell her.

166
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,860
I don't care.

167
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,160
Are you shameless or are you oozing overconfidence?

168
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,390
I have a clear conscience.

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,920
- Why are you laughing? Am I laughable? 
 - Yup.

170
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,250
You look really funny right now. Your facial expression is like, "I can't live if I lose." Is it something like that?

171
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,420
Yes, to someone I shouldn't lose to.

172
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,920
You think you lost, huh? I wasn't even in a fight.

173
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,360
You're really good with words, aren't you?

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,250
You have such confidence in getting out of any situation with words, don't you?

175
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,900
- Is that it?
 - I'm very familiar with that

176
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,220
because I have one at my house.

177
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,080
I know how to deal with people like that.

178
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,400
How?

179
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,210
Ignoring them completely.

180
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,530
I'm giving you a warning. This is the end of our private conversation. Don't speak to me.

181
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,180
Okay.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,070
- Oh, no! 
- Be gentle.

183
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,750
Are you alright? Let me see.

184
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,010
Easy. Easy.

185
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,150
You're the one who spoke first.  It only took one minute.

186
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,210
How can you joke around about this?

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,340
You are really out.

188
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,960
Don't you speak to me ever again.

189
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,960
You two interrogate Choi Sang Hoon.  The rest of you investigate all the witnesses again.

190
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,110
Either you get the confession out of him or find new evidence.

191
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,090
Bring one or the other. You got that?

192
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,500
I understand.

193
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,550
Hyung. Hyung. Hyung. Hyung.

194
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,950
I'm sorry but could you look into the tattoo?

195
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,950
No, I can't. Why?

196
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,830
It's alright. I'll just do it.

197
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,670
What the...

198
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,330
Why? What is the tattoo?

199
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,880
She is a witness, but she is totally rude.

200
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,600
Over there, the picture you're always looking at. The girl in the back with the tattoo.

201
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,280
You may leave now.

202
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,370
Salute!

203
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,800
You better take responsibility if I get fired.

204
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,140
I don't like the sight of you either. Take a look at this.

205
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,600
What is it? Is there something you know?

206
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,240
What is this?

207
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,350
Key evidence. Jeong Mi Yeon got hit on the back of her head with this and received a fatal injury.

208
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,150
You know that Choi Sang Hoon was captured.

209
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,610
Yes.

210
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,520
Per chance, do you have a hunch or something? Where do you think Choi Sang Hoon hid this?

211
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,430
No clue.

212
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,610
 Oppa Moo Yeong 

213
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,800
 Cancel it.  I cancel giving you permission. End it. 

214
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,360
 My father is coming next week.  Let's have a formal greeting and get married. 

215
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,740
Hyung isn't coming in today.

216
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,170
Beer.

217
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,700
Don't treat a customer like that. I have something to tell him.

218
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,230
You really don't know where he is?

219
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,040
He went on a date.  They must be all lovey-dovey by now.

220
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,530
So what? What would I care if he is dating or not?

221
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,900
She is totally rich. If you knew who it was, you'd be surprised.

222
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,270
Also, you need to know this critical point.

223
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,480
She is really pretty.

224
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,780
So what if she is pretty and rich?

225
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,240
Do you really think Kim Moo Yeong is really going to fall in love or something?

226
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,350
He would fall for her more than he would fall for you.

227
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,300
Then, if she and I were to fall into the water,

228
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,790
who do you think Oppa would save first?

229
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,020
Crazy kid. Of course, he is going to save her and not you.

230
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,910
I guess that's how it is.

231
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,000
You think I don't know you. You really like him,

232
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,670
but you know you'll be immediately discarded if you let your feelings be known, so you're afraid to even confess.

233
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,270
What are you saying?

234
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,670
What? Did I get you?

235
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,620
Who said I had feelings for him? You little prick!

236
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,150
Hey! Hey! Clean this up!

237
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,130
Aish! How rude!

238
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,870
Why aren't you picking up? It keeps ringing.

239
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,350
My mom. I texted her earlier that I'm near.

240
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,130
What are your parents like?

241
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,810
Parents?

242
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,220
My parents...

243
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,390
- Institution?
 - Yes.

244
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,120
He lived in an orphanage from when he was six to fifteen years old.

245
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,160
Jamyeong Orphanage. It's a Catholic based organization in Haeseon.

246
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,180
- So, he is an orphan? 
- Yes.

247
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,580
My mom was so uptight.

248
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,000
She nagged me so much.

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,110
Well, because she always said the right things, I was often frustrated.

250
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,980
Also, she wears the same clothes all year long.

251
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,950
Liar. No one is like that.

252
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,670
It's true. She wore the same clothes all year long.

253
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,150
I had a lot of aunts.

254
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,940
You can say that they were all like my mom.

255
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,360
They always said the right things and wore the same clothes.

256
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
That's funny. How about your father?

257
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,630
My dad was a police officer.

258
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,640
A zealous detective who captured bad guys.

259
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,390
He entered the institute when he was six.  There is no record of him prior to that.

260
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,040
Even the name "Kim Moo Young" was given to him at the institute.

261
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,350
He is a hard worker and he has a fairly good reputation at work.

262
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,850
No Hui Joon is an intern there.  He spent a short period of time at the orphanage when he was young with Kim Moo Yeong.

263
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,210
No Hui Joon got adopted later.

264
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,710
He's had many women around him, but he's never had a longterm relationship.

265
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,140
He has never brought a woman home either.

266
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,200
How are your parents?

267
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,240
My parents?

268
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,550
We're just ordinary.

269
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,360
Moo Yeong.

270
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,070
Jin Kang's brother is a police officer too. Yoo Jin Gook.

271
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,510
I know. I saw him in the neighborhood.

272
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,520
He is really funny.

273
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,570
He raised Unni all by himself. He didn't even get married.

274
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,850
By himself?

275
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,350
When Unni was young, both of her parents passed away.

276
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,200
I feel sorry for her.

277
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,390
You feel sorry for her?

278
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,190
Of course, I do.

279
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,730
I feel most sorry for Jin Kang.

280
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,050
When I hate my mom the most,

281
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,240
I think of Jin Kang and I get over it.

282
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,200
This girl! She said she's almost home.

283
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,880
What?

284
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,150
That girl, is she in her right mind?

285
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,520
My goodness.

286
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,760
Oh, Woo Sang, that guy.

287
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,400
Order. Order everything.

288
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,170
What's the most expensive thing here? Do you have that Luwak or something like that?

289
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,780
The thing that costs $20 a cup.

290
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,820
Oh, we don't have that. But we have blueberry cream shaved ice, which is the most expensive.

291
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,860
It's only $12.

292
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,910
Will this suffice?

293
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,830
Forget it.

294
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,000
Who eats shaved ice at this hour?

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,660
- Hey,
 - Are you crazy?

296
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,050
Get over it. I'm here to make it up to you even on my day off.

297
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,890
I'm sure you're here for another reason. You wouldn't be here for me, oh great Manager Yoo?

298
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,090
I don't have anything else!

299
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,840
Hey, this morning Choi Sang Hoon's arrest warrant came out. What's there for me to do?

300
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,440
I came just to buy you coffee. That's what I came for.

301
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,260
You really don't have any other reason.

302
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,820
If you don't go straight home after this,

303
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,430
you know what will happen?

304
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,670
Scratch me. Just scratch me.

305
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,030
I really do have sharp nails!

306
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,610
An iced Americano, please.

307
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,950
Sure.

308
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,060
Will that be good enough, $4.50?

309
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,420
Don't think of calling it even. You still owe me $15.50.

310
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,840
She calculates so quickly. Please give me two of those.

311
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,340
 (Mouthing $15.50 to himself.)  

312
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,910
$10 minus $4.50...

313
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,390
This is the lauder tun to produce wort (unfermented beer).

314
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,080
The next one is the kettle to boil the wort.

315
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,460
When the wort is ready, they are sent through those pipes to the fermentation vessel.

316
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,380
When the fermentation is complete, the last step happens over there.

317
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,230
- It matures and ripens. 
 - Really fascinating.

318
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,870
Would it be okay to take some photos?

319
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,330
Of course, go ahead.

320
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,210
Thank you.

321
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,080
Min Ji.

322
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,910
It's too bad.

323
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,810
He must not be here today.

324
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,370
Who?

325
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,400
You know, the good-looking one.

326
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,030
- Here I am!
 - You startled me.

327
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,780
Weren't you looking for the good-looking guy?

328
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,210
I can hear everything.

329
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,880
Oh, then where is that guy?

330
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,750
You said you heard everything.

331
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,550
But, that's me.

332
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,140
Oh, hmm. Nuh-uh...

333
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,350
Oh, those looks.

334
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,210
What do they eat these days to get so tall?

335
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,920
Oh, how nice. Really. Oh my gosh.

336
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,190
Hey!

337
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,880
What are you doing? Don't do it.

338
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,330
What is it? No, no.

339
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,350
What are you doing?

340
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,090
What did you eat for breakfast?

341
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,390
Oh, sorry.

342
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,900
He's a little... You know, there are a lot of weirdos out there.

343
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,870
What the heck are you doing?

344
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,040
You're crazy.

345
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,960
She was just curious.

346
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,510
She was wondering what you eat to get so tall, when I think I'm taller.

347
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,410
Oh... milk?

348
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,750
I'm kidding. I don't eat breakfast.

349
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,400
Oh, so you skip breakfast.

350
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,530
Is she your girlfriend?

351
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,140
What do you mean girlfriend? Whose future marriage path are you trying to block?

352
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,400
Colleague, colleague! A totally innocent colleague.

353
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,100
- Colleague. 
 - Cross, cross.

354
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,530
Good luck, Colleague.

355
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,960
I knew she wasn't, she's too pretty.

356
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,310
Don't mind us. I barely tolerate him.

357
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,490
What brings you here at this hour?

358
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,960
I was here to meet a friend.

359
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,890
I'll be going then.

360
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,630
Okay.

361
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,960
What? You scared me for a second.

362
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,010
Who is it? Who was that?

363
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,960
Kim Moo Yeong.

364
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,660
- Kim Moo Yeong?
 - Yes.

365
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,380
That...?

366
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,910
- That Kim Moo Yeong?
 - Yeah.

367
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,380
Oh, you're right. You were right about that.

368
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,920
What?

369
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,490
Last time, you said your heart raced.

370
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,290
You said you got strangely anxious.

371
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,310
That's how I feel now.

372
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,810
Why is that?

373
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,830
Why would that be?

374
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,010
Aren't you leaving? It's five minutes to one.

375
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,140
Oh, where does the time go?

376
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,670
- I'm sorry.
 - Aish!

377
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,650
Oh. How rude!

378
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,160
We both bumped each other.

379
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,450
Why are kids so rude these days?

380
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,560
Excuse me!

381
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,910
What did you eat for breakfast?

382
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,900
What the heck?

383
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,340
Forget it. Let's just go.

384
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,010
Come out, hurry up.

385
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,860
What's with you? You're having too much fun with it.

386
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,000
What do you eat to be so embarrassing?

387
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,920
Age?

388
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,440
Your age? What a thing to brag about.

389
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,450
- Age prettily, okay?
 - Yes.

390
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,510
I think kids these days are different from us.

391
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,600
Huh?

392
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,310
What is this?

393
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,340
I'm so disappointed! He doesn't know how to pick women.

394
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,780
She seems pretty enough.

395
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,490
Should I get a tattoo, too?

396
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,470
Why a tattoo?

397
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,550
So I could look like a rude brat.

398
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,070
A tattoo?

399
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,010
What do you think?

400
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,810
Would it look good on me?

401
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,270
I'm going first, so take your time coming.

402
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,050
What is it now?

403
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,000
Chief.

404
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,350
It was definitely it.

405
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,580
 Isn't it weird? 

406
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,750
 I didn't know it was Mi Yeong's. 

407
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,690
 So I just threw it in the garbage. 

408
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,210
But thinking about it,

409
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,780
it was the morning that she died.

410
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,000
So it means that Sang Hoon left it at my place that night.

411
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,180
But,

412
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,590
I really

413
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,490
didn't hear anything while I was sleeping.

414
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,450
Why?

415
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,050
Why would Choi Sang Hoon leave it with me?

416
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,040
Did you sleep well that night?

417
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,400
You said you slept well. You said you can sleep without medication nowadays.

418
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,880
Of course. I quit a long time ago.

419
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,540
I quit right after meeting you.

420
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,110
Right?

421
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,220
Her name is Im Yoo Ri.

422
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,070
She's 22 and she attended middle school with Jeong Mi Yeong in the US.

423
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,720
Jeong Mi Yeong came to Korea three years ago,

424
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,980
and Im Yoo Ri came the year before last.

425
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,110
They got together frequently after coming to Korea and were best friends.

426
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:58,750
She lives in a local band's practice room and works part-time.

427
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,120
And there isn't anything else in particular. Why?

428
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,650
Nothing in particular.

429
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,710
It's nothing. There was just something that bothered me.

430
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,740
 Beer Festival 

431
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,640
  1502  

432
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,210
You came in early. I thought you weren't sure if you could make it in.

433
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,790
Yup.

434
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,470
Take some pictures too.

435
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,780
Was the circulation too strong?

436
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,680
Doesn't it seem like the body falls a bit short?

437
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,300
That's true.

438
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,680
I think the weight didn't come out as expected.

439
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,930
 Is it your first time seeing a scar? 

440
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,070
 No. 

441
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,120
 Is it bothering you? 

442
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,080
 I think you're the one who is bothered. You were totally flustered in from of him. 

443
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,570
 It's because it was a blind date. 

444
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,530
 How about me? 

445
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,490
 What about you? 

446
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,550
 Don't you care about me? 

447
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,830
 So it would seem. You don't concern me at all. 

448
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,850
- What can be done?
 - What else? The master should take responsibility.

449
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,040
What are you looking at?

450
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,370
I was wondering what you were looking at.

451
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,610
Come on over. Let's test the beers.

452
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,960
Thanks for letting me look around.

453
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,280
I thought you were going to test the stouts.

454
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,730
Go ahead then.

455
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,620
It tastes good. The recipes here are incredible.

456
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,100
Thanks. It's my recipe.

457
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,130
It tastes good.

458
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,550
Did you send Ms. Im away deliberately?

459
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,460
Nobody else is here. One by one they go and we're the only two left.

460
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,220
That's why I'm going to leave. One by one, sending everyone away.

461
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,430
So take care by yourself.

462
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:11,130
I changed schedules deliberately. Hui Joon was in charge today.

463
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,370
Excuse me. Could you loan me an umbrella?

464
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,250
Oh, an umbrella?

465
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,530
It can't be personal, right? I have to give you a professional one, don't I?

466
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,090
I don't have a professional umbrella though.

467
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:09,870
Just loan me anything. I'll go buy one at the store and give yours right back.

468
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,890
I really don't have one.

469
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,150
Wow, it's going to come down for a while.

470
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,020
Just a minute, I'll give you a ride.

471
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,900
Get in! I won't make you talk.

472
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,210
I wanted to see you wear it. Why are you carrying it?

473
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,210
Mom, I have something to tell you.

474
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,870
Okay.

475
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,460
Mom,

476
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,690
I'm not going to marry Woo Sang. And I'm not going to the chairman's dinner.

477
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,680
Why not?

478
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,970
Did he tell you not to go?

479
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,900
The boy you've been seeing lately.

480
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,150
Why so surprised? Is there anything I don't know?

481
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,710
Good job.

482
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,630
Men.

483
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,790
After all this waiting, he wouldn't bring up marriage. I was wondering why all of a sudden?

484
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,400
But, only up to here.

485
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,850
Don't provoke Woo Sang.

486
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,410
I'm saying not to meet that boy again.

487
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,510
Mom,

488
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,650
I really am not going to marry Woo Sang.

489
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,100
I don't want to.

490
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,410
He's not someone you can break up with just because you want to.

491
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,500
Woo Sang is a scary man.

492
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,750
Isn't it great? He's such a man.

493
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,120
How nice.

494
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,950
Seven dollars.

495
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,850
This as well.

496
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,980
You have no conscience, just buying your own umbrella in this pouring rain.

497
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,970
Why do you flip-flop so much?

498
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,430
You used to only tease me like a little kid.

499
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,270
Now, you're broody like someone who is angry.

500
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,300
Why did you give me a ride if you're going to give me a hard time about it?

501
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,270
Drop the formalities. As you say, you're the one flip-flopping.

502
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,690
Just drop the formal speech like you normally do.

503
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,680
Fine.

504
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,760
Let's drop the formalities.

505
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,300
You're the one who started talking to me, on a personal level.

506
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,150
You're seriously a kid.

507
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,600
It's cold. I left it uncovered for you to notice, but you're not giving it any attention.

508
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,860
Don't be shocked. This woman is weird. Other women aren't like that.

509
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,150
It's a pretty lethal piece to women.

510
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,200
Is it something like "I also have such a scar" so it's nothing special?

511
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,650
Do you really think that works on women?

512
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:14,060
Yeah, of course. "Oh, no!" "When did that happen?" "It must hurt" "Ohhhh."

513
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,270
Look at the relaxed attitude of one who has one.

514
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,040
What's the big deal about a scar? It happens.

515
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,280
"I've never been scarred by it." "I don't have a complex that you're expecting."

516
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,270
That's the expression you're showing.

517
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,200
Yeah, I don't. I'm not scarred by it.

518
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,310
 I feel sorry for her. 

519
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,280
 I feel most sorry for Jin Kang. 

520
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,950
That's good, that you're not scarred by it.

521
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,310
It's Seung Ah.

522
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,380
I said that it's Seung Ah. Hurry up and pick up.

523
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,210
It's going to get disconnected.

524
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,890
Why didn't you pick up?

525
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,220
I'm with another woman.

526
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:15,890
Another wo... me?!

527
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,300
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

528
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:30,180
I'm asking because I'm honestly just curious. Why are you like that?

529
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,490
Moving forward, step by step.

530
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,270
Step by step, what?

531
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,900
I'm moving forward more, step by step.

532
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,280
I lose the chance to stop when I'm with you.

533
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,500
The speed accelerates.

534
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,190
Your eyes

535
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,320
bother me a lot.

536
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,480
I feel short-tempered if I don't do something.

537
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,420
Look. I'm about to become short-tempered again.

538
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,570
What's going on?

539
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,340
Policeman Yoo, hello.

540
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,410
What's going on? Why are you coming together?

541
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,640
It's home. I'm home.

542
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,000
So why are you getting out of that car?

543
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,620
I went to the beer making place today.

544
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,420
It's a really famous craft beer making company called Arts.

545
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,360
We got the contract to do their design, and he works there.

546
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,100
Is that enough?

547
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,120
Arts? What does he do there?

548
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,760
He's a beer making assistant.

549
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,920
You ...

550
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,730
Don't get involved with him.

551
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,330
What do you mean involved? Don't worry. He's dating Seung Ah.

552
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:00,060
Seung Ah? Are you saying  Kim Moo Yeong is dating Seung Ah?

553
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,880
Don't act like you know, okay?

554
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,520
I shouldn't have told you.

555
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,610
It's good.

556
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,800
Moo Yeong, you met him earlier.

557
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,070
Executive Director Jang Woo Sang.

558
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,410
The executive director would like to commission you with a special recipe.

559
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,660
It's only a small event so don't feel too pressured.

560
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,320
I'm hoping that you, Kim Moo Yeong, would make a wedding commemorative beer.

561
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,140
I hear his intended really loves our beer.

562
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,850
Don't do that. Let's pick a day and have you bring her with you.

563
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,500
If we know her beer taste, it's good for your plan too.

564
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,620
It's a good idea.

565
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,740
It would be good if you could do that.

566
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,180
I will set some time aside.

567
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,450
I'm Choi Sang Woon. I'm Choi Sang Hoon.

568
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:20,510
I'm Choi Sang Woon. I'm Choi Sang Hoon.

569
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,530
I'm Choi Sang Hoon.

570
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,100
What are you mumbling there, punk?

571
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,530
I'm trying to do some psychological profiling.

572
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,800
I'm Choi Sang Hoon. O-o-oww!

573
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,870
Do you know what the first letter of profiling is?

574
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,890
I know.

575
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:43,120
P-R-O-F...

576
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,950
That last picture, let's see it again.

577
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,050
- This one? 
 - Yes.

578
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,420
Snow globe.

579
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,300
 Snow Globe 

580
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,870
   Men's Detention   

581
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,670
I'm curious about something.

582
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,760
I guess you bought this to give this as a gift?

583
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,740
Your dead girlfriend liked snow globes a lot, right?

584
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,230
She had collected so many of them in her living room.

585
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,670
Where do you think she would have put this?

586
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,040
It's a merry-go-round.

587
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:05,580
A merry-go-round, do you think she would have placed it next to the sailboat or the angel?

588
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,830
If Jeong Mi Yeon were still alive

589
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,610
where would she have placed this?

590
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,420
What are you trying to say?

591
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,200
Would she have placed it next to the sailboat or next to the angel?

592
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,140
What's the sailboat and angel...?

593
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,690
Please say it so I can understand.

594
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,110
I'm here, outside your house.

595
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,640
 Moo Yeong? 

596
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,090
 You didn't have to get out of the car. 

597
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,640
I'm Seung Ah's mother.

598
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,690
My child isn't coming out.

599
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,900
- Seung Ah, tomorrow... 
- Mom!

600
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,640
She has to go to greet her future in-laws so she's very busy.

601
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,350
You know what I mean, right?

602
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:16,040
I'll delete your number. You should do the same.

603
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,830
Mom.

604
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,900
 Delete contact  

605
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,960
Let's talk for a moment. Choi Sang Hoon...

606
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,260
Are you going to turn him over to the prosecutors tomorrow?

607
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,790
Let's stop here.

608
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,870
I don't think it's Choi Sang Hoon.

609
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,540
It's still not confirmed. In my opinion, I think it would be better to investigate a bit further before turning him over.

610
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,320
I think it would be good for our team too.

611
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,890
- Team? 
 - Why?

612
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,350
Are you sore that he was caught sooner than expected?

613
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,420
This is why I keep saying you're not part of our team.

614
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,960
Stop being so meddlesome and go do what you were doing.

615
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,550
Circumstantial evidence is just that. It's not conclusive.

616
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,420
  Indictment 

617
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,520
Seung Ah.

618
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,340
Smile.

619
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,980
 Wonyeong-dong 37-4/1 (HD) 

620
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,580
What are you looking for today now?

621
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:06,220
The punk who stole someone else's scooter, saying that his was stolen, wants us to find his.

622
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,960
Is that 37-4?

623
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,710
How could he park it in a CCTV blind spot?

624
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,380
I know, right?

625
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,710
It's a bust.

626
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,750
- Go about your work.  
 - Yes.

627
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,700
 Do you know when I find you the cutest? 

628
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,290
 'I don't need any of this. I'm better than this.' 

629
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,100
  At least I'm not materialistic like you. 

630
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,270
 Right now. 

631
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,160
 You're cute. 

632
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:17,500
 But you can't live without these, 

633
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,020
 because you're as materialistic as I am. 

634
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,870
I'm sorry.

635
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,950
 You really don't want to do it? 

636
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:37,780
 If you don't want to do it that much, then don't. Is it that difficult? 

637
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,730
 Why? You honestly want to do it, right? 

638
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:50,450
 I guess it's possible; humbly pretending not to win. 

639
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,090
No.

640
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,230
You're home. I'm not eating.

641
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,930
Are you busy?

642
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,450
What is all this?

643
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,270
I have to finish the CI by tomorrow.

644
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,760
CI?

645
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,240
We're changing the Arts' logo design.

646
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,280
Logo. Hey,

647
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,530
Someone might think you're a real career woman.

648
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,540
 Beer Festival 

649
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:20,580
This...this...what is this?

650
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,470
What is this?

651
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,890
That's the goods.

652
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,020
Goods?

653
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:34,070
It is a drawing which was included in the goods manufactured by Arts for the summer corporate festival.

654
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,910
You know those things we pass out to the customers, things like umbrellas and cups.

655
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,710
Umbrella?

656
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,600
Oh my.

657
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,260
Oppa, I'm really busy.

658
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,310
We can just pick them up.

659
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,750
I am clearing such a mess.

660
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,880
No, you can't just carelessly put them together.

661
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,950
You have to put it in order based on color, one by one.

662
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,890
- All of them by color? 
 - Yeah.

663
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,910
This one.

664
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,770
If it's Arts, it's where Kim Moo Yeong works, right?

665
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,680
Ah, Kim Moo Yeong. If it was him, this would be done in a minute.

666
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,020
When will all of these get done?

667
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,380
What would be done in one minute?

668
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,850
Seung Ah tells me that he is a genius.

669
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:24,520
Her bracelet broke and all the beads flew loose, but he fixed it.

670
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,890
And when she looked at it later, it was exactly the way it was originally.

671
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,640
What?

672
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,410
Really, she said it was exactly the same when there were more than twenty beads.

673
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,720
Oppa, where are you going?

674
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,550
Oppan, how can you leave?

675
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,430
 Oh, all the way to the front row, the order is exactly the same.  There are dozens. 

676
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:50,940
 It's not like one can remember from looking at it once. 

677
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:56,170
 Really, she said it was exactly the same when there were more than twenty beads. 

678
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,940
 Criminal Matters Department  

679
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,460
 The goods. 

680
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,260
 It is a drawing which was included in the goods manufactured by Arts ... 

681
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,990
 If it's Arts, it's where Kim Moo Yeong works at, right? 

682
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,660
 What were you looking at, that you were so absorbed in? 

683
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,750
 The murderer. 

684
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,250
 Murderer? 

685
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,630
 Yes, on the wall. 

686
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,370
 On the wall? Oh, the picture of Choi Sang Hoon. 

687
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,160
 Yes. 

688
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,660
No, it's not that.

689
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,610
I really don't want to do it.

690
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,510
I know.

691
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,980
It's the police officer.

692
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,170
What are you doing here?

693
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,640
What would I be doing in front of someone else's home?

694
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,470
I was waiting for you, of course.

695
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,320
Why?

696
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,740
You asked me a while back

697
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:25,170
how would I feel if someone died because of me.

698
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:28,260
This time, let me ask you.

699
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,670
How did you feel when you killed someone?

700
01:01:53,540 --> 01:02:00,550


701
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:08,540
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

702
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,100
 This is new. You're asking me out on a date. 

703
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,940
 I don't know, because I never had a mother. 

704
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,170
 I don't have parents either. 

705
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,510
 I know. It's something that I felt I knew from the start. 

706
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,420
 You have a cat? What's its name? 

707
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,980
 Last name, Jin. First name, Gang. Jin Gang. 

708
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,430
 This is everything you ever received from me. 

709
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:25,180
 I was with him. I slept with him. 

710
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,240
 Why, Ahjussi? 

711
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,970
 I find Kim Moo Yeong to be a suspect in Jeong Mi Yeong case. 

712
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:29,960
 Be careful, I'm telling you. 

713
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,350
 Why didn't you leave yet? 

714
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,190
 Stop her. Stop her so she won't meet him ever again. 

715
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,240
 Yoo Jin Kang!
