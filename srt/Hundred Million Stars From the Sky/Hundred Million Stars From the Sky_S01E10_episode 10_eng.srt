Oh, the A/C. No wonder it was so cold.

00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,760
The A/C?

26
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,490
You dummy, you didn't even know the air was on.

27
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,920
Your side is working, too.

28

Mine isn't wor... oh, it's working.

29
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,140
What's going on, you're even driving me to work.

30
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,610
So, are you saying you like it or not?

31
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,730
I like it!

32
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,260
I would have just gone if you were a minute late.

33
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,170
You're quite lucky today.

34
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,660
Lucky day!

35
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,130
What should we do next Thursday?

36
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,280
That's right. It's already November next week.

37
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,820
I can't keep up with the seasons changing.

38
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,530
It's okay. I don't even know what year it is.

39
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,620
Should we make kimbap? Or is kimbap over the top?

40
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,700
Let's make some. It's been a while. Just like we're going on a picnic.

41
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,320
Should we?

42
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,390
Oh right. Buy some new hiking boots. Those are too old.

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,190
See you.

44
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,150
Hey, Homely!

45
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,900
I was a bit harsh yesterday.

46
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,890
I know you're all grown up. Since you're grown now,

47
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,340
I'll trust you to take care of your own business and won't tell you what to do anymore. Okay?

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,790
Okay.

49
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,990
 Yes or no? Are you done thinking about it? 

50
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,200
 No 

51
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,250
 Delete Message 

52
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,230
 Are you sure you want to delete this message? 

53
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll make my own.

54
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,590
It's already done. Here you go.

55
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,600
Thank you!

56
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,630
What is it? The coffee is rich and nutty.

57
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,710
Isn't it? I like it because it isn't sweet.

58
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,330
Thank you!

59
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,320
Wasn't Jang Se Ran's major in art?

60
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,140
Yes, so when I looked up her interviews she seemed to have a special interest in installation art.

61
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,770
I heard she's collected Kusama's outdoor artworks.

62
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,910
So instead of two-dimensional pieces,

63
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,230
I think it would be better to go with three-dimensional graphics.

64
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,320
What about Kim Moo Yeong's taste?

65
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,150
Director Jang's taste is important, too, but he's the one who is going to run it.

66
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,090
Shouldn't we take Kim Moo Yeong's taste into consideration?

67
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,170
I don't think so.

68
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,320
What?

69
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,670
I mean, I ran into him yesterday in the neighborhood.

70
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,410
Coincidentally at the market, since we live in the same neighborhood.

71
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,740
So I asked him and I don't think he's going to do it.

72
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,060
You don't think he's going to do it?

73
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,180
You should have asked him for sure when you had the chance!

74
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,270
Is he still thinking or is his mind made up? What is it?

75
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,180
I believe he made his decision.

76
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,540
No, he said he made a decision.

77
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,750
Not to do it. Very definitely.

78
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,990
Did you just laugh right before this suddenly disappointing news?

79
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,950
I did? I don't think so.

80
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,940
I must have felt that it's so unfortunate.

81
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,590
Didn't I tell you earlier? Manager Jin Kang is very strange lately.

82
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,890
I know. Who hums for two hours?

83
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,150
Hum? Me?

84
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,320
Okay, okay. It's vacant, hum, hum...

85
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,040
 No. 

86
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,610
What do you think about this?

87
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,280
To tell you truthfully, I think it's excessive.

88
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,000
Right?

89
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,210
I must have been too good to him.

90
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,590
The order has come down to send Im Yoo Ri to the prosecutors tomorrow on the charge of manslaughter.

91
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,120
They say we should further investigate Kim Moo Yeong for another week.

92
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,750
Why aren't they taking them together and telling us to split the case?

93
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,910
They say the investigation of motive for Kim Moo Young is insufficient.

94
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,960
- Lee Gyeong Cheol.
 - Yes?

95
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,600
Do you know that Officer Yoo requested a transfer to the patrol division?

96
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,860
Is that so?

97
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,880
Yoo Jin Gook, do you know why I brought you two in together?

98
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,590
Yes. I won't have any issue with whatever decision is made.

99
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,970
It's only two months until the next review.

100
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,970
Count your blessings that it was quietly let go this time

101
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,420
and don't let your pride get ahead of you anymore.

102
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,530
Anyhow, if we're disciplined this time, I think I'll lose my mind.

103
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,430
But if Officer Yoo gets disciplinary action, doesn't he kind of deserve it?

104
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,300
If only he'd shared the information right away when Im Yoo Ri turned herself in,

105
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,160
we wouldn't have arrested Kim Moo Yeong and done that pointless work in front of the cameras.

106
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,990
That's... because I acted so hastily.

107
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,560
Officer Yoo didn't know we'd so urgently...

108
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,550
Leave him alone. Eom Cho Rong has a special relationship with him.

109
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,080
Don't you know his girlfriend is Officer Yoo's sister?

110
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,170
That's amazing. Are things going well?

111
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,550
Yes.

112
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,530
No matter how much you like her, choose your alliances wisely.

113
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes.

114
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,790
Get your act together.

115
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,120
There's no disciplinary action. They got past it.

116
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,570
Oh, what a relief!

117
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,590
There's nothing more to speak of at length. Let's just do as much as we did before this case.

118
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,130
I don't know why you're so invested in Jeong Mi Yeon's case.

119
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,090
But we got along fine before then.

120
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,580
As if you were here but not here.

121
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,000
Not seeing your face if possible.

122
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,400
Manager.

123
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,820
This is Job's Tears Tea. Would you like some?

124
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,530
Thank you. I know it wouldn't have been easy for you to do.

125
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,070
I don't regret it. I knew I shouldn't do it.

126
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about Kim Moo Yeong and Im Yoo Ri.

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,130
Yes, you did wrong in that respect.

128
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,120
That's true.

129
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,740
That's all good, but...

130
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,840
But?

131
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,920
Never mind. I'm glad there was no disciplinary action.

132
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,400
Hey, Cho Rong.

133
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,990
Yes?

134
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,450
What is this?

135
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,140
An old colleague of mine from Haesan gave it to me.

136
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,300
He said to buy Jin Kang snacks or something.

137
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,560
You buy her some when you see her.

138
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,940
Go ahead. I'll be in shortly.

139
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,910
Okay.

140
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,860
 I'm sorry. 

141
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,760
 I really didn't want to hear those words. 

142
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,310
 I'm sorry, Cho Rong. 

143
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:12,090
Manager, things didn't work out with Jin Kang.

144
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,960
I think I should tell you. And I didn't want to have any hard feelings.

145
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,470
You introduced us, and it didn't work out so I'm sorry.

146
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,080
Eom Cho Rong!

147
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,470
Would you like a drink?

148
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,980
No, maybe next time. Next time.

149
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,720
 Let's take the bus. 

150
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,730
Let's go!

151
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,130
Oh, I'm going to Hongdae today. I'll drop you off in the area.

152
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, it's okay. I'll just take the bus.

153
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,470
There's going to be traffic. No need to go out of your way.

154
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,330
It's actually faster to take the bus, so I'll just take the bus.

155
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,160
Let's love our public transportation.

156
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,390
Okay.

157
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,360
Then, can you just drop me off at the subway station?

158
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,960
Oh, I said I was going to Hongdae.

159
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,630
It's the opposite direction from the subway station. Just walk.

160
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,690
Take care!

161
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,790
- See you tomorrow!
 - Bye, bye!

162
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,430
Oh, what a pain. I'll take the bus, too.

163
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,190
Want to do that?

164
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,590
 Assistant Manager Im is taking the bus. 

165
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Never mind. There will be traffic. I'll just take the subway.

166
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,330
See you tomorrow!

167
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,340
 Assistant Manager Im is taking the subway. 

168
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,550
 Assistant Manager Im is taking the bus. 

169
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,630
What do you mean by "Assistant Manager Im found the bus"?

170
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,000
Assistant Manager Im found the subway.

171
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,870
It's so nice to walk like this.

172
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,560
I like this time of year the best.

173
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Doesn't it feel like the weather is giving you permission to be a little melancholy?

174
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
Huh? What did you say?

175
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,620
Why? Are you sad it's almost November?

176
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,190
Difficult over something that comes every year?

177
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,240
What are you thinking about?

178
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Just stuff.

179
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,860
Jin Kang broke up with Cho Rong.

180
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,760
For real?

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,870
Cho Rong told me earlier that it didn't work out with Jin Kang.

182
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,010
Wow, what a shame. There aren't many guys like Cho Rong.

183
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,340
Exactly! If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have said that this morning.

184
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,430
Say what?

185
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,700
I told Jin Kang, it's fine,

186
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,890
I trust you and I won't get involved.

187
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,900
Good job!

188
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,550
Even if it's a shame it isn't Eom Cho Rong, what can you do, if they aren't meant to be?

189
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,040
Don't just say it, but be laid back, like this.

190
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,880
Be laid back and just wait.

191
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,330
Why did they break up?

192
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,280
I don't know.

193
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,510
But, I think it has something to do with him.

194
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,750
Kim Moo Yeong.

195
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,980
What the? Do you know something, too?

196
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,670
No, not exactly.

197
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,020
Oh, that's right. The Seongsoo-dong pub.

198
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,250
Did you tell them you're not doing it? You didn't?

199
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,550
What do you think?

200
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,210
You did.

201
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,490
Actually, my CEO really hoped you would take charge of it.

202
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,950
She was hoping we could get the bid with your connection.

203
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,530
Hey, if I was in charge, your company would have been chosen 100%.

204
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,430
That hurts.

205
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,870
But, anyway, why are you so against me doing that job?

206
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,680
It would be more prestigious than what I'm doing now. And I'd make more money. Don't you like money?

207
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,830
Me? No way. Who doesn't like money?

208
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,570
You better earn a lot of money.

209
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,850
I like the money, but

210
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,200
I don't like you being close to those people.

211
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,630
Those people are people who would do anything.

212
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,930
You better keep your promise about letting me ask anything about you that I'm curious about,

213
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,060
because I'm really going to ask you everything.

214
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,290
I have so much that I want to ask you

215
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,170
and a lot that I need to ask.

216
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,150
But I don't want to right now.

217
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,750
I only got angry whenever I would see you.

218
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,890
I got angry, cried, and worried.

219
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,140
And I said to myself that I'd never see you again. I never smiled.

220
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,590
So I want to smile first and then do whatever is needed afterward.

221
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,750
Don't smile.

222
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,880
Why not?

223
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,150
I get scared when you smile.

224
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,180
Dig in.

225
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,960
Okay.

226
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,350
Could we go that way? Let's try going that way.

227
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,920
- You got the drift.
 - Of course.

228
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,270
I don't want to cause my brother concern if possible.

229
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,360
You know that my brother is really concerned about you, don't you?

230
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,980
Yeah.

231
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,730
But I like him though.

232
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,310
No, that's not it. I wouldn't go so far as saying I like him.

233
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,600
But he's fun.

234
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,660
Would I describe it as wanting to mess with him?

235
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,900
Or maybe I want to fight him. In any case,

236
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,440
I end up messing around when I'm with him.

237
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,590
My brother is really funny, isn't he?

238
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,470
You've smiled before.

239
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,230
"I think I'm going to keep hating you."

240
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,590
 Is the cat doing okay? What's his name? 

241
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,700
 Last name, Jin, first name, Kang. Jin Kang. 

242
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,420
 I'm the fool for asking. 

243
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,360
 I think I'm going to keep hating you. 

244
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,700
 Good luck with that. 

245
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,360
 You smiled exactly three seconds after I said that. You did. 

246
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,370
You still remember that.

247
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,740
Oh, that's right. The cat. Did you try looking for him?

248
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,760
I haven't found it.

249
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,260
But I got a text.

250
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,210
He said he has a pretty girlfriend so he's busy. He said not to wait for him.

251
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,830
I think I'm going to keep hating you.

252
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,600
Good luck with that.

253
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,520
It's a flower shop. When did this open?

254
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,410
Let's go.

255
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,980
- Hello!
 - Welcome.

256
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,740
- Are you done getting ready?
 - Yeah.

257
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,710
Fall always means mums. They're nice.

258
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,200
Aren't they pretty? They were selling them on the way home.

259
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
A flower shop opened out front.

260
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,850
Is that so?

261
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,160
Are you going to give me another ride today?

262
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,720
Of course, I should give you a ride.

263
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,980
Oh, that's right. I'm working late today, so don't wait up.

264
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,810
You're going to have to buy the kimbap ingredients.

265
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,760
When we make kimbap tomorrow, we should bring some to Eom Cho Rong.

266
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,790
I wonder if he got to work or not?

267
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,280
What kind of company makes you work late every day?

268
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,120
I have to get a ton of work done ahead of time if I'm going to go on a picnic with you.

269
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,940
Let's go.

270
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,190
 Please give us a word. 

271
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,640
Why is it only being revealed now?!

272
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,590
Please make a statement.

273
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,660
Please show us your face.

274
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,260
Just give us a word.

275
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Policeman Yoo, will you check the other half later when you're going home?

276
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,680
- What? 
 - Kim Moo Yeong. He's getting questioned tomorrow, and his phone line is busy.

277
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,910
It's a headache if he decides to go into hiding.

278
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,760
The interrogation is tomorrow at two.

279
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,020
Okay, 2 pm.

280
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900
 EAGLE 
 Yes.

281
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,690
- I have no battery left. I have to hang up.
 -  Okay. Oh, 

282
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,640
 I'm working late today. Don't come to my office. 

283
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,890
I'm not going. If you happen to go to my house,

284
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,530
you know the yellow mums? Look under there.

285
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,840
What's the reason for turning it down?

286
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,520
I'm going to be learning something,

287
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,630
and I think it would interfere with it.

288
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,740
What are you learning?

289
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,610
How to be a good person.

290
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,600
That's so not you.

291
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,750
Because it doesn't fit me, I'm giving it a try.

292
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,720
This should be reason enough. Right?

293
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,430
I figured you out with just one look.

294
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,210
But you must not know that yet.

295
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,620
We are the same kind of people.

296
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,110
Whatever!

297
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,730
It's already too late for us to become human beings.

298
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,660
What raised me was 80% boredom.

299
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,920
I was born to this life but there's nothing that's especially fun

300
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,720
or that I especially want.

301
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,310
I spot something shiny and start chasing it, but I've been fooled.

302
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,010
It's all trivial and meaningless.

303
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,780
But I never counted it a loss, because it passed the time.

304
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:10,980
The shiniest thing I can see right now is you.

305
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,560
What would you do if you were me?

306
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,720
You'd try to check, wouldn't you?

307
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,540
You'll end up coming to me. You can bet on it.

308
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,210
This tastes bad.

309
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,780
When is he being turned over to the prosecutor?

310
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,820
 The phone has been turned off... 

311
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,140
 Isn't it pretty? They were selling it on the way home. 

312
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,160
 I'm working late tonight so don't wait up. 

313
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,620
 What is it? Do you know something, too? 

314
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,670
 Not exactly. 

315
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:12,090
 Before, when Kim Moo Yeong was taken to the police station as the murderer  

316
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,830
 Jin Kang had called about it. 

317
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,240
 She asked if the Mr. Kim on the news was Kim Moo Yeong. 

318
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,820
 But, her voice was so.... 

319
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,450
 if Kim Moo Yeong is the kid you've been looking for, 

320
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,940
 don't you think he shouldn't be seeing Jin Kang? 

321
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,690
 Hello? 

322
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,270
- Oh, hello?
 - Hello? It's me, it's me.

323
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,660
Why aren't you saying anything? I thought you called by mistake.

324
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,500
 Where are you? Why can't I reach you? 

325
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,770
Did you call a lot? It was on vibrate so I didn't know.

326
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,600
Where are you?

327
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,020
Where else? I'm at work. I told you I'm working late.

328
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,310
Working late?

329
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,000
 Chief, I don't think this has been uploaded. 

330
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,510
 Huh? I uploaded in the logo folder. Just a minute. I'll go look. Oppa, right now, I'm... 

331
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,740
Okay, okay. Get to work, I'm hanging up.

332
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,740
Are you going to my house?

333
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,660
That's right.

334
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,800
Did you not hear the warnings when you were released?

335
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,260
Try not to miss calls from the police. If you miss one, call back as soon as you see it.

336
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,870
If you have a need to leave the city, report it ahead of time.

337
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,280
In the case that you can't be reached for a long period of time, you'll be put on the wanted list.

338
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,710
If you know so well, why couldn't you be reached all day?

339
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,390
My battery ran out. I was going to call after charging it.

340
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,600
Why? Is something wrong?

341
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,000
The interrogation is tomorrow at 2 pm.

342
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,560
Okay.

343
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,980
You are seeing my sister, aren't you?

344
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,930
Don't see her again.

345
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,770
Why not?

346
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
Because I don't have the right?

347
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,590
Not the right. I'm opposed to you because it's you.

348
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,630
Don't ever see her again.

349
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,990
This isn't a request, it's a warning.

350
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,980
Driver, please stop up there.

351
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:34,410
 If you happen to go to my house, you know the yellow mums? Look under there. 

352
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,060
 Kim Moo Yeong. Kim Moo Yeong. 

353
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,770
 Kim Moo Yeong! 

354
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,080
Where are the cups?

355
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,500
Oh, I don't have any. Just give it here.

356
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,730
You don't have any cups?

357
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,030
No.

358
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,010
What kind of dream was it? Was it a nightmare?

359
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,130
Was it a nightmare?

360
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,120
A dream about my dad dying.

361
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,730
A dream about your dad dying?

362
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,770
Yeah.

363
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,810
A dream that he was killed by a gun.

364
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,880
It's the fifth time I've had the same dream.

365
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,850
You keep having the same dream?

366
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,690
The content is the same,

367
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,400
but it gets a little clearer each time.  Like a memory growing clearer.

368
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,430
What kind of dream was it?

369
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,620
It starts out good. I'm extremely happy.

370
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,820
In the dream, I am four years old? Maybe five?

371
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:35,150
 I'm playing with a toy in the forest. I might be playing with a younger sibling. 

372
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,130
 When I get home, my dad... 

373
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,720
 I'm so happy, I'm trying to get to my dad. 

374
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,960
 The sound of the kettle. The water is boiling. 

375
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,950
 And the gun. I see the gun past the steam. 

376
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,820
A gun?

377
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,490
Yeah. He's trying to kill my dad.

378
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,730
It's a total nightmare starting there.

379
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,540
It's so scary.

380
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,930
I can't see the face, but

381
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,650
I definitely see the gun. It looks like he's about to shoot my dad.

382
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,400
I'm about to call out to my dad,

383
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,820
but the gun goes off and my dad collapses.

384
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,010
That's where the dream ends.

385
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,490
But I can't wait up. It's like something is pressing me down.

386
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,300
But then I hear your voice.

387
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,400
My voice?

388
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,300
Yeah, saying, "Kim Moo Yeong."

389
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,830
Like how you called my name earlier.

390
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,460
Really?

391
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,350
Yeah. That's why I thought you were a dream just now, too.

392
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,220
I opened my eyes and you were there.

393
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,650
When did you first have that dream?

394
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,610
When I was in that accident in Yangseon.

395
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,980
I heard your voice then, too.

396
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,290
 Kim Moo Yeong! 

397
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,600
But, how did you know it was my voice?

398
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,580
It was definitely you.

399
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,740
That's so weird.

400
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,510
It might not be a dream, either.

401
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,900
And if it wasn't a dream?

402
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,440
Something from my past that I've forgotten.

403
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,670
I don't have any memories before I was five.

404
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,710
None at all?

405
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,040
No. So I'm not sure if it's age five either,

406
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,910
since I don't know when I was born or anything.

407
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,850
Then what's the first memory you can remember?

408
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,510
Walking.

409
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,050
Walking endlessly to somewhere.

410
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,670
 My legs hurt and I was hungry. 

411
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,570
 And I was anxious because I didn't know where I was, but I kept walking. 

412
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,380
 I think I was worried about someone. 

413
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,230
 I thought someone might be waiting for me, so I couldn't stop. 

414
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,150
Who?

415
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,650
Your mom?

416
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,820
My dad, my mom, me, and my younger sibling.

417
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,000
Doesn't he look like a goofball, my younger brother?

418
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,600
Yeah, he does.

419
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,390
It's my only clue.

420
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,410
A grandmother took me in when I had lost my way.

421
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,370
They say it wasn't even a year before she died.

422
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,600
So the town leader took me to the orphanage.

423
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,910
I was told that even then, this picture was in my pocket.

424
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,740
How does it look?

425
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,250
You look really happy. Everyone is smiling.

426
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,450
Look! There's an angel there too.

427
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,740
Doesn't he look like a police man?

428
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,530
A police man?

429
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,570
But his hat is purple.

430
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,870
I guess not.

431
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,510
I thought my dad was a policeman since a long time ago.

432
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,180
The dad in my imagination is still looking for me.

433
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Somewhere, fervently.

434
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,490
Me, the lost son.

435
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,720
So,

436
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,460
it's not that I was an abandoned child.

437
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,010
I'm a lost child.

438
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,900
Aren't these thoughts childish?

439
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,290
No.

440
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,630
How many times have you had these thoughts?

441
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,340
Countless times. A lot.

442
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,180
What is it?

443
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,280
How do you know that kind of feeling?

444
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,920
I know it, too.

445
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,500
How?

446
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,920
I just do.

447
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,240
I just do.

448
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,050
Look at this. Your family looks so happy.

449
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,220
I would definitely have thought I was a lost child, too.

450
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,560
You think so?

451
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,640
Have you tried looking for your family?

452
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,960
Yeah, once when I was eight and once when I was 20.

453
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
But what of it?

454
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,620
Should we try to find them again?

455
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,210
You must be scared.

456
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,410
Because that dream might be real.

457
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,480
Oh, you're here? You're here early.

458
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,680
Kimbap!

459
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,960
Hey! Say "ah"!

460
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,200
When we made kimbap a long time ago, you loved getting the ends.

461
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,670
You were like a baby bird stuck right next to the cutting board, so happy!

462
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,500
I still think the ends taste the best.

463
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,070
Here, an end.

464
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,200
Go sleep. We can have a late start.

465
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,180
Why? You want to eat before sleeping? You must be hungry. Wait a little.

466
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,650
Oh my, okay.

467
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,580
Oh my.

468
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,730
But, I don't think I'll be able to go to the temple today.

469
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,300
Oh, really? Why not?

470
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,860
Were you really busy at work?

471
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,660
I'm busy at work and...

472
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,960
Oh, and next week there's a bid presentation.

473
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,380
It's kind of a big one. I told my CEO today that I can't go today, but

474
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,580
I still think I should go.

475
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,520
 The lies just came pouring out. 

476
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,660
You must be rubbing off on me.

477
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm joking! Eat up!

478
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,630
But let's not lie from now on.

479
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:10,010
You know how to play a man.

480
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,910
It's good, right?

481
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,790
It's really good.

482
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,150
Your brother could open a kimbap store.

483
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:33,300
He made me kimbap for all the spring picnics and fall sports, without missing a single one.

484
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,660
But why today?

485
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,560
Why do you always go to the temple every November 1?

486
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,130
That's true.

487
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,650
Why is it always on that date?

488
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,310
We just always did that since we lived in Haesan.

489
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,390
 - It's been so long, I've never thought about it. 
 - Are you okay? 

490
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,980
 Oh, thank you! Are you alright? 

491
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,790
 I think I just liked doing it. 
 - Ahjussi, thank you. 

492
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,560
 Okay. 

493
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,390
 Like an annual event between just us. 

494
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:08,710
 Because I looked forward to November 1 more than a school picnic when I was young. 

495
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,110
Oh! Unni, have you arrived?

496
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,850
Thank you so much!

497
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,390
Okay!

498
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,740
Please go on a date with my brother in my place.

499
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,890
Yes!

500
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,560
Haesan Station looks like this.

501
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,500
I thought I'd remember it, but I don't at all.

502
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,290
New Haesan Station.

503
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,670
Haesan Station was originally in Shinhae. It's not there anymore.

504
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:07,630
This is my first time coming to Haesan. I haven't been here since I moved to Seoul.

505
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:13,130
At first, my brother said he was transferred to Seoul so I thought that's what happened.

506
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,240
But it's weird.

507
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,300
When does anyone get transferred from Haesan to Seoul?

508
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,990
It might be different if it was Seoul to Haesan.

509
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,580
My brother deliberately applied for a transfer for me.

510
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,780
He was also a police officer when he was in Haesan?

511
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,680
Yeah. He's been a police since he was 22. So, of course, he was a police officer here.

512
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,100
 You're from Haesan. 

513
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,240
 But you really don't know a single cop there? 

514
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,360
 No, I don't. 

515
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,670
Why?

516
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,940
Nothing.

517
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,440
Let's finish up and go home.

518
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,580
Why?

519
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,760
Kim Moo Yeong's questioning is at 2 pm.

520
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,860
It got pushed to tomorrow afternoon. That punk is in his hometown.

521
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,190
What a good life. Where is his hometown?

522
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,330
Haesan or something? He's already there, so what can be done? We can't go get him.

523
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,430
Where is Officer Yoo?

524
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,810
He had some work,

525
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,840
Work? Oh, I forgot.

526
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,770
It wouldn't be him if he came to work on his day off.

527
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,710
Right, I heard Officer Yoo is requesting a transfer?

528
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,220
He should have done it sooner. It's finally going to be quiet.

529
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,840
But what's the deal with our team leader and Officer Yoo?

530
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,990
And what does he mean that their old team was disbanded because of Officer Yoo?

531
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,740
They say a suspect died during a chase.

532
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,490
Died?

533
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:48,160
 He was a hardened criminal, and while Officer Yoo was chasing him alone, 

534
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,910
 the culprit fell off a cliff, I heard. 

535
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,580
He fell to his death?

536
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,130
So he fell? Or was it suicide?

537
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,790
Whether he misstepped and fell off or

538
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:03,490
committed suicide because there was no way out, how can we catch criminals if we are too careful in chasing them?

539
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,690
The disciplinary committee must have come down hard on him.

540
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,750
No, not at all. They had a lot of violent crimes cases after that.

541
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,800
Social support was with him so it went over fine.

542
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,470
- So why? 
 - That's why Team Leader is upset.

543
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,100
You know how some people are overly sensitive with guilt.

544
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,680
I think he really had a bad time with it.

545
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,570
The team was broken up and the members were scattered.

546
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,540
But seeing a person die right in front of him.

547
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,480
It's enough to shock anyone.

548
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,980
Back then, we had no problem enforcing death sentences.

549
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,930
Even if that bastard hadn't fallen to his death there, he'd have gotten the death sentence for sure.

550
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,870
He was bound to die anyway.

551
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,240
This tastes so good.

552
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,500
It's been 17 years since I tasted your cooking.

553
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,830
Seventeen years?

554
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,560
Yes. Don't you remember?

555
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:50,560
When we worked in Seongbuk Station, I followed Jin Kang to her field day in place of you?

556
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,650
That's right. When Jin Kang was in fifth grade.

557
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,820
You remember, don't you? That's right.

558
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,630
The grade school kid is all grown now

559
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,440
and makes sure her brother can date.

560
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,170
- Just eat. 
 - Yes, Jin Kang's Oppa, thank you for the food.

561
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:19,140
But, Jin Kang doesn't know, does she? Why you bring her here every year?

562
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,340
She doesn't know.  And she shouldn't know.

563
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,060
Still, they are blessed.

564
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,370
They got to see how their daughter is growing every year, thanks to you.

565
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,730
Thank you for thinking that way.

566
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,400
But, we just come.

567
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,200
Once a year, Jin Kang and I get some fresh air.

568
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,900
And spending time at the temple clears your head.

569
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:01,540
♫   Will I be able to reach you?   ♫

570
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:09,950
♫   Will I be visible to you?   ♫

571
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,150
♫   To me as I am feeling cold,    ♫

572
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:25,320
♫   you are like a warm star   ♫

573
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,280
♫   We can do it   ♫

574
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,860
♫   Our fate was destined   ♫

575
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:44,500
♫   right from the beginning   ♫

576
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:53,230
♫   Star, you are the star that can’t be seen in the sky   ♫

577
00:51:53,230 --> 00:52:02,830
♫   Star, my star that’s living in me   ♫

578
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:10,160
♫   It’s fine even if we are left alone in a dark night   ♫

579
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:16,750
♫   Let’s close our eyes together   ♫

580
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:21,070
♫   Star, us  ♫

581
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,770
Should we go?

582
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:44,110
♫ Love is always patient ♫

583
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:52,480
♫ Love is always meek ♫

584
00:52:54,340 --> 00:53:01,730
♫ Of faith, hope and love ♫

♫ The greatest is love ♫

586
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:22,750
♫ The greatest is love ♫

587
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,010
Here you go!

588
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,930
Thank you!

589
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:01,610
It was nothing.

590
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,600
Who is she?

591
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,910
Someone I want to look good for.

592
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,870
Hearing that puts my mind at peace.

593
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:25,340
What is a good person? What kind of person is a good person?

594
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,620
Someone who has a lot of love.

595
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,950
Someone who has a lot of love.

596
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,080
I'm in big trouble then.

597
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,110
I guess so.

598
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:41,140
Why? Did you want to hear that you're not?

599
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:46,700
Wow, I can't believe you made me laugh.

600
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,970
Why did you just leave that day? The day of Sister Theresa funeral?

601
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:00,780
- That day Sister Yang also...
 - I came because I was curious about something.

602
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,480
A long time ago, before I came here,

603
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:11,050
you said a policeman from Haesan had come looking for a boy similar to me, didn't you?

604
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,370
But, you know, Moo Yeong, that kid...

605
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,130
I know.

606
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,780
 Looking for Lost Child 

607
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,440
That person was looking for a child with a burn scar on his right shoulder,

608
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,600
and it was a year before I arrived here.

609
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,160
When I first arrived here,

610
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,240
the director even called the police to confirm after seeing my right arm.

611
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,340
You said that child was already found.

612
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:48,550
So, the child that person was looking for was obviously not me.

613
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,950
But, I still went to the police station. I must have wanted to confirm it.

614
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,040
When?

615
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,110
When I was eight years old.

616
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,360
I thought that person

617
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,180
was my dad.

618
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,970
But, it was as expected.

619
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,360
But why could that be?

620
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,910
I thought I needed to start here.

621
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,680
So in the end...

622
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,100
I'm here again.

623
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,930
 There's a lake behind the orphanage. 

624
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:49,980
 Across the lake, the rock at the halfway point on the trail is my spot. 

625
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,540
 What did you do there? 

626
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:56,260
 I just sat there. 

627
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,820
 What did you do just sitting there? 

628
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:03,970
 I just looked around at this and that. 

629
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,600
 The men fishing. The couples on dates. 

630
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,850
What are you looking at?

631
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,860
I was looking at you.

632
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,490
When you were little. I bet you never listened.

633
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,820
Did you find out anything?

634
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,010
No. Not much.

635
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,220
When I was little, I thought a lot about the orphanage, too.

636
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,850
I wondered how it must feel to grow up in the orphanage.

637
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:59,580
Since your parents died early, if you didn't have your brother, you might have ended up in an orphanage, too?

638
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:03,460
Yeah, I found out in middle school.

639
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:08,580
You know those times? When all those things you can't understand

640
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:13,300
all fit together like a puzzle in an instant.

641
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,780
So you go, "Oh, that's why."

642
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,950
And you just automatically understand.

643
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:26,130
"Why don't I have any baby photos of me?" or,

644
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:31,690
My dad died in 1988, so how was I born in 1990?

645
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,200
Or,

646
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,890
I told you before, right? That I have an older sister who immigrated to the US.

647
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:45,110
I wondered what the meaning of what my sister said to my brother before going to study abroad?

648
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,390
What did she say?

649
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,820
She said, "Your younger sister is not her, but me."

650
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,520
I'm not my brother's biological sister.

651
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:09,350
It doesn't feel that strange to be saying this.

652
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,220
I thought I wouldn't be able to tell this to anyone until I died

653
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,460
because even when I thought about it alone, I felt sorry for my brother.

654
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,950
You must have wondered about a lot of things.

655
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,870
You weren't able to ask your brother a thing because you felt bad.

656
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,080
I thought that a lot, too.

657
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,220
An abandoned child, or a lost child.

658
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:43,370
But I always thought that I was an abandoned child.

659
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:47,000
What type of people were my parents?

660
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,610
Why did they abandon me?

661
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:57,090
My brother was even younger than I am now. Why did he take me in?

662
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,960
The saddest thing is ...

663
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:10,200
that I could never tell him how thankful I was.

664
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:19,400
That I was thankful for raising me when I was a nobody.

665
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,950
Even if I wanted to say it.

666
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,990
I hope he's happy.

667
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,930
He's really amazing.

668
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,680
He's amazing.

669
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,730
Why does rice wine taste so much better when you drink by the mountains?

670
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,450
Wait a minute.

671
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:18,720
I don't know if she's eating dinner or not.

672
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,490
I'm sorry for coming instead of her.

673
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:24,340
Jin Kang should have come. I'm so sorry!

674
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,510
It's strange. You look pretty when you're fired up. To me.

675
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,830
Pretty, my foot.

676
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,970
So what? Are you even worried about me?

677
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:38,290
Me worry about you? Why would I worry about you?

678
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,110
Ah, forget it!

679
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:43,410
Pretty, yeah, right. I knew it.

680
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,250
What did I...

681
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,720
I don't know which direction of yours I'm supposed to follow.

682
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,640
Isn't it true? You worry about everyone else in the world, but you won't worry about me?

683
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,550
Sometimes I have this thought when I see you.

684
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,260
Love is worrying about someone.

685
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,510
That's why you won't ever worry about me.

686
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,130
But you're tough as nails though.

687
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,790
I get it! Did I say anything?

688
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,850
But you better know this;

689
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:22,030
Who worries about you the most?

690
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,980
- Do you know what that is?
 - Ouch!

691
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,480
What are you—? You must be crazy!

692
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,180
- I guessed it, didn't I?
 - Ah, seriously!

693
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,020
I wish I had a time machine.

694
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,980
To do what?

695
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:47,430
To come here and hug you. The little kid Kim Moo Yeong.

696
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,960
It's not too late to do it now.

697
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,360
I want to sleep with you.

698
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,640
Me too.

699
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,570
We are going back to work tomorrow. Let's drink.

700
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,150
To work.

701
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:25,760
If we can't, then just screw it.

702
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,780
Sure.

703
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:33,070
That's right. Live while laughing like this.

704
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,460
- Isn't it nice to be like a fool?
 - Fool!

705
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,650
That's right, you fool.

706
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:43,270
I regard you very, very highly.

707
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,350
Even though everyone says it wasn't your fault,

708
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:50,590
I like you, who have felt bad about it for a long time.

709
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,650
But

710
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:58,560
if one day, you completely forget to come here, and say, "I've lost my mind!"

711
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,850
It would be so great if that day came.

712
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,790
It won't.

713
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,720
Who knows?

714
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:17,200
Maybe later when I'm old and my mind comes and goes.

715
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,360
But if isn't that, I must not forget.

716
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:27,330
The reason I really wanted Im Yoo Ri to turn herself in,

717
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,430
was so she wouldn't be like me.

718
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,520
What are you talking about?

719
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,810
A person died because of me, but I didn't know what to do.

720
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:44,560
I even thought about dying, too. But I couldn't go through with it.

721
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,140
My father was gone and Jin Hee was still

722
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:54,840
in high school. And my mom...

723
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,760
so I had to live somehow.

724
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,920
But the days were so long.

725
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,630
The days were so long.

726
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:17,550
At the time, who knew that time flies by like this?

727
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,600
I was barely 24 years old.

728
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,360
Do you know what was the worst about it?

729
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,960
Not going to prison.

730
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,980
Not being able to pay for my crimes

731
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,390
that tormented me so much.

732
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,250
Why would you go to prison? I think Lee Gyeong Cheol was right.

733
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,060
It's not your fault.

734
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:45,170
Whether he committed suicide or fell to his death because he got cornered,

735
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:48,220
you did your best to capture the criminal.

736
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:53,690
It wasn't suicide, and it wasn't a fall.

737
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:15,390
♫   How long has it been? Do you remember me?  ♫

738
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:23,320
♫   I am walking on top of scattered times   ♫

739
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:30,430
♫   I believe in miracle in the moment of coincidence   ♫

740
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:37,940
♫   I embrace the laughter and pain in that   ♫

741
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:45,260
♫   Though seasons pass quickly and change the scenery    ♫

742
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:54,260
♫   The memories are burnished and come again   ♫

743
01:06:54,260 --> 01:07:00,430
♫   I don’t understand when I look at your face   ♫

744
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:07,930
♫   I  lost my way already   ♫

745
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:15,960
♫   I feel stunned as if I woke up from a long dream .   ♫

746

♫  My love  you are waving in my tears   ♫

747
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:34,200
He didn't fall to his death from a cliff.

748
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:42,420
Because he was never on the run from the start.

749
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,800
I shot him with my gun.

750
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:23,780


751
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:32,130

753
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,520

754
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,870
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 
♫  Someday  ♫

755
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,850
 Is Moo Yeong is dating your sister? 

756
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,620
 Dating? I won't ever allow that! 

757
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,320
 Your sister won't be able to stop herself. 

758
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,700
 It's my first time seeing my brother hate someone that much. 

759
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,390
 Why do you think my brother is acting like that? 

760
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,170
 What time did you say Kim Moo Yeong's questioning is today? 

761
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,830
 Just do your own work. 

762
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:02,200
 What's wrong with an officer asking about a suspect's questioning? Am I wrong? 

763
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,150
 Oppa please stop! Just stop! 

764
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,010
 Who's the one  who raised you until now? 

765
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,020
 I do not intend to make myself look good in front of your brother. 

766
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,000
 Are you saying this even though even though you know what my brother is to me?
