1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:08,020


2
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,170
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 

3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,320
 Was it you?
 My father was killed, wasn't he? 

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,300
 No, your father committed suicide. 

5
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,620
 I'm looking for that child. 

6
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,150
 Do you know what my name is? 

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,600
 In the fall of 1993, 

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,700
 I was at Haesan Hospital, too. I was a first-year intern in the ER. 

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,780
 I treated his burn wounds. 

10
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,990
 Is Moo Yeong Seon Ho? 

11
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,350
 Wow, I'm a little nervous. What is your name? 

12
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,620
 Seon Ho. My name is Kang Seon Ho. 

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,810
 Kang Seon Ho. 

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,140
 Moo Yeong is looking into his past. 

15
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,970
I didn't die. You're not smiling. I said it to make you smile.

16
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,990
Were you really trying to kill me?

17
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,480
It doesn't suit you.

18
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,720
You said a person who kills someone becomes a murderer. A vicious murderer.

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,550
It doesn't suit you.

20
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,980
 Episode 13 

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh, you're here?

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,530
- He's here.
  - He is? 

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,450
Seeing that he came to work, does it mean his resignation was retracted?

24
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,940
 I hope so. 

25
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,010
- Would you like another one?
 - Yeah.

26
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,640
No, thanks. If I eat any more, I won't be able to eat lunch.

27
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,050
Right? It's so filling.

28
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,260
That's why I'm going to eat two and skip lunch.

29
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,770
Should I as well?

30
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,220
When you couldn't win the bid for Jang Sera's Pub in Sungwoo-dong, does it go down your throat so well?

31
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,150
Would you like another one, CEO?

32
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,560
I'll eat it. They're good.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,620
CEO, what is the meaning of the Seon in your name?

34
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,870
What?

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,310
Your name. What is the meaning of the Seon in Hwang Seon Ah?

36
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,450
It means "kind." Can't you tell just looking at me?

37
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,410
Wow, that's so great.

38
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,430
What's so great? It's so common.

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,000
Is it? It's even better if it's common. Because it's true about being kind.

40
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,840
What's wrong with her?

41
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,710
Let's say it was recommended you resign since you will need the unemployment benefits.

42
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,120
This is the best I can do. Do you feel it's unfair?

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,140
No, I don't. Thank you for everything.

44
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,330
 Were you able to turn in your resignation? 

45
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,360
 I couldn't. I was fired before I could resign. 

46
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,660
- Yeah?
 - Fired?

47
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,820
 Yes, recommended to resign. 

48
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,440
 I was going to  quit anyway, so it worked out well. 

49
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,060
The CEO said he did as much as he could for me.

50
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,820
I guess that's true.

51
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,060
I'm off early today. Want to meet up?

52
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,150
What time are you done?

53
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,340
Okay.

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,190
 Jeolgudae, Mount Geumah 

55
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,540
 Jeolgudae, Mount Geumah 

56
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,300
 Jeolgudae, Mount Geumah 

57
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,230
 That's what everyone calls it. The cliff there. 

58
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,580
Kang Seon Ho!

59
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,020
Let's take a photo.

60
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,420
A photo?

61
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,320
A commemorative photo.

62
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,570
Look at everything you prepared.

63
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,370
See?

64
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,330
Come here.

65
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,820
- You can take it from here?
 - Yup!

66
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,300
Look.

67
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,620
One, two, three!

68
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,040
One, two, three!

69
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,750
One, two, three, V.

70
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,380
Should we look?

71
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,700
Did it turn out okay?

72
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,590
It looks great. I'll send it to you, too.

73
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,070
But a photo to commemorate what?

74
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,970
To commemorate you being unemployed.

75
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,160
What?

76
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,490
Dummy, don't you know?

77
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,810
Of course, Kang Seon Ho, it's to commemorate you finding your real name.

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,190
"Kind" Seon, "High" Ho. I really like it!

79
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,200
Who is...?

80
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,090
Who said, it's "Kind" Seon and "High" Ho? I said I don't know the Chinese root for them, and you just decided on those.

81
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,550
No, I don't know about the Ho, but the Seon,

82
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,830
for some reason I feel it definitely means "kind."

83
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,630
Why? I like it a lot, don't you?

84
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,400
Like it or not,

85
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,120
it still feels awkward, like it's someone else's name.

86
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,270
♫   Our fate was destined right from the beginning   ♫

87
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,480
A name is such an interesting thing.

88
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,600
When I say, "Kim Moo Yeong," it has a sad feeling for some reason.

89
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,420
But when I say, "Kang Seon Ho," I feel like it sounds kind and tenacious.

90
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,460
Do you like it that much?

91
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,340
Yeah, I like it that much.

92
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,610
I think your parents are really good people.

93
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,750
♫   It’s fine even if we are left alone in a dark night   ♫

94
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,870
I'm sure they're good people since they named their son that way.

95
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,600
- You think so?
 - Yeah.

96
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,130
Did the doctor tell you anything else other than your name?

97
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,230
 Your father committed suicide. 

98
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,470
Well, pretty much.

99
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,190
I must be living vicariously.

100
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,980
I feel like I found my name.

101
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,150
We can find out your name, too. Let's try looking into it.

102
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,310
I will later.

103
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,160
Won't my brother tell me in time?

104
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,010
I'm going to wait until my brother tells me.

105
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,450
 Kang Soon Goo 

106
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,680
I was hoping to see the fall colors, but all the leaves have dropped.

107
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,950
I guess so. A ghost is going to appear.

108
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,750
But it's really nice here. It's so open.

109
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,220
It's a good thing we came this way, isn't it?

110
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
It's nice.

111
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,360
My father committed suicide.

112
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,830
He said it was on the mountain,

113
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,110
but I'm not sure.

114
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,990
Either the doctor knows but isn't telling me,

115
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,960
or he can't because he really doesn't know.

116
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,510
Anyway,

117
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,230
I guess the result is in.

118
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,580
That way my family wasn't that happy.

119
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,170
Your father

120
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,960
passed away.

121
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,500
Already.

122
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,670
I'm planning to go to Haesan.

123
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,270
My father.

124
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,610
I want to go there once.

125
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,120
Where in Haesan?

126
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,720
There is a place called Jeolgudae on Mount Geumah.

127
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,100
It must be a cliff. That's where it happened.

128
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,510
Should I go with you?

129
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay. Go and greet him nicely.

130
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,770
Oh.

131
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,870
But what do I say?

132
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,990
To greet him. I don't even know his name.

133
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,900
How do I greet him?

134
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,550
"Father."

135
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,640
That's all you need to say.

136
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,730
"Father, I'm Seon Ho."

137
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,080
Oh.

138
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,420
That's what I'll do.

139
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,480
It's coming.

140
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,890
You take that first today.

141
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,110
Okay. It's so hard to date in secret.

142
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,860
We can't even take the bus together.

143
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,060
Why do I feel so anxious?

144
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,310
You're just going to greet him.

145
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,580
But why do I suddenly...?

146
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,010
No need to feel anxious.

147
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,520
I'll be back soon.

148
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,600
 Is Moo Yeong Seon Ho?  

149
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,510
 Yes. 

150
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,860
 Moo Yeong is that child Kang Seon Ho. 

151
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,380
 You jerk! Get out of the way! 

152
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,810
 You're not even human. 

153
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,910
 If you're a human, 

154
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,600
 if you're human, even in the slightest degree... 

155
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,260
 I was just at your office. Want it? 

156
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,390
 You must clearly be mistaken. 

157
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,940
 You can't become a cop just because you're smart and can pass a test. 

158
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,070
 You have to be human to be a cop, not a murderer like you. 

159
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,890
 He's a child to be pitied! 

160
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,720
 He grew up under difficult circumstances. 

161
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,180
 Even if you don't do that, he got hurt a lot. 

162
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,310
 Why did he commit suicide? 

163
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,860
 I don't know. 

164
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,170
 If it were you, would you be able to stop here? 

165
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,850
 I've never stopped anything I've started. 

166
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,110
 What more do you think there is? 

167
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,710
 A gun. 

168
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,340
 I still  

169
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,880
 dream about my father being killed. 

170
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,430
 For some reason, everything is telling me to stop, 

171
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,220
 as if I won't ever be able to return if I go there. 

172
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,500
A bottle of soju, please.

173
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,920
 It looks like a painted screen. 

174
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,230
 So I don't know why people call it Jeolgudae (which means mortar pad). 

175
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,960
♬   Do you remember me   ♬

176
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,750
♬   I am wandering over time   ♬

177
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,560
♬  which has been placed in disarray  ♬

178
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,430
♬  Seasons rush by  ♬​

179
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,760
♬   And change the landscape too   ♬

180
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,270
♬   Just memories become engraved   ♬

181
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:39,720
♬   And again  we  ♬

182
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,770
 I was going to bow, but it felt awkward, so I didn't. 

183
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,770
 Actually, I couldn't even say, Father. 

184
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,450
 I'm not sad. 

185
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,610
 If I fell asleep like this, it seemed like I would have a good dream. 

186
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,650
 Dad? 

187
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,500
 Jeolgudae (Mortar Pad) 

188
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,300
 Jeolgudae 
750m 

189
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,050
 Yoon! 

190
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,600
Yoon.

191
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,640
 I feel like I've come home. 

192
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,300
  Jeolgudae, Mount Geumah, Haesan 

193
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,070
 I really feel like I've returned. 

194
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,860
 Look at this! 

195
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:21,020
♬   In a small alley that's barely seen  ♬

196
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,420
 Dad 

197
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,550
 A gun? 

198
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,790
 Yes, something Moo Yeong said before is bothering me. 

199
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,850
 Is there a gun related to Moo Yeong's father's death? 

200
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,520
 Did you get back okay? 

201
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,670
 For some reason, everyone is telling me to stop, as if, if I go there, I'll never be able to return. 

202
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,440
  I stopped by at a mart and bought a bottle of soju.  I asked for directions. I can see Jeolgudae. 

203
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,730
 It looks like a painted screen. I don't know why people call it Jeolgudae. I thought of bowing down,  

204
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,820
  but it felt awkward so I didn't.  Actually, I couldn't' even call him father. I'm not sad. 

205
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,680
 Did you get back okay? 

206
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,230
So he really was that child.

207
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,060
That's upsetting. If I'm like this, you must feel...

208
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,120
Are you okay?

209
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,940
Jin Kang said this,

210
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,370
that he was hurt by people like me.

211
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,320
In order to protect one's own child,

212
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,660
he was hurt by people who didn't care what happened to another person's child.

213
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,550
How did things end up this way?

214
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,450
I did it because I was scared.

215
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,750
Kim Moo Yeong was like a car without any brakes.

216
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,830
And Jin Kang had no intention of getting off that car.

217
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,670
I didn't know where it would end up if I didn't force it to stop somehow.

218
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,750
So like Jin Kang said,

219
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,880
in order to protect my own child, I harmed another child.

220
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,100
That child

221
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,160
is really Seon Ho.

222
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,200
What do you plan to do now?

223
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,810
He said this before. No,

224
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm the one who said it. "Nothing is for free."

225
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,360
 Nothing is for free in this world. 

226
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,420
 There's no such thing as a lucky break. 

227
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,360
 That's good. I hate things for free. 

228
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,770
 I like things like, "Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth." 

229
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,310
It's true. Nothing is free in this life.

230
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,190
If he wants, that eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth,

231
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,900
that's okay, too.

232
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,160
Manager Yoo.

233
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,690
- Oppa! 
 - Hey!

234
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,470
Oh! Look who this is!

235
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,120
My Yoo Jin Kang!

236
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,100
- Jin Kang, sorry, I let him drink too much. 
 - Unni ...

237
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,690
- It really is, my homely Jin Kang. 
  - Quickly, into his room.

238
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,950
It's not like you fed it to him. He  (informal) drank because he wanted to. 

239
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,700
He? He?  (informal speech) 

240
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,660
This guy!

241
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,020
Just leave it, I'll take care of it.

242
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,090
Look at this. This chestnut.  Who is this chestnut?

243
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,550
Oppa!

244
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,230
Sorry.

245
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,780
Don't be sorry.

246
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,640
 But you really must have shot a gun. 

247
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,970
 What happened to him? 

248
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,400
 Did he die? 

249
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,350
 Have we seen each other somewhere? 

250
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,020
 Not at the police department. Before that. Long before? 

251
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,840
 Probably not. 

252
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,480
Did you get back okay?

253
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,330
Why are you so out of breath?

254
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,160
I hurried over here because I couldn't wait to see you.

255
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,070
Hold on.

256
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,020
You went to your house?

257
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,930
Yeah.

258
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,900
The house you grew up in?

259
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,340
Yeah.

260
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,440
Where? How did you find it?

261
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,300
Just. Passing by. In the woods.

262
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,410
In the woods?

263
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,710
Yeah, a house like a picture.

264
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,410
It's a lie.

265
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,810
Hmm?

266
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,630
I'm lying.

267
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,350
There wasn't a house. I'm just saying

268
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,030
that I felt like there would be a house like that.

269
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,400
What the? I was excited temporarily, thinking you really found it.

270
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,920
Would it have been good if I found it?

271
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,980
Of course, it would have been. The house you grew up in with your family.

272
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,330
You know how people recall unexpected memories once they get there.

273
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,700
That's true.

274
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,360
Ah. Did you greet your father?

275
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,640
Yeah.

276
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:27,600
- You said your brother was a police officer in Haesan, right? 
 - Yeah.

277
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,320
When did you move to Seoul?

278
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,880
Oh, the summer I turned seven, so...

279
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,040
It was the summer of '96 then.

280
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,940
You're so quick at calculating that.

281
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,150
Why did you move to Seoul?

282
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,800
I'm not sure, but I think it was because of me.

283
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,180
I couldn't adjust to kindergarten there.

284
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,460
And also, my mother passed away that spring.

285
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,310
So probably because of this and that.

286
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,930
But why are you suddenly asking?

287
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,780
- Policemen are shift workers, right? 
- Yeah.

288
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,000
Paid weekly. There are a lot of policemen who work on off-duty days and holidays.

289
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,600
But my brother doesn't care. He takes time off no matter what.

290
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,660
When are his days off?

291
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,780
This month it's the 4th, 8th, 12th.  All multiples of 4?

292
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,600
He'll be working day shift today then.

293
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,980
But why are you suddenly curious about that?

294
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,030
Didn't I tell you? It was my dream to become a cop since I was young.

295
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,480
So I'm quite interested in police work.

296
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:39,440
That's right. That's why you said you thought your father was a cop, right?

297
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,650
Yeah.

298
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,070
Since when do you go exercising in the morning?

299
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,280
I was wondering where you were at the crack of dawn.

300
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,960
I won't be able to once it gets cold, so I'm going to do it every day for now.

301
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,670
Why? Do you want to join me?

302
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,950
No, thanks.

303
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,030
Bird poop.

304
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,270
Gross.

305
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,540
 0407 

306
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,780
There.

307
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,660
Hey! Hey, Sleepy head! Wake up! Homely, wake up!

308
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,510
Are we already there? This isn't it.

309
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,220
Go, go, hurry! The bus is here. Get out!

310
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,320
Okay.

311
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,940
Don't forget the movie at six!

312
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,960
 Looking for Missing Child 

313
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,240
 Kang Seon Ho, five years old, male 

314
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,060
Kim Moo Yeong.

315
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,450
Kim Moo Yeong?

316
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,580
Yes. Should I send him in?

317
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,570
No.

318
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,930
She's busy today.

319
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,260
I'll come back next time. You know my number, right?

320
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,660
Call me when she's available.

321
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,850
It's too easy if I meet him right away.

322
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,120
If it's okay,

323
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,750
she might be able to make some time. In two hours.

324
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,560
 Director, Kim Moo Yeong is on his way in. 

325
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,660
Hello.

326
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,550
Take a seat.

327
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,430
What is it?

328
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,690
I have a favor to ask.

329
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,300
A favor? What is it?

330
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,230
I need a gun. Can you get me one?

331
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,020
A gun?

332
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,210
A gun.

333
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,240
I thought hard for two hours about why you would come to see me.

334
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,080
Since you will be investigated by the prosecutors, do you now realize that being a cop doesn't suit you?

335
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,450
Or if you had regrets about turning down my offer.

336
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,640
But, a gun?

337
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,680
So that's the kind of reason you needed to come to see me.

338
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,910
But what can be done? It would be difficult.

339
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,670
If I do something difficult, what would you do for me?

340
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,480
Anything.

341
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,930
 Looking for Lost Child 

342
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,690
What is this?

343
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,420
I want to know about that kid.

344
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,990
Why someone made that and was looking for him. What kind of people his parents are.

345
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,200
Kang Seon Ho. Who is it?

346
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,200
It's refreshing. I feel rejuvenated now.

347
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,420
This is really refreshing.

348
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,050
I can't believe Jin Kang is helping me recover from a hangover.

349
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,800
Aren't you glad you helped raise me?

350
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,690
Yeah. Even though I didn't do a thing, totally.

351
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,050
Unnie.

352
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,740
Hmm?

353
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,670
What do you think about my brother?

354
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,240
What about your brother?

355
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,960
What do you think about my brother as your boyfriend?

356
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Boyfriend?

357
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,160
Jeez... As a boyfriend?

358
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,880
Hey!  What do you mean as a boyfriend? What nonsense.

359
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,930
Really?

360
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,170
It wouldn't work, would it?

361
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,740
Even I don't think it would work.

362
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,150
You would be wasted on my brother.

363
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,110
Hey, what do you mean a waste? I'm a divorcée.

364
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,110
And where would you find such a sincere man like Manager Yoo—

365
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,820
This movie is supposed to be really funny.

366
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,890
I feel like I won the lottery.

367
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,560
Jin Kang bought me hangover soup and now a movie.

368
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,040
Oh, that's right! I feel so bad.

369
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,400
What?

370
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,820
I left something at work.

371
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,100
Oh, no. I'm fine, so just go.

372
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,250
- It's okay, you can go.
 - What do you think about him instead?

373
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,800
Oh, Jin Kang!

374
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,560
I know I was a little obvious, but...

375
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,600
Have a good time.

376
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,430
You're sister is so obvious.

377
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,620
Let's go.

378
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,810
Smile a little, would you?

379
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,970
Smile. Just smile.

380
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,490
 Where are you? 

381
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,420
- You're here.
 - Yeah.

382
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,220
- You fixed it.
 - Huh?

383
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,500
I fixed it?

384
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,430
I brushed the dust from inside and turned the key and it worked.

385
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,090
Oh, really?

386
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,550
Where did you get it?

387
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,060
I found it.

388
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,130
Found it?

389
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,470
Yeah, in Haesan.

390
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,700
What about the arm?

391
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,590
- It's lost.
 - Lost?

392
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,830
Yeah.

393
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,900
It wasn't there from the start.

394
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,630
I guess that's why it was discarded. Because an arm is missing.

395
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,360
I'm going to wash my hands.

396
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,570
I see.

397
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,980
That's why it was discarded.

398
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,890
But where were you? I texted you earlier.

399
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,720
Oh. I stopped by somewhere.

400
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,950
 Smile. Just smile. 

401
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,760
 I said to smile. Smile! 

402
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,490
 It hurts. 

403
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,320
 What hurts? I'm doing it to make you smile. 

404
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,460
 Smile. Smile. 

405
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,850
 Made you smile! 

406
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,120
 Here are the tickets. 

407
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,060
 To the left. 

408
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,180
Hmm?

409
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,250
What's wrong? You left the water running.

410
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,510
And you don't hear me. What are you thinking about?

411
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,010
What are you thinking about?

412
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,620
You're just you.

413
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,200
Huh?

414
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,680
No matter what happens,

415
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,580
you  are just ...

416
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,600
you to me.

417
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,920
What do you mean?

418
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,810
What do you mean you being you?

419
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,090
I'm just saying.

420
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,780
Jin Kang did this for nothing.

421
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,060
You have no idea what the movie was about, do you?

422
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,980
Huh?

423
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,950
What do you mean? It was so funny.

424
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,880
You didn't even laugh once.

425
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,120
I thought I did. Didn't I?

426
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,990
It's okay, even if you're thinking about other things.

427
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,820
Let's just walk.

428
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,450
It's really okay. Go ahead.

429
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,490
Just think about other things all you want.

430
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,500
This morning, that guy stopped by our house.

431
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,090
What do you mean he stopped by your house?

432
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:35,090
After Jin Kang and I left for work, he secretly got in somehow.

433
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,470
That's trespassing.

434
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,250
I guess so, it's trespassing.

435
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,660
You can laugh at that?

436
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,800
So?

437
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,090
So, what? I'm just saying it happened.

438
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,300
I get to see a gun thanks to you.

439
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,120
What do you think?

440
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,180
I didn't realize how cool it was until I saw it up close.

441
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:28,030
I think guns are beautiful because they're dangerous.

442
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,410
Don't you think it resembles someone?

443
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,600
Take a seat.

444
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:50,430
What are you going to do with it? Are you really planning to kill someone?

445
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,460
Seriously.

446
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,370
If you really kill someone with it, you know it will make things difficult for me, don't you?

447
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,040
I won't tell anyone you got it for me.

448
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,590
You must really be planning to kill someone.

449
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,630
Do you know why I'm doing such a dangerous thing for you?

450
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,890
Aren't you at all curious?

451
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,140
I am curious.

452
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,340
Because I want you.

453
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:27,970
Like something in my pocket. Completely mine.

454
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,720
I've fallen for you.

455
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,410
"Don't get caught." Do you remember?

456
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,250
 Don't get caught. 

457
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,090
 There was an accident. I was curious as to what happened. 

458
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,140
 I looked at Seung Ah's car's dashcam. 

459
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,610
 I couldn't understand what was being said at first. 

460
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,750
 I rewound it maybe ten times? 

461
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:04,700
Then I heard it. "Don't get caught."

462
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:09,430
I went crazy with delight.

463
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,450
My goodness, there's someone else just like me!

464
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,990
I am?

465
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:18,200
I told you so. That we're alike.

466
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,040
Like another sprout coming from the same root.

467
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:30,410
I'll give it some thought. Thanks for this.

468
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,160
You aren't taking any more bullets?

469
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,300
This is enough.

470
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,450
What about this child?

471
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,100
 Looking for Missing Child 

472
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:46,230
I'm a little confused, whether I should get angry or not.

473
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:50,560
This kid is connected to your girlfriend.

474
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,980
My girlfriend?

475
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,820
Yoo Jin Kang. Isn't that why you asked me to look into it?

476
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:04,190
Because it's the child that Yoo Jin Gook, Yoo Jin Kang's brother was looking for?

477
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:09,800
 Looking for Missing Child 

478
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,380
Officer Yoo Jin Gook was the one looking for this child?

479
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,120
Yeah.

480
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,840
You really must not have known.

481
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,830
 Yoo Jin Gang
 Seoul Bank 

482
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:27,150
 0524 

483
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,080
 KG Savings Account
 Seoul Savings Account 

484
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:50,160
 Why was he looking for me? 

485
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,590
You?

486
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:58,080
It's me. Kang Seon Ho, this child.

487
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,350
You should have said so sooner.

488
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,240
Although it's been changed now, until June of '96,

489
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,590
Yoo Jin Gook was the owner of this number.

490
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,240
It was so upsetting when I found that out.

491
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,160
I thought you were making me do your girlfriend's dirty work.

492
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,510
I don't know my father's name.

493
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:32,310
They say he committed suicide in Haesan in fall of '93 at Jeolgudae, Mt. Geumha.

494
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:35,670
I really don't think it was a suicide.

495
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:38,270
I think my father was murdered.

496
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,220
He's your father, but you don't know his name.

497
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,980
They say it was suicide, but he was murdered.

498
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,960
Okay. I'll look into it.

499
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,180
It shouldn't take long.

500
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,790
Now you recognize my worth.

501
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,860
This is as easy as child's play.

502
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,760
Then one more thing. I'm looking for my family.

503
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,940
Your family?

504
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,500
My mom and younger brother.

505
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:16,060
A younger brother about two or three years younger.

506
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,530
Yoon.

507
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,930
I'm not sure, but I think it's Kang Yoon.

508
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,240
Kang Yoon?

509
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,590
So, you want to find your younger brother.

510
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,420
Why?

511
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,700
I mean, I understand looking for your mother.

512
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,740
She could be filthy rich. But a younger brother,

513
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,120
isn't it better not to have one?

514
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,770
If he's lost, you should be thankful. Why look for him?

515
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,130
I need to find him.

516
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,680
We must not be as similar as you had thought.

517
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,950
Thanks for the help.

518
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,910
 Unni So Jung 

519
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,630
How late are you working tonight?

520
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,830
 10 pm at the very earliest. 

521
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,930
 But it will probably be past midnight. I'll see you tomorrow morning. 

522
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,670
 Okay. 

523
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,120
You're here.

524
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:53,720


525
01:01:53,720 --> 01:02:00,070
♫  Moonlight, when the light fades this night   ♫

526
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:07,250
♫  These stars fade again. Will we be like that?   ♫

527
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,430
♫  When this dark night   ♫

528
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,850
 The Smile Has Left Your Eyes 
♫  passed   ♫

529
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,700
 Yeah, I killed him. 

530
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,160
 Yeah, I killed him.  Your father Kang Soon Goo. 

531
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,660
 I thought you were a police officer, 

532
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,970
 but you're a murderer. You ruined my childhood. 

533
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,930
 People like you are the most repulsive. 

534
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,530
 What brings you here at this hour? 

535
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,390
 I'm returning this. 

536
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,410
 I used one bullet. 

537
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,320
 In the end, you will be injuring yourself. 

538
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,170
 You will inflict wounds to yourself and will hurt those who care for you. 

539
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,330
 I wish I could hold you tight and never let go 

540
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,780
 so you can't go anywhere. 

541
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,400
 Even if I have nothing and no matter how far I go, 

542
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,210
 I will come back. 

543
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:46,260
 To you. 

544
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,470
♫   These stars fade again   ♫
