1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,640
Haotian.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,320
Let's go.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,560
I'm tired.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,400
Come up.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,120
Good job.

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,800
Do you like him that much?

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,480
Just because he looks like Lin Haotian,

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
At first,

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,120
my curiosity

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,360
and my feelings for him

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,200
because he looks like Haotian.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,960
But when I got to know him,

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
they are different.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,680
He's cheerful

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
and cheerful.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,080
He shines into my life like a ray of light.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,360
He's a very special person.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,960
Do you trust him?

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't know.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
But these are not important.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,800
What's important now is

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,479
I must protect the company.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,200
and my dad's work.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,960
As your brother,

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,200
to remind you.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,880
The shareholders

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,400
are coveting you.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
Don't let them

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,320
anything on you.

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,960
Got it.

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,560
Got it.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Don't worry.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,600
This new shareholder

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,280
Mr. Jia

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,800
He's an international college student.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,479
A master of finance.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,680
He's been working in Wall Street for years.

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
He's young and promising.

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,120
And when he was in college,

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,039
he was Mr. Li's senior.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,479
During school,

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,040
they had a special relationship.

44
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,120
Mr. Lu.

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
Li Youran

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,600
What does she want?

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Does she want to start a company

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,920
or the harem?

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,840
Exactly.

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,040
Gu Nanshan didn't clean his ass.

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,720
Another Jia Yunsheng.

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
If one day

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,880
the two concubines fight again,

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,920
Isn't this the company's laughing stock?

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Mr. Lu.

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,160
At this time,

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
you have to help us.

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,200
Our hard work

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
in it.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,240
Mr. Li is young.

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
She's more open-minded.

62
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,200
I don't care if her private life is open or not.

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
But the company

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
can't let her mess around.

65
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,040
After all, she is the major shareholder of the company.

66
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,200
and the president's first choice.

67
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,240
We should respect her.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,960
The company is having diplomatic problems.

69
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Let's see how Mr. Li handles it.

70
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
If it works,

71
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,040
we'll work for her.

72
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,560
What if it doesn't work?

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,440
we have done

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,920
to Li.

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,520
Then we'll

76
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
listen to you.

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,760
Mr. Li.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,480
I found the person you asked me to find.

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,960
I'll send you the address later.

80
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,360
Okay, thank you.

81
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,520
Come on.

82
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Let's drink.

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,480
Eat and drink.

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
There's an idiot.

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
He gave me 80,000 won.

86
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,120
and asked me to stay in the hotel with him for an hour.

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll kiss him when I go out.

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,440
Smells good.

89
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,640
Get up

90
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,000
Why don't you sleep more?

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,560
I have work to do later.

92
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,440
What happened to your face?

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,120
Nothing.

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,240
I fell down on my bike yesterday.

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,040
Don't worry.

96
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Breakfast will be ready soon.

97
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
Go sit down.

98
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,640
We have an interview later.

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,760
We have to go together.

100
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,120
Does it hurt?

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
From now on,

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
you have to be careful.

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,760
It's almost done.

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
Let's get ready to go.

105
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,080
Over.

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Bunny, look at the time.

107
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
Why are you still here?

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
As a rookie,

109
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Of course a stupid bird has to fly first.

110
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
Hurry up and mend it.

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,040
Sit down and wait for me.

112
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
It'll be ready soon.

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,040
The one on the right is Uncle Li

114
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,560
Who's on the left?

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,840
A partner of my dad.

116
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,480
Why haven't I seen him in the company?

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,680
I heard he did something wrong to the company.

118
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
He jumped off a building and committed suicide.

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
It's time to get off work.

120
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
I know something delicious.

121
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,840
I'll treat you to supper tonight.

122
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
Okay.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
I'll come back tomorrow.

124
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Take a look.

125
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
There's an idiot.

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,640
He gave me 80,000 won.

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,080
He was framed.

128
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,600
Kiss him when you go out.

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
A fly won't bite the Seamless Egg.

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
If he didn't look so unreliable,

131
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
who would frame him on purpose?

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,240
What if these people

133
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,800
but me?

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Can you stop

135
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
take everything on yourself?

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,159
It's not his fault.

137
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,040
It's good that he doesn't blame me.

138
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Are you in love with him?

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,120
Are you going?

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm here.

141
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Where are you?

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
About face.

143
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,600
Now go forward.

144
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,920
Do you see the table in front

145
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,800
Now turn around and sit down.

146
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Are you happy?

147
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes.

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
Do I look good?

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

150
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,000
But I don't think it's as good as you.

151
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Do you like it?

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Yes.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,039
I like it too.

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Thank you.

155
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
For what?

156
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
Today,

157
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
today.

158
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,960
Good night.

159
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,720
Good night.
