1
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Xinyao.

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,920
There's something wrong with my dad's death.

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,000
is strange.

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,480
What do you mean?

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,120
I went to the detention center to see Lu Jian'an.

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,040
He told me himself

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,080
my dad's death is not that simple.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,680
Do you believe

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
Lu Jian'an's words?

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,000
I believe you.

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,920
I think

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,480
he's reminding me of something.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
You mean

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,000
Lu Jian'an is just a pawn.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,320
Behind him,

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,880
behind him.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,960
I even think

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,400
even Lu Jian'an doesn't know his real identity.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,039
Xinyao.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,080
Who do you think this person is?

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,840
If this person really exists,

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,560
he must be the closest person to you.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,520
No matter what,

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,200
we must find him.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,720
Answer the phone.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,800
Have you completed the mission?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,240
Three days is too urgent.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,520
Can you give me a few more days?

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,520
You have no right to bargain.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,120
Three days later,

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,080
I'm leaving.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Disappear.

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,120
Remember.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
You're just an actor.

35
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
You can act

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,440
the script.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,440
Even if three days don't work, five days will do.

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,759
Mr. Li.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
Gu Nanshan

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
We didn't find anything about him.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
No information?

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,280
What does that mean?

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,480
This person appears out of nowhere.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
No birth certificate.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,079
No ID.

46
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,240
or interpersonal relationship.

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,960
Except

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
named Gu Yifu,

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,280
Who is he?

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,040
I think he's his father.

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,360
He's terminally ill.

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,600
I found this

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,480
in foreign medical records.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,280
This is the only person Gu Nanshan contacts.

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,320
How about this?

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
Help me find out more clues

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
to find more clues.

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
Okay.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,120
Gu Nanshan.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
Who are you?

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
It's all because of you.

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,400
It's time to make a decision.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,920
You're finally back.

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,320
Did you drink?

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,520
A little.

66
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,079
Are you unhappy?

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
No.

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,120
Look how happy I smile.

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,760
I want to drink too.

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,120
Drink with me.

71
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,360
We're home.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
We're home.

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I want

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,440
stay longer.

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,240
Honey.

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,680
We've been married for so long.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,080
since we got married.

78
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,920
So we can take this opportunity

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
we can have a drink

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,040
and have a good chat.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,159
Where are your family?

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,280
Why have you never mentioned them?

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,520
My mom passed away a long time ago.

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
My dad raised me alone.

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Why didn't you tell me

86
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
to bring me to see him?

87
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,880
Maybe

88
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,920
he had a hard life.

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
He has thought it through.

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,600
Outside,

91
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,280
travel around the country.

92
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,560
Really?

93
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,480
Let's play a game.

94
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,480
Sure. What do you want to play?

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,680
Truth or Dare.

96
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,760
Rock, paper, scissors.

97
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,480
But the loser has to take a sip.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,840
Rock, paper, scissors.

99
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,360
You lost.

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Choose one.

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
Dare.

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Truth.

103
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,600
Truth.

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,200
What is your wish now?

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,240
Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
I want to

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,720
disappear for three days.

108
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,800
No one can find me.

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Come on.

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,159
You lost again.

112
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,440
I lost again.

113
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,640
What will you choose this time?

114
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,280
Dare.

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,560
Dare.

116
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,000
Dare.

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,200
I haven't decided yet.

118
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
You owe me one.

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Come on.

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,360
Again.

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
You can't choose Dare this time.

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,920
You can only choose the truth.

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,600
Now I want to ask you

125
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,760
what do you want to do the most?

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me think.

127
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,080
Think about it.

128
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
Think about it.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
I want...

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,440
I want to love

131
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,640
again.

132
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,880
This time,

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,040
I want to hear

134
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,680
her explanation.

135
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,760
and see what she's thinking.

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Until the end

137
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,360
Look at the person I love the most.

138
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,640
is you.

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
With the improvement of life level,

140
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,920
tourism industry has become

141
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,280
of global economic development.

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,040
The concept of health city is health Gavin.

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,240
Nanshan.

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,720
Why are you here?

145
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
Take three days off for Mr. Li.

146
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,400
I'll pay you back when it's due.

147
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Nanshan.

148
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
Thank you for these days.

149
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,680
I'm very happy.

150
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
What about today?

151
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,760
The starry sky today.

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,240
Do you like it?

153
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,720
I like it very much.

154
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,440
Unfortunately,

155
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,080
you can't see the brightest star.

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Why?

157
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,560
Because the brightest star

158
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,640
is you.

159
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,200
glib-tongued.

160
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,440
Really.

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
I mean it.

162
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,600
Believe it or not,

163
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
it's the luckiest thing

164
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,960
to meet you in my life.

165
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
I believe you.

166
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
From now on,

167
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,320
no matter where I am,

168
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,640
no matter how far I am from you

169
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,600
As long as I look up,

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
I can see your light.

171
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
As long as I look up,

172
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,640
I can see the direction of my home.

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
But I won't allow you to stay so far away from me.

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,640
I want you to stay by my side forever.

175
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,240
I want to be like this forever.

176
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,799
Let's be like this forever.

177
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,799
Really?

178
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Of course.

179
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
I want to give you a gift.

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
What is it?

181
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,240
I want to give you a baby.
