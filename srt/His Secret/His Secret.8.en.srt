1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,320
Xin Yao.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,680
What's wrong?

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,720
What?

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,480
Who was the one

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,600
who drove you to work?

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,440
Well...

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,480
That's Yunsheng.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,080
My car broke down.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,360
I asked him to call a tow truck for me.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,080
and send me to the company.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,240
Senior.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,400
I thought you were in a relationship.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm the first one to tell you about my relationship.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,200
That's true.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,080
Go back to work.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,800
See you.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,840
It's work.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,600
Not dating.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you doing?

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm preparing the baby's supplies.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,200
What for?

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,960
It's a gift.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,400
Don't go.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,840
Why don't you ask me who to give it to?

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,960
I don't care.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,200
You have many friends anyway.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,800
It doesn't sound good.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,120
Take it as a good word.

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
Come here.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,160
Listen to me carefully.

31
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,759
I have to make it clear.

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,560
These are indeed for Chen Li Li.

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,240
Did I say I want to hear it?

34
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,039
Calm down.

35
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,440
Do you remember

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,000
when the pregnancy date was?

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
It's this period

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,960
So?

39
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,880
When she gives birth,

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,000
when she gives birth?

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
Is that person

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
she came to our house to extort money?

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Could it be that person

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,880
to come to our house to blackmail us?

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,840
What if

46
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,480
it's not a coincidence?

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,000
In that case,

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
to repay your kindness.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,480
I will

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,440
how she extorted me.

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
The test report is ready anyway.

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,520
I will force her to tell me

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
in front of her family.

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,920
who ordered her to do this.

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,480
who ordered her to do this?

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,880
My dad decided on the health city project himself.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,400
He took it very seriously.

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,680
He made a lot of preliminaries and research.

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,000
You invested so much in it.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
Why didn't you follow the plan?

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,520
Things have changed.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,120
Ran.

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
You don't know much

64
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,280
in business.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Business opportunities

66
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,079
is ever-changing.

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,400
The health city project was good a few years ago.

68
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,120
It's not good these years.

69
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,560
So I decided to run a technology city.

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,760
Science city?

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
If you want to make a tech city, you need to

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,520
and do preliminaries and research.

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
This is a huge cost.

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,960
Also,

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
the early investment of health city

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm going to lose everything.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,480
Don't blame me for being rude.

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,720
You have almost zero experience

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
about the project.

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,280
Tell me.

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,120
Who ordered you to do this?

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
No one ordered me.

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,040
Stop pretending.

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,720
Someone gave you 80,000 yuan

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,960
to frame me.

86
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
Is that true?

87
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
I'll give you 200,000.

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,920
Tell me who he is.

89
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
He's so powerful.

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
If I tell you,

91
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,640
I won't be able to stay.

92
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,320
How much do you want?

93
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,320
One million.

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
One hundred.

95
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,160
You're talking big.

96
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,320
Where did I get so much money?

97
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,280
I don't care.

98
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,960
If you want to know who he is,

99
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,640
you have to give me one million.

100
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
No discussion.

101
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,880
We have done a thorough research

102
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,880
the technology city project.

103
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,040
Its investment output

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
is far beyond the health city project.

105
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,519
Stop being stubborn.

106
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,200
I think we can vote.

107
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,320
The decision of this project

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
for this project.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,080
I vote for the technology city.

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
Six votes.

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
I believe in your decision.

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,960
I vote for health City.

113
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
It's a tie again.

114
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
We can't go on like this.

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
Our business can't be delayed.

116
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
I suggest

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,280
all the directors of the project

118
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,320
to participate in the voting.

119
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
After all, they are on the front line.

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,000
They have convincing

121
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,200
and persuasive.

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,880
Mr. Li,

123
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
If you don't mind,

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll call someone.

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,040
This is an important decision.

126
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
I have to calm down

127
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,880
before making a decision.

128
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,960
Uncle Lu,

129
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I will consider your proposal.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Let's call up a meeting another day

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,600
and make the final decision.

132
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Did you see the video I sent you?

133
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,440
I sent you?

134
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,720
I told you there must be something wrong with them.

135
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,000
Now you see it.

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
He went on a date with her.

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,159
I knew it.

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
he's not a good person.

139
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,680
You don't believe me?

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,520
Now,

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
you are now.

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
Okay, I got it.

143
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
Oh no.

144
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,000
What else?

145
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,120
Of course I'll ask him out

146
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,240
to confront him.

147
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,400
I don't believe

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
What tricks can he make up?

149
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,040
Xinyao.

150
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
It's a secret.

151
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
you'll find out one day.

152
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,600
So,

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,640
There's no rush.

154
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,680
Honey.

155
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
Have breakfast.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
How do you like the ham I made?

157
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,240
It's been a long time.

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
for no reason.

159
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
You're a thief.

160
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,040
Tell me.

161
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,159
What is it?

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Nothing.

163
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,280
It's okay.

164
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm going to work.

165
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,720
Wait.

166
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,120
Something's up.

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,560
I have something to tell you.

168
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,480
Go ahead.

169
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
I want

170
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,000
borrow some money from you.

171
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
How much?

172
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,360
One million.

173
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,040
Why do you need so much money?

174
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,320
I just want to stay at home.

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
I want to do some projects.

176
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,920
I happen to have a friend

177
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,480
wants to do a project.

178
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,640
Chaoyang Industry.

179
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,760
Farmer?

180
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
What?

181
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
A goose.

182
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,400
This goose is great.

183
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,120
A goose with an egg and a goose.

184
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
One investment.

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,080
for a lifetime.

186
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
I'll arrange the finance to call you right away.

187
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,000
So straightforward.

188
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Of course I support my husband's career.

189
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,840
Thank you, honey.

190
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,440
Since I lent you the money,

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,720
you should give me an IOU.

192
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,400
I've already prepared it.

193
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
This is the one million you want.

194
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,160
