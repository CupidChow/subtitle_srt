1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,200
Carry me.

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:52,960
Haotian.

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
It's time.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,920
Let's begin.

5
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,600
Lu Jian'an.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,120
The health City project

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,560
suddenly changed the material supplier.

8
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,600
Do you know that?

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm just following the rules.

10
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,120
But the transfer records of you and the materials manufacturer

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
You can't fool me.

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,760
You should know

13
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,920
how much it can make in between.

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
Five million.

15
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,960
How long will this be?

16
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,480
Someone died in the middle.

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Cheers.

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Mr. Yan.

19
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,880
I... I didn’t participate in the project of health City.

20
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200
Are you familiar with this girl?

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,560
It's normal for men to like girls.

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,760
But we should be more careful.

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
If this photo

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
on the Internet,

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
or your wife...

26
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Got it.

27
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,640
Mr. Lin.

28
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,640
I have nothing on you.

29
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,880
How do you plan to acquire my shares?

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,240
Mr. Kong,

31
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,440
you really

32
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,079
for the Li family.

33
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
and loyal

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,120
to Mr. Li.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
But this time,

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
with Youran.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,280
So I came here

38
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,000
to ask for your help.

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,040
How?

40
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,480
I can use

41
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,760
at 30 percent

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,800
to acquire your shares in Li's.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,520
At the same time,

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,160
I'll give you the same amount of Lin's shares.

45
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,520
Lin's shares?

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,240
Mr. Kong.

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,720
We are both businessmen.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,960
How can a businessman not make money?

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,840
Do you think

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,000
is my suggestion appropriate?

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,600
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,560
Cheers.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,920
Mr. Jia.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
What’s the topic

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
tonight?

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,480
Shareholders are clear.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,160
Mr. Li has

58
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,800
35% of her shares

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,280
has been transferred to me.

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
And Mr. Lu Jian'an

61
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
has also

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,120
of his shares

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,840
to me.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,760
In this way,

65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,200
plus three percent of my shares,

66
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,560
I should have

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,240
the company.

68
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,720
54% of the shares.

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
He should be a major shareholder.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Right?

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
From now on,

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,240
the company

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,720
the company.

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,840
From now on,

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,480
this company is named Jia.

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,560
Any objections?

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
What about this?

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,520
with this.

79
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,160
But I have to tell you

80
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,400
our shareholders

81
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,040
of our shareholders

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
has been transferred to the same person.

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,120
To whom?

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,440
Hello, Director.

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
You lied to me.

86
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,080
Gu Nanshan.

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
I'm Lin Haotian.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,360
Mr Liang,

89
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,160
Please compare the shares of Li's Group

90
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,640
of Li Group again.

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
Lin Haotian.

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,880
Mr. Lin.

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,520
The depth strategic partner of Li Group.

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,000
The current chairman of Lin's Group

95
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,760
has 35% of

96
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
of Li's Group.

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,680
Lin Haotian, the only heir of Lin's Group,

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,960
and Li Youran, the only daughter of the Li Group.

99
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,080
It not only indicates that

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
will cooperate deeper.

101
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,960
It’s said that half of Lin’s Group

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,720
to Li Youran.

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,120
And Lin Haotian's name

104
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,480
also added Lin Haotian's name.

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,560
35 percent.

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
35%.

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
So what?

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
Even if you take all the shares

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,680
in your pocket,

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,040
You only have 46 percent.

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
How can you compete with me?

112
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,040
Here.

113
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,720
Mr. Lin.

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,360
Mr. Lin signed with Mr. Li.

115
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,760
According to the contract,

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Mr. Li's 35% shares

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
will be held by Mr. Lin.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
If you need a deal,

119
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,040
Mr. Lin and Mr. Li

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,760
sign together

121
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,120
can it work.

122
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,520
Impossible.

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Jia Yunsheng,

124
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
You lost.

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,520
That's impossible.

126
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,560
This company is mine.

127
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,320
This company should be surnamed Jia.

128
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,280
Everything

129
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
should be mine.

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,800
Lee You-ran.

131
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,160
Aren't you crazy?

132
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,480
I changed the medicine for you.

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
You must be crazy.

134
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,120
I didn't take

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
you gave me.

136
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Don't take the medicine given by Jia Yunsheng.

137
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
He must be crazy.

138
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,480
Your father

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,600
sold his company's business secrets

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
because of the business secrets of the company.

141
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,640
Mr. Li almost sold his company

142
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
for your wife and children.

143
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
to save his life.

144
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,680
But he felt too guilty

145
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
and committed suicide.

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Bullshit!

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
My dad wouldn't commit suicide.

148
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,600
It's you.

149
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,520
My dad jumped off the building because of you.

150
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,840
It's you!

151
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
All of you

152
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,440
with my dad's blood.

153
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
My dad couldn't have jumped off the building.

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,920
Everything here is mine.

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This company should be surnamed Jia.

156
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Heaven is unforgivable.

157
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,080
You deserve it.

158
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,520
Stop it.

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,280
Wait and see.

160
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,160
I'll make you pay with your blood!

161
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,440
Are you okay?

162
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,920
Mr. Lin.

163
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,960
You still owe me a honeymoon.

164
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Where do you want to go?

165
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,280
I want to go to Greek

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,720
To watch sunset with you by the sea of Aiqin

167
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,760
Let's get drunk.

168
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
Where else do you want to go?

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,360
I want to go to South Africa.

170
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,200
and watch lions with you.

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,880
Elephant giraffe.

172
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
No problem.

173
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,440
Where else?

174
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,880
I want to go skiing in Switzerland.

175
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,160
I want to go.

176
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
Grim fairy tale world. How about Little Mermaid?
