1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,920
Zhang Qiang.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,040
One million has been transferred to your mother.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,200
Do what you have to do.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,680
Turn yourself in.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,240
And...

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,200
Drop your phone.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Thank you, boss.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,880
I'll turn myself in now.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,240
Dear reporters,

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,920
Thank you for coming.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
This is really unreasonable.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
My husband has just died.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,880
No one cares about this now.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,880
In the end,

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,760
the result of the accident hasn't come out yet.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
Mr. Li has made a promise

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
that he will pay every penny less.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,039
Please rest assured.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,760
Please rest assured.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm not worried.

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,080
Don't worry, reporters.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
Listen, everyone.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,920
The nature has changed.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,440
You used inferior materials

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,039
with cheap materials.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,760
This is an evil company.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,600
You wanted to give me 200,000 yuan before.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,080
Who are you fooling?

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,200
Listen to me.

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,120
Their project manager has run away.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,800
You still want to hide it?

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,240
You have to give me justice.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,320
Let me tell you.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,039
If I can't solve this problem,

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,600
I won't leave.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
We're working on it.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
We will give the family a satisfactory answer.

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Can we get up first?

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,840
Don't touch me.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,080
Everything will be happy.

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,360
What result?

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,360
I won't leave

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,840
I won't leave.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
Xianbing.

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,080
Pick up the phone.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,919
Have I booked my flight ticket?

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
The security bureau will be here soon.

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
I still have your account.

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Remember.

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,240
Say what you should.

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,400
What I shouldn't say

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,240
Shut up.

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,480
Hello, Mr. Lu.

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,520
We are supervisors of the security bureau.

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,079
This is my badge.

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,200
I need you

57
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
need you to go back with me

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,120
and get to know it.

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,040
Please.

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,160
Does anyone else care about this?

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
Let me tell you.

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,440
Where is the person in charge?

63
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
She can't avoid the first day of the year.

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
You must solve this for me today.

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,120
If you can't solve it,

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,960
You can't sell a house.

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,960
Mr. Li

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,920
is solving this for you?

69
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,440
Mr Liang.

70
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Mr Li.

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
How did the discussion go?

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,960
They won't listen to me.

73
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,600
He's useless.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
Is it up to you?

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,040
One million.

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
One million.

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
A life.

78
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,520
Two million.

79
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
I have no say in my family.

80
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,079
Listen to my sister-in-law.

81
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,240
Two million.

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,360
No problem.

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,079
Your brother and I have two kids.

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,079
We have two kids at home.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,880
Yes. Do you hear me?

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,400
One life costs two million.

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,320
We have two children at home.

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,360
At least five million.

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,160
No.

90
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,760
You are suspected of blackmailing.

91
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,360
Let me tell you.

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
Who is blackmailing?

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
Someone died in my house.

94
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Still, we have to go through the judicial procedure.

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,040
Get out!

96
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,760
I won't talk to you.

97
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,840
I'll talk to Mr. Li.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Who are you?

99
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,440
It's none of your business.

100
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
Do you know what this is?

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
A police report.

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
Your brother's death is a murder of negligence.

103
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
The police will inform you soon.

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,720
If you dare to harass me again,

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,960
you'll suffer the consequences.

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Are you okay?

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm fine.

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,800
It wasn't an accident.

109
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,480
Nonsense!

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,680
I'll kill you!

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Be careful.

112
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Does it hurt?

113
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
No.

114
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,320
Why does it hurt?

115
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,920
You hit me so hard just now.

116
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,840
How can it not hurt?

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
What kind of injury is this?

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,120
I practiced it before.

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Let alone that person,

120
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,159
Even if it's five,

121
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Even if there are five or six,

122
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,440
I'll still defeat them.

123
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,960
What's wrong?

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
Every time you're with me,

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
when you're with me.

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm so happy

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,440
for my wife.

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
All right.

130
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm leaving.

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
Work hard.

132
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,200
Can you do it?

133
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,560
Of course.

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,200
Who am I?

135
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,680
Superman.

136
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
Waiting for you to come home.

137
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,720
Li's Group always values the safety of the building.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
There has never been a construction site accident in these years.

139
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,000
It looks like they came prepared.

140
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,880
Is this a coincidence

141
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,320
or a conspiracy?

142
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,800
There are only three characters on the white board.

143
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,960
You've been staring at it for an hour.

144
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,680
I think something is wrong.

145
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,920
Lu Jian'an tampered with the construction materials.

146
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,160
The accident happened

147
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
before we solved this.

148
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,400
In this,

149
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,040
is about human lives.

150
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,600
As long as the interests are high enough,

151
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
anyone can take the risk.

152
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,680
I still don’t think it’s right.

153
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,400
The police said the worker named Zhang Qiang

154
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040
turned himself in because of personal grudge.

155
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,920
because of personal grudge.

156
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
But don't you think it's too coincidental?

157
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,680
The accident happened after Lu Jian'an entered.

158
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
It doesn't make sense.

159
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600
I'll still pay him.

160
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,720
Then why did he run away?

161
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,120
What if

162
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
this is not an accident?

163
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,159
You mean

164
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,280
Lu Jian'an?

165
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,720
But he's already inside.

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Yes.

167
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,320
That's why there's a problem.

168
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,080
No.

169
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,520
I have to ask him.

170
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,240
Uncle Lu.

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,520
Are you here to laugh at me?

172
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,520
Do I look good?

173
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,920
I'm here today

174
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,760
to ask you something very important.

175
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,000
Is the worker's death related to you?

176
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,280
Did you order it?

177
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
How many times have I told you?

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,960
It was an accident.

179
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,520
It has nothing to do with me.

180
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
I trust you.

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
I believe

182
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
you're not the kind of person who kills people.

183
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Uncle Lu.

184
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,840
I've contacted the lawyer

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,520
to collect materials

186
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
and defend you.

187
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,159
And I’ve arranged

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
your family.

189
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Ran.

190
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Uncle Lu.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,760
I watched you grow up.

192
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,200
You still believe that I didn't kill anyone.

193
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
I have something to tell you too.

194
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,920
Your father's death

195
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
is not a coincidence.

196
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,880
You have to find out.

197
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Thank you.

198
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,400
Honey.

199
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,039
If my dad was killed

200
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
my dad was killed,

201
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,520
If I didn't come back in time,

202
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,720
I should have died.

203
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,880
It's all in the past.

204
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Don't be too upset.

205
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
I can't.

206
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,640
I can't just

207
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,280
just like this.

208
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,480
So what do you think?

209
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,000
If this person

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
is hiding behind Lu Jian'an,

211
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,560
He must be helping Lu Jian'an

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
who helped Lu Jianan

213
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
The person who sent him in.

214
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,040
This concerns the company's interests.

215
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
So this person

216
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,880
is probably in the company.

217
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
That makes sense.

218
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
We need to find out

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,960
what happened

220
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,480
What happened?
