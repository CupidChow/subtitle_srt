1
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,360
What's the problem?

2
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,600
Lu Jian'an

3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,160
He's a sly old fox.

4
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,280
I've read all the accounts you sent me.

5
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,200
Very professional.

6
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,920
He must have asked someone to do it.

7
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
You mean

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,520
someone is behind him?

9
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,759
If that's the case,

10
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
he doesn't have to be afraid of me.

11
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Then why did he resign

12
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,440
the project manager?

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,280
is relaxed.

14
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Let me analyze it for you.

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
Where is Lu Jian'an?

16
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,000
He is now

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
retreat to advance.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,120
But he'll definitely do something later.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,039
It's like a fist.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
He took it back.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,880
He will definitely come out.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
He's in the dark now.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,960
That's what worries me more.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,720
What if

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,440
he jumps into the wall to play dirty?

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,000
You must be careful of him.

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
The construction site called me

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,320
and asked us to go.

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,440
Go.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Be careful.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
Put on your helmet.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,600
How's the schedule going?

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,680
Can you finish it on time?

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Mr. Li, regarding the schedule,

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
depends on the cooperation of the materials.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Material supplies?

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
Is there a problem?

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,440
Mr. Lu changed

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
the material supplier that was set during the tender.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,240
But it's too late to change it now.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Xinyao.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,880
Speed is one thing.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,079
More importantly,

44
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,400
to find out the new suppliers.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,120
Their qualifications

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,040
Hurry up.

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,120
Let's take a look at Mr. Li.

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
What are you doing?

49
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm installing a camera.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,360
There are only the two of us in this house.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
Why are we installing cameras?

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,079
What if I'm not home?

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,200
Lu Jian'an is here?

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
You worry too much.

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
I'd rather worry.

56
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
than take it lightly.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Okay.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,680
What is this?

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,400
Bluetooth Software Connection.

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,160
monitor the footage of the house 24 hours a day.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,920
Wait.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Here.

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,240
pepper spray.

64
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,160
Mini taser gun.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm full of electricity.

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,040
Bulletproof vest.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,560
How is it?

68
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm not afraid of being ugly.

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,480
Safety first.

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,840
The last one.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,720
self-defense.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,160
I wrote it myself.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Practice hard.

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,000
Isn't this too much?

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,000
No way.

76
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,800
That bastard.

77
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,240
Who knows what he'll do

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,720
who knows what he will do?

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
Don't bother. I'm not afraid of him.

80
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm afraid.

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,520
The quality of the construction is our top priority.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,560
So no matter from construction or materials,

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
you must be strict.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
Don't let your guard down.

85
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,760
Got it?

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,560
Okay, Mr. Li.

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,480
Dear workers, my man

88
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,280
A living man

89
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,120
is gone.

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,200
There is no explanation at the construction site.

91
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,880
This banner...

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Do I want to come here to make a banner?

93
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,000
That's because

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,760
no one cares about this.

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,640
There are elders and children at home.

96
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,720
and two children.

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,200
What should we do?

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,520
Don't pull me.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,240
If they don't give me an explanation,

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,200
this is not over.

101
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,880
Hello.

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,800
We're the supervisors of the security bureau.

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,840
Here.

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
My badge.

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,920
Take a look.

106
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,520
Okay.

107
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,520
Have a seat.

108
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,440
We got a call from Miss Tian.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
I heard something happened to you.

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,800
to report to us.

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,800
Yes.

112
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,880
Our current situation is

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,880
the latest project of our group.

114
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,600
Health City.

115
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
There was a safety accident.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
According to investigation,

117
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,920
it's most likely because

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,440
because of

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,000
of the construction materials.

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
Who was the person in charge

121
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,640
of your project?

122
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Lu Jian'an.

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,800
It is reported that

124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,960
he changed the supplier without permission.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,560
Wait.

126
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
In other words,

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,760
your project is proceeding normally.

128
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,200
Lu Jian'an

129
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
has no reason

130
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,400
change your

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,880
the supplier, right?

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,840
Yes.

133
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,520
Sir.

134
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,720
I hope you can

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,440
to help us find out the truth

136
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,159
and redeem the accident.

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
to our company.

138
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

139
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
We'll do our best.

140
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't worry.

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,320
Thank you.

142
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,120
My master said

143
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,240
there are not many construction sites

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,920
Not many construction sites can get paid.

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
Stop talking.

146
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,920
Stop talking.

147
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
No one heard it.

148
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,200
Besides, we didn't say anything.

149
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
The guy who just died

150
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,440
has just been here for two days.

151
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,600
What was his name again?

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,240
I don't remember.

153
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
But he ran away

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,600
ran away.

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Sister-in-law!

156
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,400
How are you?

157
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
What took you so long?

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
Someone just called me

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
about my brother's death.

160
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
to extort money from them.

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,159
We'll take all the money we've earned.

162
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
Give us another million when it's done.

163
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
The people here are not that easy to deal with.

164
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,960
I'll go up and kill them.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
What are you doing?

166
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
Look at the company.

167
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
It's so big.

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,280
So many security guards.

169
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
Can you defeat them?

170
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,080
What should we do?

171
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,280
We have to use wisdom.

172
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,080
Listen to me.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Listen.

174
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
You must give me an explanation.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
We understand

176
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,360
your feelings.

177
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,640
we don't want to see

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
It's something we don't want to see.

179
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,640
Our mood is heavy too.

180
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,120
Fine.

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Shut up.

182
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,600
Now my brother

183
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,760
is gone.

184
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,440
Tell me how much you want to pay.

185
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Sir,

186
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
Calm down.

187
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,120
It has happened.

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
We will handle it.

189
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,120
But the result

190
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
is not under investigation.

191
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
What's there to investigate?

192
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,360
He died at your construction site.

193
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
It's obvious.

194
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,280
Just tell me how much you can pay.

195
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,280
Don't worry.

196
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,200
We will take full responsibility for this.

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,080
I understand

198
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,480
the pain of losing your family.

199
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
So I can promise you now.

200
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,960
the group

201
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,480
and personally,

202
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,159
will do my best

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,520
to meet your needs.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,520
Go ahead.

205
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,640
How much

206
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,840
How much are you going to pay?

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,480
Because

208
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
the investigation result of the accident hasn't come out yet.

209
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
So we can't give you the exact amount.

210
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,120
But we will give you

211
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,280
200,000 yuan for miswork.

212
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,080
200,000?

213
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
Who are you sending away?

214
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Are you kidding me?

215
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
One life costs 200,000 yuan.

216
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
200,000.

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
My man just died.

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,520
You want to kill us with a life of 200,000?

219
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,120
I must expose you today.

220
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,640
Please be the judge.

221
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,840
What are you doing? Don't touch me!

222
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,600
I didn't touch you.

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
Put your phone away.

224
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
Don't talk nonsense.

225
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
Listen to me first.

226
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,400
I mean the 200,000 yuan

227
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,240
It's just your family's delay of work

228
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,720
for your family's delay of work.

229
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,040
is not the last compensation.

230
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,960
Who knows?

231
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,200
I know if you think we are not educated

232
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,320
and give us 200,000 as hush money?

233
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,160
No.

234
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
Mr. Li can't go on like this.

235
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,080
They're obviously playing dirty.

236
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,600
Don't touch me.

237
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,800
Who is cheating?

238
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
Let's not fight.

239
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
I heard it.

240
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,920
Don't fight.

241
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
Talk nicely.

242
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,400
Don't fight.

243
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,040
If you don't pay me today,

244
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
Don't move.

245
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,320
Don't move.
