1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,960
Mr. Lu.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,480
You can't leave.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,120
Besides,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,640
you...

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,920
What do you mean?

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,600
It's wrong

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,760
is wrong.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,920
Am I going to embarrass myself here?

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,040
Mysterious man.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,360
We finally meet.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,160
Gu Nanshan.

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,840
How did you find me here?

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,360
Director.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,400
Your script is good.

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,520
What director?

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Where's my dad?

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,360
What about your dad?

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,080
How many times have I told you

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
Don't call me if there's nothing.

21
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,759
Ridiculous.

22
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,360
Gosh.

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,759
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
You found a good actress.

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,440
What actress?

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,120
Stop pretending.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Since she can harm me

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,800
for your 80,000 yuan,

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,400
I can let her ask you out

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,479
for money.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,759
Tell me.

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,200
What do you want

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,480
What do you want?

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,760
I want to work with you.

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,520
Cooperate?

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,720
What can we cooperate with?

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
Mr. Lu,

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,600
Do you want to

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,520
take the health City project?

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
has nothing to do with you.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,040
I can help you.

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,320
You?

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,600
Just me?

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Don't forget

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
I'm Lee You-ran's husband.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
Why should I trust you?

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,800
Let me tell you the truth.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
I married Li You Ran

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
for money.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880
You want to take the health city.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
for money.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,560
So,

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,200
we have the same goal.

54
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,560
Okay.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,280
Tell me your conditions.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
I told you.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,520
I only want money.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,480
When it's done,

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,640
I'll give you one million.

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,480
Two million

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll give it to you now.

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Lu Jian'an.

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
You're back.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,320
Dinner will be ready soon.

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,400
What did you do this afternoon?

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,040
Nothing.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
I went to the gym

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
and went to the supermarket.

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
and bought you so many delicious food.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Gu Nanshan, you're still lying to me.

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,000
What's your relationship with Lu Jian'an?

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Why were you with him this afternoon?

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,720
Lu Jian'an and I are partners.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,040
Cooperation?

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Wait.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,040
Two million.

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
Where did you get so much money?

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Lu Jian'an gave it to me.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
Why should he give you money?

80
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,280
I earned it on my own.

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
Do you think I'm a fool?

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
That sly old fox will give you money.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,560
Honey.

84
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,520
Listen to me.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,120
Is there a project called

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,960
called Health City?

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,280
Lu Jian'an

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
wanted to get this project.

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
So I lied to him.

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
to help him get

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
The two million

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
is the money he gave me.

93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,600
Gu Nanshan.

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,520
Do you believe what you said?

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,320
How many things are you hiding from me?

96
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,360
Also,

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
how do you explain this?

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,360
I confess.

99
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
All confess.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,280
I did see that woman.

101
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,400
We've been through a lot lately.

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
I dare not tell you

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
The reason I met her

104
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,720
to find out who the mastermind is.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
She proposed to me

106
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,360
to pay a million for the house.

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,440
That's why I went home

108
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
to borrow one million from you.

109
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,520
before she told me

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
Lu Jian'an is the mastermind.

111
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,920
So this afternoon, I risked my life

112
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,040
in the afternoon.

113
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
But I don't think I can do it with your money.

114
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
with your money.

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
So I was smart

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,560
with your project.

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,040
Tell me,

118
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
is better than me?

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,240
How much can you earn

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,720
can you make?

121
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,800
You can give me 2,000,000,000 dollars for the benefits.

122
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,840
You're really going to lose it.

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
At least

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
at least one zero.

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
So urgent?

126
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Any progress?

127
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,000
Here's the money.

128
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
I quit.

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,440
Are you kidding me?

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,240
The health city project

131
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
is worth two billion yuan.

132
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,640
Just give me two million.

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Are you kidding me?

134
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
If you can't do it, we'll break up.

135
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
Mr. Lu Jian'an

136
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,120
gave me 80,000 yuan.

137
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,640
in the name of the interview,

138
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880
in the name of an interview

139
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,840
and stayed with you for an hour.

140
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
This video

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,560
the public may not be interested.

142
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,760
but I wonder if other shareholders

143
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,760
in the shareholders’ meeting.

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,159
I am

145
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,480
I'm just a wall.

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
If you don't turn this way,

147
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,640
you can only turn to the other side.

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,600
Are you trying to blackmail me?

149
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,960
I dare not do anything illegal.

150
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
Our cooperation is a win-win situation.

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
I will definitely help you

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,840
the health city project.

153
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,560
How much?

154
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
Add a zero.

155
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
I've written you the IOU.

156
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,960
As long as you sign it,

157
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,000
and press your fingerprint.

158
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,480
Mr. Li and Gu Nanshan's spokesperson

159
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
is very successful.

160
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,120
Now

161
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
"Give her a home if you love her."

162
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
This slogan

163
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
has become

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
a top-class IP.

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,880
The image of the company

166
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Keep going.

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,240
Next topic is health City.

168
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,640
The financing of the health city project is going very well.

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,200
Our company's overall

170
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
has increased nearly ten percent.

171
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,760
So,

172
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,640
I suggest we take the advantage.

173
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,360
I've decided that Mr. Lu will be

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,840
will be Mr. Lu.

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,640
Proceed as planned.

176
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,720
Uncle Lu.

177
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,000
Besides my dad,

178
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,880
you are

179
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
this project.

180
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,520
Thank you for your trust.

181
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,320
Thank you.

182
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,440
Any other opinions?

183
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,760
Gu Nanshan, you're really something.

184
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,760
If not,

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,760
It's a deal.

186
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,200
Easy.

187
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,440
and carefree.

188
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,400
The decision you made

189
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
at the meeting today

190
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,080
this decision.

191
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,960
Why did you give the health city project

192
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,920
to Lu Jian'an?

193
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,440
He is the best candidate for this project.

194
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,480
From experience

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
experience and the whole project.

196
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,960
All right.

197
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
I want to hear your real thoughts.

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,760
My real thought is

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
if he is willing to do well

200
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,600
for the company,

201
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
It's a good thing

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,880
for the company.

203
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,160
If he has to tamper with this project,

204
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
I can have this chance

205
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
to get rid of him.
