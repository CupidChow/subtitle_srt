1
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
Come and drink with me.

2
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
You suspect Xinyao?

3
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Think about it.

4
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,440
Up to now,

5
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
everything is related to her.

6
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,880
Impossible.

7
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,840
She would never harm me.

8
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
You came back from abroad.

9
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,400
when you came back from abroad.

10
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,560
But why didn't she

11
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,480
when your father was hospitalized?

12
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,720
but when your father's funeral.

13
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,440
Also,

14
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,200
Did she give you

15
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,800
She gave it to you, right?

16
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,040
It's fake.

17
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,200
Why didn't she tell you

18
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,600
Why didn't she tell you directly?

19
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
instead of telling you directly?

20
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,160
Now, she's leading you to suspect me.

21
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,520
We are all her pawns.

22
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,320
Now that we're done using her,

23
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,040
I want to use you

24
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,240
to get rid of us.

25
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,360
I know her.

26
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,240
She's not scheming at all.

27
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,480
Honey.

28
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,240
People can act.

29
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,880
But you can't act for more than ten years.

30
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,720
We are best friends.

31
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,400
Since we were in college,

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,440
we've been whispering in a bed.

33
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,480
Her tuition

34
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,640
from my family.

35
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,680
from my family.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
After graduation, it was also arranged by me to join the company.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
and supported him all the way

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,680
to become the chairman's assistant.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,480
Let me tell you.

40
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,440
In this world,

41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
even if everyone wants to hurt me,

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,840
she won't hurt me.

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,000
All these years,

44
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
all these years.

45
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,000
I feel happy

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
I feel very happy.

47
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,880
Don't worry.

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,560
Our beautiful future will come soon.

49
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
I will tell the whole world

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
you are the most beloved woman

51
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,440
in my life.

52
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,159
Really

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
Really.

54
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,640
But now there is a biggest obstacle

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,960
is Gu Nanshan.

56
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
I'll do

57
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm willing to do anything.

58
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,800
Hello, are you Mr. Gu?

59
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,240
It's me, Gu Nanshan.

60
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,080
Mr. Chai has said hello.

61
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,880
Tell me if you need anything.

62
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,080
Here's the thing.

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,440
I did a DNA test

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,760
at your place.

65
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,840
Do you remember?

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes.

67
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
According to the results,

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,520
the fetus has nothing to do with you.

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,080
In my office,

70
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
in my office.

71
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
If you need it,

72
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,920
if you need.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Do you remember

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,720
who came to take this report?

75
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,520
I remember it was a lady.

76
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,400
Her name seems to be

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Tian Xinyao.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,840
Thank you.

79
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,080
You're welcome.

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,040
Something is wrong.

81
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,240
What's the problem?

82
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,280
His account has been modified.

83
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Done.

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,080
This is Lu Jian'an's account route.

85
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,080
Original information.

86
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,880
There's an address

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,240
there's an address to erase his record.

88
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,480
Take this address

89
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,440
and compare your employee's address.

90
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll know who did it soon.

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,400
Hello.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,320
Hello.

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm Gu Nanshan, the president.

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,240
Find out who is using this address.

95
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay, just a moment.

96
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,040
Hello.

97
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,920
I found the address

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,640
I found it.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,640
It's a personal computer of one of our employees.

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Her name is Tian Xinyao.

101
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,040
Tian Xinyao.

102
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
I went to see

103
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,960
the paternity test.

104
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,960
She told me

105
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,920
she personally

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
gave this report to Tian Xinyao.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But the test report shows that

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,280
a non-parent-child relationship.

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
You mean

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,600
someone tampered with this report?

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,640
Yes.

112
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,800
And this.

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,200
What is this?

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,080
This is

115
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,160
of Lu Jian'an.

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,440
Through this information,

117
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,360
I found the address

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,120
the transfer records for him.

119
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,520
Guess whose address it is.

120
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
It's also Tian Xinyao.

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,880
What's wrong, Tian Xinyao?

122
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,880
Brother-in-law.

123
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,320
Can we talk?

124
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,680
What happened?

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
I feel sad.

126
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
Only you can help me.

127
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Where?

128
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,400
At home.

129
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,680
The door is open.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,720
Coming
