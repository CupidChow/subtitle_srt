1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,360
Good morning, honey.

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,120
Are you awake?

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,400
No.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,480
No.

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,080
Then I'll sleep a little longer.

6
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
What should we make?

7
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Sour Soup Noodles.

8
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,640
I have to wait.

9
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,800
Wait for me over there.

10
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,479
Do you need my help?

11
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,640
No need.

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,039
Okay.

13
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,680
Have another one.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,520
The new script is here.

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
You're a scumbag this time.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
Don't let me down.

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,120
Who's looking for you?

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
A salesman.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
Here's the rice.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
Try it.

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,840
Is it good?

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes.

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,960
Who is it so early

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Hello.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,079
Who are you looking for?

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm looking for my husband.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,200
Gu Nanshan.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,880
Gu Nanshan!

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,040
Bastard, you are hiding here.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,760
Who are you?

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Who am I?

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,000
Why didn't you ask me who I was when you slept with me?

33
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,120
Just talk.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,040
Why did you hit me?

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,600
No one dares to make a scene in my house.

36
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,079
My stomach hurts.

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
Do you want me to call the ambulance?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,920
No need.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,320
The kid kicked me.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm fine now.

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,280
Come with me.

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
Explain it.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
There's nothing to explain.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
Do you know her?

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Yes.

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,040
Then why did you ask her who she is?

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
It was so sudden just now.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,320
I was confused.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,360
Is the baby in her belly yours?

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't know.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,240
When was the last time we met?

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Eight months ago.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,120
Did you sleep?

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,360
Yes.

55
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,079
But I didn't know you at that time.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,520
It doesn't matter.

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
How do you prove that this child belongs to Gu Nanshan?

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,240
You want to deny it?

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
Tell me.

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
How do you want to prove it?

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,440
Let's do a DNA test on the fetus.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,840
No way.

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
This appraisal

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,920
has a great impact on the fetus.

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,600
What if

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
something happens to my child,

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,040
who can take responsibility?

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,120
You dare not?

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,080
Why not?

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
We can do an appraisal.

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,200
But...

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
I can't do it for nothing.

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
As long as it proves that the child is his,

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
I'll do anything you want.

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,040
Let's be frank.

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
My condition is simple.

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Two.

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,600
First,

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,440
I want the best prenatal care

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,840
and postpartum care.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,880
No problem.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,520
I'll arrange the best hospital and hotel for you.

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
No way.

84
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,200
What do you want?

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
What do I want?

86
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
I think

87
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
this is good.

88
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,200
It's well decorated

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
and nice environment.

90
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,040
Even the sofa

91
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,200
is soft.

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
Most importantly,

93
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,080
my husband is here.

94
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,480
I promise you.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
You'll stay here.

96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
Second,

97
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,960
you have to pay

98
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
You have to take care of it.

99
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
I mean

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,960
I have to give him a good environment.

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,160
A good condition.

102
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,680
Right?

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,120
I don't want much.

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
Every month,

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,320
200,000 yuan.

106
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120
Is this too much, Mr. Li?

107
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
But,

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,280
Is there anything else?

109
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Actually,

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
this matter

111
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,400
to be so complicated.

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
If you think it's troublesome,

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,120
just give me 10 million.

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,920
I'll disappear right away.

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
without a trace.

116
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
If the child is really his,

117
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,520
I think this is the best solution.

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
Look at me.

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,360
I made a mistake.

120
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,520
Ten million won won won't do.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,720
20 million.

122
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,480
I promise you.

123
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,840
Mr. Li is really straightforward.

124
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,000
However,

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,520
I have no evidence.

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,880
Let's

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
sign a pledge.

128
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll arrange it.

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,040
Thank you, Mr. Li.

130
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Divorce him.

131
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
He's already forcing me.

132
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,840
How can he bear it?

133
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
Gu Nanshan is despicable,

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
but it's a relaxing matter.

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
We need to hear what you say.

136
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,000
Of course.

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,000
That scumbag.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
is at a relaxed house now.

139
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,360
with that pregnant woman

140
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,800
with that pregnant woman.

141
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,720
We won't divorce.

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,840
Keep it for the Spring Festival.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,960
This is a relaxed marriage after all.

144
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,200
It also concerns the interests of the whole group.

145
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,080
They are the brand ambassadors of the company.

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
Once they get divorced,

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
it will bring

148
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,400
the company

149
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
a huge blow.

150
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,960
The price

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
is too high.

152
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
Once shareholders' interests are damaged,

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,159
they will cause trouble.

154
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,200
It's hard to calm down.

155
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,480
Is it so hard to get a divorce?

156
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,120
No.

157
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
Divorce is easy.

158
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
But it's hard

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,240
It's hard.

160
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,080
Xinyao.

161
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,159
Do something for me.

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
What is it?

163
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,880
Take Chen Li to the hospital.

164
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
for a paternity test.

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,560
Easy.

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,760
I think this is a good idea.

167
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
Let's use scientific method to prove it.

168
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,000
We'll know what to do next.

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,200
But

170
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,120
she's already...

171
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Like this.

172
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Can you?

173
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
Tell me.

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
Who sent you here?

175
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,000
Who sent me here?

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
Who sent me here?

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,480
It's because the baby in my belly

178
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
guide me.

179
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
There's no camera in my house.

180
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,440
Can you stop acting?

181
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,480
Gu Nanshan.

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,960
What are you talking about?

183
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
How am I acting?

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
Who is acting?

185
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
Who sent you here?

186
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,280
Why are you yelling?

187
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,080
You scared me.

188
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
My stomach hurts again.

189
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,200
Baby, look at your heartless father.

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,040
Is he a man or a woman?

191
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,640
Do you want him to be a boy?

192
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,920
or a girl?

193
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,600
Have you received

194
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
a mysterious phone call?

195
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,200
Yes.

196
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
I had

197
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,000
a mysterious dream.

198
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
In this dream,

199
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,600
there was an old man with white beard.

200
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
He told me

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,680
when I give birth to this child,

202
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,600
I will

203
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
He's rich.

204
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Good actor.

205
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,880
The DNA test results are out.

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,040
What do you think?

207
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Are you sure it's a parent-child relationship?

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,080
Look.

209
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,160
The child is his.

210
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,680
We

211
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
I don't mean anything else.

212
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,880
I just want to ask Mr. Li

213
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
what to do next.

214
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,920
Now the company

215
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
is having internal and external problems.

216
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,760
The image is damaged.

217
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
The market value disappeared.

218
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,559
Some people

219
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
low price

220
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
and became a new shareholder.

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
It's a mess.

222
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,919
You have to come up with a plan.

223
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,640
Right?

224
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
I've got the evidence

225
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,400
that Gu Nanshan was framed.

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,240
The PR company

227
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,320
are also preparing

228
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
to restore the company's image.

229
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,760
So please calm down.

230
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
Stop! You can't go in!

231
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,160
Get out of the way!

232
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,800
Don't you dare touch me today.

233
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,840
Go away.

234
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,880
Shareholders' meeting?

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Share shares?

236
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,200
That's great.

237
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
My baby

238
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,360
He has to get one too.
