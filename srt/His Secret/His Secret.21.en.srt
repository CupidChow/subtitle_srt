1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,160
Look.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,360
You stained your body.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,760
Let me wash it for you.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,160
Are you cold?

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
The rainy night 20 years ago

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
It's colder.

7
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,120
The fox's tail is exposed.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,240
Jia Yunsheng.

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
It’s not the time yet.

10
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,160
We must hold back

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,520
and let him keep acting.

12
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,680
We can't give him another chance to make a comeback.

13
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
Ran.

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Ranran

15
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,079
Ranran

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Ran, wake up.

17
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,600
Time to eat.

18
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,400
What?

19
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
Is the food I prepared for you not good?

20
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
I remember

21
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,079
you love milk.

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
Let me feed you.

23
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
What's wrong, Ranran?

24
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
Why are you so careless?

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,880
Let me wipe it for you.

26
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
Clean it.

27
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Wipe it properly.

28
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,160
Ranran.

29
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,840
Are you hungry?

30
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,520
It's okay.

31
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,640
I bought you something delicious.

32
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,520
Wait.

33
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,000
Have you eaten dog food?

34
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,640
Open your mouth.

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
Chew

36
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,080
Is it bad

37
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,840
The dog food I've eaten tastes worse than this.

38
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,800
But no matter how bad it is, I have to eat it.

39
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
At least I can live.

40
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Eat.

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
No

42
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Eat

43
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
Eat.

44
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,160
Eat.

45
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Eat.

46
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,960
Eat.

47
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,560
Eat.

48
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
You're a born

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,400
You bitch!

50
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Is it good?

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
In that case,

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
I'll give you

53
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
to ask me out.

54
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
The equity transfer agreement.

55
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,240
By the way,

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
I forgot.

57
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Let me read it to you.

58
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,200
Share Transfer Agreement.

59
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,080
[Transfer Party A for short]

60
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,680
Lee You Ran.

61
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
It's you.

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,400
The compromise

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,480
is me.

64
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
Jia Yunsheng.

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Since the contract was signed, Party A

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,600
will automatically transfer all the shares

67
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,880
to Party B.

68
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,640
Happy?

69
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm very happy.

70
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,120
Ranran

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,680
Give me your hand.

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,040
Ms. Lee You-ran.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,080
I finally married you.

74
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,960
Twenty years ago,

75
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
I saw my dad's blood

76
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,640
from my feet.

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,000
My mom is singing

78
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,960
in front of me.

79
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
From that moment on,

80
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,840
I lost

81
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,240
lost warmth and brightness.

82
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,720
From that moment,

83
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,720
[darkness was the only thing left in my heart.]

84
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
Revenge

85
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
and cold.

86
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Your dad

87
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,560
Your dad ruined our family.

88
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,000
Li You Ran.

89
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,360
How can you have such a good life?

90
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,800
such a happy life?

91
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Li You Ran.

92
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,640
Blame yourself for your surname Li.

93
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
As long as I live,

94
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,520
I will torture you for the rest of your life.

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,480
Summon the shareholders' meeting now.

96
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,960
Right now.
