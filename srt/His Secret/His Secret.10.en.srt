1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,640
Mr. Lu.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,400
Let's change the materials.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,040
Do you know about the supplier?

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,520
When did it happen?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,800
Why didn't I know?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,120
The material supplier was selected during the tender.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,200
Not now.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,400
Don't worry.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,920
Just do your job.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,000
Understand?

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,720
Relax.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,320
Let me remind you.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
It's very risky

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,400
to make this decision.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,560
Once Lu Jian'an

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,680
in this project,

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,160
You will be the one

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,800
will be you.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,080
Senior.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,320
Didn't you always say

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,680
risks and opportunities coexist?

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Sometimes we have to take risks.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,720
Don't look at me like that.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,760
What's wrong?

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,600
I think

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,280
I'm not

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,200
in school.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,600
You've grown up.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,600
Dear leaders and friends,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,240
Good morning.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
Today,

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,520
a grand opening ceremony for the health city project.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
to witness

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,120
of this project.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,840
Next, let’s welcome

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,759
Mr. Lu Jianan,

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,360
Mr. Lu Jian'an, the head of the project,

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
and all shareholders of this project

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,520
please fill in the first shovel for the base ceremony.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
The health city project

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,199
is very important.

42
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,639
I hope you can take responsibility.

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,480
Every part and every step must be stable.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,520
Mr. Lu is in a meeting.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,040
Mr. Gu.

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,560
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,520
What? You still want to steal it?

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,960
Are you trying to destroy the evidence?

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Let's talk outside.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Just say it here.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
It's not something shameful, is it?

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,680
Gu Nanshan.

54
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,960
What do you want?

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,240
Mr. Lu.

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
When will you pay me back?

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,840
The project fund is not ready yet.

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,240
Where can I raise money?

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
I'll give it to you when I get there.

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,480
That's not what you said.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
You didn't say

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,640
to pay after the project is over.

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,840
Mr. Lu.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,920
If I can't get the money today,

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,720
I won't leave.

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,040
Mr. Lu.

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,640
Mr. Lu.

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,440
Where have you been?

69
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,600
Something came up at the company.

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
Have you got the payment for the project?

71
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Yes.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,560
Transfer 20 million first.

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,880
to my personal account.

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Private account?

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,280
What are you doing?

76
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,560
Mind your own business.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,480
Do it now.

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,680
Got it.

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
Go and check

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
all the accounts

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,360
in health City.

82
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Nanshan.

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,159
Nanshan.

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,159
Gu Nanshan.

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,760
Surprise, honey?

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Honey.

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
Am I awesome?

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Am I good?

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Yes.

90
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,800
It turned from 1 million to 20 million.

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
Am I the rare

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,320
in a century?

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
How will you reward me?

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,480
Mr. Li.

95
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,280
The accounts of the health City project

96
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,480
are all here.

97
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,280
One of them

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,080
to Lu Jian'an's personal account.

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,200
Private account?

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,960
Private account?

101
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,760
Yes.

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
Okay.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Hello.

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
Isn't that

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Mr Liang from the legal department?

106
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,159
What's the matter?

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,480
Nothing.

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,840
I need to ask him something.

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,200
Honey.

110
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
The 20 million

111
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
the 20 million.

112
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,320
The first one is five million.

113
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,440
Take it to buy a bag.

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
The second five million.

115
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,360
I'll take you to eat all the delicious food in the world.

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,760
The third five million.

117
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,640
We travel around the country.

118
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
The last five million

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,320
Take it as pocket money.

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Just spend it.

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,600
All of them.

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Of course.

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,800
You're my wife after all.

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
Who else can I spend it for?

125
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Mr. Gu is generous.

126
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,640
Honey,

127
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,320
Have you ever thought

128
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,200
if you use this money as an investment,

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
can you

130
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
Can we raise money again?

131
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,280
That makes sense.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,080
What should we invest?

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Didn't you say you wanted a goose?

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
I was talking nonsense.

135
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm talking nonsense.

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,120
I don't believe it myself.

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,120
I think it's reliable.

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,960
You know?

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,400
The most profitable thing now is

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,040
high-end farming industry.

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,840
With my husband's business brain,

142
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
with his business brain.

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
I have business brain.

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,520
Of course.

145
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,240
Take my one million and go out.

146
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,120
You exchanged 20 million.

147
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
It's a business deal.

148
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,320
Ki Jae.

149
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,400
Just do as your wife says.

150
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,400
I'll make a plan for you now.

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,640
Just wait and see.

152
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,640
a big boss.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
No problem.

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,240
You're a business genius.

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm hungry.

156
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,840
Go make dinner.

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,440
Okay, Mr. Gu.

158
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,680
Honey.

159
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
I just remembered

160
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,360
your 20 million is a stolen money.

161
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,520
You'll have to return it.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
The money.

163
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,640
Also,

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,560
pack your things

165
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
and hide outside.

166
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,760
Why?

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,160
Aren't you afraid that Lu Jian'an

168
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,080
and take revenge on you?
