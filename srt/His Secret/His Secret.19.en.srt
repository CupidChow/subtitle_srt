1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
What kind of family are you?

2
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,240
I didn't realize it until the patient was seriously ill.

3
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,720
If we don't treat him, the consequences will be unimaginable.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,680
It's all my fault.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,720
But Doctor, I want to confirm it again.

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,680
Can her illness

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,400
be cured?

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,080
With her current condition,

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
is very difficult.

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,840
Yaoyao is such a good girl.

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,080
I've been too busy lately.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,760
I don't have time to accompany you.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,480
Do you still miss me?

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,039
Of course I miss you.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,240
I just finished an emergency meeting,

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,600
after an emergency meeting?

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,880
Really.

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,200
Really.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,920
I really want to spend more time with you.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,039
But I have to go to the hospital later.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,160
Why?

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,039
What happened to you?

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
It's all because of Li You Ran.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
The doctor prescribed medicine for her.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,479
She lost it again.

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,320
Give me the name of the medicine.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,200
I'll go.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,920
So good.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
and sensible.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Kamachiping.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,079
To treat epilepsy.

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,280
Overdose will seriously affect

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,600
the central nervous reaction

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,920
causing dementia.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
mental disorder,

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,960
Memory reducation and other side effects.

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,280
I got the medicine.

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,960
But I checked it.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,880
this medicine is not for manic depression.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
Just get it.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
Don't worry about other things.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,640
Ran.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,800
Seeing you like this,

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
when I see you like this.

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,680
I promised you

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
to protect you

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
and take care of you.

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,200
But you were hurt like this before.

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,200
and pain,

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,480
I feel so guilty.

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,600
I remember the first time I saw you

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,760
when I first saw you,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,360
I already fell in love with you.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Every smile of yours

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,040
is like

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,160
in my life,

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,280
warms me.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I know you didn't give me the chance.

59
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,079
So I buried this love

60
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,560
deep in my heart.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,240
Ranran

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,320
Seeing you like this,

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
can you feel

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,960
the pain in my heart?

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
Ranran.

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,400
Can you give me a chance?

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,200
I will love you for the rest of my life

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
and take care of you.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,480
and protect you.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Will you marry me?

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,400
Relax.

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,400
I've done a lot of things that I've done to you.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,680
I can't face you anymore.

75
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,320
I feel so guilty.

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
So I had to leave.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,120
Sorry.

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Mr. Li

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
You're still working at this hour?

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,120
I made lamb soup for you.

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Try it.

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,760
Let's drink it while it's hot.

84
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,920
Thank you.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Ranran

86
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
Time to take your medicine.

87
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,000
Where's the medicine?

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
You have to take it on time

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,960
before you get better.

90
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Good boy.

91
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,200
Come on.

92
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,600
You need to come out often.

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Don't always stay at home.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
What's wrong?

95
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
Nothing.

96
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,520
It's okay.

97
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,600
Let's go.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,040
Let's go.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Think about it.

100
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,120
How many years has this cow been with us?

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,760
It's too deep.

102
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,040
I'd rather sell 20 silver dollars less

103
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,560
than let anyone kill it.

104
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,200
If it weren't for a new wife for my son,

105
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,800
I wouldn't even sell it.

106
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
As the saying goes,

107
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
these three good words are money.

108
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,760
Ranran

109
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,040
Ranran.

110
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
Hang in there.

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,040
Relax.

112
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,960
[Laughing]

113
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,240
What are you doing?

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,360
You have nothing

115
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,800
with Youran, you know?

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,680
Get lost!

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,400
Jia Yunsheng,

118
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
to take care of Jia Yunsheng.

119
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
You just take care of him like this.

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,440
It's all because of you.

121
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
I'm warning you.

122
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,360
If anything happens to You,

123
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
I won't forgive you.
