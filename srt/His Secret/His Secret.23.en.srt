1
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,320
I promise you.

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Wherever you want to go,

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,360
I'll be with you.

4
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,360
Mr. Lin.

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
You're finally back.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm finally back.

7
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
For the rest of my life,

8
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,080
for the rest of our lives.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
For the rest of our lives,

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
we will never be apart.

11
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Let me give you a ride.

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,320
No need.

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Manager Xu is waiting for me on the 16th floor.

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
I'll be back soon.

15
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
General Director Seo.

16
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
General Director Seo.

17
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,600
I've been hiding my identity for 20 years

18
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
for this moment.

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

20
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,760
Because I want you to know

21
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,040
how it feels to jump off a building.

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
But do you know

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
how much blood

24
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,920
How much blood will you bleed if you jump?

25
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,440
I know.

26
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Jia Yunsheng.

27
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,480
Turn yourself in.

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,079
Stop being so stubborn.

29
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Turn yourself in.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Relax.

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,040
Do you want to know how your dad died?

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
Your dad slowly died in front of me.

33
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
Do you know how happy I was?

34
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
You're a beast.

35
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,920
Bastard!

36
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,120
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected.

37
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,400
Li You Ran.

38
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,920
Everything your family has done to us

39
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,040
I've suffered for so many years.

40
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,400
I want you

41
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
pay you back.

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Get up! Get up!

43
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,680
I killed your dad before.

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,920
Now I'm going to kill you.

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,159
Let go of me!

46
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,840
I'll make your whole family go down

47
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,159
and apologize to my parents.

48
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Look.

49
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
Is it high?

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
Are you afraid?

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you know why I chose the 16th floor?

52
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,520
Because my dad

53
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,400
jumped off the 16th floor.

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
It's your turn now.

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Why are you laughing?

56
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,120
Why are you laughing?

57
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm laughing at my stupidity.

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,120
I treated you like my family.

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
I treated you like my real brother.

60
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,800
I trusted you and relied on you.

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
In the end, you're a devil.

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,080
And

63
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,920
I laugh at you for being pathetic.

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,040
He deserved his death.

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,080
You lived

66
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,520
with this ridiculous hatred.

67
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,920
There's no love in your heart.

68
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,680
You only have hatred.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,880
So you only deserve to live in a dark corner.

70
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
Shut up!

71
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,280
Go to hell!

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,960
Jia Yunsheng!

73
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Stop!

74
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,240
Let her go.

75
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,040
Don't come over!

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,040
I want her to die with me!

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Calm down.

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,480
I can die for her.

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,000
Lin Haotian.

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,480
I should have killed you a year ago.

81
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,240
But you came at the right time.

82
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,560
I'll kill both of you!

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Relax.

84
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll wait for you.

85
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
Ms. Lee You-ran.

86
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,520
Today is our 100th day together.

87
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,000
When I first saw you in Spain,

88
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
I fell in love with you.

89
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
You speak gently.

90
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,760
and you have a pretty smile.

91
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,640
At that moment,

92
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,200
my whole world became beautiful.

93
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,559
But I can't tell you I love you.

94
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,080
From that day on,

95
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,840
every sunset afterglow

96
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,200
on your face,

97
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
I want to be better

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,080
to pursue your footsteps.

99
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,400
and stay by your side

100
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
to protect you from the wind and rain.

101
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
Break the sky

102
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,960
You gave me

103
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,720
unlimited motivation and courage.

104
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,160
So now I have the courage

105
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,520
to give you this invitation for the rest of my life.

106
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,200
Please do me the honor.

107
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
Will you

108
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,800
marry me?

109
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,360
I do.

110
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,040
OK, come on.

111
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,480
Let's move to the next group.

112
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,720
Yes. You can face each other.

113
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,040
Come closer.

114
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,120
Closer.

115
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
We've been separated for so many times.

116
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,800
We can finally be together forever.

117
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
Who knows?

118
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,160
After all, someone likes to disappear.

119
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,480
If I lose it again,

120
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,320
I might not be able to find it back.

121
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,840
OK. You can stand towards me.

122
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
Stand straight.

123
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,800
The bride can lean

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
on your shoulder.

125
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
will never happen again.

126
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,280
I finally got you.

127
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
Are you serious?

128
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
You're good at acting.

129
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
Who would believe that?

130
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,560
Honey.

131
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
Okay, you two can stand against each other.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,120
A good bride can lean on his shoulder.

133
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,040
My love is firmer than gold.

134
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,840
My heart is more real than pearls.

135
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,920
Your heart is more real than pearl.

136
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
You’re sweeter than honey.

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,600
Miss Gu,

138
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
You are really a good actor.

139
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,360
I knew it.

140
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
In this life,

141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
I will never leave you again.
