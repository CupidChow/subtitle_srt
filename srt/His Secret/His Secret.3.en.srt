1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,600
[Love at first sight] Okay.

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,960
Love at first sight.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
It's really enviable.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,480
Next,

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,760
Mr. Gu Nanshan,

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,080
who is the pretty girl

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,000
in the photo?

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,800
Gu Nanshan.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,400
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm going to work.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,440
What about you?

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,600
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm here for the job interview.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,440
I lost my job.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,320
Every time I see you,

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,440
I get hurt or lose my job.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,039
Today is important to me.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,800
Please stay away from me.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,720
Hello, Mr Li.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Mr. Li.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,840
Special Assistant of the Chairman.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,440
Special Assistant?

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Help what?

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm not that educated.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
I can't help you.

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
How much do you earn?

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,880
I do three jobs a day.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,120
One is RMB2,000.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
18,000 a month.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,680
I'll give you ten times.

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,560
Ten times?

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
What exactly are you doing?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,120
[Marriage property reached the following agreement.]

34
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,600
Marriage agreement.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,479
Ran.

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,840
You're still busy at this hour?

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,280
Prepare the information for the shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,880
It's late.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,840
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,680
We're here

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
to talk with you.

42
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,800
What is it?

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
We all know

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
your father's will.

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Although you inherited your father's shares,

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,079
but you're not married.

47
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,120
you have no right to run the company.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,560
So you can't decide

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
about the company.

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,200
But don't worry.

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
As long as Uncle Lu is in the company,

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
I can guarantee

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
you deserve.

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,079
you deserve.

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,079
Marriage

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,160
sooner or later.

57
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,720
The company is my father's lifelong effort.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,560
He left me the shares

59
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,800
to inherit his business.

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
and take care of the company, right?

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,680
The will was left by Mr. Li.

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,920
by Mr. Li.

63
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,480
The company rules were set

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,880
by Mr. Li.

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,920
The company can't live without a owner.

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,520
We

67
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,800
show our respect.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
That's right, Ran.

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
Strictly speaking,

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,560
you don't even have the company's control.

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
How can you attend the shareholders' meeting?

72
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,440
What are you doing?

73
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,720
Don't you have an office?

74
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,920
You can't come one by one when talking about work.

75
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,880
Why do we have to squeeze together?

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,240
Do you think this is a market?

77
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,560
You're here to talk about work

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,640
Those who don't know think you are a bunch of men

79
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,160
bullying a little girl.

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,520
It's hundreds of years in total.

81
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,960
Aren't you ashamed?

82
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,079
Who are you?

83
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,440
We work here.

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,240
Do you have to tell me what to do?

85
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm her assistant.

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,520
We are all shareholders here.

87
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,920
We can fire you anytime.

88
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm her assistant.

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,520
Only she has the right to fire me.

91
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,920
If there's nothing else,

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
please.

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
We have a shareholder meeting tomorrow.

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,079
There are some things

95
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,000
at the meeting.

96
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,640
We're here

97
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,280
to care about Ran.

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't make it a misunderstanding.

99
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,760
Right?

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,920
Special Assistant.

101
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Thank you for your care.

102
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

103
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,880
for saving me again.

104
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
You're welcome.

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
So,

106
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,839
did you agree?

107
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,280
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
It's okay.

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
It's okay.

110
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,560
It's not because of you.

111
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,480
I'm used to being free.

112
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,680
and I'm not used to being bound.

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
What I pursue

114
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,040
is poetry and distance.

115
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,480
I know.

116
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
Li Group.

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,240
Respect the founder, Mr. Li Xing Bao's last wish.

118
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,880
Through the election of the board,

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Yes.

120
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,960
Mr. Lu Jian'an.

121
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
to be the chairman of the group.

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,200
I hereby announce

123
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Please.

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Mr. Lu Jian'an.

125
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,320
Thank you for your trust in me.

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
I will do my best

127
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,000
to bring Li Group to a new level.

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Li Group?

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Wait.

130
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,880
You're here.

131
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,960
Don't worry.

132
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Leave the group to me.

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,360
I will make the group

134
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
again.

135
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,960
I'm here today

136
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
to announce something.

137
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm married.

138
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm very happy

139
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
to you.

140
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Mr Gu Nanshan.

141
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,080
Mr Liang.

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,280
Can I

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,960
to participate in the company's decision?

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes.

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,480
Why are you here?

146
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
I thought about it.

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
I think marriage

148
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,200
doesn't have any conflict with Shi and the distance.

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,080
So I'm willing to marry you.

150
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,920
Please.

151
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,920
Mr. Gu.

152
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,320
Hello, honey.

153
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,880
Hello, honey.

154
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,440
Smile.

155
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,080
We're spokespersons for our company's image.

156
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,120
This promotional video is for outsiders.

157
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Can you be more intimate?

158
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,560
Are you sure?

159
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
Yes.

160
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,600
Welcome to today's pavilion.

161
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
We invited Li Youran

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,080
and Gu Nanshan.

163
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,560
Let's talk about

164
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,880
their love story.

165
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
I heard

166
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,480
at first sight abroad.

167
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,240
Then they came back to China separately.

168
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
We met on the street in China.

169
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,080
Oh, my God.

170
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,720
I don't even dare to write like this in novels.

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
When you meet

172
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
in your life,

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
In fact, everything

174
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,520
will be simple.

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
There's a hair.

176
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,280
I heard you got married in a flash.

177
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
Sort of. On the 13th day

178
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,840
13 days.

179
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,680
On the 13th day after we came back,

180
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,680
we registered our marriage at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

181
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,600
It's really sweet.

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,760
Our fans said it's because of you.

183
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,400
believe in love again.

184
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
I heard that

185
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,800
has also become

186
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,040
of our Li Group.

187
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
Love at first sight.

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
I'm so jealous.

189
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,320
Next,

190
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,600
Mr. Gu Nanshan,

191
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,920
who is the pretty girl

192
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,840
Beauty, who is it?
