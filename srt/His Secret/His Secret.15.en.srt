1
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,400
I did what you said.

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,160
Where's my dad?

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,320
Don't worry.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,360
When he recovers,

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll return him to you.

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,039
Nanshan.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
Gu Nanshan.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,600
Gu Nanshan.

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,640
Gu Nanshan.

10
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,360
Gu Nanshan.

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Where have you been?

12
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,600
Mr. Li.

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
We've found Gu Nanshan's father.

14
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
How is he?

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
At Friendship Hospital,

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,880
in Friendship Hospital.

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,520
Li You Ran found him.

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
Let's take the opportunity.

19
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,800
The real show will begin soon.

20
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,160
Uncle Lin.

21
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,400
How could Uncle Lin be Gu Nanshan's father?

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
Did you get it wrong?

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
Absolutely.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
Lin Haotian's father is Gu Nanshan's father.

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
So,

26
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Gu Nanshan is Lin Haotian.

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
He didn't die in the car accident.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,920
Not yet.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
What happened next?

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,240
What happened after that?

31
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,400
Have you found Gu Nanshan?

32
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,880
Mr Liang.

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,079
Help me contact the media.

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Now?

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,160
Okay.

36
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,279
BLOOD

37
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,160
BLOOD

38
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,760
[Hello, the number you've dialled does not exist.]

39
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,480
Please check and dial again.

40
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,360
Sorry, the number you dialed does not exist.

41
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,600
Please check and dial again.

42
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,920
Sorry, the number you dialed does not exist.

43
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,040
Please check and dial again.

44
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,560
Sorry, the number you dialed does not exist.

45
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
Honey.

46
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,520
Let me explain.

47
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,960
If you save my dad,

48
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,520
I would never know

49
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,840
how to thank you.

50
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
But I'm sorry.

51
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
I lied to you first,

52
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,880
but my love for you is real too.

53
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
From now on,

54
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
no matter what you ask me to do,

55
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
I'll do it.

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,840
Lin Haotian,

57
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,120
How long are you going to pretend?

58
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,160
Lin Haotian.

59
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm Gu Nanshan.

60
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
What happened this year?

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Gu Nanshan.

62
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
It's been a year.

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,720
It's time to get some fresh air.

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,159
Take your script.

65
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
and play your role well.

66
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,040
you'll see your dad.

67
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,400
Remember.

68
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,880
Get close to Li Youran

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
and let her fall in love with you.

70
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,159
and hurt her.

71
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,040
and let her be doomed forever.

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm not Gu Nanshan.

73
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm locked in

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
in the dark room

75
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
The motivation to live

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Sometimes I can see my dad

77
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
from the screen.

78
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,159
I only know that

79
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
my name is Gu Nanshan.

80
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
Why do you have

81
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
a photo of the three of us?

82
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
We took this together three years ago.

83
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,840
If you and Lin Haotian only look alike,

84
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
maybe it’s just a coincidence.

85
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,040
But how is that possible?

86
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,960
Your father

87
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
are the same.

88
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
You mean

89
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
we knew each other three years ago?

90
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,440
You are Lin Haotian.

91
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,000
It's hard for you to accept it now.

92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,440
But no matter you are Lin Haotian or Gu Nanshan,

93
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
these are not important.

94
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
What matters is

95
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
you are my love.

96
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,200
All these years,

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
all these years.

98
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,880
It's okay.

99
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll always be with you.

100
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,280
A year ago,

101
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,840
a year ago?

102
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
If we want to know what happened this year,

103
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,160
we must find the mysterious man

104
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,000
and see who he is.
