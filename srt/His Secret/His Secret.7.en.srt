1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,760
Hello, Mr. Li.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,720
What's with the report?

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,240
It's totally different from what I took back.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,320
My baby

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,680
He needs one too.

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,040
Who are you?

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,840
Don't tell me

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,160
your baby

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
has something to do with Mr. Li?

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
My baby

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,640
is Mr. Li's husband.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,880
Gu Nanshan.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,440
What?

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,519
You don't believe me?

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I did a DNA test.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,680
Right, Mr. Li?

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,120
I'm here today

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,840
to give me

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,440
and my child

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
with my child.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
Enough.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
This company has become a market.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,360
What do you think?

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
or get a divorce.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,920
or resign.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,160
and give the company an explanation.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,360
Uncle Lu.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,240
You asked for it so quickly.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,200
People might think

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
you had a plan.

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,000
Ran.

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,680
Don't provoke me.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
I watched you grow up.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,240
After your father passed away,

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,280
I don't want anything to happen to you.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
I will be fine.

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Everyone.

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,479
Three days.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,039
I'll give you an answer.

40
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,680
If you can't,

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
I will leave the board.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Mr. Li, this is the schedule you asked me to check.

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,120
They never appear in the same place

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,880
at the same time.

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
How could this child be his?

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,160
There must be something wrong.

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,240
Is this Woo-Eon Hospital?

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
I want to see President Chai.

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,520
Thank you.

50
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,640
Uncle Chai.

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm Youran.

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,720
I want to ask you a favor.

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Gu Nanshan.

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,480
Leave Li Youran immediately.

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,480
When will this end?

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
It'll end when it's time.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
I quit.

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,960
I... He really quit, okay?

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,640
Okay.

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Here's your choice question.

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
One is a woman we met by chance,

62
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,960
and the other is your beloved father.

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,560
Whose life is more important?

64
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
Think carefully and tell me the answer.

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,200
You're at home.

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
Explain this.

67
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,680
What do you mean?

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,720
He's not your child.

69
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Why did you admit it?

70
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,840
I wasn't sure.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
I slept with her seven months ago.

72
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,800
The test report says whatever it says.

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,960
Yes.

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,440
It's clearly written on the schedule.

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,840
Last year,

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you and her

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
at the same time.

78
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
How did you sleep?

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,320
Are you done?

80
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm tired enough.

81
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,040
Is it fun?

82
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,240
Let's get a divorce if you feel uncomfortable.

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,600
Do you know

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,000
can't be decided.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,400
Can you be content?

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,720
You're lucky enough.

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,360
Besides,

88
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,880
our marriage is a contract.

89
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,320
It's none of your business

90
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,560
It's none of your business.

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,320
I've had enough of this.

92
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
Let's stop here.

93
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,640
Let's break up, okay?

94
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,320
Feels good.

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,960
You married me not because of love.

96
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,840
You've achieved your goal.

97
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm useless.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,520
Let's part nicely.

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,360
According to the DNA test report,

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,520
Gu Nanshan is not related to that child.

101
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,159
The schedule list shows

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,120
he has never met that woman.

103
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,240
So Gu Nanshan was framed?

104
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,240
We'll believe you.

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,280
Who knows if you're protecting Gu Nanshan?

106
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,120
If you don't believe me,

107
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,480
you can verify it yourself.

108
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,760
I have to say something here.

109
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
it's true that I married Gu Nanshan.

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
So I got the company's decision-making power.

111
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
is also a fact.

112
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,120
I don't want others

113
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,520
to make trouble

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,800
behind my back.

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,160
This will not change anything

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
nothing will change.

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,760
What about the report?

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,280
It's totally different from what I took back.

119
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
The hospital made a mistake.

120
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
Anything else?

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,360
The invitation to the charity auction

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,760
to attend the charity auction with Gu Nanshan.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,680
It can break the gossip

124
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
between you two.

125
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,480
He can't come.

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
What happened

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,320
has caused a serious impact on the Li family.

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,280
If she shows up alone in front of the media,

129
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,760
it will bring her more trouble.

130
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,520
Like this.

131
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,320
hurt her.

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,520
Hello, Miss Li.

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Tonight's charity auction

134
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,920
should be held by the couple.

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,440
I don't know why you're the only one here.

136
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
My husband has something to do today.

137
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,200
It's said that you and him are already

138
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,159
about the divorce?

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Where did you hear that?

140
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Honey.

141
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,920
Why are you so careless?

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
I left my bracelet in the car.

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Why are you here?

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,280
Give back

145
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,080
you left behind.

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,600
Mr. Gu,

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Have you admitted your affair?

148
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,320
Did you break up

149
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
have broken up?

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
Your question is ridiculous.

151
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,520
My relationship with my wife

152
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
with my wife.

153
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
The rumors you mentioned

154
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,920
are just groundless rumors.

155
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,440
My wife and I

156
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,720
and will keep the possibility of

157
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
by law.

158
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,159
Today's theme is Charity Night.

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,960
Please don't ask

160
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,040
please stop asking.

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Don't delay the guests coming in.

162
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,360
Thank you.

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,360
Let's go.

164
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,760
Didn't you say

165
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,520
we'll part ways

166
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,560
and never see each other again?

167
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,640
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I always said

169
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,520
I wanted poems and faraway places

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,320
to cover up

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
the so-called loneliness.

172
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,560
But after knowing you,

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
I realized

174
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,640
true freedom

175
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,440
is love.

176
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
I just realized

177
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,040
the poem and distance I wanted

178
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,600
is right in front of me.

179
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,240
Please forgive me.

181
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,559
Actually,

182
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
I have a feeling.

183
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,520
I thought you'd come back to me.

184
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,280
Why?

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,440
I don't know.

186
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,840
But you're back.

187
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,440
Right?

188
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm back.

189
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,640
Mr. Lu.

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,480
Gu Nanshan doesn't play by the book at all.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
What should we do next?

192
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,040
Forget it.

193
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Use your strength.

194
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,200
