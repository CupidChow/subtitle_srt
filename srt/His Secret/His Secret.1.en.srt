1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm Lee You-ran from Lee Group.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,280
A year ago,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,520
when I was preparing for my honeymoon,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,600
I had an accident.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,840
and took my lover away in a car accident.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,400
[and brought my life to the abyss of darkness.]

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,840
Love.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,920
Friendship.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,880
Loyalty.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,520
Betrayal.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,159
A conspiracy I've been planning for years

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,840
is unfolding silently.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,240
It just started.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,520
Eat

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,960
Come and have a drink.

16
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,920
Beauty.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,480
Don't go.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,480
Baby, where are you going?

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,360
Why are you running?

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,360
Hello, baby.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,880
Stay away from me.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,160
Hey, give it back to me.

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,600
Baby, you're so pretty.

24
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,759
Don't touch me.

25
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,880
We just want to...

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,680
Bitch!

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Haotian

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
Haotian.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Did you have fun?

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,479
Get lost.

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,080
You should get out of here.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
You're so funny.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,680
Take your men and get out of here.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,640
Say that again.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Run! Run!

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,160
Run!

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
Run!

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,800
Impossible.

39
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,120
Impossible.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
It can't be him.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
My Haotian is dead.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
Who is he?

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,600
Help me.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,880
Help me.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,760
Help me.

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
In this world,

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,480
in this world?

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,440
Leave it to me.

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,720
You're awake.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,720
You can't move yet.

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,160
Lie down.

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,840
The doctor said it didn't stab the organs.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,800
I just need time to recover.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,720
By the way,

55
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,720
you called me last night.

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
What?

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,120
Did you mistake me for someone else?

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
I got the wrong person.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,280
Thank you so much.

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
If you hadn't showed up in time yesterday,

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
what would have happened.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Indeed.

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,760
In a foreign country,

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm envious

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,640
like me.

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm quite lucky.

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
My name is Li You Ran.

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,120
What about you?

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Gu Nanshan.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,400
and

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
Meet Nanshan.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
We have the latest news.

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
Li Xingbao, the head of Li Group,

75
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,000
died of a sudden illness two days ago.

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,400
But the only heir of the group, Lee You Ran,

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,720
has not appeared.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,080
He's missing.

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,080
This company is in trouble.

80
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,800
Why didn't Li You Ran show up?

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,440
Yes.

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,800
Mr. Li has only one child.

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
He's gone and doesn't show up.

84
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,760
I understand your emotions.

85
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
But emotions can't solve the problem.

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,400
We still have to wait.

87
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,280
about Mr. Li.

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
How long do we have to wait?

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
Several projects have been suspended.

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
If we wait any longer,

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
the project will be gone.

92
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,440
Mr. Li is not back.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
No one is in charge of the company.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
Mr. Lu,

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
you can decide.

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,800
No.

97
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
The priority now

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
is to find Mr. Li.

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,360
Excuse me.

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Did you see where he went?

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,240
He left this morning.

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,400
Thank you.

103
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Gu Nanshan, why did you leave without saying goodbye?

104
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
Lu Jian'an, stop right there!

105
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Tian Xinyao!

106
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,080
You bastard!

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,600
Mr. Li trusts you so much.

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
You watched her grow up.

109
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,680
But I didn't expect

110
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,560
you are such a heartless beast.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,480
Mr. Li just passed away.

112
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,720
Aren't you going to hold a funeral when he comes back?

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Are you so eager to seize power?

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,680
You're crazy.

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,880
Aren't you sad wearing this human skin?

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
Tian Xinyao.

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
Have you forgotten your surname is Tian?

118
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,440
You're a poor student sponsored by Li family.

119
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,120
Why are you so excited?

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,080
No matter what my surname is,

121
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
there are many people in the Li family.

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,640
Fine.

123
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,400
Find Ran back.

124
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
If I were you, I wouldn't be here.

125
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
if I were you.

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,400
Stop!

127
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,160
Make it clear.

128
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,200
What did you do to Yuran?

129
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,560
Why can't I reach her?

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
A playboy

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
is always fooling around abroad.

132
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
Can I know where it is?

133
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Find it yourself.

134
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,680
I'm sure you all know the company's situation.

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,680
It's time for the company

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,760
to make a decision.

137
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,560
The board meeting today

138
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,840
is to select new leaders.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,880
Since everyone is here,

140
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
let's raise our hands to vote.

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
I recommend Mr. Lu

142
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,200
to become

143
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
of the group.

144
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
I agree.

145
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,040
Me too.

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
I agree.

147
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,840
Thank you for your trust.

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
In that case,

149
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll take the responsibility

150
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,720
this responsibility.

151
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Uncle Lu.
