1
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,600
Thank you for your trust.

2
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,760
In that case,

3
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,320
I'll take the responsibility

4
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,480
this responsibility.

5
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,840
Uncle Lu.

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,000
Ranran.

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,440
You're back.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,800
My condolences.

9
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,680
Thank you.

10
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,360
for taking care of my father's funeral.

11
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,280
But I think

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,759
I think I should handle it myself.

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,720
Am I right, Uncle Lu?

14
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,240
Time waits for no one.

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,479
we'll make the decision for you.

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I know

17
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,320
you've been in a bad mood recently.

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,920
Take a rest.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,160
Leave the company to the uncles.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,440
It won't collapse.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,240
Don't worry.

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,320
Uncle Lu.

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
I know

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,560
I know.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
In private,

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,640
thank you

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
for your love for me.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,400
In public,

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,040
how can I

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
how can I forget

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,360
of your shareholders

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,960
and ignore the company?

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
My dad didn't teach me

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
didn't teach me that.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
Of course.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
What do you think?

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,400
From now on,

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,720
I'll take over Dad's work.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,840
Mr. Lu.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
I've read the file

41
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,079
about the succession.

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,680
Is there a problem?

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,880
No.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,520
There's no problem with the inheritance.

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
It's written clearly in the will.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,120
Lee You-ran is the only heir to Lee's Group.

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,120
But...

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,760
But what?

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
However,

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,400
in Mr. Li's will,

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,120
that Li Youran only had shares

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,840
she only had the right to divide shares.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
She has no administration rights.

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,560
That means

55
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,680
no matter how much shares she has,

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
she can't decide anything in our company.

57
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,880
You can say that.

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,320
Looks like God is helping us.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,079
He hit someone.

60
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,120
How do you drive?

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
You hit people when you see them.

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
What do you want to do?

63
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,880
I'll go to the hospital myself.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,920
How much?

65
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,040
Give me 5,000.

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,079
Okay, I'll transfer it to you.

67
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't give it to him.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,760
Gu Nanshan.

69
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
Come with me.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
None of your business.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,040
Get up.

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,560
She hit me.

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Why is he here again?

74
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,600
Could it be...

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,400
this is fate?

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
Dismiss.

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,120
Gu Nanshan.

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
You're back.

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Of course I'm Chinese.

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,360
He just left.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,960
What did you tell him?

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,440
He must be a scammer.

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,960
I lied to him that I was plain clothes.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,400
Thank you again.

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
Let me treat you to a meal.

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,280
I didn't get to thank you last time.

87
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
Don't mention it.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,080
You don't have to treat me.

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Be careful

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
be careful.

91
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
There are not so many good people.

92
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Bye.

93
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

94
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
Let's catch up.

95
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
There's nothing to talk about.

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,280
We're all busy.

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Bye.

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
Nice car.

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
Dad.

100
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm late.

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
Have you read Uncle Li's will?

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,240
We really don't have time now.

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,400
The shareholders' meeting is in three days.

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,240
If you don't get married soon,

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,960
both of us will be screwed.

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,440
Jommy Ans

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,080
is a lawyer handsome?

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,320
Not really.

110
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,400
Dr. Yang Xiao Guang

111
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,880
I heard he has a mine at home.

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Not good.

113
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,920
You don't like those with mine?

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Then this one.

115
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,000
Zhang Chuming: Zhang Chuming.

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,800
A famous designer.

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,080
A famous designer CEO.

118
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,440
A famous designer.

119
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,760
8,000 W a year.

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
This artist

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,000
A

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,680
a rising star.

123
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
But...

124
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,960
does he look too old?

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,120
It's good to be mature. He loves people.

126
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,920
No no I don't like it

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Sister

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Choose one and get married.

129
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,640
If you don't choose one or get married,

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
the company will change its owner.

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,680
Xinyao, I'll stop teasing you.

132
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Listen.

133
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,920
I already have someone in mind.

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,159
Lights.

135
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,640
You again?

136
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,280
Hello.

137
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm not okay.

138
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
You look serious.

139
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,920
Let me take you to the hospital.

140
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,320
It's nothing serious.

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,320
Okay.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,200
Hurry up.

143
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,320
Bring me the lighting board.

144
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,960
Do you work here?

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,080
Every time I see you,

146
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,480
whenever I see you?

147
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
Are you bad luck to me?

148
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
I haven't said how unlucky

149
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,280
every time I meet you.

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
It's easy.

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Just don't see me again.

152
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,440
Time to work.

153
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,360
Let's get to work.

154
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Let's get to work.

155
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Coming.

156
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
Come on.

157
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,560
Get up.

158
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,400
Gu Nanshan, wait and see.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll get you.
