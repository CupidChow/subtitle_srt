1
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,520
See?

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,400
I'll get back

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,240
what belongs to us.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,040
This position

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
should have been yours.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,440
But now,

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,240
belongs to me.

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,960
Easy

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,880
[Laughing]

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,160
What are you doing?

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,280
You have nothing

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,720
with Youran, you know?

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,600
Get lost!

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,320
Jia Yunsheng,

15
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,080
to take care of Jia Yunsheng.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,280
You just take care of him like this.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
It's all because of you.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm warning you.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,280
If anything happens to You,

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,400
I won't forgive you.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,280
It has nothing to do with you now.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,080
Do you hear me?

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,760
Get out of here!

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,960
Stop it!

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,800
This is a hospital.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
Fighting in the hospital.

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,520
Are you all crazy?

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,479
Who's his family?

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
Please come with me.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,200
The patient is not in a good condition.

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
The medicine has no effect on her.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,600
Her central nerves were severely affected.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,160
Her condition deteriorated quickly.

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,400
If it goes on like this,

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,120
maybe

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
become unconscious.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Family members should be prepared.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,080
We might need to make another decision.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
The patient needs 24-hour care.

40
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,000
Ordinary people

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,960
can't handle it.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,680
Of course.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
in the environment of going home,

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,200
she might

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,640
more stable.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,320
But in professional care,

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,360
the hospital

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,000
is safer.

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,440
So look.

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,280
whether to stay in the hospital

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
or go home?

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,320
You'd better make a decision before the patient wakes up.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,880
No matter what decision you make,

54
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,000
just tell her.

55
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,079
Don't let her panic.

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,240
Go home.

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,720
Stay in hospital.

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Doctor.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
Please get us discharged.

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,360
First, the patient is familiar with the family environment.

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,920
Second,

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,880
it will help the patient.

63
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's do it.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Don't look at him.

65
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
He has nothing to do with the patient now.

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,480
It's okay.

67
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,079
If you need someone

68
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,680
to provide facts or information,

69
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,640
You decide.

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,720
Maybe sometimes

71
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,960
you need to read

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
the information you need.

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Ranran.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

75
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Ranran.

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,440
I cut some fruits for you.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
to replenish your nutrition.

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,960
Good boy.

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Why are you so careless?

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,920
How is it?

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,159
Is it smooth?

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Everything is going well now.

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,680
Because Mr. Li Youran is sick,

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
the board of directors decided

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Mr. Jia Yunsheng.

86
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,920
Temporary.

87
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,720
of the company.

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
Thank you for your trust.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Haotian.

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Do you remember what I told you?

91
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Nanshan.

92
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,000
From now on, don't talk.

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,440
or react.

94
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
From now on,

95
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
don't come to me.

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,640
Don't come even if you miss me.

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll give the mysterious person a chance to approach me.

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,960
Only when I'm weak

99
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,920
he'll take the bait.

100
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,240
You have to retract your fist.

101
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
Then you can have strength.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,840
We need to take back our fists now.

103
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,520
so that we can see

104
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,200
where their fists come from.

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
It's too dangerous.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Let me be the bait.

107
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
Let's go back and think of another way.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,360
Honey.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,400
Listen to me.

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
It's not what you think.

111
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't want to see you anymore.

112
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
Ranran

113
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,840
The bath water is ready.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,400
And your favorite rose petals.

115
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Let's go.

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,520
Slow down

117
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
Ranran is the best

118
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
Let's take a shower.

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's take a shower in clothes.

120
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,520
The water is ready.

121
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,600
Lift your foot.

122
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,440
Slowly.

123
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Ran, sit down.

124
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Ranran.

125
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,520
Do you remember

126
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,280
when we were in college,

127
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
we went swimming at the beach together.

128
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,200
Once,

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,880
you had a cramp

130
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,120
I had a leg cramp.

131
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,360
I saved you.

132
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
I thought

133
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
you would fall in love with me from now on.

134
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,640
But you just thanked me.

135
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,280
Do you know

136
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,760
I take care of you every day.

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
and take care of you.

138
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,120
How do I feel

139
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
Have you eaten ribs

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
Every time when stewing ribs

141
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,159
you must clean it carefully

142
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Be patient.

143
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
Right?

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,760
Are you thirsty?

145
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Have some water.
