1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,000
Gu Nanshan.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
It's been a year.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,160
Let's get some fresh air.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,240
Take your script.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,880
and play your role well.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
you'll see your dad.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,360
Remember,

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,600
let her fall in love with you

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,160
and hurt her.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,160
and let her be doomed forever.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm not Gu Nanshan.

12
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,080
It stopped in less than an hour.

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,920
This is all real money.

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
Is this company image

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,600
to play around?

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,960
An image spokesperson.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,800
For what?

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,760
I've told you that this young girl is in a difficult position.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,360
She can take over such a big company.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,800
Please calm down.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,000
We're having a shareholder meeting.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
We're not here to fight.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,680
We need to solve the problem.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,440
How about this?

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,360
let's give Mr. Li another chance

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,240
to see what she will say.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,479
I swear.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,280
It was really like this.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,880
I received an interview call that day.

30
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,960
So I went.

31
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,039
Mr. Gu, please have a seat.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,720
I’ll get the reporter

33
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,840
who interviewed you.

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,280
I waited for over an hour.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,640
The reporter didn’t show up.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,840
Mr. Gu, I’m really sorry.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,120
Let’s meet another day.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
Okay.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
This way, please.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
Mr. Gu.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
What’s wrong?

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,280
Honey.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Trust me.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,440
I trust you.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,320
Why don't you let me prove it?

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
Since I chose you,

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,440
I will believe you.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,160
You won't lie to me.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,080
right?

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll deal with those shareholders.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,280
After your father passed away,

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,320
we took good care of you.

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,920
But the trouble you caused this time

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,880
doesn't make sense.

55
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Everyone,

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
I believe Gu Nanshan's character.

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
He would never do that.

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,040
So someone

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,960
someone did this on purpose.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
What evidence do you have

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,160
to prove that he's innocent?

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
Not yet.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Ranran.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,160
Our uncles are in love.

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
It's none of your business.

66
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,079
But as the president of a company,

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
you can't be so romantic.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,640
Mr. Li.

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,079
We don't want to

70
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,360
to hear you show off.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
We just want to know

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,560
the company's loss.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
How can we redeem the company's image?

74
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,560
If we can't,

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
what should we do?

76
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,240
How?

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
Who will make up for our loss?

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Your loss.

79
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
your loss.

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,680
Yunsheng,

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
If you are willing,

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,760
I can sell it at the original price

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,399
at the original price

84
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,200
to acquire your shares.

85
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
Who are you?

86
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,760
Jia Yunsheng.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,000
CEO of Morgstan venture.

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
I have acquired

89
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,480
in the market.

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,640
I don't mind having more.

91
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,400
I think highly of your company.

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,440
But

93
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,720
I think highly of Mr. Li.

94
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,240
If anyone here

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,000
is not satisfied with Mr. Li's identity,

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,159
you can consider it.

97
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,400
Thank you so much.

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,800
I owe you again.

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,120
Don't mention it.

100
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,760
I've heard about your family.

101
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
I didn't know you took our shares.

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Easy.

103
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,320
I have to explain to you in advance.

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
I acquired your shares

105
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
to help you.

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,240
I told you

107
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
to protect you.

108
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,240
So don't worry.

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,840
I will be by your side.

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,560
I won't let you fight alone.

111
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
Yunsheng,

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,800
Come to my home after work.

113
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,120
Let me introduce someone to you.

114
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Right?

115
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,680
It's different.

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,840
The fruit is cut.

117
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,200
Thank you, honey.

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
Not at all.

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
Let me introduce him to you.

120
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,880
This is Jia Yunsheng.

121
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,120
My senior.

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,159
just came back from Wall Street recently.

123
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,800
This is my best friend, Tian Xinyao.

124
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's sincerely thank

125
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
Yunsheng.

126
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,760
and Tian Xinyao to congratulate us on our wedding.

127
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's drink juice instead.

128
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Cheers.

129
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,520
Wait.

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
Before we toast,

131
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,280
Gu, I have to remind you.

132
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
In the future,

133
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
be good to Youran.

134
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,840
Don't let her down.

135
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,760
Don't worry, Yunsheng.

136
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
I will take good care of her.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,080
Cheers.

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,600
What's wrong?

139
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,440
I broke the plate.

140
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,880
You're so careless. Come here.

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,800
Hands up

142
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
Why?

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,480
I heard that if you put your hands up,

144
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,520
the blood won't come out.

145
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,760
Wait for me.

146
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,200
It hurts.

147
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,200
No.

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,960
Thank you for earlier.

149
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,320
for acting with me.

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,400
Taking money

151
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,800
to help people.

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
It's my duty.

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
All right.

154
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I'll go back to my room and sleep.

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
Right.

156
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
Higher.

157
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Can you drive?

158
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,440
I don't see anyone.

159
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,520
Gu Nanshan.

160
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,720
You're brave.

161
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
But don't forget

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
I have your father.

163
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560
If you don't want anything to happen to him,

164
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,080
just act according to the script I gave you.

165
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,280
Remember.

166
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
You're an actor.

167
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,520
Mr. Lu.

168
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,760
Everything you asked me to do is done.
