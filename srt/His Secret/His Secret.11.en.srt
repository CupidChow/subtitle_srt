1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,800
Did you call me?

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,480
How is it going?

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Mr. Lu, we've already blocked it.

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,600
Okay.

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,120
Let me tell you.

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,160
health City project

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,240
is the top priority of our company.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,240
You must grasp the quality

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,120
Hold on to the production.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,920
Be careful.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,760
Right? Look.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,920
Isn't it well written?

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,120
Think of danger in peace.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,200
Defend against the situation.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,120
Safety first.

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,720
right?

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,519
Mr. Lu.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,560
Mr. Lu.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Xianbing.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,960
How many times have I told you?

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,000
to do things steadily.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,160
Don't panic.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,360
Mr. Lu.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,760
Can I have a word with you?

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,600
Hold on.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,120
What is it?

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,960
Mr. Lu.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,039
The financial department has started

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,640
checking the accounts between you and health City.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,400
Really?

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,240
Mr. Lu.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
Gu Nanshan, where are you?

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
What happened?

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,759
Why are you so angry?

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,800
I don't care where you are.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,120
Come back right now.

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
I'm reading poems and far away.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,520
Look at you.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Come back now!

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,200
Mr. Lu.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,280
The signal is bad.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,040
That bastard.

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,120
Mr. Lu.

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,600
The most important thing now

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,880
is not just the 20 million

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
This is the hardest part.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,079
We can’t erase

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
can’t be erased.

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,360
I don't know.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,960
You don't have to remind me.

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,760
Go, go, go.

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,800
Go raise money for me.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Okay.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Mr. Lu.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Have you solved the problem of embezzlement?

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,400
Who are you?

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
You're the one

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Did you call me?

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Tell me.

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
How will you help me?

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,079
I can help you.

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,520
to clean the accounts.

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
I'll give you 20 million.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
But from now on,

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,079
you have to listen to me.

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
What do you need me to do?

67
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,040
After the bill is settled,

68
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,200
quit the project.

69
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,079
Quit the company?

70
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,280
Are you kidding me?

71
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
The company's shares are mine.

72
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,960
I can quit the project.

73
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,600
But if I quit the company,

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Impossible.

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,480
It's up to you

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,760
It's up to you.

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,840
Give me

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,160
to me.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,320
I'll give you

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,840
one minute to think about it.

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,600
Start.

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Time's up.

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,240
I promise you.

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,680
to report this to everyone.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,280
This...

86
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,400
The second fund for the health city project

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
has arrived.

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
Next,

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,920
Mr. Lu.

90
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,240
Wait a minute.

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
What is it?

92
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
The finance and legal department

93
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
these days.

94
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,960
Mr. Lu.

95
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,000
Take a look.

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,440
Give me an explanation.

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
What do you mean?

98
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Explain what?

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
The accounts of the health City project are in chaos.

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
The amount of entry and exit cannot match the account.

101
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,880
A large amount of funds were circulated.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Mr. Lu,

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,880
You embezzled public funds.

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,800
Do you think I need to explain?

105
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,840
Impossible.

106
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,640
Are you sure?

107
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,880
Let's face to face.

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,720
Ask the legal and finance to come to the meeting room.

109
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,160
We'll check it in person.

110
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,120
After verification,

111
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,040
there is no illegal operation

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,800
in health City.

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,520
Lu Jian'an's personal account

114
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
with Lu Jianan's personal account.

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,000
The route of funds is clear.

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
We have evidence.

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
Thank you.

118
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,280
Back then,

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,920
we followed Li

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
to fight the world together.

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
We've been through a lot.

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
Charge into the battle.

123
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
Li trusts us so much.

124
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,800
And now,

125
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
we're old.

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm a nuisance to young people.

127
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,440
If I say it wrong,

128
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,560
I was targeted.

129
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,560
Ran,

130
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,240
If you want Uncle Lu to quit,

131
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,080
just say it.

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,400
As long as you tell me,

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
I'll give up my position.

134
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm not that narrow-minded

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm not that narrow-minded.

136
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Mr. Lu,

137
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,560
It's our fault.

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,400
Sorry.

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,960
No, no, no.

140
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,880
I'm the one who should be sorry.

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
I failed to satisfy you.

142
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,159
I should apologize.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
My ability

144
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,080
my way of work

145
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
I can't get your trust.

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,840
I think

147
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,400
it's meaningless.

148
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Every emperor has his own courtier.

149
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
Today I announce

150
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,560
officially quit.

151
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
of the health City Project.

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,120
You can use whoever you want.

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
You can trust whoever you like.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Do whatever you want.

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,040
Everyone,

156
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
I

157
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,840
leave first.

158
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,240
Please

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,320
to help Mr. Li.

160
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Ran.

161
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,240
Goodbye.

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,480
I'll take over

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
the health city project.

164
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,440
Mr. Lu.

165
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
What happened?

166
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,159
What happened?

167
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,040
Why did you suddenly quit the board?

168
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,800
You brat.

169
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
How dare you come to see me?

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
We are allies.

171
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
We're on the same boat.

172
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Don't get mad at me.

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
How can I not be angry?

174
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Look at me.

175
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,280
Don't be angry.

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,200
Mr. Lu.

177
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm here to help you.

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,360
When I heard this,

179
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
I rushed over immediately.

180
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,480
Those bastards have gone too far.

181
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,920
From now on,

182
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,880
I will do whatever you say.

183
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
We can't return it.

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
We have to continue.

185
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
Damn you!

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,840
Didn't you cheat me enough?

187
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,880
Don't say that.

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
When did I cheat you?

189
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,080
Did you do what I promised you?

190
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,960
Who knew you'd embezzle money?

191
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
Who did?

192
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,240
When did you see that?

193
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Do you have evidence?

194
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,560
Are you bored?

195
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
Hurry up.

196
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,440
Come here.

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,280
Hurry up.

198
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,840
Get him out.

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Let go.

200
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
In that case,

201
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
I won't stand on ceremony.

202
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,760
Lu Jian'an.

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,600
If you dare to touch Li Youran,

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,720
one finger,

205
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,880
I won't forgive you.
