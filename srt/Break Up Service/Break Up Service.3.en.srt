1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,830
I hire you.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,940
Okay.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,460
Alright, you are Team A.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,840
You made a mistake again.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,230
You are so useless.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,520
Can’t you train me properly?

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,190
Do you really think I am training you?

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,920
Can’t you see that I’m trying to get rid of you?

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,460
I won’t endure it anymore.

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,300
I’m going to give the snake another chance.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,130
The snake has some skills that I don’t.

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,500
(Are you interested in the snake?)

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,790
Interested? No way.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,130
Ice and Mocha,
how did you feel about your fan meeting?

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,940
It was very memorable.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,000
It was a gift from us
to the fans of “Friend? Who Is Your Friend?”.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,300
It has been two years
since we began the drama project.

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,660
Actually, it has been three years.

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,080
We have been together for three years?

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,640
He means we have been friends for three years.

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,210
Oh.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,740
Mocha, who is your friend? Don’t be shy.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,850
The series was very successful.

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,730
Why is there no sequel to the series?

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,940
Mocha, your contract will expire this month, won’t it?

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,080
You won’t renew your contract, right?

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,450
That’s why there’s no plan for the sequel.

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,890
Will you continue to work as a shipped couple?

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,830
How can she ask him that?

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,960
Please answer it.

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,430
Mocha, please answer the question.

32
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:40,240
Please answer the question.

33
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,710
Who said we are just a shipped couple?

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,050
We are a real couple.

35
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,900
Why aren’t you renewing the contract?

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,870
It’s none of your business.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,290
If it’s not you,
who else can be my shipped partner?

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,350
I’m sorry, Ice.

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,530
But I made up my mind.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,160
I will hold a press conference for it soon.

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,420
You can’t do this to me.

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,170
Tell me…

43
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,900
I finished my schedule.

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
I’m heading home now.

45
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,620
I miss you too.

46
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,780
See you at the condo.

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,470
Hey, Mocha.

48
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,240
Mocha.

49
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,120
I’m not finished.

50
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,830
Jued has been missing work for a few days.

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,970
Is she alright?

52
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,270
Hello. Test.

53
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,020
Hello.

54
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,260
Did you fire Jued?

55
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,700
No.

56
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,730
It’s none of your business.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,620
I don’t want to be nosy.

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,640
But I feel bad for you.

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,010
You’re going back to work alone again.

60
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,950
Here, this is for you.

61
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,310
Are you trying to poison me?

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,580
What poison?

63
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,880
I just want you to take better care of yourself.

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,670
You are worried about me?

65
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,900
Boss, don’t you know
how important you are to the company?

66
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,220
You’re clueless.

67
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,330
I’ll open it for you.

68
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,870
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

69
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,940
Are you trying to bribe me?

70
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,960
Huh?

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,340
Bribe?

72
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,010
Why do you think of me so negatively?

73
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,380
It’s nothing. I’m here to help you.

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,540
Who asked for your help?

75
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,410
You did.

76
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,210
You can’t do this alone. You need me.

77
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,880
Why did you take it from me?

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,380
Stop.

79
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,130
Break up Mocha and his real partner.

80
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,820
A request from Ice, his shipped partner.

81
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,480
I am their fan.

82
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,860
Their chemistry is so good.

83
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,690
So?

84
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,140
I…

85
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,310
I want to see them with my own eyes.

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,650
Okay.

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,380
You let me go with you?

88
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,150
Go back to where you came from.

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,550
Go.

90
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,990
Go away.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,220
What the heck?!

92
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,010
Jerk.

93
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,620
The snake has been missing work for three days.

94
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,180
Isn’t that a good thing?

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,410
You like working alone, don’t you?

96
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,420
It’s great.

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,840
My office is not crowded anymore.

98
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,060
I have the room to myself again.

99
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,980
Then why are you complaining?

100
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,610
She is the first one I accepted as my partner.

101
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,160
I gave her a pass on probation.

102
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,090
I got her a desk.

103
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,420
Why didn’t she come to work?

104
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,520
You are asking me? How would I know?

105
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,630
Why don’t you ask the snake?

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,130
No.

107
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,900
I’ve given in to her way too much already.

108
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,880
But you want to know
what’s going on with her, jerk.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,970
You are a hypocrite.

110
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,070
You’d better decide what exactly you want.

111
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,050
Stop wasting my time.

112
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,350
In case you forgot,

113
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,590
I work in the Emergency Room.

114
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,840
This is not an emergency?

115
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,220
If you aren’t going to die within five minutes,
you’d better hang up the phone.

116
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,170
So I can go back to work.

117
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,200
Wait.

118
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,710
Tell me if you were me, what would you do?

119
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,500
I would call the snake, not me.

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,420
I’m hanging up. You are wasting my time.

121
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,230
Shit.

122
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,360
It’s a snake, not a shit.

123
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,300
I was bitten by the snake two days ago.

124
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,410
Am I going to die?

125
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,580
Let’s call her to get it over with.

126
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,550
(Sorry. The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at this time.)

127
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,390
Okay. Forget it.

128
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,830
I haven’t seen her
come out of the room for a few days.

129
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,780
Is she…should I call 911?

130
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,540
Okay. I did my best.

131
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,240
This is it.

132
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,620
What?

133
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,400
What smell is this?

134
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,430
Her phone is here.

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,200
It must be the smell of a dead body.

136
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,280
What should I do if she dies in the room?

137
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,160
Who would want to rent it after this?

138
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,070
I’m screwed.

139
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,210
It’s rotten chicken.

140
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,890
Are you sure?

141
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,550
Don’t you see the chicken thigh?

142
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,130
Then where is her body?

143
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,610
(Help me.)

144
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,020
(Help me.)

145
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,690
(Help me.)

146
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,150
(Help…)

147
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,760
Help me.

148
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,500
You were locked in the bathroom
because the doorknob was broken.

149
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,980
You didn’t have your phone with you.

150
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,320
Your electricity and water were disconnected.

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,460
So the fresh food in the fridge went rotten.

152
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,060
She didn’t pay her rent.

153
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,160
So I need to disconnect her power and water.

154
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
I was locked in the bathroom for three days.

155
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,240
How could I pay you the rent?

156
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,490
How would I know that?

157
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,280
I was lucky to have water to drink
when I was in there.

158
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,050
Otherwise, I would have been dead.

159
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,440
I have a water bucket.

160
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,790
Don’t imagine things.

161
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,820
If I died, it was your fault.

162
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,790
The doorknob has been broken for a while.

163
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,650
Why didn’t you fix it?

164
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,220
You always pay your rent late.

165
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,950
So I delayed the repair.

166
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,840
It was broken before I moved in.

167
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,550
The table, the closet, and the bed are all broken.

168
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,230
It’s not true. Don’t blame me.

169
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,460
They were in good condition before you moved in.

170
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,790
See? The chair is also broken.

171
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,010
He broke it. Don’t blame me.

172
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,240
It’s been broken for a while.

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,420
I put up with it because I didn’t want to bother you.

174
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,870
Don’t blame me.

175
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,260
Wow!

176
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,120
Is this for watching TV?

177
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,640
Wow!

178
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,450
Hello!

179
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,040
Wow!

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,570
I bought it as an investment.

181
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,490
I stop by from time to time.

182
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,400
Thank you, Boss, for letting me stay here.

183
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,210
I will never forget your kindness.

184
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:52,900
Who let you stay here?

185
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,380
I sent you here to work.

186
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,820
Our target lives in a room down the hallway.

187
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,440
When you finish your work,

188
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,770
you’ll move back to your old apartment.

189
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,860
But I really like this place.

190
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,750
Boss, can I rent it from you?

191
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,560
Please.

192
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
You can’t afford it.

193
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,670
If I successfully wrap up the case,

194
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,820
will you rent it to me at a discounted price?

195
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,860
Please.

196
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,360
Please, Boss.

197
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,250
Go do your job.

198
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,520
I’ll hurry back.

199
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,460
I’m going to work.

200
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,330
[Our target is leaving his room.]

201
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,700
[I’ll send his photos to you to stir things up.]

202
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,120
[Deliver what you have promised.
Then we will talk.]

203
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,270
[Talk about me renting your condo, right?]

204
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,820
[Go do your job.]

205
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,410
My lovely furniture.

206
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,940
Please wait for me.

207
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,660
I’ll persuade Boss to let us stay together.

208
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,680
Wait.

209
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,870
Which floor?

210
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,920
Same floor.

211
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:58,790
Oops.

212
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,990
My hands are full. Can you pick it up for me?

213
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,390
I…

214
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,320
I’ll carry the basket for you.

215
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,690
Are you Mocha
from the series “Friends? Who Is Your Friend?”

216
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,320
Yes.

217
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,970
I watched every episode. I’m your fan.

218
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,030
Can I take a picture with you?

219
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,580
Can I get a few more?

220
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,950
Excuse me.

221
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,800
Aren’t you too close?

222
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,410
Excuse me.

223
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,610
Hey.

224
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,100
Can I take it again?

225
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,020
Look at the camera, please.

226
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,220
Excuse me.

227
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,920
Aren’t you too close?

228
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,170
Can I take it again?

229
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,830
Excuse me.

230
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,420
Excuse me.

231
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
One more, please.

232
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,120
I apologize on my sister's behalf.

233
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,740
She got too excited when she met Mocha.

234
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,050
I’m sorry.

235
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,660
It’s okay. I get how my fans feel.

236
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,620
It’s not easy for our paths to cross.

237
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,940
It’s normal that she would be excited.

238
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,190
Please continue to support me.

239
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,610
You can support him.

240
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,060
But if you stalk him again,

241
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,780
I will have to report it to the police.

242
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,790
If there’s nothing else, excuse me.

243
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,220
Thank you, Made.

244
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,030
I need to fine you 500 baht
for causing the mess in the elevator.

245
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,340
It’s your right to let anyone stay in your room.

246
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,680
But please make sure
that she won’t harass other residents.

247
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,140
Are you sure she’s your sister?

248
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,600
Fine, I’ll believe you.

249
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,590
But I need to ask you not to make loud noises.

250
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,200
Loud noises?

251
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,340
What noises?

252
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,970
I told you to flirt with him, not harass him.

253
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,290
I have to pay for that stupid fine.

254
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,780
What did you do to my room?

255
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
Who is Made?

256
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,330
What right does he have to fine us?

257
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,740
He’s the condo manager.

258
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,840
What is the condo manager?

259
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,440
I never lived in a condo before.

260
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,580
He oversees the operational activities,

261
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,020
handles the owners’ complaints,

262
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,820
and ensures compliance with the condo rules.

263
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,970
Smoking in the hallway. Fine 500 baht.

264
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,830
Open your mouth and eat it.

265
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,500
Open your mouth wider.

266
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,180
Bringing food into the gym. Fine 500 baht.

267
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,570
Eating food in the pool. Fine 1,000 baht.

268
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,400
Made is extraordinary.

269
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,890
Whenever someone violates the rules,
he will appear immediately.

270
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,950
He’s like the condo’s guardian god.

271
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,460
He’s giving out fine receipts
like they are traffic tickets.

272
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,070
You’re on his radar now.

273
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,770
He will never let you go near Mocha.

274
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,390
You are now useless.

275
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,080
Go back to your apartment.

276
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,160
Please don’t kick me out yet.

277
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,720
I think I have a way.

278
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,080
Hello.

279
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,460
What is your business here?

280
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,660
I just moved in.

281
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,410
Your name is Kormai?

282
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,510
It’s cute just like your looks.

283
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,980
Really?

284
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,160
You too.

285
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,740
But my name is Jued.

286
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,330
Gaeng Jued is tasty.

287
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,380
I bet you are as tasty as your name.

288
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,730
Kormai, are you living here alone?

289
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,570
No.

290
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,870
I’m living with my boyfriend.

291
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,280
He’s at work.

292
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,200
He must be the guy I met this morning.

293
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,270
I went down to do my laundry
and met him in the elevator.

294
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,070
He’s so handsome.

295
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,470
Right?

296
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,980
I also think he’s very handsome.

297
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,970
Your boyfriend is also handsome.

298
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,560
He’s not my boyfriend. He’s my brother.

299
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,060
I don’t believe you.

300
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,600
He’s really my brother.

301
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,090
I’ll tell you something.

302
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,880
The last girl also said she was his sister.

303
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:32,930
Boss.

304
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,230
[Warning: 500 baht fine for noise disturbance.]

305
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,860
Now, I get why Made warned us about loud noises.

306
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,130
But I like you

307
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,140
because you never make loud noises.

308
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,360
Are you admitting that he’s your boyfriend?

309
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,840
I guess.

310
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,540
You guess?

311
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,070
He let me live here

312
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,340
but he has never said what I am to him.

313
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,870
I don’t know what he’s doing behind my back.

314
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,580
Men can’t be trusted.

315
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,280
I’ll tell you something.

316
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,880
When I met your boyfriend this morning,

317
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,660
he was the one who started the conversation.

318
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,050
He told me he was single and lived alone.

319
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,050
Honey. I’m back.

320
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,790
He’s back at the right time.

321
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,940
Ouch!

322
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,070
Why are you hitting me?

323
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,120
Why did you say you were single?

324
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,670
Let me go.

325
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,050
When did I say that?

326
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,470
How would I know?

327
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,400
Excuse me.

328
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,060
Causing noise in the common area.

329
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,020
Fine 500 baht.

330
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,130
Ouch.

331
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,070
It’s okay, honey.

332
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,810
Are you Pop?

333
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,650
I wired the fine to you.

334
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,980
I’m sorry.

335
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,450
I thought Kormai was Mocha’s girlfriend.

336
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,950
She just does a part-time job.

337
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,870
She cleans his room.

338
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,150
Mocha lives alone.

339
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,530
What about his boyfriend?

340
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,430
Do you mean Ice, his shipped partner?

341
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,010
He never came here.

342
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,550
Every time I go to clean his room,
I never see anyone.

343
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,420
The only person I met in his room was Made.

344
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,450
He hires me to do the job.

345
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,150
Why did Made do that?

346
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,140
Mocha is probably busy with work,

347
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,280
shooting a series and making an appearance.

348
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,850
So he doesn’t have time to do it.

349
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,130
Made helps him take care of it.

350
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,070
Although he’s strict,

351
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,790
he takes good care of the residents.

352
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,170
Picking the plant leaves.

353
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,640
If we don’t look closely, we might think
they are the condo manager and the resident.

354
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,710
But actually…

355
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,780
they are dating.

356
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,430
[Love you.]

357
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,060
[Me too.]

358
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,090
[I want to be fined too.]

359
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,250
Picking a flower from the common area.

360
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
Fine 500 baht.

361
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,970
I’ll give it back to you.

362
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,920
(Even though they love each other so much,
they need to keep it a secret.)

363
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,000
(Because Mocha is a BL actor
who has a shipped partner.)

364
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,750
(He is so famous.)

365
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,760
(He can’t let anyone know
that he has a boyfriend.)

366
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,090
How do they hide the relationship
from other residents?

367
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,850
When someone violates the condo rules,
have any of them seen Made before he fines them?

368
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,750
[I’m home.]

369
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,400
(Since he’s the condo manager,
he can be anywhere in the condo.)

370
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,540
(No one will suspect him.)

371
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,090
Hello.

372
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,150
(But for his secret safety,

373
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,050
he uses the route that no one usually uses.)

374
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,080
I want to eat it now.

375
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,590
I want to eat deep-fried dough sticks too.

376
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,580
(He’s thorough
and knows how to fly under the radar.)

377
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,570
(But he cannot escape from my radar.)

378
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,130
Please continue.

379
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,060
What are you doing here?

380
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,020
I’m here to check on the progress of your mission.

381
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,420
Please continue with your briefing.

382
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,030
The conclusion is…

383
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,770
It is…

384
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,710
Mocha is dating Made, the condo manager.

385
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
How was it? Did I do a good job?

386
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,970
Not bad.

387
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,370
Will you let me rent…

388
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,260
You can now move out.

389
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,830
Why?

390
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,450
I no longer need a girl on this mission.

391
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,160
I’ll volunteer to replace Jued on the mission.

392
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,920
Sir.

393
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,260
Hey.

394
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,940
Hey.

395
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,660
How can you do this to me?

396
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,360
I have a mustache. It means I’m a man.

397
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,840
Sis, what are you doing?

398
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,270
I’m a bro today.

399
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,490
What are you looking at?

400
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,150
Asshole.

401
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,710
I’m calling from Room 110.

402
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,310
My pipe is broken.

403
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,560
(I’ll send a plumber to your room.
You need to wait around 20 minutes.)

404
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,160
It will be too late. My room will be flooded.

405
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,410
(But the plumber is busy.)

406
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,150
If he’s busy, you should come to fix it.

407
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,300
Come here right now.

408
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,360
What would you do
if the water leaks into other units?

409
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,380
(Okay.)

410
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,250
Come in.

411
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,630
Your shirt is wet. Why don’t you change it?

412
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,490
I like it this way. It’s cool.

413
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,900
What about you? Why are you sweating?

414
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,240
Are you hot?

415
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:45,910
No.

416
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,430
I’ll call the plumber.

417
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,350
I saw it.

418
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,790
You kept glancing at me.

419
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,200
Are you crazy? When did I do that?

420
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,630
I will never be interested in
a troubled resident like you.

421
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,900
Me too.

422
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,200
I’m usually only interested in women.

423
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,480
You know what?

424
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,830
You are the first man I’m interested in.

425
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,730
Boss.

426
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,740
Made.

427
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,340
Boss, are you hooking up
with the condo manager?

428
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,310
How could you do this to me?

429
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,720
Are you cheating on me?

430
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,390
No, Mocha. It’s not what you think.

431
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,280
It’s exactly what you think, Mocha.

432
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Your boyfriend is cheating on you
with my boyfriend.

433
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,230
Who is your boyfriend?

434
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,060
You.

435
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,110
You fall so hard for him
that you forget that I’m your girlfriend?

436
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,060
Mocha, look.

437
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,910
It’s not what you think. Don’t listen to her.

438
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,770
It is what you think.

439
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,600
It’s not. I fell.

440
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,840
You saw it with your own eyes.

441
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,180
Let’s go back to our room and talk.

442
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,890
There’s no need to talk.

443
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,510
Hey!

444
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,570
I’m here to fix his pipe.

445
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,140
I’m telling you the truth, Mocha.

446
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,420
Who is dating whom?

447
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,630
Who is cheating on whom?

448
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,450
I’m not sure.

449
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,190
No.

450
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,650
I broke them up.

451
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,160
You need to let me stay here.

452
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,180
When did I agree to that?

453
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,610
You assumed that yourself.

454
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,600
I said get out.

455
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,230
No.

456
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,020
Get out.

457
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,520
No.

458
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,690
Help me.

459
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,550
No.

460
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,480
After this mission,

461
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,840
I’ll throw you out of the window with the sofa.

462
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,230
Please make yourself at home.

463
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,740
There was nothing going on
between me and your boyfriend.

464
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,490
It was an accident.

465
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,250
It’s too late.

466
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,840
We already broke up.

467
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,930
But Mocha and I,

468
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,650
we reconciled.

469
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,090
Huh?

470
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,810
Didn’t you two break up?

471
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,630
No way. We didn’t.

472
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,910
Mocha can’t stay mad at me for too long.

473
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,940
He loves me so much.

474
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,140
He’s a famous actor.

475
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,560
He can afford to live anywhere.

476
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,410
But he chose to live here because of me.

477
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,930
Since you already know about our relationship,

478
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,950
I have a tea to spill.

479
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,430
Mocha will not do a BL series anymore.

480
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,140
Because he wants to go public
with our relationship.

481
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,820
(My room.)

482
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,250
He will sign with A25,

483
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,120
which focuses on acting skills, not shipping.

484
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,630
He’s leaving to announce

485
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,800
that he will not renew his contract.

486
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,130
He does that for me.

487
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,660
(My room.)

488
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,080
(You are so useless.)

489
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,730
(Do everything to stop Mocha
from attending the press conference.)

490
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,350
(Prepare the photos for me.)

491
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,310
(I’ll take care of the rest.)

492
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,030
(Roger that.)

493
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,730
I’m sorry.

494
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,430
It’s okay.

495
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,260
What?

496
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,940
Hey, what are you doing?

497
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,460
I’m sorry.

498
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,430
Got it.

499
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,290
Hey, you.

500
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,110
Give it back.

501
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,090
Give it back.

502
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,090
Where are you going?

503
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,750
Give it to me.

504
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,900
Give it to me.

505
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,150
Give it to me.

506
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,530
What are you doing?

507
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,350
I don’t want Mocha to quit doing BL series.

508
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,640
I want to watch your series forever.

509
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,700
Mocha, don’t walk away from your fans.

510
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,330
Please don’t leave us.

511
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,190
Mocha, take it.

512
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,630
You, come with me.

513
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,230
Mocha.

514
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,270
Mocha.

515
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,960
Don’t quit BL series.

516
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,990
Mocha.

517
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,250
Mocha.

518
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,420
(Plan A fails, doesn’t it?)

519
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,420
(It’s okay. Let’s move on to plan B.)

520
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,800
Sweetie, what’s wrong?

521
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,890
Did someone upset you?

522
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,710
Mocha.

523
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,710
Tong.

524
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,170
Hello.

525
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,230
What are you doing here?

526
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,730
I want to talk to you.

527
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,520
Sure.

528
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,050
Who is that, sis?

529
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,310
He…

530
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,860
He’s the director of the film production company

531
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,940
that Mocha is signing with, sis.

532
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,710
Oh. Who is your sister?

533
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,700
I shouldn’t believe the Break-Up app.

534
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,730
They said they could break up couples.

535
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,950
It’s a total scam. It’s so shitty.

536
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,790
I shouldn’t…

537
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,950
Hey, if you don’t want to eat the powder,

538
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,710
keep your mouth shut.

539
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,590
Do you hear me?

540
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,790
Someone sent this to me.

541
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,130
If these photos are leaked,

542
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,190
it will affect my movie.

543
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,050
What would I tell the press?

544
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,120
You can tell them the truth.

545
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,300
This is my personal life.

546
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,310
I want them to see me as an actor
who can play different roles.

547
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,730
Not an actor who depends on shipping
and BL chemistry.

548
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,150
You want them to focus on your acting,

549
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,080
not the shipping.

550
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,570
You are a real actor.

551
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
I made the right decision to work with you.

552
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,250
So you are okay with my decision?

553
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,080
I’m okay with it.

554
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,070
My company produces various genres of movies.

555
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,800
They are 30 minutes late.

556
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,050
Why didn’t the press conference start yet?

557
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,570
Why are you here?

558
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,540
Why don’t you stop Mocha?

559
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,820
You two are up to something again, right?

560
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,800
No, I didn’t do anything.

561
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,290
I don’t need to do it anymore.

562
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,630
Hello, everyone.

563
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,790
I hold the press conference today

564
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,180
because I have an announcement to make.

565
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,020
The series “Friends? Who Is Your Friends?”

566
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,250
It will have a sequel.

567
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,650
The title is “Boyfriend? Who Is Your Boyfriend?”

568
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,230
I made the right decision to work with you.

569
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,430
But…

570
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,610
for the movie you were cast in,

571
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,710
I need to change the leading actor.

572
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:16,910
Why?

573
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,200
Even if you aren’t shipped with another actor,

574
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,630
you will be shipped with an actress.

575
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,010
But you told me

576
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,750
you don’t want to focus on shipping.

577
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,680
But that’s…

578
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,570
It’s okay.

579
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,050
You should sign with my company.

580
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,210
I’m sure the right project will come along one day.

581
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,010
But it will take some time.

582
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,830
This means you are renewing your contract, right?

583
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,580
Yes.

584
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,130
Where else can I go…

585
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,010
when my boyfriend is here?

586
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,230
Who is your boyfriend?

587
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,100
I guess you get what you want.

588
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,350
They continue to be the shipped couple.

589
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,370
What will you do next?

590
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,330
I guess

591
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,600
I’ll go back to my old life.

592
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,470
Being the condo manager and the resident?

593
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,530
Can I ask you something?

594
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,290
Aren’t you tired of using the fire escape
to go back to your room?

595
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,900
Going to the gym together,

596
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,010
swimming in the pool together,

597
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,890
holding hands in the common area,

598
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,460
or doing other things that other couples can do.

599
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,170
But you can’t do it.

600
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,690
Moreover, you can’t express your affection
in a public place.

601
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,440
For this unclear relationship,

602
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,710
is it worth all the effort you’re giving?

603
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,950
I have to hide our relationship,

604
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,290
and wait until your contract expires again?

605
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,880
The new company can’t show me
a clear plan for my career.

606
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,140
So I have to choose this way.

607
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,140
You also don’t have a clear plan for me.

608
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,440
This time, I’ll make the call.

609
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,330
I think we should stop here.

610
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,850
No, everything I did was for us.

611
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,490
No, you didn’t do it for us.

612
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,370
It’s for you, just you.

613
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,880
Made, are you really leaving me?

614
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,110
No.

615
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,570
You are the one who will leave.

616
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,200
This is my room.

617
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,940
I want to use the elevator just like anyone else.

618
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,880
I don’t want to use the fire escape anymore.

619
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,110
Are you sure you’re going to move out?

620
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,770
I failed the mission.

621
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,280
I need to face the music.

622
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,520
You looked so cool today.

623
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,230
Because of what you said,

624
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,900
Made decided to walk out of the unfair relationship.

625
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,370
You are quite…a good person.

626
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,280
How much do you pay for your rent?

627
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,610
3,000 baht.

628
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,130
Why?

629
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,680
I’ll charge you the same rate.

630
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:51,280
The common fee, the water and electric bills,
you pay them to the condo manager.

631
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,260
If you break anything in my room,

632
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,950
I’ll charge you twice the price.

633
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,950
Are you agreeing to rent me the condo?

634
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,480
Are you asking because you don’t want it?

635
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,670
Yes, I want it.

636
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:06,390
But don’t say I’m a good person again, alright?

637
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,860
It gives me creeps.

638
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,430
I won’t do it again.

639
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,320
But I have another favor to ask.

640
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,910
What? Don’t push your luck.

641
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,280
I don’t want any luck.

642
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,790
Can I have your hand?

643
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,710
Why? I’m not a dog.

644
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,630
Why do I need to do it?

645
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,850
Come on. Can you do the two-finger sign?

646
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,730
Do it properly. Hold it up.

647
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,950
Put it upside down.

648
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,170
I invented the hand sign for Team A.

649
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,410
Does it resemble the letter ‘A’?

650
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,030
Did I ask you to do it?

651
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,480
I want to do something to repay you.

652
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,750
When we finish our work,

653
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,670
we can do the hand sign.

654
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,550
It looks so cool.

655
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,700
Nonsense.

656
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,300
Do you want the keycard?

657
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,810
Yes.

658
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,690
Ouch.

659
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,300
I’m sorry.

660
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,520
You’re so busy making noodles
that your hair gets messy.

661
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,380
Our next target is Mai and Mon.

662
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,150
They broke up and rekindled their relationship.

663
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,720
They became even more lovey-dovey.

664
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,180
We can be together for real, right?

665
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,450
Can I ask you something?

666
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,620
What?

667
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,020
Can I kiss you?

668
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,020
We are trying to break them up
but instead, they fall even deeper in love.

669
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,300
What else can we do?

670
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,000
There are things we can do.

671
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,310
It’s my time for me to act.
