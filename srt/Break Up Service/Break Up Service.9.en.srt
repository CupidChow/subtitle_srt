1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,250
What are you doing here, looking so down?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,050
I feel like I’m not good enough.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,410
Why do you think you are not good enough?

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,040
Maybe you are too good for someone.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,210
I also love…

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,800
Tee, I like you. Can I ask you out?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,340
I like you too.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,260
Bee has been dating Cherry the longest.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,400
They have been together since they had nothing.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,320
Let’s break up.

11
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,940
Will you marry me, Cherry?

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,730
Congratulations!

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,460
Cherry.

14
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,910
Honey, please come back to me.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,830
I’m now rich.

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,830
DURING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN

17
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,960
(This is a story of a writer who follows his dream.)

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,760
It’s 135 baht per box.

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,520
(He’s living a hard and poor life.)

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,510
(The only light in his dark life is her.)

21
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,040
What?

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,170
(Can you give a discount?
Other shops sell it at a lower price.)

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,160
135 baht is freaking cheap.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,590
Why are you asking only for a discount?

25
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,060
You should have asked for it for free.

26
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,380
(She is sweet and gentle.)

27
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,760
(She is always by his side.)

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,460
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,960
Today, I’ll show you
how to turn an ordinary meal into fine dining.

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,340
Rice served with fried mackerel
and spicy shrimp paste dip.

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,790
Ahh.

32
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,650
How is it, honey?

33
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,440
Your cooking is the best.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,670
Can you feed me too?

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
This is a fine dining meal for only 30 baht.

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,730
A luxurious meal and a comfortable life.

37
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,120
This meal,

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,260
it’s on me.

39
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,700
Honey,

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,170
the three qualities of your ideal man,

41
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,750
good-looking, rich, and sweet.

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,400
Now, I have all of them.

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,130
I am now rich.

44
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,070
I can afford to improve my look.

45
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,020
I’m still the same sweet guy.

46
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,460
Please come back to me.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,110
Cherry, please marry me.

48
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,710
Okay.

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,760
Yay!

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,480
No, no.

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,840
I mean…

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,660
Will it be okay if I need some time to think?

53
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,070
No, no, no.

54
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,410
Cherry, please say yes and marry me.

55
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,310
Ong-art.

56
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,830
Ong-art.

57
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,190
Ong-art.

58
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,450
Bee won the lottery jackpot in the latest draw.

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,870
He received 60 million baht.

60
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,330
He bought a house, a car,

61
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,650
and beauty treatments to upgrade his look.

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,820
Then he hired Destiny.

63
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,670
We completed the mission.

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,780
But Destiny ruined our plan.

65
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,570
They didn’t stay separated for 45 days.

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
We need to refund the client.

67
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,560
Although the refund is only 30 percent of the fee,

68
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
It’s still a large sum of money

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,470
because Ong-Art is a deep-pocketed client.

70
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,450
You don’t need to refund him.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,710
We will break them up again.

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,870
How come they know so much
about our company’s activities?

73
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,850
That’s right.

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,150
Do they know someone in our company?

75
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,420
Don’t worry.

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,110
I’ll take care of the problem.

77
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,630
I’ve never seen Mr. Chan this upset.

78
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:22,940
Jued.

79
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,480
Jued.

80
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,100
Jued, what are you doing?

81
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,340
Jued.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
Nothing.

83
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,110
Are you okay?

84
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,860
Since the incident, you have looked anxious.

85
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,670
You can talk to me.

86
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,800
I’m here to listen to you.

87
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,440
Boss, you spray it too much.

88
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,870
Too much love in the air

89
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,220
I can’t breathe.

90
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,380
It’s a honeymoon phase.

91
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,560
When it’s over,

92
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,460
your relationship will fall apart like others.

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,160
This is information about Cherry and Bee.

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,570
You did your job well.

95
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,890
I hope your relationship goes well as your job.

96
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,980
Bee and Cherry will go on a date this afternoon.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
I prepared everything for our team’s mission.

98
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,430
There’s no such thing as our team.

99
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,810
Honey, it’s a designer bag shop.

100
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,030
I want to go in and take a look.

101
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,610
Sure.

102
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,550
You think I’m poor.

103
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,600
So you shut the shop in my face.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,350
When I become rich, I’ll buy the whole store.

105
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,150
They did it again.

106
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,620
You refuse to let me in,
even though I’m all dressed up.

107
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,490
We should leave, honey.

108
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,290
I’m not okay with this.

109
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,850
Calm down, honey.

110
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,870
I took care of everything.

111
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,480
Please come in.

112
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,540
Choose whatever you want.

113
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,170
Come on.

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,810
Go in.

115
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,690
We need to find a way to send Jued in.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,310
Jued.

117
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,200
This is the shop’s uniform.

118
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
I prepared it for you.

119
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,250
Thank you.

120
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,360
But I don’t think I can get in.

121
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,040
Why?

122
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,220
I’m afraid that she will remember…

123
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,940
I…

124
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,800
I don’t feel confident.

125
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,150
Are you crazy?

126
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
I know you will figure it out like always.

127
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,440
Fine.

128
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,470
Here.

129
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,990
This is a signal jammer.

130
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,470
Plant it in the shop.

131
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,270
Go.

132
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,620
You can do it.

133
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,960
This gentleman is our VIP customer.

134
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,350
He asked us to close the shop to welcome you.

135
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,780
Please feel free to look around.

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,730
The VIP room is this way.

137
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,980
Please have a seat and wait a moment.

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,220
We will bring our bags to show you.

139
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,060
I never thought

140
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,000
I would be shopping in a VIP room.

141
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,610
It’s so spacious.

142
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,350
Bring everything out.

143
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,770
Do you want anything?

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,030
Here is our collection.

145
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,910
Excuse me.

146
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,000
Have we met before?

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,530
You look familiar.

148
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,980
Are you Masao_B?

149
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,360
You look familiar.

150
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,630
I’m sorry. I’m having rhinitis.

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,720
Please take a look at our online catalog.

152
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,920
This bag is pretty.

153
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,050
Honey, look at this bag. It’s so pretty.

154
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,520
It’s pretty. So are you.

155
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,640
It’s perfect for you.

156
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,800
This one also looks great.

157
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,240
You can choose any bag that you like.

158
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
Are you sure?

159
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,030
Did you have everything?

160
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,840
These are sample bags and an afternoon tea set.

161
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,030
It’s a service exclusively for our VIP customers.

162
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,460
Wow.

163
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,170
I hope you enjoy it.

164
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,580
Yes.

165
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,730
Honey, this is amazing.

166
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,750
I don’t need to walk around the store.

167
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,230
They also prepared snacks for us.

168
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,610
They look yummy.

169
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,380
Cherry likes a rich guy.

170
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,860
Besides spoiling her,

171
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,960
you need to act classy to win her heart.

172
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Firstly, you need to show off
your knowledge of fine dining.

173
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,820
Listen to me and do what I tell you.

174
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,590
Where is the staff?

175
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,600
I want to ask for cutlery.

176
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,550
Honey, you don’t need cutlery for afternoon tea.

177
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,950
You can use your hand to pick up the food.

178
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,520
Always start with sandwiches at the bottom tray

179
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,650
You can use your hand to pick up the food.

180
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,880
We will start eating from the bottom tray.

181
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,070
Shall we eat?

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,710
Hold on, honey.

183
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,000
How did you know all this?

184
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,030
I dreamed of taking you to a place like this.

185
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,940
So I studied about it beforehand.

186
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,610
Ahh, please enjoy it.

187
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,660
Let’s begin our plan.

188
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,340
Turn on the signal jammer.

189
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,260
Wait a moment.

190
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,400
The signal jammer is turned on.

191
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,860
Mr. Bee?

192
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,710
Hello?

193
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,620
Hello?

194
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,150
Mr. Bee.

195
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,820
Cupid, you sound different.

196
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,330
The signal is not good.

197
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,640
But it’s okay as long as you can hear me.

198
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,420
Okay.

199
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,230
After finishing the sandwich,

200
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,160
you should clean your fingers by licking them.

201
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,220
Lick them.

202
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,930
This is the elite’s dining etiquette.

203
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,020
Honey, do you want a tissue?

204
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,040
No, you need to lick them.

205
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,540
This is how the elites eat it.

206
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,950
Lick them, honey.

207
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,450
Lick them?

208
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,050
Yes. You look like an elite, honey.

209
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,370
We are real elites.

210
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,810
I think that is not enough.

211
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,660
You need to eat a scone in one bite.

212
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,630
Just like when you eat a boiled egg at a wedding.

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,400
Do we need to eat the whole piece in one bite?

214
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,100
That’s right, honey.

215
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,180
Mr. Bee?

216
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,260
That won’t work.

217
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,690
If it’s hard to swallow,

218
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,480
tell your girlfriend to drink the tea.

219
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,640
But you can’t cool it down by blowing it.

220
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,440
You need to drink it in one go.

221
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,010
Honey, drink this without blowing it.

222
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,800
Drink it.

223
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,670
It’s hot.

224
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,880
Are you sure you know how to eat it?

225
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,310
Miss, you damaged the bags.

226
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,670
Are you sure you know how to eat it?

227
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,760
Of course.

228
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,300
I…

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,070
Actually, I don’t know how to eat it.

230
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,160
I’m sorry.

231
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,190
Why are you lying to me?

232
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,940
I want to take you to this shop.

233
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,590
The last time we came here,
they looked down on us and refused to let us in.

234
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,560
But this time, we can get in the shop.

235
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,200
But I ruined it.

236
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,490
They will look down on us again.

237
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,100
I’m sorry, honey.

238
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,080
I’m so sorry.

239
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,910
It’s not a big deal.

240
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,680
If we don’t know how to eat it, so what?

241
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,410
We are rich. We can do whatever we want.

242
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,170
Miss.

243
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,300
I’ll buy the damaged bags.

244
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,350
You can afford it, right?

245
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,210
Absolutely.

246
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,050
I forgot that I’m rich now.

247
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,260
Miss.

248
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,010
Send these bags to my address.

249
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,150
I’ll take them all.

250
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,710
(Jued, retreat. Let’s go back to our office first.)

251
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I love you.

252
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,490
Give me a lot of love.

253
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,940
Honey, why did you take me to this park?

254
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,220
It’s not an activity for the elites.

255
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,690
Honey, wait a second.

256
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,460
One, two, three.

257
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,300
Honey.

258
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,030
Isn’t it beautiful?

259
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,580
It’s so beautiful.

260
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,360
I prepared it for you.

261
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,100
Really?

262
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,120
Yes.

263
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,300
(Why are you lighting fireworks at this hour?
People are sleeping.)

264
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,240
Then block your ears.

265
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,220
Honey, this is so romantic.

266
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,500
Do you like it?

267
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,320
I love it.

268
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,670
Let’s go.

269
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,260
Sure.

270
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,610
Excuse me.

271
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,160
Are you him?

272
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,510
The man who won the lottery jackpot
in the latest draw.

273
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,240
Yes, it’s me.

274
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,110
Great. I’m a reporter.

275
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,210
Can I interview you?

276
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,970
It’s not a good time. We are on a date.

277
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,330
It’s okay, honey.

278
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,740
We are rich.

279
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,250
Let’s treat it as a dry run for celebrity life.

280
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,320
You can interview him.

281
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,250
Shall we continue?

282
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,840
This is the first question, Sirirat.

283
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,240
That’s not my name.

284
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,730
But that is the name on the lottery ticket.

285
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,210
Nut found Bee’s secret.

286
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,650
Bee didn’t win the lottery jackpot.

287
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,250
Destiny set it up.

288
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,540
Miss Sirirat Sinthongkham.

289
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,880
It’s not your name?

290
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,340
How can it be his name?

291
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,880
That’s a woman’s name.

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,820
What?

293
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,870
Then how did you have her lottery tickets?

294
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Are you pretending to be the winner?

295
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,390
Umm…

296
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,040
No.

297
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,270
Hold on, honey.

298
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,940
You didn’t win the lottery?

299
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,820
You are sweet, but you’re the biggest fool.

300
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,160
Let’s break up.

301
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,290
Herbicide.

302
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,710
It’s so expensive.

303
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,530
A manila rope.

304
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,970
It’s even more expensive.

305
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,440
Why?

306
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,840
I want to die but I can’t even afford it.

307
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
That sounds terrible.

308
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,680
My name is Cupid.

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,970
I work at Destiny.

310
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,520
We want you and your girlfriend
to get back together.

311
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,250
These are the winning lottery tickets
in the latest drawing.

312
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,320
It is worth 60 million baht.

313
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,340
We can lend you the money to build your finances.

314
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,970
You can slowly pay us back with interest.

315
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,890
The total amount will be 69 million baht.

316
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,390
What do you think about it?

317
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,470
The interest is quite expensive.

318
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,170
It’s not expensive

319
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,340
if you want to get Cherry, the woman you love, back.

320
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,180
Now, it’s up to you.

321
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,770
Will you take the risk to get her back?

322
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,380
I’m sorry.

323
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,310
The money I spent on you,

324
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,230
it’s a loan.

325
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,980
You, idiot!

326
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,220
Why are you causing a debt
for no good reason?

327
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,820
Stop it.

328
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,080
How could you lie to me?

329
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,180
I didn’t mean to lie to you.

330
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,260
There was a woman….

331
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,830
Who?

332
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,820
You just confessed to me.

333
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,480
Hello, I’m Cupid.

334
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,660
I work for a company
connecting influencers and brands.

335
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,540
Our company lent the money to Mr. Bee.

336
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,500
We see this
as a long-term investment in our partnership.

337
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,320
Yes.

338
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,870
We came across his content
about low-cost fine dining on TikTok.

339
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,970
We had been following him for some time.

340
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,700
We decided to reach out to him.

341
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,580
We agreed to lend him the money
for his content creation.

342
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,610
We offered to help promote his content.

343
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,550
We view it as a way to expand his business.

344
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,880
It’s a win-win deal.

345
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,890
After we helped promote him,

346
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,470
he became widely known.

347
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,550
His content has quickly become popular.

348
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,120
The number of his followers
almost reaches 1 million.

349
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,940
Many brands want him to be their presenter.

350
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,240
From an unknown creator,

351
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,460
he is now a TikTok star.

352
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,270
Don’t you think
this would be more interesting news?

353
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,490
Does it mean he became rich for real?

354
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,210
Yes.

355
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,510
His wealth is on the rise,

356
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,470
as shown in this graph.

357
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,390
Wow.

358
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,330
Okay, let’s continue with our date.

359
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,620
Sure.

360
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,300
Honey, you are the best.

361
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,140
I told you I wasn’t lying to you.

362
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,810
We finally meet.

363
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,810
But this is the best Break Up Service can do?

364
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,020
See you in the next round.

365
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,880
Let’s go.

366
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,540
Did you know her?

367
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,100
No.

368
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,270
Why did she smile at you?

369
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,280
How would I know?

370
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,420
You can’t hide it from me.

371
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,530
Just tell me the truth.

372
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,650
I think you should call it a day and go home.

373
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,720
Why?

374
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,390
Where are you going?

375
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,170
I’m going to see Tee.

376
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,910
I want to talk to him privately.

377
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,590
If you told her how you feel,

378
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,880
you wouldn’t have lost her like this.

379
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,270
You know everything, don’t you?

380
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,610
Yes.

381
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,650
I know that you are not the type who will get sad
because of this kind of thing.

382
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,380
I’m not sad.

383
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,480
If you said so.

384
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,590
You just stand still for too long

385
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,250
and haven’t shot a single ball.

386
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,110
Boss.

387
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,440
You’ve been out of the dating game for a while.

388
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,180
But trust me.

389
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,050
You need to dust off your skills a little.

390
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,580
You can find a new girl in no time.

391
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,930
Here.

392
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,920
Who will pay for this?

393
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,610
[Rose]

394
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,150
Jued.

395
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,420
Bee will propose to Cherry today.

396
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,730
Cupid has bought a ring for him.

397
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,120
We need to stop this proposal
by stealing the ring.

398
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,790
It’s delicious.

399
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,990
What are you looking at?

400
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,450
Just eat your food.

401
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,520
But I can’t contact Boss.

402
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,610
Can you do the mission by yourself?

403
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,970
I have no choice but to do it.

404
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,160
Are you okay with the dress I prepared for you?

405
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,150
Yes.

406
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,200
Honey, we can come to a restaurant like this
as often as you want.

407
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,920
Now, I’m a TikTok star.

408
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,000
My book is selling well.

409
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,830
Let’s have this kind of meal every day.

410
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,180
Sure.

411
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,730
You can order anything you want.

412
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,560
(Sorry. The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at this time.)

413
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,080
Where are you, Boss?

414
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,310
Why do you keep calling me?

415
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,940
I’m here.

416
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,800
Follow our plan.

417
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,970
Steal the ring from Cupid.

418
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,230
His new girlfriend?

419
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,370
Isn’t he too nice to her?

420
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,960
Why does he have to take her to work?

421
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,770
Why is she here?

422
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,430
Give this ring to Mr. Bee.

423
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,620
He knows what to do.

424
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,420
Yes.

425
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,340
Jued.

426
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,800
The ring.

427
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,580
Go get it.

428
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,930
Damn.

429
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,080
Yes.

430
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,980
What?

431
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,510
Boss, I’m sorry. I forgot.

432
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,960
Excuse me.

433
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,510
I want to know

434
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,090
if this dish is made with pork or beef.

435
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,840
It’s made with pork.

436
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:24,940
Pork?

437
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,590
Yes.

438
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,460
Okay. Thank you.

439
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,110
I was about to ask for it.

440
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,200
Where is the ring?

441
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,360
The ring is gone.

442
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,230
Jued.

443
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,920
Jued, this way.

444
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,450
Who is the owner?

445
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,960
This way.

446
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,420
Oh.

447
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,960
She came with Boss.

448
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,220
But why is she helping Cupid?

449
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,640
Are you Bee from the Masao_B channel?

450
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:00,840
Yes.

451
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,580
Is this yours?

452
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,750
Yes.

453
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,780
I’m so happy to finally meet you.

454
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,230
I’ve been a long-time fan
of your book and TikTok channel.

455
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,910
I’ve been following you two for a while.

456
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,870
Congratulations. You finally have your big day.

457
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,940
I couldn’t come this far without my fans’ support.

458
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,670
For a special occasion like this,

459
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,530
Why don’t you do something
to bring back the old memory?

460
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,430
How?

461
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,830
What is Cherry’s favorite dish?

462
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,650
Where are you taking me?

463
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,530
Close your eyes.

464
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,370
Hold on.

465
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,480
Watch your steps.

466
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,890
Okay.

467
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,480
Take small steps.

468
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,960
Sit down.

469
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,270
Sit down?

470
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,460
Why?

471
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,010
Open your eyes.

472
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
You said you like the mackerel

473
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,690
I cooked for you the most.

474
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,540
Ahh.

475
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,750
How is it, honey?

476
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,580
Your cooking is the best.

477
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,860
I’ll cook mackerel for you every day.

478
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,410
Will you marry me?

479
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,490
Thank you.

480
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,400
You help them have a happy ending.

481
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,110
They will never forget a fan like you.

482
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,460
Actually, I’m not their fan.

483
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,610
I did some digging

484
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,320
and knew them better than their fans.

485
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,810
I found that Cherry loved mackerel so much.

486
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,230
So much that he hasn’t eaten it for several years.

487
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,290
What do you mean?

488
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,270
This mackerel,

489
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,050
It reminds me of our lives back then.

490
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,450
You know how our lives were.

491
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,460
You had a dream but no money.

492
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,340
But I didn’t mind it because I loved you.

493
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,570
I wanted to see your dream come true.

494
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,650
I wired the rent to you.

495
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,990
Sometimes, I had this thought.

496
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,190
I worked so hard.

497
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,970
I was the only one earning a living for both of us.

498
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,900
I never thought mackerel was delicious.

499
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,770
But it was all we had.

500
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,900
So I pretended to like it.

501
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,790
If you don’t like mackerel, I’ll put it away and…

502
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,600
You don’t need to do that.

503
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,090
This mackerel,

504
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,850
It makes me realize
the passion I have for you has long gone.

505
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,620
Though you have the three qualities that I want,

506
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,510
my love for you has long gone.

507
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,650
My answer is no.

508
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,280
I don’t want to marry you.

509
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,550
I thought I could love you again.

510
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,900
It’s okay.

511
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,640
You didn’t do anything wrong.

512
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,730
I am the one who needs to apologize.

513
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,970
When I finally got up to do something for you,

514
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,300
it was too late.

515
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,350
I’m sorry.

516
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,940
Thank you for always supporting me.

517
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,290
We are doing well on our own path.

518
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,500
No need to worry about each other.

519
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,140
I’m sorry, and thank you.

520
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,560
It’s okay.

521
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,520
I understand everything.

522
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,060
(This story comes to an end.)

523
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,240
(They go their separate ways
and follow their own path.)

524
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,150
Good luck.

525
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,590
You too.

526
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,970
(Although they didn’t end up together,
they once loved each other.)

527
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,200
(Their memories will live on.)

528
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,890
Who are you?

529
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,240
That’s Rose.

530
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,630
Team B of Break Up Service.

531
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,750
I asked her to help us on this case.

532
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,790
I didn’t want to ask for her help.

533
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,980
But we are in a crisis.

534
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,140
I was on a support team for Team B.

535
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,430
I saw her from a distance through the screen.

536
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,080
This is the first time I've met her.

537
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,770
Hey, did you get injured when you fell earlier?

538
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,730
It’s good that you aren’t injured.

539
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,300
They shouldn’t mess up with Break Up Service.

540
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,670
This is what you got in return.

541
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,570
Cheers!

542
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,920
Very good.

543
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,600
Let’s go.

544
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,240
Tee.

545
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,260
Do you want a beer?

546
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,930
No, I’m okay.

547
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,110
But it doesn’t look like beer in your glass?

548
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,120
What is it?

549
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,000
I prefer plain milk

550
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,290
Plain like Jued?

551
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,480
No, I mean I like plain flavored milk.

552
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,760
I see.

553
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,160
Stop talking about the milk.

554
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,320
Come here.

555
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,500
I bought it for you.

556
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,510
Let’s think it’s a prize for completing the mission.

557
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,880
Thank you.

558
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,790
It looks unique.

559
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,530
So I want to give it to you.

560
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Thank you for thinking about me.

561
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,470
It’s not a big deal.

562
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,640
Cheers.

563
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,120
Jued.

564
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,570
Jued.

565
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,980
Jued, what’s wrong?

566
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,120
Nothing.

567
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,860
Are you okay?

568
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,490
Yes.

569
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,320
Can you get me another glass?

570
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,330
Sure.

571
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,670
I’ll be right back.

572
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,130
Easy.

573
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,640
I’ll give you a ride home.

574
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,480
Are you sure you want to do that?

575
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,370
I won’t let you go home easily.

576
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,860
Although I look like plain vanilla,
I can be bold-flavored.

577
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,030
Tee.

578
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,930
Tee.

579
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,010
Yes.

580
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,580
Mr. Tee.

581
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,370
Yes.

582
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,110
Chan wants to talk to you, Mr. Tee.

583
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:48,920
Okay.

584
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,700
I mean Mr. Chan. Sorry.

585
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,710
I’m coming.

586
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,820
Jued, I’ll be right back.

587
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,810
Wait here.

588
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,740
Yes, I’m coming.

589
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,780
I’m coming.

590
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,980
Mr. Chan is on the phone.

591
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,160
Tee looked cute when he was young.

592
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,560
Boss, why are you here?

593
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,230
Why?

594
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,290
Are you disappointed to see me instead of Tee?

595
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,310
A little.

596
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,240
I’ll give you a ride to Tee’s condo.

597
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,170
Wait, Boss.

598
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,350
I…

599
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,640
I have something bothering me.

600
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,200
But I can’t tell anyone about it.

601
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,500
Why didn’t you tell Tee?

602
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,000
That day, when I told you to go home first.

603
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,520
I tried to tell him.

604
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,890
But I couldn’t.

605
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,890
So you chose to tell me instead?

606
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,920
I don’t know why.

607
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,270
I just feel like I can talk to you.

608
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,830
I helped Pop and Kormai reconcile.

609
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,870
I hired Destiny to help them.

610
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,960
I already knew.

611
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,200
How did you know?

612
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,110
I was watching you.

613
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,860
Will you pay the deposit now?

614
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,480
Can I borrow it?

615
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,570
Why were you watching me?

616
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,270
I…

617
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,140
I also have something to tell you.

618
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,300
I love you.

619
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,860
Long time no see. How have you been?

620
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,290
This is Stephen Choi, my fiancé.

621
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,340
Fiancé?

622
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,890
I think Mr. Chan still misses Kesorn, his ex-wife.

623
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,720
Your next mission is to break them up.

624
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,870
If you can break them up,

625
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,040
I’ll give you 1 million baht as a bonus.
