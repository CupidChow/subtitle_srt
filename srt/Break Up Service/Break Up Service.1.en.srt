1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Excuse me. It’s about work.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,840
Hurry back.

3
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,120
Avoid answering calls in front of his girlfriend.

4
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,620
If I were him, I wouldn’t do it.

5
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,160
Are you trying to stir up trouble between us?

6
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,070
No.

7
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,950
How can he leave
his beautiful girlfriend sitting alone?

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,730
You are saying this

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,210
because you don’t know his plan, right?

10
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,370
Do you see a photographer hiding there?

11
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,720
All the customers here are my friends and family.

12
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,100
Soon, a popular love song will be played.

13
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,160
Your man will walk in and get down on one knee.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,380
Then you will say yes.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,890
This drink is on me as a congratulations to you.

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,710
This is sad

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,650
because I can never be a part of your plan.

18
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,750
What are you doing here?

19
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,670
[Today is our 3rd anniversary.]

20
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,940
[Mod, today I have something to tell you.]

21
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,610
Guy.

22
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,460
Mod, who is he?

23
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,270
Why did he send me this picture?

24
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,820
What does he want?

25
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,580
What does it mean?

26
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,080
Why did he send it to me?

27
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,750
Guy, I can explain it.

28
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,950
How will you explain it?

29
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,240
You cheated on me.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,630
Hurry up. We have only until 6 pm.

31
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,580
Isn’t that our condo?

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,340
Mod, don’t watch it.

33
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,370
Mod, it wasn’t me.

34
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,120
Do it on the sofa? Let’s move to the bed.

35
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,350
Don’t pay attention to it.

36
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,200
Did you cheat on me, asshole?

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,480
Asshole?!

38
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,810
You also cheated on me.

39
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,490
How dare you push me?

40
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,810
Why can’t I?

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,130
What you’re going to do about it?

42
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,020
(The mission to break up Mod and Guy
is accomplished.)

43
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,780
(Please transfer your last payment to me.)

44
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,410
(If they get back together in seven days,)

45
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,030
(we will break them up again.)

46
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,830
(Okay.)

47
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,860
(If they get back together in 45 days,)

48
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,630
(we will refund 30 percent of the service fee.)

49
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,130
(We can help break them up
but we can’t make her go back to you.)

50
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,250
(Do you understand?)

51
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,390
(It’s okay.)

52
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,620
(If I am not happy, they can’t be happy.)

53
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,940
Don’t worry.

54
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,380
That will never happen,

55
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,130
Ever.

56
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,720
Boss, stay still.

57
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,630
Be gentle.

58
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,540
Done.

59
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,640
Get up.

60
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,370
Can’t you wait for me to take it off?

61
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,990
Will it leave a scar?

62
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,940
Yes.

63
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,760
A scar of shame.

64
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,330
Boss, can you quit this nasty work
of breaking up couples?

65
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,430
You always get injured every time you work.

66
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,850
You don’t know anything.

67
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,250
I asked the question because I like having scars.

68
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,520
Every scar represents
the coming-of-age moment in my life.

69
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,710
Starting from this scar.

70
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,740
I got it when I was five.

71
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,010
[5-year-old Boss]
I broke up my parents’ marriage.

72
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,170
A strip club! You went to a strip club?!

73
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,080
After that, I moved to live with my wealthy aunt.

74
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,690
Next is the scar on my leg.

75
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,000
[10-year-old Boss]
Aunt.

76
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,320
You have a fixed deposit account
for your mistress?!

77
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,040
I got my aunt and her husband divorced.

78
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,170
You are dead!

79
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,020
No!

80
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,340
My aunt fled the country to avoid the charges.

81
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,450
I went with her.

82
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,720
Honey, don’t shoot!

83
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,770
Next is this scar.

84
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,250
[15-year-old Boss]

85
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,360
I broke two teachers up.

86
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,700
So I was sent back to Thailand.

87
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,090
The most important scar.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Yes.

89
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,820
I helped Mr. Chan,
the owner of the startup company where I was an intern,

90
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,710
divorce from his wife.

91
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,350
Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan.

92
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,100
He launched the Break Up Service app,
recruited me to Team A,

93
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,550
and named me the company’s co-founder.

94
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,960
Chan.

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,930
Chan.

96
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,780
I kill a man.

97
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,410
I kill a man.

98
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,120
That’s how I became the man I am today.

99
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,160
You mean a scumbag?

100
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,900
You were born to destroy others’ relationships.

101
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,570
So what?

102
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,930
Relationships are fragile.

103
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,160
I just help speed up the breakup process.

104
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,150
Whatever. I’m sick of scolding you.

105
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,810
Stop fooling around, Boss.

106
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,650
You don’t need to scold me anymore.

107
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,770
I won’t come to see you for a while.

108
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,790
Because this scar will be
my last coming-of-age moment in my life.

109
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,660
Are you dying?

110
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,610
Who dies?! I’m marrying Chan.

111
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,170
Who is Chan?

112
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,220
She’s my girlfriend.

113
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,400
She’s the owner of a jewelry shop.

114
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
Oh, that woman.

115
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,410
She’s a wonderful woman.

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,620
She’s the opposite of you.

117
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,620
A cheater who does dirty work for a living.

118
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,900
You also lied to her about being an engineer.

119
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,570
What will you do
if she marries you and finds out the truth?

120
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,990
That’s why I’m quitting this job.

121
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,470
I’m going to work at her jewelry shop.

122
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,980
You want to be a gold digger, don’t you?

123
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,810
Will you quit your cheating habit?

124
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,800
I’m planning to.

125
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,270
But I’m not sure I can do it.

126
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,860
If I can’t, it’s not a big deal.

127
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,970
I was born with the skills to break up relationships.

128
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,930
I know best how to get away with it.

129
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,270
I’ll wait and see if you can pull it off.

130
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,270
No need to do that.

131
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,730
You should start choosing my wedding gift.

132
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,410
Fine.

133
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,630
Don’t keep my gift waiting for too long.

134
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,470
You will hear good news from me this afternoon.

135
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:33,970
Alright.

136
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,340
Go.

137
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,250
Mom, can you lend me 1,000 baht?

138
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,610
I’ll pay it back when I get a job.

139
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,980
(You’d better keep your promise.)

140
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,910
(You haven’t paid me back the last time.)

141
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,150
Please help me so I can breathe.

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,920
(Your breath is so expensive.)

143
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,230
(Can I charge interest?
Why is it so hard for you to get a job?)

144
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,970
Mom, I’m hanging up. I think I’ll get it.

145
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,810
(I’m not finished talking.)

146
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,970
Oh, my feet hurt.

147
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,820
The shoes are pinching my feet.

148
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,640
It hurts.

149
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,790
Ouch.

150
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,930
It hurts.

151
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,520
You dropped this.

152
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,020
The shoes are pinching my feet.

153
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,980
Ouch.

154
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,210
Jerk. He doesn’t even say thank you.

155
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,440
Hey.

156
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,580
Hey, wait.

157
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,760
Hey.

158
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,900
Hey.

159
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,670
Hey, wait.

160
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,540
Wait.

161
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,960
Wait.

162
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,760
Follow that bike.

163
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,010
Give it to me and follow that bike.

164
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,930
Hurry up.

165
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,100
- What?
- What’s wrong?

166
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,630
What’s wrong with it?

167
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,100
Hurry up.

168
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,020
(Earlier, you said you would get it.)

169
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,710
(Were you talking about a job or the money?)

170
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,110
(If you get the money, can you lend me some?)

171
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,220
(He cheated on me. Should I break up with him?)

172
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,320
Calm down. Take your time to think about it.

173
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,680
He’s here. I’ll call you back.

174
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,070
Why do you get injured again?

175
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,820
I went to check the construction site
and a gravel flew and hit me.

176
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,370
Don’t they have safety measures?

177
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,420
Accidents happened to you too many times.

178
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,760
Can we sue them?

179
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,410
What is the name of your company?

180
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,710
Who were you talking on the phone with?

181
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,530
My friend.

182
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,180
She just caught her boyfriend cheating.

183
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,060
She called to ask for my advice.

184
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,830
How many stitches did you get?

185
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,950
What did you tell her?

186
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,470
I told her she shouldn’t break up with him.

187
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,610
This is his first mistake.

188
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,390
He deserves a second chance.

189
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,590
My girlfriend has a heart bigger than the ocean.

190
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,580
They have been dating for a long time.

191
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,520
They shouldn’t break up over a short-term fling.

192
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,190
Yes.

193
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,890
Does your company do anything for your accident?

194
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,460
If you don’t tell me, I’ll google it myself.

195
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,800
Break Up Service, isn’t it?

196
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,730
Hey, pull over here.

197
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,030
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,180
Give me back my helmet.

199
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,920
Yes. I forgot.

200
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,230
How much is the fare?

201
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,460
120 baht.

202
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,710
120?!

203
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,830
Why is it so expensive?

204
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,540
How much do you usually pay?

205
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,410
20 baht.

206
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,390
No way. It can’t be 20 baht.

207
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,650
At least, it should be 80 baht.

208
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,300
Hey, didn’t you say 120 baht?

209
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,420
80 baht is fine.

210
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,380
No, I’ll give you 20 baht.

211
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,780
No, 80 baht.

212
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,860
20 baht is enough.

213
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,630
I got to go. Come on, 80 baht.

214
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,130
No, 20 baht.

215
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,770
Hey, hey.

216
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,640
Your company’s name is Break Up Service, right?

217
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
Don’t they have safety standards?

218
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,670
Chan

219
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,770
Boss.

220
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,240
Why did you buy it from another shop?

221
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,060
My family owns a jewelry shop.

222
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,980
You should have bought it from my shop
so you wouldn’t be scammed.

223
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,190
Did you have the certificate?

224
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,190
I want to propose to you.

225
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,440
If I bought it from your shop,

226
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,490
you wouldn’t be surprised.

227
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,500
Boss, what did you say?

228
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,210
I’m proposing…

229
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,710
Excuse me.

230
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,240
We met earlier at the locker.

231
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,120
This is the motorbike taxi
that helped me follow you here.

232
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,610
So?

233
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,720
Our phones were switched at the locker.

234
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,900
When you changed your outfit into this.

235
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,580
Did you change your outfit?

236
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,670
No. I’ve been wearing this
to the construction site.

237
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,540
No.

238
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,850
He changed it.

239
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,650
He was wearing a suit earlier.

240
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,540
Why did you wear a suit to the construction site?

241
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,330
I didn’t change my outfit.

242
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,650
She must get the wrong man.

243
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,710
No, I don’t.

244
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,240
If you don’t believe me, you can ask him.

245
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,130
We were following your boyfriend here.

246
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,920
Am I right?

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,290
Just give her phone back.

248
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,010
So she can wire the fare to me.

249
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,370
Here is your phone.

250
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,540
This is my phone.

251
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,310
Whatever.

252
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,570
But you need to pay me.

253
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,640
What about my phone?

254
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,710
How about this? How much is the fare?

255
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,450
Even though I don’t know you,

256
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,480
I pay for it because I feel bad for you.

257
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,030
Is this enough?

258
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,870
Yes.

259
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,740
I’ll take her back to where I found her.

260
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,380
Come on. Let’s go.

261
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,370
Chan.

262
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,460
Will you marry me?

263
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,680
See? It is unlocked with your face recognition.

264
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,450
The screen lock is
the photo of you and your girlfriend.

265
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,090
Your girlfriend?

266
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,440
This is my first mistake.

267
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,570
You will give me another chance,

268
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,850
just like your advice to your friend, right?

269
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,260
Right?

270
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,840
Run. Come on, run.

271
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,940
It’s not time to remove the suture

272
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,240
but you’re back with the wound split open.

273
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,270
I knew it. The last scar is bullshit.

274
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,080
You’ll keep getting new wounds
unless you quit this dirty job.

275
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,450
The phone’s face recognition is unreliable.

276
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Just like my girlfriend.

277
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,650
She told her friend
to forgive the cheating boyfriend.

278
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,650
But when she goes through the same situation…

279
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,720
Ouch, Oat!

280
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,390
You did that on purpose, didn’t you?

281
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:33,900
Yes.

282
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,480
You deserve it.

283
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,760
This is your fault but you are blaming her.

284
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,640
You’d better prepare flowers
to ask for her forgiveness.

285
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,070
If she dumps you, you will regret it.

286
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,680
What’s the point of apologizing to her?

287
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,810
Our relationship is already broken.

288
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,370
No matter how much I try, it can’t be fixed.

289
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,050
Just like my scar.

290
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:51,940
So what?

291
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,090
You aren’t going to make up with her?

292
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,730
No.

293
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,030
Don’t you regret it?

294
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,550
It’s your chance

295
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,660
to be the son-in-law of a jewelry shop owner.

296
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,650
No.

297
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,740
At least, it confirmed my belief.

298
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,470
Relationships are fragile.

299
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,890
I thought I knew it well.

300
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,630
But there’s nothing I can do about it.

301
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,480
From now on, I will stop resisting my fate.

302
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,670
If I’m meant to destroy love, I will destroy it.

303
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,700
You say like you have a target on your mind.

304
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,970
She destroyed my relationship.

305
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,160
Next person, please come in.

306
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,400
Hello, I’m Jinsiree Seewiangchuen.

307
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,820
You can call me Jued.

308
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,240
Jued as in bland taste.

309
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,440
My strong points are that I’m enduring.

310
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,970
It’s time to pay your loan interest.

311
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,580
Is there anyone home?

312
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,140
Where are you?

313
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,250
Where the heck are you?

314
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,870
You always avoid me
when I come to collect my money.

315
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,570
What’s wrong with you?

316
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,140
(My family always taught me about endurance.)

317
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,620
Pay your rent.

318
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,350
I guess she’s not home.

319
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,770
(I’m adaptive and quick-witted.)

320
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,250
(Though I’m a new graduate,
I have many work experiences.)

321
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,700
Sold out?!

322
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,450
Yes.

323
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,160
But I’ve queued since 7 am.

324
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
My client already paid me.

325
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,290
I’m begging you.

326
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,720
(For me, getting a good job
is like finding good love.)

327
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,190
(Every day at work won’t feel like working.)

328
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,470
So do you want to work or not?

329
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,880
Of course, I want to work.

330
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,960
I just try to explain to you
how happy I will be if I work here.

331
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,250
Okay. I’ll notify you of the result.

332
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,610
Thank you.

333
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,330
I lost my phone.

334
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,910
Can you notify me through this email?

335
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,600
Sure.

336
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
Thank you.

337
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,930
(Under the deep, dark ocean,
where the pressure reaches 1,086 bar,)

338
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,510
(lives a creature called the Mariana snailfish.)

339
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,340
(It can adapt to the extreme environment
with immense pressure.)

340
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,960
Jued.

341
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,410
Jued.

342
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,260
Hello, Prang.

343
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,310
You came to see Ake, right?

344
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,710
I’ll call him to come meet you.

345
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,810
Hello, Ake.

346
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,250
Jued is here to see you.

347
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,280
She’s waiting in the store.

348
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,390
He’ll be right here.

349
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,250
Yes.

350
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,600
How are you doing?

351
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,520
I’m doing good.

352
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,250
Jued.

353
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,290
It’s lunch break.

354
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,020
You should take her to have lunch.

355
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,070
Take your time. No need to rush.

356
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,420
We will have to stay late tonight
to check the inventory.

357
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,630
Ake, you are so lucky to have such a good boss.

358
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,070
She is sweet, smart, and kind.

359
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,210
She is so talented.

360
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,980
She is like Wonder Woman.

361
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,410
It must be inconvenient for you,

362
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,230
not having a phone.

363
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,490
Yes, I was walking around
to find a pay phone to call you.

364
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,370
You thought my call was a scammer call,
didn’t you?

365
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,340
So you didn’t answer it.

366
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,770
It was from a number I don’t know.

367
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,400
How would I dare answer it?

368
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,500
Here.

369
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,000
Use it to pay for your rent.

370
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,830
I know you don’t have money.

371
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,860
But I haven’t returned the money
I borrowed from you the last time.

372
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,950
Take it.

373
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,300
You can pay me back when you get a job.

374
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,320
Okay?

375
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,870
Ake, you are the only good thing in my life.

376
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,840
You mean the same to me.

377
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,230
You know that, right?

378
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,560
Let’s eat.

379
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,010
Hello. I’m on my way.

380
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,370
The same hotel, right?

381
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,470
Okay.

382
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,130
It took you so long to contact me
to return my phone.

383
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,220
Later better than never.

384
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,840
Can you send me the photos on your phone?

385
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,860
I was walking and found something interesting.
So I took photos with your phone.

386
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,870
My phone memory is running low.

387
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,390
Is that your boyfriend?

388
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,260
Who did he have a meal with?

389
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,480
She is his coworker.

390
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
They work together.

391
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,290
It’s not strange that they have a meal together.

392
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,490
See the next photo.

393
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,550
He’s so sweet.

394
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,080
He held her hand when crossing the road.

395
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,510
It’s normal. My boyfriend is kind-hearted.

396
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,750
He used to carry a dog to cross the road.

397
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,500
Fine. Then see the next photo.

398
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,690
His supermarket has a delivery service.

399
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,190
They probably went
to deliver goods to a customer.

400
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,760
See the next photo.

401
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,260
Hey.

402
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,740
Do you think I don’t know
you are trying to stir things up?

403
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,500
Sorry that it won’t work. I trust him.

404
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,140
Why are you doing this? Are you a freak?

405
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,290
Why did you stalk him?

406
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,680
Okay.

407
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,370
I gave up.

408
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,790
I’m leaving.

409
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,990
(Three.)

410
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,330
(Two.)

411
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,830
(One.)

412
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,450
Prang.

413
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,660
Ake.

414
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,890
You came here with Prang
to deliver goods to a customer, right?

415
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,970
Tell me this is all.

416
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,570
I…

417
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,630
I’m sorry.

418
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,850
Why are you saying you’re sorry?

419
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,920
If you say you’re sorry, it means you admit it?

420
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,670
How can you do this to me?

421
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,770
I thought…

422
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,960
an ordinary man like me

423
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,310
deserves an ordinary woman like you.

424
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,410
We are the same kind of people.

425
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,480
Until I met Prang.

426
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,500
You said this yourself.

427
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,380
She is sweet, smart, and kind.

428
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,990
I never thought

429
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,960
that she would be interested in me.

430
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,780
But when it happened,

431
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,250
I didn’t want to let her go.

432
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,130
What about me?

433
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,980
Have you ever thought how I would feel?

434
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,410
To be honest,

435
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,840
I didn’t think about it.

436
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,260
Jued.

437
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,350
All this time,

438
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,230
I’m the only one who has been helping you.

439
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,860
Unlike Prang, she can support me in everything.

440
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,460
I can go anywhere with her
without feeling embarrassed.

441
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,350
Unlike you,

442
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,720
I only feel sorry for you.

443
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,190
The money you borrowed from me,

444
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,430
I won’t ask you to pay it back.

445
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,090
About Prang,

446
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,850
can you do me a favor?

447
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,940
What do you mean?

448
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,610
She’s okay with me having you.

449
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,080
I want you to do the same.

450
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,270
So we can be together.

451
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,280
I think you should go home.

452
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,310
Mission accomplished.

453
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,050
I can go anywhere with her
without feeling embarrassed.

454
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,120
Unlike you, I only feel sorry for you.

455
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,730
Let go of me.

456
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,980
Hey, do you want to die?

457
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,670
Are you stupid?

458
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,920
You are going to kill yourself
because your boyfriend cheated on you?

459
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,530
Yes, I am stupid.

460
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,470
I want to die.

461
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,240
You should die with me.

462
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,120
Why do I need to do that?

463
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,860
You destroyed my life.

464
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,070
I’ll take you with me.

465
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,500
No.

466
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,320
Hey.

467
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,250
You would find out
that he cheated on you anyway.

468
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,210
I just helped you find out sooner.

469
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,930
So you don’t waste your time
and end things with him

470
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,850
How can I end things with him? I want to die.

471
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,100
This is not ending things with him.

472
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,000
It’s ending your life.

473
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,550
If you are dead, they can do whatever they want.

474
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,080
Are you sure you’re okay
if they hold hands while visiting your grave?

475
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,730
Huh?

476
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,740
Good.

477
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,040
Be angry.

478
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,800
Ake.

479
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,620
Be angrier.

480
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,100
Prang.

481
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,930
Good.

482
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,210
Okay.

483
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,020
You are angry enough.

484
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,760
I’ll help you take revenge.

485
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,980
But right now, can you let it go?

486
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,500
Are you tired?

487
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,010
Not at all.

488
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,510
Really?

489
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,440
Just seeing your face, all my tiredness is gone.

490
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,990
Last night was amazing.

491
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,300
What about tonight?

492
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,570
Are you ready?

493
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,840
Yes.

494
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,520
Let me go.

495
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,300
Come here.

496
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,200
What are you doing?

497
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,030
I’m going to hit them.

498
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,030
Hit them, hit them, hit them.

499
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,740
You are acting like a middle school bully.

500
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,470
Do you think there won’t be
any legal consequences if you hit them?

501
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,130
Think again.

502
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,930
Think.

503
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,670
If I’m going to face charges,

504
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,490
do you think I should hit them
with a shoe or a durian shell?

505
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,130
You don’t need to do anything.

506
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,150
I’ll take care of it.

507
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,240
What do you want to have for dinner?

508
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,470
Anything is fine. You choose.

509
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,710
Where can I find Mouton Rothschild?

510
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,830
Do you mean Lod Chong?

511
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,520
Lod Chong is in the chiller that way.

512
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,720
It’s not Lod Chong.

513
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,030
I want Mouton Rothschild,
a red wine from Bordeaux.

514
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,770
Oh.

515
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,980
I usually drink the 2000 wine vintage.

516
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,600
The price is around 90,000 baht per bottle.

517
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,180
If you want to mark up the price, I don’t mind.

518
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,520
I drink it every day. But I suddenly ran out of it.

519
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,170
Our store doesn’t have expensive wine like that.

520
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,140
Do you want to see other wines that we have?

521
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,180
I only drink Grand Cru wines.

522
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,800
Cheap wines trigger
my allergic reactions and rashes.

523
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,880
What should I do?

524
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,140
Ake, why don’t you check other branches?

525
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,020
But other branches don’t have…

526
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,150
It’s our fault that
we don’t have the product you’re looking for.

527
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,730
We will take responsibility by catering it to you.

528
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,580
I’m counting on you.

529
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,610
Which branch do you want me to go to?

530
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,280
Pathum.

531
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,220
Pathumwan?

532
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,390
Pathum Thani.

533
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,310
Take my car and go now.

534
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,910
It will take a while.

535
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,790
It’s okay.

536
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,370
It means I will have more time with you.

537
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,000
Prang, I called to check with the branch…

538
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,760
How could you do this to me?

539
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,550
Why are you upset?

540
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,100
We are not in a relationship.

541
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,890
You and I…

542
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,480
We are just fooling around.

543
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,430
Don’t tell me that
you think I have feelings for you?

544
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,070
Don’t you notice that I’m only with you at our workplace
or the places where we can be alone together?

545
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,940
I’ve never introduced you to anyone.

546
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,560
You are my subordinate.

547
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,080
I’m your boss.

548
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,550
We have nothing in common.

549
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,060
Take a look at yourself.

550
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,660
Then look at him.

551
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,570
He’s on another level.

552
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,290
I can go anywhere with her
without feeling embarrassed.

553
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,040
Unlike you, I only feel sorry for you.

554
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,080
If you still want to be in my life,
you should keep in your place.

555
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,420
Shall we continue?

556
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,650
What are you waiting for?

557
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,250
Ouch.

558
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,660
Are you bleeding?

559
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,120
Jued.

560
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,550
Prang and I are over.

561
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,960
I decided to quit my job.

562
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,740
I’m sorry.

563
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,530
I…

564
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,240
I was a horrible man.

565
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,510
I hurt you.

566
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,130
Now,

567
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,620
I know that what I did was wrong.

568
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,510
I promise.

569
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,040
From now on, there will be only two of us.

570
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,340
Please give me another chance.

571
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,500
Can we start again?

572
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,590
Am I still the only good thing in your life?

573
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,250
I don’t have any hope, right?

574
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,480
But I want you to know this.

575
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,260
You will always be the only good thing in my life.

576
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,130
One.

577
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,200
Two.

578
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,720
Three.

579
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,500
Wait.

580
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,930
The money I owe you, I’ll slowly pay it back.

581
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,400
I won’t take a single dime from you.

582
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,400
Let me vent out to you.

583
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,490
Asshole.

584
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,400
Douchebag.

585
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,520
Don’t ever show your face in my life again.

586
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,830
A man leeching off a woman like you
doesn’t deserve to be in my life.

587
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,490
Go rot in hell.

588
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,260
Ouch.

589
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,540
It’s good that you didn’t fall for his words.

590
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,970
Once a cheater,

591
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,550
if you give him another chance, he will do it again.

592
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,760
You know him well because you are alike.

593
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,680
How can you say that to me?

594
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,550
I helped you.

595
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,640
You can’t blame that he did this
because he is that kind of person.

596
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,530
You should blame love.

597
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,280
It’s too fragile and vulnerable.

598
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,010
It’s not true.

599
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,320
Love can also be strong and unwavering.

600
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Have you ever met that kind of love?

601
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,230
No.

602
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,880
Because I’m not good enough.

603
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,510
I am lacking in every way.

604
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,440
I am poor and unemployed.

605
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,950
There’s nothing good about me.

606
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,480
Why would a good man want to be with me?

607
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,880
You are stupid.

608
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,910
You are fooled by those fairytales.

609
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,560
Yes, I am stupid.

610
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,370
I am stupid and smug.

611
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,120
I told him I’m going to pay him back.

612
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,530
I don’t have a job.

613
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,630
How will I find money to pay him back?

614
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,180
Your ring.

615
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,020
Sell it.

616
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,000
I can’t sell it.

617
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,960
It’s a toy ring.

618
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,180
He bought it from a dollar store to wear it for fun.

619
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,160
Now, there’s nothing funny about it.

620
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,100
Here.

621
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,800
Go here to apply for a job.

622
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,520
So you can find money to pay him back.

623
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,090
Or you will finally see the true nature of love.

624
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,570
Your job here is to break up couples
beyond the point of return.

625
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,390
Boss, why did you call me here?

626
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,280
I want you to meet your partner who will join Team A.

627
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
I told you Team A can work effectively alone.

628
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,690
I don’t need a partner to be my burden.

629
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,790
You can begin your job now.

630
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,380
He is our target.

631
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,000
You need to go and be close to him
as much as possible.

632
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,620
I’ll take photos and use them
to make his girlfriend jealous.

633
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,430
Ouch!

634
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,590
You are so useless.

635
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,670
You can’t do it?

636
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,390
If you are that weak,
you should submit your resignation.
