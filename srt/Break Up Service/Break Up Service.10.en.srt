1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,980
We are doing well on our own path.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,510
No need to worry about each other.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,300
That’s Rose.

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,370
Team B of Break Up Service.

5
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,650
I asked her to help us on this case.

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,720
I have something bothering me.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,340
But I can’t tell anyone about it.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,670
I also have something to tell you.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,520
I love you.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,390
But we are work partners.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,690
I told you

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
I want to be more than that.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,170
But I never think of you that way.

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,470
I come to you when I need someone to talk to.

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,240
It doesn’t mean I feel the same way.

16
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,430
I am dating Tee.

17
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,240
Let’s forget about what happened
and go back to how we used to be.

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,190
Can we go back to being Team A?

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,430
Come on.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,810
I’ll give you a ride home.

21
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,720
When someone asked me

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,790
when I thought my journey to success began,

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,720
I proudly told them

24
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,780
it began on the day

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,780
I got divorced and became single again.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,040
You are the one who helped make it happen.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,720
You should be proud.

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,180
I shouldn’t be acting like a lovesick puppy.

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,300
Boss, you need to get over her.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,310
You need to go back to being the same bad guy.

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,170
The same bastard.

32
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,820
The pillar of Break Up Service.

33
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,960
Can you do that for me?

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,000
Come in.

35
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,540
This drink is good for you.

36
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,250
My beloved brother.

37
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,470
Drink it.

38
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,550
This is pennywort juice.

39
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,800
It will help heal your wound.

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,540
I promise.

41
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,290
I will find a way
to help you go back to being the cool guy.

42
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,710
Nut.

43
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,460
Yes.

44
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,920
Take this.

45
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,890
Can you open the door for me?

46
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,620
Come on, my brother.

47
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,160
Feel depressed as much as you want.

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,820
Pennyworth juice.

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,520
Yes.

50
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,660
I hired her to be his partner
to stop him from resigning.

51
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,460
Instead, she breaks his heart.

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,670
I can’t believe it.

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,060
I don’t know what to do with Jued.

54
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,010
You can do whatever you want.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,970
But please don’t fire her.

56
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,360
It’s not her fault that Boss falls for her.

57
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,650
He broke up countless couples.

58
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,180
But he lost out to his own love life.

59
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,320
Love is like a glitch in our lives.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,780
Do you still miss her?

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,450
Miss her?

62
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,160
I just don’t know why it’s here.

63
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,030
I thought I threw them all away

64
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,130
when I divorced her.

65
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,300
I keep finding strange things in my room.

66
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,480
What about the company outing?

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,660
Here.

68
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,740
These are the options for you to choose from.

69
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,030
I chose this one.

70
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,860
It looks pretty and offers a discount.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,710
We will have our company outing here.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,910
Please book it.

73
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,410
Yes.

74
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,230
Thank you.

75
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,170
I’ll take care of it right away.

76
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,100
Nut, come back and close the door.

77
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,500
Nut.

78
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,440
Nut!

79
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,330
Did you call me?

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,310
No.

81
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,790
You forgot to close the door.

82
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,390
Sorry.

83
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,770
Everyone.

84
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,980
Everyone.

85
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,220
We will leave in ten minutes.

86
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,250
Get ready.

87
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,790
Ying. Joy. Get this into the van.

88
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,640
Yes.

89
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,020
It’s so big.

90
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,600
Joy, why aren’t you helping me?

91
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,920
Hello.

92
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,760
Jued.

93
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,780
You are incredible, incredible, incredible.

94
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,870
Well done.

95
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,710
You took revenge for us.

96
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,880
Good job.

97
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,920
What about that one?

98
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,390
It’s too big.

99
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,090
- Jued.
- Tee.

100
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,750
You go first.

101
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,440
That night that Boss took you home.

102
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,620
Just to confirm,

103
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,550
there’s nothing else
besides what you have told me, right?

104
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,760
He confessed his feelings for me.

105
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,890
I love you.

106
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,740
I already rejected him.

107
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,100
I only see him as my work partner.

108
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,670
Plus, I’m dating you.

109
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,540
But he stole my van to take you.

110
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,000
He always goes over the top.

111
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,640
This is why everyone knew what happened.

112
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,860
You’re right.

113
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,740
I’m sorry that I keep asking you about it.

114
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,220
It’s not a big deal.

115
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,970
I’m okay if it can make you feel assured.

116
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,220
What I want to tell you earlier is…

117
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,530
Can I give a snack to Boss?

118
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,430
If you aren’t okay with it, I won’t do it.

119
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,450
I’m okay with it.

120
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,630
You promised him
that you would continue to be his work partner.

121
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,990
You can go.

122
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,340
I’m fine with it.

123
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,520
What are you doing?

124
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,700
What are you doing here?

125
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,580
I want to give a snack to Boss.

126
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,260
My snack looks tastier than yours.

127
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,540
You go to this outing because of Team B.

128
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,910
Then why did you say you love me?

129
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,180
You are a womanizer.

130
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,150
You are an asshole.

131
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,380
Jued, are you okay?

132
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,950
Tee.

133
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,280
I’m sorry.

134
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,280
I’m sorry.

135
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,850
You didn’t need to feed me so quickly.

136
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,330
I wasn’t in a hurry.

137
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,380
I feel bad for you.

138
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,690
Why are you sitting here alone
and looking so down?

139
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,830
You should do something else.

140
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,270
Can you go sit somewhere else?

141
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,820
I want to be alone.

142
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,260
If you want to be alone,

143
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,500
then why do you join the outing?

144
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,780
Don’t you think everyone knows
you are here to watch her?

145
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,820
Your hand.

146
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,310
Can you take it away?

147
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,170
Mr. Chan, the hotel looks great.

148
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,090
You made the right choice.

149
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,020
Yes.

150
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,310
But I think…

151
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,990
this place looks familiar.

152
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,360
How?

153
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,750
Hey!

154
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,900
This is where Kesorn and I got married.

155
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,920
Why did we come here?

156
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,770
Nut.

157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,500
Where is Nut?

158
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,600
Nut is checking in the pool villa for you.

159
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,750
Why don’t we go to the pool villa and relax?

160
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,310
I think…

161
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,510
Mr. Chan still misses Kesorn, his ex-wife.

162
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,810
Kesorn.

163
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,280
Chan.

164
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,740
No.

165
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,260
Chan.

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,560
No.

167
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,930
Chan.

168
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,670
No.

169
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,320
I don’t miss you anymore.

170
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,320
Ouch!

171
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,770
I don’t miss…

172
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,510
No way.

173
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,070
One more?

174
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,880
Are you real?

175
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,460
Yes.

176
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,020
Long time no see. How are you doing?

177
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,800
A single man like me.

178
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,240
My life without you. Everything is perfect.

179
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,740
I took my employees on a company outing here.

180
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,630
We won a startup award.

181
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,330
Have you heard about it?

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,210
Congratulations.

183
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,090
I hope you are doing a legitimate business.

184
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,730
What about you?

185
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,480
Do you have any good news to share?

186
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,850
Obviously not.

187
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,580
That’s why you came back

188
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,020
to where we held our wedding.

189
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
You wanted to revisit the old memories, right?

190
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,890
I’m here to erase the old memories.

191
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,340
Jagiya.

192
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,390
Jagiya.

193
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,240
I learned from watching Korean dramas.

194
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,490
“Jagiya” means sweetie.

195
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,710
This is Chan.

196
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,320
He’s my ex-husband.

197
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,700
This is Stephen Choi.

198
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,970
My fiancé.

199
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,920
Fiancé?

200
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,890
Hi, Mr. Chan.

201
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,960
I heard a lot about you.

202
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,340
We came here to shoot our pre-wedding photos.

203
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,330
Pre-wedding?

204
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,120
Are you marrying him?

205
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,850
Ne.

206
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,730
What?

207
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,800
Ne.

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,870
What?

209
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,760
Ne.

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,590
What?

211
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,350
Ne.

212
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,100
Nae?

213
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,280
“Ne” means yes.

214
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,580
Yes, yes.

215
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,260
Excuse me.

216
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,040
Yes, your ass!

217
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,700
Mr. Chan.

218
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,780
I think we should go to another hotel.

219
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,230
No.

220
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,050
Your next mission.

221
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,260
You need to break up those two.

222
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,430
But we are on the company’s outing trip.

223
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,990
Anyone who can break them up,

224
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I’ll give you a bonus worth one million baht.

225
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,080
Stephen Choi is an American-Korean businessman.

226
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,220
He has been living in Thailand for a long time.

227
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,130
So he can speak Thai.

228
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,750
He is so fake.

229
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,180
It doesn’t say
what kind of business he is running.

230
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
He is definitely a scammer.

231
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,050
He must scam Kesorn to marry him.

232
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,370
Hey, you guys over there.

233
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,210
When will you start breaking them up?

234
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,720
Tee.

235
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,520
I want the one million baht bonus.

236
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,140
So I can pay my family’s debt,

237
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,210
the money I owe my ex and Boss.

238
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,990
Since you have a large debt,

239
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,390
I’ll help you.

240
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,700
You are so sweet.

241
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,820
The only way for the three of us to get the bonus,

242
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,480
we need to tag along
with one of the three operation teams.

243
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,900
I…

244
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,720
Rose, you can take 40 percent of the bonus.

245
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,290
We will take 30 percent each.

246
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,420
You can take 50 percent of it.

247
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,270
We will share the other 50 percent.

248
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,330
These brats left me without hesitation.

249
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,500
Boss, you need to team up with me on this mission.

250
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,800
No.

251
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
I don’t want to do anything.

252
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,660
Boss, listen to me and imagine this.

253
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,220
If you do nothing,

254
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,670
those two will splurge the bonus on pleasures
while you are left miserable.

255
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,360
Yay!

256
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,700
They may spend the money on their wedding.

257
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,890
They will live happily and grow old together.

258
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,670
Jued.

259
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,620
Yes, Tee.

260
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,260
Can you stand seeing that?

261
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,220
Can you stand it?

262
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,620
It’s so refreshing that I get myself together.

263
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,470
Good boy.

264
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,210
Let’s accomplish this mission together.

265
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,390
Yes.

266
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,250
Thank you.

267
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,080
Thank you.

268
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,380
Honey, my face gets oily.

269
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,010
Excuse me for five minutes.

270
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,740
I need to touch up my makeup.

271
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,520
Sure.

272
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,080
I’ll be right back.

273
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,580
Yes.

274
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,610
You and I were the only ones
who ever worked with Kesorn and Chan.

275
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,880
We are the only ones

276
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,550
who know about their problems.

277
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,660
Then you should remember

278
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,150
my first day as an intern.

279
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,790
7 YEARS AGO
Open the lid, put the paper down,

280
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,360
and close the lid.

281
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,580
Then push this button, Boss.

282
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,100
I get it, Miss Nut.

283
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,440
You don’t need to call me Miss Nut.

284
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,490
Sure, Bitc…

285
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,190
You can call me Nut.

286
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,490
Yes, Nut.

287
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,590
Honey.

288
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,090
Yes.

289
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,060
Why don’t we take them out for dinner?

290
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,260
Good idea.

291
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,660
You go ahead and book a restaurant.

292
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,540
Can you give me five minutes?

293
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,520
Of course.

294
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,180
What are you going to do?

295
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,270
I’ll touch up my makeup.

296
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,110
Wait a second.

297
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,770
Sure.

298
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,970
Hurry back. I’m hungry.

299
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,640
Sure.

300
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,420
Honey.

301
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,400
Chan.

302
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,100
Chan.

303
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,380
Where will we have dinner?

304
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,620
Which restaurant did you book?

305
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,940
What dinner?

306
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,040
The intern went home.

307
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,320
Only the Isan diner near the office is still open.

308
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,480
Chan, look at my dress.

309
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,250
Chan, look at my dress.

310
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,120
If you don’t go now, the diner will close too.

311
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,640
Nut.

312
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,510
Isan diner.

313
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,020
Yes, dinner.

314
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,300
Let’s go.

315
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,600
Nut, are you here to touch up your makeup?

316
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,300
Yes, I want to apply my lipstick.

317
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,140
Right.

318
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,710
Goodness, the lipstick is on your face.

319
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,860
You can’t go out
to see your fiancé like this, Kesorn.

320
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,080
You should redo your makeup.

321
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,460
How can I do that?

322
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,210
I only have blotting paper and lipstick.

323
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,220
It’s okay.

324
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,030
I have a small makeup bag with me.

325
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,120
You call this small?

326
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,680
Feel free to use it.

327
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,640
I’m sorry, sis.

328
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,710
I really need the money.

329
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,700
Can I sit with you, Oppa?

330
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,700
We met this morning.

331
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,660
Sure.

332
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,600
If you are not going to do anything, step aside.

333
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,270
You get in my way.

334
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,130
I came first.

335
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,760
You came first but she didn’t choose you.

336
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,650
What do you mean?

337
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,570
I’m talking about the issue between us.

338
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:29,810
There’s something on your cheek.

339
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,100
Where is Kesorn?

340
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,140
Why did she leave you alone?

341
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,110
My girlfriend went to touch up her makeup
for five minutes.

342
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,530
Five minutes on sloth time?

343
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,430
She doesn’t seem to care about you.

344
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,240
She keeps you waiting like this.

345
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,100
She cares about me.

346
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,490
That’s why she wants to look perfect for me.

347
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,960
So everyone will be jealous of me,

348
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,540
especially that stupid Chan.

349
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,660
He is shallow.

350
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,370
He can’t see her true wart.

351
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,050
It’s “worth’, not “wart”.

352
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,600
You two, get out of my way.

353
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,280
What?

354
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,860
I slipped.

355
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,050
I’m so clumsy.

356
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,340
She’s so clumsy.

357
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,550
What are you doing?

358
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,230
Let my foot go.

359
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,310
It tickles.

360
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,110
Jued.

361
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,300
Rose.

362
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,850
Jued.

363
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,940
Honey, I’m sorry.

364
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,600
I thought it would take only five minutes.

365
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,170
But I was stuck in the bathroom.

366
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,790
Are you okay?

367
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,860
I’m okay.

368
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,100
I put on my makeup while waiting for help.

369
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,310
If Team B didn’t interfere with my plan,

370
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,990
I would have gotten the photos.

371
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,930
Team C was tactless.

372
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,520
You also played dirty.

373
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,270
You locked me in the bathroom,

374
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,970
you backstabber.

375
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,620
You wasted the whole night for nothing.

376
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,550
When I let you do the mission freely,
you ended up fighting.

377
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,340
This time, I’ll hold one team back.

378
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,780
Who wants to go first,

379
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,940
Raise your hand.

380
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,710
I’ll say it again.

381
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,860
If you want the other teams to go first,

382
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,700
put your hand down.

383
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,940
The other teams, you can go.

384
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,920
You need to spend the night
coming up with a plan.

385
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,070
You can’t go to sleep

386
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,660
before you accomplish the mission.

387
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,880
Do you remember your second day as an intern?

388
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,920
You called me that day.

389
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,070
Honey,

390
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,470
what do you want to have for our next meal?

391
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,590
Anything is fine.

392
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,910
There’s no food in such a name.

393
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,930
Anything simple and fast.

394
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,770
What do you mean by anything simple and fast?

395
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,440
Honey, you can order anything.

396
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,020
I can eat everything.

397
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,070
Anything?

398
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,090
Anything.

399
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,170
Here.

400
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,560
Larb from the Isan diner
left from yesterday’s dinner?

401
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,730
It’s not a leftover. I saved it for today.

402
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,300
It’s simple and fast, just as you want.

403
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,450
Did you do this to get on my nerves?

404
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,850
Boss, can you help me find it?

405
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,560
I put it over there but I can’t find it.

406
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,500
You don’t like it?

407
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,440
Chan.

408
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,140
Honey.

409
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,960
Chan.

410
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,780
Don’t do it.

411
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,940
Hurry up. I need it now.

412
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,620
Chan.

413
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,660
You need to calm down.

414
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,630
Chan!

415
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,920
Sticky rice.

416
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,950
No, I mean the document.

417
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,450
Wait.

418
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,370
I put it there. Find it
.

419
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,980
Do you feel hot?

420
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,380
A little.

421
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,560
Madame. Mister.

422
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,790
You are a couple, right?

423
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,450
Do you want to rent a boat
to go out and take photos?

424
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,090
It looks so romantic like this, Madame?

425
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,020
Jagi, I want pictures like this.

426
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,460
Jackie? Who is Jackie? It’s not my name.

427
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,230
No.

428
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,930
I thought you called someone else.

429
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,420
Mister, do you want it? It will look great.

430
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,810
Sure.

431
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,770
Where is your boat, Auntie?

432
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,440
Follow me. I’ll lead the way.

433
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,620
It looks pretty just like the photos.

434
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,910
Let’s go.

435
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,920
If you feel sore, I can give you a massage.

436
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,910
We are fine.

437
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,470
Tada!

438
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,410
Auntie!

439
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,100
It looks different from the picture.

440
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,370
This is not a longtail boat.

441
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,870
It looks exactly the same.

442
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,840
It’s long and has a tail.

443
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,980
It’s around 2-3 meters long.

444
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,370
That’s why it’s called a long-tail boat.

445
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,790
Honey.

446
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,650
Honey, I want to ride it for some time.

447
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,030
You want to ride?

448
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,850
Please ride it with me.

449
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,110
Good job, Team A.

450
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,060
Kesorn likes to keep people guessing
what she wants.

451
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,700
If they guess it wrong, she will get upset.

452
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,350
Stephen only sees her angel side.

453
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,270
If he sees the devil side of her like I did,

454
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,900
he will run away back to Seoul.

455
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,280
Tee, what if we don’t get the bonus?

456
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,830
It’s okay.

457
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,560
We can play this instead.

458
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,000
I prepared it to play with you.

459
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,550
Hey.

460
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,310
Where is Team B?

461
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,560
Oppa.

462
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,770
Can we join you?

463
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,120
Come on. Get on.

464
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,220
It won’t be fun if it’s just the two of you.

465
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,810
Hurry up. Get on it.

466
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,640
This is perfect.

467
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,250
All set.

468
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,080
Come on. Let’s go.

469
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,960
Excuse me.

470
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,690
I changed my mind.

471
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,110
This is my seat.

472
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,300
Aren’t they too close?

473
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,300
The boat is crammed.

474
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,930
I’ll go ride the jet ski.

475
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,220
Where are you going?

476
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,100
They are almost on top of each other.

477
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,610
That’s right.

478
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,920
They are so shameless.

479
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,400
Is she trying to flirt with the target or him?

480
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,000
I can’t take it anymore.

481
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,380
I can’t take it anymore.

482
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,420
What are you doing?

483
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,160
Wait.

484
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,380
I want to ride it too.

485
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,820
Move.

486
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,330
What are you doing?

487
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,030
I like this.

488
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,700
Can I take the second seat?

489
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,710
It offers the right amount of thrill.

490
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,710
Who said you can ride it?

491
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,090
This is my boat.

492
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
Let me join you.

493
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,940
Go sit behind me.

494
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,440
No.

495
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,580
Hey!

496
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,210
Do whatever you want.

497
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,820
I didn’t want to ride it in the first place anyway.

498
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,260
I’m hot and tired.

499
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,660
I told you I wanted a longtail boat,

500
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,280
not a banana boat.

501
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,440
I won’t do it.

502
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,010
Honey, really?

503
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,130
You should get used to this.

504
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,640
This is the real her that I had lived with.

505
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,850
How is it? Isn’t she grumpy and scary?

506
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,770
This is great.

507
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,590
Honey, thank you

508
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,920
for allowing me to see this side of you.

509
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,760
Honey.

510
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,470
Are you okay with it?

511
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,300
I’m such a whiner.

512
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:03,950
Oh.

513
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,110
You only show your true feelings.

514
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,840
If it’s you, I can accept everything about you.

515
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,550
I love you.

516
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,600
I love you too.

517
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,050
Oh, Mr. Chan.

518
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,910
Let me go.

519
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,480
Break Up Service.

520
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,090
Everyone, come here.

521
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,640
Break Up Service, you are useless.

522
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,780
You failed this simple mission.

523
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,140
You move too slowly.

524
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,780
I’ll show you what a fast move looks like.

525
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,780
You failed the mission.

526
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,120
You can’t break them up.

527
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,290
They confessed their love in front of me.

528
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,160
This is the lowest point of Break Up Service.

529
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,530
All of you are useless.

530
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,030
Especially you.

531
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,410
It’s not your turn yet. How did you go out?

532
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,910
I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.

533
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,570
Of course, it won’t happen again.

534
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,300
I made up my mind.

535
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,060
I will dismiss Team C from this mission.

536
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,150
Tee.

537
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,930
I disobeyed his order and went to the beach.

538
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,700
I…

539
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,780
I know you really want the bonus.

540
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,950
Tee.

541
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,210
Jued, since we are dismissed from the mission.

542
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:29,110
We’ll be the only two people
who can truly enjoy the company outing.

543
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,370
Thank you, Tee.

544
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,250
You’ve never been mad at me.

545
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:45,980
But I think…

546
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,780
Nut must be very mad at me.

547
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,150
I ruined her plan today.

548
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,640
I can’t go back to my room tonight.

549
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,110
Do you want to go to my room to hang out?

550
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,150
(I thought he wouldn’t join the outing.)

551
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,570
(So I didn’t book a room for him.)

552
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,000
(But he said he would share a room with you.)

553
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,370
Why didn’t you ask me first?

554
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,780
(Just let it go.)

555
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,070
(Is Jued with you?)

556
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,110
(Can I talk to her?)

557
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,390
Jued.

558
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,480
It’s Nut.

559
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,850
Yes, Nut.

560
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,250
(Jued, you can come back to our room tonight.)

561
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,660
Aren’t you mad at me?

562
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,890
(You are no longer competing against me
for the bonus.)

563
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,050
(We can now go back to being family.)

564
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,380
Nut.

565
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,270
(Hurry up.

566
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,630
Ying and Joy are waiting for you.)

567
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,680
Sure.

568
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,690
I’ll be right there.

569
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,620
Yes.

570
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,560
I got to go.

571
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,430
Okay.

572
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,170
Bye.

573
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,000
Good night.

574
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,820
Good night.

575
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:37,710
Nut.

576
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,730
Good job.

577
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,180
I’m in Pranburi.

578
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,390
Why is your team in Chiang Mai?

579
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,300
Didn’t you look up the location first?

580
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,320
This hotel chain has hotels in many provinces.

581
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,870
So I changed the location and
sent it to their pre-wedding photographer team.

582
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,180
Good job, Rose.

583
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,030
I guess the bonus is likely to go to Team B.

584
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,110
I’ll go and mock her.

585
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,090
Aigoo.

586
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,300
Aigoo.

587
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,350
Don’t you feel embarrassed?

588
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
You are getting married.

589
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,560
But you don’t have a photographer
because he went to the wrong hotel.

590
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,160
My goodness.

591
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,580
Don’t you think it’s a bad sign?

592
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,060
Maybe you can’t get married.

593
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,630
I know we might have an accident.

594
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,040
So I prepared a backup plan.

595
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,320
If the situation doesn’t look good,

596
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,330
Destiny Wedding can help you.

597
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,400
I’m sorry for being late, President.

598
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
The traffic was very bad.

599
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,470
President?

600
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,310
You!

601
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,820
That’s right.

602
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,230
I’m the owner of Destiny,
your business competitor.

603
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,250
Break Up Service, I disgust you.

604
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,550
Today, I’ll teach you an expensive lesson.

605
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,820
Honey,

606
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,010
when Chan said it was a bad sign.

607
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,760
I called a fortuneteller on Jeju Island.

608
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,130
She said the best day to hold our wedding is…

609
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:54,860
Tomorrow.

610
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,240
Huh? Tomorrow?

611
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,350
Isn’t it too soon?

612
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,170
Can we prepare everything in time?

613
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,690
Yes, you can.

614
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,300
If it’s for love,

615
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,570
our team can get everything ready in time.

616
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,110
Honey, we love each other.

617
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,550
What are we waiting for?

618
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,540
Let’s create good memories

619
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,200
to replace your bad memories.

620
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,300
Yes, honey. Let’s create new memories.

621
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,830
I love you.

622
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,190
It hurts.

623
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,020
What?

624
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,680
You told me the juice can help heal wounds.

625
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,440
I don’t have any wounds.

626
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,680
You look like you’re going to die.

627
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,880
Don’t deny it.

628
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,230
Mr. Chan.

629
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,050
We were spying on their team and found this.

630
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,110
Hurry and open it.

631
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,830
This map shows
the locations of all of our hidden cameras.

632
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,630
Maybe…

633
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,300
We suspected that
an insider sent our information to Destiny.

634
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,600
It might be true.

635
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,070
The spy uses the codename “Angel”.

636
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,320
Who?

637
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,170
Who?

638
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,370
Who is the Angel?

639
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,540
You are acting nonsense.

640
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,870
Who would admit it?

641
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,620
Then everyone, get pens and paper.

642
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,330
Look.

643
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,820
It looks similar.

644
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,560
What?

645
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,080
It doesn’t look similar.

646
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,180
Can I go to the bathroom?

647
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,240
It must be her.

648
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,800
Sneaking out like this.

649
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,360
Aren’t you afraid
that they will suspect you of being “Angel”?

650
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:36,960
I’m not.

651
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,760
Why do I have to be afraid?

652
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,930
I think Rose looks suspicious.

653
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,650
Rose is not Angel.

654
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,450
If she isn’t Angel, why did she lie
that she wanted to go to the bathroom?

655
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,620
I don’t know.

656
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,720
But you should be careful.

657
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,770
Did you forget you have a secret?

658
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,930
Are you using the secret to threaten me?

659
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,280
Stop acting foolish.

660
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,430
I’m warning you
because I don’t want to see you make a mistake.

661
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,280
Rose is not someone you should mess up with.

662
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,150
I have worked with her.

663
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,780
I know her…

664
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,360
If you know her that well, why don’t you ask her
to take my place and be your partner?

665
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:08,890
Jued.

666
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,160
I don’t care.

667
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,180
I’ll make up for what I did with this mission.

668
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,500
I will expose Rose.

669
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,320
If you refuse to listen to me
and something bad happens,

670
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,190
I won’t help you this time.

671
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,310
Then don’t.

672
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,760
I will never ask for your help.

673
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,920
You still want to help the snake.

674
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,460
So what?

675
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,950
You were the farmer.

676
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,080
Now, you turned into a clown

677
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,210
Just like I was.

678
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,410
I warned you but you didn’t listen to me.

679
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,990
Don’t ask me to go drinking next time.

680
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,330
We should go and work as a clown instead.

681
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,640
Can’t I worry about her as her work partner?

682
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,030
Are you seeing her just as your partner?

683
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,470
She only sees me as her partner.

684
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,370
What else can I do?

685
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,370
You don’t need to do anything.

686
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,420
You have done everything you can.

687
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,060
You confessed your feelings for her.

688
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,720
She already rejected you.

689
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,660
It must hurt badly.

690
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,860
Besides getting over her,
there’s nothing else you can you.

691
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,220
That’s why I’m packing my bag
and going back to Bangkok.

692
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,740
I won’t help her again.

693
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,310
Good.

694
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,630
You know you can’t stay out of her business.

695
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,780
Then you should stay away from her.

696
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,770
This is the first step to move on from her.

697
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,330
Call me when you arrive in Bangkok.

698
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,550
I’ll buy you pennywort juice.

699
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,710
Okay.

700
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,260
Jued.

701
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,130
Who are you looking for?

702
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,210
Destiny has a customer privacy policy.

703
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,910
We won’t reveal your secret.

704
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,600
I know you won’t do it.

705
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,810
But I feel guilty.

706
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,510
I work for Break Up Service.

707
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,070
We have different goals.

708
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,730
But I saw it.

709
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,290
I saw how happy you were
when your friends got back together.

710
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,980
I’m sorry.

711
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,000
That’s true.

712
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,190
Even if I could turn back time,

713
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,290
I would still hire Destiny
to help Pop and Kormai reconcile.

714
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,480
See? We have the same goal.

715
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,490
I followed Rose…

716
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,630
Stop making an excuse.

717
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,870
We know everything.

718
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,690
I was the one who followed you.

719
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,260
That’s how I got the evidence.

720
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,080
(Even if I could turn back time,)

721
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,470
(I would still hire Destiny
to help Pop and Kormai reconcile.)

722
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,730
(See? We have the same goal.)

723
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,630
Can I go to the bathroom?

724
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,280
Jued.

725
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,140
(Destiny has a customer privacy policy.)

726
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,880
(We won’t reveal your secret.)

727
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,860
I trusted you, Jued.

728
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,040
But you betrayed me and hired our competitor.

729
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,650
I’m sorry, Mr. Chan.

730
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,380
I was wrong.

731
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,220
It’s interesting.

732
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,220
Jued is the only one who contacts our enemy.

733
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,220
Maybe?

734
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,220
Are you Angel?

735
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:13,910
No, I am not.

736
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,530
But our mission failed the last time

737
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,240
because you interrupted the plan.

738
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,730
Hey, that’s too much.

739
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,130
You can’t blame everything on Jued.

740
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,520
The mission failed
because you went against each other.

741
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,380
Jued hired Destiny.

742
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,280
Did you know about that?

743
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,450
You are her boyfriend.

744
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,260
Tee didn’t know about it.

745
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,240
I did it by myself.

746
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,970
I’ll take responsibility
by resigning from the company.

747
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,680
Then I have to resign too.

748
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,110
Because I know about it.

749
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:50,740
Boss.

750
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,550
I’ve known about it
since the first day she hired Destiny.

751
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,520
I didn’t stop her.

752
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,240
I didn’t tell anyone about it.

753
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,090
I know we violated the rules.

754
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,270
You can punish us if you want.

755
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,910
But you can’t accuse her of being a spy.

756
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,590
Just because she hired them,
it doesn’t mean that she is a spy.

757
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,470
I don’t believe that she is a spy.

758
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,150
I interviewed her for the job.

759
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,120
I don’t think she did it.

760
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,880
Nut.

761
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,460
Don’t forget it.

762
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,320
We are family.

763
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,920
Boss, what do you have to prove it?

764
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,730
Do you have any evidence?

765
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,460
It’s not necessary.

766
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,530
If she is a spy,

767
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,650
there’s no way she’d let this mission succeed.

768
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,460
Jued will work with Team A.

769
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,130
We will break up Kesorn and Stephen
before their wedding tomorrow.

770
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,180
This is to prove that Jued is not Angel.

771
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,000
Good.

772
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,960
This will be fun.

773
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,270
Let’s do what you said.

774
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,550
What if Team A fails, what will you do?

775
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,880
I want to know

776
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,470
how Team A’s leader will take responsibility for it.

777
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,660
I we can’t do what we said,

778
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,450
there will no longer be Team A of Break Up Service.

779
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,520
If you fail to break up Kesorn and Stephen
before their wedding,

780
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,270
Team A and Boss will resign.

781
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,400
Let’s do our last mission.

782
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,380
Do you know

783
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,300
what the worst enemy in a relationship is?

784
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,510
The exes.

785
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,190
Admit it. You still miss Chan.

786
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,260
Do you think it’s possible
that Kesorn still love Chan?

787
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,270
Let’s solve your problem.

788
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,030
We found out who Angel is.
