1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,590
I think I’m falling in love with you.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,300
I love you.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,510
Instead of being my partner,
do you want to be my boyfriend?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,970
When you see happy couples,

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,810
you feel happy with them.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,900
It’s strange for us who work in the field.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,900
But I want to keep seeing it.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,500
Helmet.

9
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,660
It’s not safe to hold like that.

10
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,170
We received a request via our app
to destroy Boss and Jued’s relationship, sir.

11
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,210
Whoops.

12
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,510
I’m sorry that we have to hold a meeting outside the office.

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,620
Because the targets are our coworkers.

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Oat was never worried
when Boss was in previous relationships.

15
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,330
Because he knew Boss never loved them.

16
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,090
Even when Boss said
he was going to get married,

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,020
Oat knew they would eventually break up.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,980
When Boss started dating Jued,

19
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,650
Oat feels uneasy about it.

20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,440
After that, we will make Boss
fall in love with the client,

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,280
who has a crush on him for a long time.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,830
Let’s do that.

23
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,760
The Boss-Jued-Oat case

24
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,740
will be our first mission
after the merger of

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,450
Break Up Service and Destiny.

26
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,170
You saw me?

27
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,300
Look.

28
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,910
Which one do you want, pink or red?

29
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,920
Why?

30
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,770
They are lucky colors for love.

31
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,400
I wear a green one,
the lucky color for my birthday, Wednesday.

32
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,970
You were born on Tuesday.

33
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,780
The lucky colors are either pink or red.

34
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,780
I don’t believe in this stuff.

35
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,330
What?

36
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,310
But we were born
under a star of love destruction.

37
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,050
In math, two minuses make a plus.

38
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,940
I think we will be doing just fine.

39
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,760
Whatever.

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,920
Let’s stop talking about it.

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,850
I chose the red one.

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,780
Put it here.

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,530
You are so sweet.

44
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,420
You work for Destiny.

45
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,180
What are you doing here?

46
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,660
Didn’t you already move your stuff?

47
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,990
Yes, I did.

48
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,520
But I’m here to get one of the staff.

49
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,560
Although our companies have merged,

50
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,570
we will work separately.

51
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,430
We both need to stay in our places.

52
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,790
Do not cross the line.

53
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,690
One, two, three, four, five, six.

54
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,210
With Mrs. Kesorn, there are seven of us.

55
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,430
Our team has more members.

56
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,180
One, two, three, four, five.

57
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,610
One, two, three, four, five.

58
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,020
With Mr. Chan,
your team has only six members.

59
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,150
Aigoo.

60
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,150
Nonsense.

61
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,900
What matters is the performance.

62
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,030
Just wait and see
who can deliver a better performance.

63
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,640
Hello, this is Break Up Service.

64
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,780
Hello.

65
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,040
This is Destiny.

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,610
You are not sure
which company you want to hire?

67
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,710
It’s okay.

68
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,540
You can come in to talk with us first.

69
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,080
Take your time to consider

70
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,890
which company will be more useful to you.

71
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,920
Yes.

72
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,980
Boss.

73
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,110
Boss.

74
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,850
Get ready to meet the client.

75
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,680
We need your expertise this time.

76
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,010
You need to win over this client.

77
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,710
Jued.

78
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
This client will be assigned to you.

79
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,180
Though you are dating one of their staff,

80
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,780
For our company,

81
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,190
you cannot go easy on them.

82
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,190
Good luck.

83
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,170
I have a crush on a guy in my Tai Chi group.

84
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,860
After the exercise, I want to ask him
to eat some sweets to have a romantic time.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,390
So we can get out of the friend zone.

86
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,860
But there’s a problem.

87
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,880
He still can’t forget his late wife.

88
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,210
He goes to visit her grave every day.

89
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,500
I’m so upset.

90
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,920
I don’t know what to do.

91
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,920
Since his wife is dead,

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,070
why don’t you hire Destiny
to help you create a new love?

93
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,600
But I think Break Up Service
is a better choice for your problem.

94
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,180
His dead wife is not a problem.

95
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,710
We just need to hold a grave exhumation rite.

96
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,190
Good idea.

97
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,420
If her grave is gone, he won’t need to visit it.

98
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,900
You are so smart.

99
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,390
You can’t do that.

100
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,660
It will ruin his memories with her.

101
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,800
We won’t ruin his memories.

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,450
We just clear up the space for new memories.

103
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,670
No, I think you should listen…

104
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,730
No, you need to listen to me.

105
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,500
Why can’t I do it?

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,460
We already talked about it.

107
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,050
I already explained it.

108
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,490
We don’t need
to make the third party feel bad.

109
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,170
Enough.

110
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,050
Stop fighting.

111
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,280
I will hire neither of you.

112
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I don’t want him anymore.

113
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,190
I will quit Tai Chi.

114
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,620
I’ll find a man on a dating app.

115
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,340
What the heck?

116
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,890
This is annoying.

117
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,900
Why is it so hard for me to get up?

118
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,910
This is your fault.

119
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,010
My fault?

120
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,370
We fight over small things.

121
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,750
Boss, do you really think
it will work between us?

122
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,030
Didn’t you tell me not to say that?

123
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,750
Look what you did.

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,370
I was doing my job.

125
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,520
When did I start the fight?

126
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,100
Do you really don’t know?

127
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,170
They are still arguing.

128
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,370
The first step went well.

129
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,160
You did a great job in stirring the pot.

130
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,330
Here is your wage.

131
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,440
Thank you.

132
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
Thank you.

133
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,370
This is a spare keycard to his condo.

134
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,950
He hid it in Team A's office.

135
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,040
Get ready for step 2.

136
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,980
I told you
work comes before personal feelings.

137
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,380
Jued.

138
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,030
Why don’t you go have lunch?

139
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,330
I’m not hungry.

140
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,550
You must be stressed about Boss.

141
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,420
No.

142
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,050
Boss and I are doing great.

143
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,410
I’m stressed about my friend.

144
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,430
What happened to your friend?

145
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,700
You can tell me since I don’t know her.

146
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,850
Tell me. It’s okay.

147
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,880
The thing is…

148
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,780
My friend started to date a guy not long ago.

149
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,000
But she isn’t sure
if things will work between them.

150
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,930
Nut, do you think what I should do?

151
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,570
Huh?

152
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,260
I mean what my friend should do.

153
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,190
She should break up with him.

154
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,980
But…

155
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,980
They haven’t been dating for long,
but she already worries about it.

156
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,650
Their relationship has no future.

157
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,710
She should break up with him immediately.

158
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,000
But they haven’t been dating for long.

159
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,330
Right?

160
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,310
They are still in the honeymoon phase.

161
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,220
But in the honeymoon phase,

162
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,110
love is usually sweet, not bitter like this.

163
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,830
I changed my mind.

164
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,390
I think they should break up.

165
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,650
Yes, right now.

166
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:58,960
- Break up
- Yes, right now.

167
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,410
I’m sorry.

168
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,310
Let me help you.

169
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,420
It’s okay.

170
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,300
These brochures are for Destiny’s clients.

171
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,710
You should take one.

172
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,080
Sure.

173
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,900
Excuse me. I’m going to have lunch.

174
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,590
Yes.

175
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,870
The line is here.

176
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,140
This side belongs to Destiny.

177
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,070
I’m sorry.

178
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,650
What are you trying to do?

179
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,340
This.

180
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,900
How to be a perfect couple.

181
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,370
I’m trying to do this one.

182
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,200
If you do something wrong,
you need to apologize immediately.

183
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,370
To make things go smoothly between us,

184
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,440
Why don’t we follow the guidelines?

185
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,860
The second one said
we need to do what our partner wants.

186
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,800
That’s right.

187
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,740
I’ll pass.

188
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,500
The third one said

189
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,390
we should spend time alone together.

190
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,480
Shall I go to your condo this evening?

191
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,750
Sure.

192
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,640
Why did you change your mind so quickly?

193
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,280
Because the third one is interesting.

194
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,530
Here.

195
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,090
Don’t you like it?

196
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,510
I like it but…

197
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,840
But you can’t follow only this one.

198
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,610
You need to follow other guidelines as well.

199
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,120
Are you serious about us?

200
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,570
Yes.

201
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:17,910
Fine.

202
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
I’ll follow all the guidelines,

203
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,750
especially the third one.

204
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,860
Spending time together at my condo.

205
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,820
Making cookies?

206
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,380
Yes.

207
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,440
Spending time together.

208
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,270
The green spoon is mine.

209
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,110
The red one is yours.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,660
Do we need to use spoons
that are in the lucky colors?

211
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,620
Yes, it’s for our love.

212
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,220
What are you doing?

213
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:07,980
It tastes good.

214
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,660
No.

215
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,090
Taste it.

216
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,760
No.

217
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,440
Come on.

218
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,130
No.

219
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,730
Try it.

220
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,730
No.
Stop it, Boss.

221
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,200
The sound comes from the television.

222
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,350
How is it turned on?

223
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,660
Let’s check it.

224
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,490
This is strange.

225
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,790
How is it turned on by itself?

226
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,480
[Salt]

227
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,920
Turn it off.

228
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,070
How did the spoon’s position change?

229
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,320
Is there a ghost in your room?

230
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,670
Are you crazy?

231
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,560
I’m the first owner.

232
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,390
I’ve been living here for a long time.

233
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,210
No unusual things have ever happened.

234
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
You probably put it there and forgot.

235
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,130
That’s possible.

236
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,860
Is it ready?

237
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:45,990
Yes.

238
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,900
These are the first cookies that I made.

239
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,960
So I’ll be the first one to taste it.

240
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,220
I made them only for you.

241
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,490
Here. Taste it.

242
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,260
What the hell is this?

243
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,110
Are you sure this is for humans?

244
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,650
I’m not sure if this is cookies or rock salt.

245
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,400
Don’t give it to anyone else

246
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,990
if you don’t want to kill them.

247
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,610
Try it.

248
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,530
Eat it.

249
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,650
What the hell did I just eat?

250
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,620
Jued.

251
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,300
- Jued.
- Get rid of it.

252
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,570
- Jued.
- Get rid of it.

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,710
How is it?

254
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,290
Does it taste good?

255
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,210
[Always say nice things to each other.]

256
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,600
It’s so delicious.

257
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
I almost cried.

258
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,370
This is the tastiest cookie I’ve ever had.

259
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,220
Then you should eat it all.

260
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,430
Come on. I made a lot of it.

261
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,850
Eat it up.

262
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,110
Why are you looking like that?

263
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,950
I cleaned your bathroom.

264
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,090
You are so sweet.

265
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,050
What did the fifth one say?

266
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,370
I don’t know.

267
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,740
Read it yourself.

268
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,120
You read it.

269
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,840
No, you read it.

270
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,200
Then read it together.

271
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,170
5. Always have physical contact.

272
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,990
Where should I touch you?

273
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,300
Here.

274
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,990
Here.

275
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,520
- Here.
- It’s tickling.

276
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,490
Where?

277
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,250
Stop it.

278
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,460
Where? Here?

279
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,340
Boss.

280
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,000
Boss.

281
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,310
Boss.

282
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,480
Where should I touch?

283
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,310
Boss.

284
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,250
Where can I touch?

285
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,960
Boss.

286
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,810
How did the bed break?

287
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,900
You overuse it, do you?

288
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,620
That’s why it’s broken.

289
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,480
How many girls did you take here?

290
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,300
That’s all in the past.

291
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,170
Don’t you want to know how it is broken?

292
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,790
No. How did you use it?

293
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Anyway, I won’t sleep on the bed
you shared with other women.

294
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,000
I’m sorry.

295
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,570
For acting unreasonably yesterday.

296
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,400
I got jealous.

297
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,400
You look cute when you get jealous.

298
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,990
Since we are here.

299
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,220
Let’s buy a new set of furniture.

300
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,030
What style do you like?

301
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,260
It’s your room.

302
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,670
I’ll let you choose it.

303
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,820
How can I do that?

304
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,790
We should pick it together.

305
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,670
From now on,

306
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,100
we will use it together, right?

307
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,010
You’re crazy.

308
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,280
You choose it.

309
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,440
[Lucky color for love for Wednesday]

310
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,570
[Lucky color for love for Tuesday]

311
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,490
I want this bed.

312
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,540
[Lucky color for love for Wednesday]

313
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,750
It’s green.

314
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,400
It’s my lucky color.

315
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,610
But it doesn’t go well with my room.

316
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,230
Let’s use this chance
to redo your interior design.

317
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,700
How?

318
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,040
Decorate your room
with the lucky colors for love.

319
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,130
None of them goes together.

320
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,880
Since it’s my room.

321
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,440
I should choose the decorations.

322
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,050
So it will go with my décor style.

323
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,490
You don’t seem to mind wearing the pin.

324
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,970
The pin is small.

325
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,810
I can look past it.

326
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,770
Look past it?

327
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,140
Yes.

328
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,120
It’s stupid.

329
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,550
Yes, it’s stupid.

330
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,450
But I feel insecure.

331
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,150
What do you want me to do?

332
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,230
They ENDED the product line.

333
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,470
Stop worrying about nonsense stuff.

334
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,180
Can you SPLIT the curtains over there?

335
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,420
Should I stop overthinking,

336
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,420
or should you care about my feelings?

337
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,400
Where should we go after our shift ENDS?

338
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,140
Stop acting unreasonably.

339
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,680
Can you stop calling me unreasonable?

340
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,500
What else do you want me to say,

341
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,800
when you are acting like this?

342
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,340
If you can’t stop calling me that, then…

343
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,810
Mr. FAREWELL,

344
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,250
please come to the bed department.

345
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,280
Shall we call it quits?

346
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,640
How can you say that?

347
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,620
Look at what you said to me earlier.

348
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,780
You should be the one
who looks back on how you behaved.

349
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,130
We started to date not long ago.

350
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,670
But you want to break up over small things.

351
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,530
I did it
because I want our relationship to work.

352
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,310
Have you ever put any effort into it?

353
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,550
Do you not really see my effort?

354
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,840
Okay.

355
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,470
You want to break up?

356
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,990
Let’s break up.

357
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,890
Break Up completed our mission.

358
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,380
Destiny, you can take over now.

359
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,720
Don’t mess it up.

360
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,080
You look down in the dumps.

361
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,740
Why did you come to the college?

362
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,770
What are you doing here?

363
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,700
I’m here to give career counseling
to my juniors.

364
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,310
So I came here
to reminisce about the old days.

365
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,120
Do you remember this room?

366
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,420
You shared the room
with your roommate, Pond.

367
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,800
Pond?

368
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,220
Who is Pond?

369
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,680
Pond, my ex-boyfriend.

370
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,870
Where is Pond?

371
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,060
He told me he was sick.

372
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,110
So I brought medicine for him.

373
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,500
He’s doing fine.

374
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,440
He brought his fling here.

375
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,060
That’s why I’m waiting out here.

376
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Which one?

377
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,170
I don’t know.
I’ve never seen him before.

378
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,440
He always gets new hookups.

379
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,690
He never cares how I would feel.

380
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,710
Then break up with him.

381
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,400
I want to.

382
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,440
But it’s not that easy.

383
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,380
It is easy.

384
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,100
Relationships are fragile.

385
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,800
It sounds abstract.

386
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,390
It’s true.

387
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,650
You don’t believe me?

388
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,190
I’ll show you.

389
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,650
This is Pond’s phone.

390
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,230
He let me borrow it in exchange for his rent.

391
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,800
I miss you so much.

392
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,080
Can you come to see me right now?

393
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,690
What the f*ck?!

394
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,480
What the f*ck is this, b*tch?

395
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,620
Hold on. Are you a foreigner?

396
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,370
That’s not the point.

397
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,090
Who the heck is that?

398
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,460
Who the hell are you guys?

399
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,590
Didn’t you say you love only me?

400
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,770
How could you lie to me?

401
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,280
Everyone, calm down.

402
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,760
Wait. I can explain it.

403
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,370
Hey.

404
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,600
Are you okay?

405
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,940
Let me take a look.

406
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,160
Now, I believe you.

407
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,160
Besides your eyebrows,
relationships are fragile.

408
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,490
I’ll care for your wound.

409
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,830
Right.

410
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,170
Pond, the serial flirter.

411
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,420
It took forever for you to remember him.

412
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,490
After that, we changed
from acquaintances to buddies.

413
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,050
I have become your wound carer ever since.

414
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,650
That’s true.

415
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,330
Every time, I get hurt.
I always come to you.

416
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,330
Where did you get hurt this time?

417
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,180
You can’t care for this wound.

418
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,430
It’s not a physical wound.

419
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,790
It’s an emotional wound.

420
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,210
I broke up with Jued.

421
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,100
The farmer ends up getting hurt by the snake.

422
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,840
Yes.

423
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,260
It hurts.

424
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,890
It really hurts.

425
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,480
I get it.

426
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,750
But I want to tell you something.

427
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,680
If you give me a chance,

428
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,300
Maybe I can help heal this wound for you.

429
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,130
Boss, I…

430
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,800
I’ve had a crush on you for a long time.

431
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,060
Though many people despise or dislike you,

432
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,030
I’m always by your side.

433
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,670
I’m waiting for you to turn to me,

434
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,790
and give me a chance.

435
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,420
Can you do that?

436
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,290
Let me heal this wound for you.

437
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,590
Oat.

438
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,960
I love you too.

439
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,410
But…

440
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,960
I can’t let you heal this wound.

441
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,150
The love I have for you,

442
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,560
It’s not the same feelings you have for me.

443
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,510
If you don’t feel the same way,

444
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,370
then let me go.

445
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,810
I will never let you go.

446
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,340
Because you are the only friend I have.

447
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,640
Whatever wound I get,

448
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,140
I still want you to care for it.

449
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,130
Are you okay?

450
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,250
No.

451
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,320
But I accept it.

452
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,820
What about you?

453
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,240
Can you now accept it?

454
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,360
Accept what?

455
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,580
Accept that what you believe is wrong.

456
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,430
Relationships are not that fragile.

457
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,830
Look at our relationship.

458
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,230
It’s so strong that it cannot be changed.

459
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,730
You should strengthen your relationship
with Jued to be strong like ours.

460
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,060
Is it really possible?

461
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,890
Of course.

462
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,050
Our relationship is proof.

463
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,830
You should go, the foolish farmer.

464
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Go see your snake.

465
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,360
I’m leaving.

466
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,530
That’s enough.

467
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,490
You can stop now.

468
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,610
I want to cancel the mission.

469
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,580
I don’t want it anymore.

470
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,630
Can you give us a minute?

471
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,360
I need to inform Destiny first.

472
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,870
Hello.

473
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,770
Yes.

474
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,370
Yes.

475
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,390
Yes.

476
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,590
If that’s what you want,

477
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,840
We will cancel it.

478
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,800
No problem.

479
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,280
It’s okay.

480
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,010
But I don’t think Break Up Service will cancel it.

481
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,900
Why?

482
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,980
Their mission is no longer operating
based on your request.

483
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,890
It’s driven by their resentment.

484
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,580
Hey!

485
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,020
Where is my bike?

486
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,650
The sound from the television?

487
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,910
How is it turned on?

488
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,770
How did the spoon’s position change?

489
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,020
How did the bed break?

490
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,980
Stop acting unreasonably.

491
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,820
Where should we go after our shift ENDS?

492
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,140
If you can’t stop calling me that,

493
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,290
Shall we call it quits?

494
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,370
We got a smoking gun photo.

495
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,210
It’ll be the final nail in the coffin
for Boss and Jued’s relationship.

496
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,150
Can I push the send button?

497
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,970
No. I want to do it.

498
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,630
Let’s do it together.

499
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,410
Fine.

500
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,460
Boss.

501
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,660
Jued left the keycard for you.

502
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,670
Where is she?

503
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,820
She got her stuff and left.

504
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,600
Tee.

505
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,030
I’ll give you directions to my old apartment.

506
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,480
Can you give me a ride there?

507
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,000
(Sorry. The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at this time.)

508
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,620
(Sorry. The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at this time.)

509
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,760
Put it here too.

510
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,460
It’s not December yet.

511
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,270
But I want to celebrate Christmas already.

512
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,040
We’re the only one who wants to celebrate.

513
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,650
The other company seems to…

514
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,790
have no holiday spirit.

515
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,710
It’s probably because their mission has failed.

516
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,950
Wait and see our next mission.

517
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,770
Did you have a plan for how to handle Boss?

518
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,370
He probably figures out what is going on.

519
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,220
Boss.

520
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,760
I…

521
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,100
I want to hire Destiny

522
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,660
to fix my relationship with Jued.

523
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,500
Aren’t you going to ask
why the company did that?

524
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,570
Then what?

525
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,460
In the end, it was our decision to break up.

526
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,250
Now, you get it, right?

527
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,090
How hard it is to make a relationship work.

528
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,740
Because it’s hard.

529
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,690
That’s why I’m hiring you.

530
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,550
I’m impressed that you came to me for help.

531
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,480
It shows how much you value this relationship.

532
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,260
Jued must be very important to you.

533
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,170
You see that Chan and I did it.

534
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,150
Because we followed your advice.

535
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,450
You are the one who ruins it.

536
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,190
You need to fix it yourself.

537
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,790
I want to resign from the company.

538
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,430
Do you remember?

539
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,430
Why did I hire you?

540
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,100
To keep an eye on the bad guy.

541
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,680
Yes.

542
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,820
To keep an eye on him.

543
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,280
So he wouldn’t resign from the company.

544
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,780
You have no qualifications
to work at Break Up Service.

545
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,180
Especially your soft-heartedness.

546
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,150
You always want to fix everything,
including relationships.

547
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,670
I’m sorry.

548
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,420
You don’t need to apologize.

549
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,260
I’m not criticizing you.

550
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,870
I just don’t get it.

551
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,930
You like to fix other people’s relationships.

552
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,060
But why have you never tried
to fix your relationship?

553
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,410
Hello.

554
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,610
Hello. Is this Oat?

555
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,030
This is him speaking.

556
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,880
Oat, this is Jued.

557
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,880
I…

558
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,250
I got a photo of you and Boss…

559
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,980
kissing.

560
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,040
I called to ask you about it.

561
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,790
Good.

562
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,800
I have something to tell you.

563
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,760
I’ve had a crush on him for a long time.

564
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,400
But he didn’t feel the same way.

565
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,180
Because he already gave his heart…

566
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,670
to you.

567
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,330
Jued.

568
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,670
I’ve known him for a long time.

569
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,510
I saw him dating dozens of girls.

570
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,140
But I never saw him sad
because of a breakup.

571
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,910
But this time,

572
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,000
He looks really sad after losing you.

573
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,150
Thank you.

574
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,350
Honey.

575
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,010
I think our missions are going to fail.

576
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,240
Both of us.

577
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,150
The Boss-Jued-Oat case
will be our first mission,

578
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,660
after the merger of

579
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,520
Break Up Service and Destiny.

580
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,460
Wait.

581
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,720
I’m against

582
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,440
the plan to break up Jued and Boss.

583
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,570
Me too.

584
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,470
They are our coworkers.

585
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,280
It’s also against Destiny’s principles.

586
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,520
Because they are our coworkers.

587
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,620
We can’t let Jued date a bad guy.

588
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,990
But I heard Jued dated a bad guy before.

589
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,090
That’s not the point.

590
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,310
It doesn’t matter
whether Boss is a good or bad guy,

591
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,420
he is the man that Jued chose.

592
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,060
That’s the key point.

593
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,490
They chose to be together.

594
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,820
Every relationship has problems.

595
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,500
We can just give them a poke
and see how they will react.

596
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,080
Those who want to break up,

597
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,110
they will call it quits.

598
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,800
But those who want to make it work,

599
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,760
they will get through it.

600
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,090
They will also get to know each other better.

601
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,400
In the end,

602
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,300
what will they choose,

603
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,710
It’s up to them

604
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,320
I want to go to exercise.

605
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,520
Where should I go to exercise?

606
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,790
You should go to the park.

607
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,310
The park near our office.

608
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,720
Okay. I’m going to the park.

609
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,510
Thank you.

610
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,550
Damn. He knows how to say thank you.

611
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,530
Mr. Chan…

612
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,750
What? The bad guy is at the park.

613
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,130
Is he really at the park?

614
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,530
Then I should go to the park.

615
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,820
I need to hurry.

616
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,000
He’s at the park, right?

617
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,880
I need to go to the park right now.

618
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,230
That’s right. Okay.

619
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,540
At the park.

620
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,820
At the park.

621
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,060
I’m sorry.

622
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,730
The area is under construction.

623
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,930
You need to use another route.

624
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,700
I’m sorry.

625
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,870
We did it.

626
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,190
This is where we first met, right?

627
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,310
I’m sorry.

628
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,260
I’m sorry that I didn’t care about your feelings.

629
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,280
I’m sorry too.

630
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,570
For overthinking about small problems.

631
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,650
We might not be a perfect couple
like in the brochure.

632
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,730
Sometimes, we fight.

633
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,330
Sometimes, we get along well.

634
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,620
Sometimes, we disagree.

635
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,340
Our values are totally different.

636
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,410
But we feel the same way.
That should be enough.

637
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,110
Yes.

638
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,890
Otherwise, we wouldn’t come back
to where we started.

(We have our own principles.)

651
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,290

from personal feelings.)

It’s so warm.

655
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,360
I need to use the toilet.

656
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,770

Are you Oat?

666
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:33,840
Yes.

667
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,220
I’m a client of Break Up Service.

668
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,990
Boss told me to come to you
to get my wound treated.

669
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,620

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,260
