1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,380
For me, getting a good job
is like finding good love.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,760
I can go anywhere with her
without feeling embarrassed.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,570
Unlike you, I only feel sorry for you.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,870
You can’t blame that he did this
because he is that kind of person.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,410
You should blame love.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,110
It’s too fragile and vulnerable.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,340
Go here to apply for a job.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,950
So you can find money to pay him back.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,800
Or you will finally see the true nature of love.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,980
Excuse me.

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,470
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,180
My strong point is that I’m enduring.

14
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,870
I learned it from my family.

15
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,900
I’m good at handling difficult situations.

16
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,550
I can endure pressure as much as deep-sea fish.

17
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,910
You said those lines
as if you knew them by heart.

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,390
How many job interviews did you have?

19
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,550
Two?

20
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,430
Twenty.

21
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,340
This is my twenty-first job interview.

22
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,320
Let’s get to the point.

23
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,220
What do you think love is?

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,210
Love?

25
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,940
Yes, love.

26
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,170
Love is beautiful.

27
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,720
You can go to your next job interview.

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,660
Listen. Don’t be discouraged.

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,110
Your qualifications are not the reason
I don’t offer you the job.

30
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,710
You look like a very good person.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,650
Why does a good person like you
apply for a job here?

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,760
Someone gave me this business card.

33
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,210
Did you find it on the street?

34
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,290
No, he gave it to me.

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,120
He was probably drunk
and scattered his business cards.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,920
He wasn’t drunk. He gave it to me only.

37
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,260
He must have given you the wrong card.

38
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,570
No.

39
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,010
He told me to apply for a job at the company.

40
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,510
What?!

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,210
And you believe him?

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,870
Are you out of your mind?

43
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,620
I don’t think so.

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,210
Oh my goodness.

45
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,530
Come in.

46
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,910
What are you looking at?

47
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,700
Follow me.

48
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,970
I’m Nut.

49
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,640
My name is Nuttapon.

50
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,170
You don’t need to call me by that name.

51
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,280
You can just call me Nut.

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,760
I’m the general manager.

53
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,160
Everyone here has a clearly assigned role.

54
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,640
This is the coordinator team.

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,230
Their job is to support the operation teams.

56
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,170
Those are Team A and Team B.

57
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,590
That’s Ying.

58
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,350
She’s a customer relations officer.

59
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,120
You may seem important to him.

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,540
But actually, you are just his side piece.

61
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,830
I recommend that you break up with him.

62
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,350
You should break up with him. Trust me.

63
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,190
That’s Joy. She’s a sales promotion officer.

64
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,740
If you don’t like confrontation,
we have a breakup agent to do it for you.

65
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,900
At the back is Tee.

66
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,940
He helps monitor situations.

67
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,060
Team B, this is a good moment to flirt with him.

68
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,230
To be honest,

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,370
it’s not right to say they help both teams.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,150
Mostly, only Team B needs their help.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,670
So they are technically members of Team B.

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,810
Do you understand everything that I say?

73
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,940
Do you have any questions?

74
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,750
Are you offering me a job?

75
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,900
About that,

76
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,960
you need to ask the man upstairs.

77
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,430
Okay.

78
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,790
I hire you.

79
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,650
What?

80
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,810
I’m Chan, CEO of Break Up Service.

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,690
We are working like a family.

82
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,690
The office is actually my house.

83
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,470
I’ll explain your responsibilities.

84
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,860
Can I do my chores while doing that?

85
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,050
My helper took a leave today.

86
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,310
The work here is not complicated.

87
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,870
Your job is to break up couples
beyond the point of return.

88
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,680
Break up couples?

89
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,010
Doesn’t that make me a bad person?

90
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,970
But the money is good.

91
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,150
Last year,
I gave a 6-month bonus to my employees.

92
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,650
Your name is Chued, right?

93
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,680
It’s Jued.

94
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,700
Jued, can you put it in my closet?

95
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,300
The closet over there.

96
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,520
Thank you.

97
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,080
Are you sure it’s ironed?

98
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, it looks ironed enough for me.

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,680
If you want to work here,

100
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,930
your duty must come before your morals.

101
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,940
If you are concerned about being a bad person,

102
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,180
don’t be.

103
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,100
Because your real job is
to keep an eye on a bad guy.

104
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
A bad guy?

105
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,390
He is a bad guy.

106
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,480
Unfortunately,
he’s very important to our company.

107
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,700
He helped me found the company.

108
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,530
I don’t know what got into him lately.

109
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,400
He wants to resign from the company.

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,400
I want you to keep an eye on him
so he won’t be distracted.

111
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,350
Who is the bad guy
you want me to keep an eye on?

112
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,900
Boss.

113
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,920
Why did you call me here?

114
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,680
Come to meet your partner.

115
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,330
I told you Team A can work effectively alone.

116
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,550
I don’t need a partner to be my burden.

117
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,610
If you work alone, you can’t call it a team.

118
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,510
You need at least two members to call it a team.

119
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,020
You’d better get to know each other.

120
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,520
It’s okay, Mr. Chan.

121
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,670
You can assign me to Team B.

122
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,070
I’m good at working as a team.

123
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,600
So I won’t be a burden to Team A.

124
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,830
Calm down and come here.

125
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,920
Both of you, sit down so we can talk.

126
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you know
he’s never given his business card to anyone?

127
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
You are the first one.

128
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,710
But I…

129
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,010
No, let me rephrase it.

130
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,820
You can be the first employee
who gets a bonus in their first year of working.

131
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,030
I’ll do it.

132
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,100
But I…

133
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,600
What?

134
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,720
Are you saying that this is not your business card?

135
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,800
I told her to apply for other positions,

136
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,630
not my partner.

137
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,120
You gave her your business card.

138
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,230
It means you have some feelings for her.

139
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,670
Are you going to deny it?

140
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
If it’s so, I won’t hire her.

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,030
Yes, he has.

142
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,770
I accepted his card while of sound mind.

143
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,340
Hey, you!

144
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,310
Okay.

145
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,850
Alright, you are Team A.

146
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,610
You two are a perfect match.

147
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,080
You can begin your work right away.

148
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,430
Boss, where should I sit?

149
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,750
You bought it only for yourself?

150
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,740
What about us?

151
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,690
It’s my money.

152
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,950
It’s her secret to stay healthy.

153
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,920
Of course, we have a new girl in the office.

154
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,960
I can’t lose to her.

155
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,810
Look at the result.

156
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,200
I should try drinking it too.

157
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,400
Yes, try it.

158
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,200
Nut, do you have a desk and a chair for me?

159
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Who bought it?

160
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,350
Ying. Joy.

161
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,780
Do you know where can I get a desk…

162
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,550
Do you have any left?

163
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,050
It’s delicious.

164
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,190
Who bought it?

165
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,070
It looks good.

166
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,860
He’s gone.

167
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,800
Come here.

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
Have a seat.

169
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,210
My goodness.

170
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,040
Are you okay?

171
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,660
Don’t you hate me?

172
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,160
Huh?

173
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,990
Why would we hate you?

174
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,250
We all feel sorry for you.

175
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,130
You’re a new graduate.

176
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,760
You have a bright future waiting ahead.

177
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,950
That’s right.

178
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,310
You shouldn’t end up with a guy like Boss.

179
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,280
What do you mean?

180
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,630
Boss doesn’t give a damn about anyone.

181
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,380
It’s so pretty.

182
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,250
It’s cute.

183
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,770
Nonsense.

184
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,680
He’s such a contrarian.

185
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,000
There are options for our New Year party.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let’s vote.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,970
I like rivers.

188
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,380
I want to wear a bikini. Let’s go to the beach.

189
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,530
I never saw you put in this much effort
when working.

190
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,040
He always kills the mood.

191
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,760
But no one can do anything to him.

192
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,860
He’s not only the co-founder.

193
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,700
But he always quickly completes his missions.

194
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,980
The success rate is 100 percent.

195
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,730
[80,000 baht is transferred to your account.]

196
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,990
His plan is cost-effective.

197
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,220
He can do everything by himself.

198
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,730
But there’s one thing we can do
to get back at him.

199
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,020
That is…

200
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,750
we can ignore him.

201
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,530
Ignore him.

202
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,520
You need to ignore him.

203
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,090
Don’t pay attention to him.

204
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,400
Ignore him.

205
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,290
Oh.

206
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,080
Are you okay?

207
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,180
You must be shocked.

208
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,150
Breathe.

209
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,910
Should I call an ambulance?

210
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,850
Inhale.

211
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,380
Exhale.

212
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,760
You must be scared.

213
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,660
It’s like ‘The Farmer and the Snake’.

214
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,940
I spared her life

215
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,900
but she was ungrateful and turned against me.

216
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,830
Why did the farmer give her his business card?

217
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,350
The snake was hanging by a thread.

218
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,530
I felt bad for her.

219
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,230
Wait.

220
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,750
Did I hear it right?

221
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,740
You know how to feel bad for others?

222
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,860
Do you want to be a good person?

223
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,730
Let’s call it a mistake.

224
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
Don’t try to play it cool.

225
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,580
You are shy, aren’t you?

226
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,230
You saved the snake from freezing to death.

227
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,360
You showed a sign of being a good person.

228
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,820
This gives me chills.

229
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,340
Fine.

230
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,090
I’ll give the snake even worse chills.

231
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,860
Hello.

232
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,630
You got a chair.

233
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,380
For the things I did, don’t take it personally.

234
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,330
I forgot that you are a new graduate.

235
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,270
I’ll walk you through your work.

236
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,650
Nut, tell me the details of today’s case.

237
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,860
(What’s wrong with him?)

238
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,670
The targets are Best and First.

239
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,430
One, two, three, up, down, up.

240
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,720
(First is a young and handsome fitness trainer.)

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
Come on, everyone. One, two three.

242
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,670
(Best is a beautiful yoga teacher
with a flawless figure.)

243
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,080
(They met on a dating app.)

244
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,130
(They both are fitness enthusiasts.)

245
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,050
(After they started dating,)

246
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,510
(they turned their passion into a business
by opening a fitness center named ‘Best Things First’.)

247
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,370
(They also have a TikTok account
with the same name.)

248
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,710
(They are known as
a perfect couple on TikTok.)

249
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,420
(This is the couple you need to break up.)

250
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,330
Why?

251
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,530
They look good together.

252
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,490
We should be happy for them.

253
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
Many people admire them.

254
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,530
But many also can’t stand them.

255
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,450
Those are sick.

256
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,030
Deduct ten points.

257
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,380
Miss Jinsiree has a negative attitude
towards our work.

258
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,880
For us, our duty must come before our morals.

259
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,600
What are you doing?

260
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,890
I’m evaluating your performance.

261
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,330
But you haven’t trained me to do the work.

262
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,910
I am evaluating you as I train you.

263
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,040
If your score is lower than the cut-off point,
you will fail probation.

264
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,930
I will need to let you go to work…

265
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,390
somewhere else.

266
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,500
I think you’ll need it.

267
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,800
Alright.

268
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,680
[I’m watching you while you’re watching him.]

269
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,710
Come up with a plan for how we get in.

270
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:33,910
Keep it down.

271
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,540
Miss, what are you doing?

272
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,540
Oh.

273
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,070
Hello.

274
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,160
If you want to use our fitness center,
feel free to contact me.

275
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,440
We offer a one-day trial.

276
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,080
Bag storage is available.

277
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,000
You don’t need to crawl in.

278
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,020
Thank you.

279
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,210
You have no tactical thinking at work.

280
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Deduct ten points.

281
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,570
He’s our target.

282
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,750
You need to get close to him as much as possible.

283
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,030
So I can take photos to make his girlfriend jealous.

284
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,980
Are we really going to do this?

285
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,900
If you don’t want to do it…

286
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,480
I’ll do it.

287
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,390
Go.

288
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,510
Good. One more.

289
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,500
Okay, you can let it go.

290
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,100
Let it go.

291
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,410
Okay, you can follow my instructions.

292
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,900
Let’s set up a schedule for our next training.

293
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:56,980
Excuse me.

294
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,780
Hello.

295
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,390
Hello.

296
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,910
Can you show me how to use this equipment?

297
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,150
Sure.

298
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,720
Why don’t you try to pull the weight first?

299
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,750
If it’s too heavy, I’ll change it.

300
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,850
It’s too heavy.

301
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,730
Okay.

302
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,920
First, let’s adjust your posture.

303
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,660
When you use the machine.

304
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,560
You stand in this direction.

305
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,810
Lift your chest.

306
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,450
Pull it down.

307
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,280
Your arm will touch your chest.

308
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,580
Okay. That’s right.

309
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,650
Try to pull it again with one hand.

310
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,200
Shit.

311
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,530
I’m sorry.

312
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,590
I’m sorry.

313
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,850
It’s okay.

314
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,750
I think this machine is not right for you.

315
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,770
I’ll find another machine for you.

316
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,340
I got the picture.

317
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,940
Really?

318
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,740
When Best sees it, she will go nuts.

319
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,190
You made a mistake again.

320
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,620
Wait.

321
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,020
Give me another chance.

322
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,210
I’ll befriend the girlfriend.

323
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,180
You can leave your belongings at the back.

324
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,270
Get your yoga mattress.

325
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,180
Warm up your body.

326
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,310
Inhale and lift your arms slowly.

327
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,960
Put your hands together.

328
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,750
Look up at your hands.

329
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,280
Stay still in this position.

330
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,250
Good.

331
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,750
Great. Turn a bit this way.

332
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,110
You were in the right position earlier.

333
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,220
Really?

334
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,110
I don’t remember it.

335
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,360
Can you help me?

336
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,150
Whose phone is that?

337
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,450
Why didn’t you turn on the silent mode?

338
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,750
Why don’t you go answer the phone?

339
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,700
I’m sorry.

340
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,110
What, Boss?

341
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,660
Nothing. I called to check
if you successfully befriended her.

342
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,680
I’m working on it.

343
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,780
I’m hanging up.

344
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,480
What?

345
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,370
You sounded upset earlier.

346
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,950
Deduct ten points.

347
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,180
Why do you keep calling me?

348
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,190
I called to ask
if you’re keeping an eye on him.

349
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,410
Why are you mad at me?

350
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,140
Darn it.

351
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,960
I’m sorry, Mr. Chan.

352
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,570
I am keeping an eye on him.

353
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,070
I got to go.

354
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,870
Fine.

355
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,340
Move your feet a bit further.

356
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,300
Good.

357
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,170
Don’t forget to exhale.

358
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,700
Miss Best.

359
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,900
This position is hard.

360
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,050
Can you help me?

361
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,200
Wait a second.

362
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,140
I’ll help you.

363
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,910
It’s okay.

364
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,880
It’s not a big deal.

365
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,100
You, jerk.

366
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,290
Act disrespectful.

367
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,130
Deduct ten points.

368
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,170
How is your back?

369
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,630
My back…

370
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,990
it’s…

371
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
It’s fine.

372
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,140
But I have something to ask you.

373
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,150
Can we talk?

374
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,900
I have an errand to do. Excuse me.

375
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,890
It won’t take long.

376
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,600
I prepared a chicken breast smoothie.

377
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,740
I watched your TikTok channel
and saw that you like it.

378
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,460
It’s okay. I have mine.

379
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,400
Excuse me.

380
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,290
I prepared it for you. Please take it.

381
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,730
It’s really okay.

382
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,550
Please take it.

383
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,620
I said it’s okay.

384
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,110
But I want to give it to you.

385
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,160
- I prepared it for…
- I said it’s okay.

386
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,180
I’m sorry. I’m in a hurry.

387
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,510
Your kindness is enough for me.

388
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,600
You keep insisting like that.

389
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,890
It’s no surprise she’s scared.

390
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,650
You are so useless.

391
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,190
I’ll give you another chance.

392
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,400
Let’s move on to the next plan.

393
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,650
Let’s give it a try.

394
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,850
If she’s back, you can continue the training.

395
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,610
People usually reveal their secrets
while talking with their friends.

396
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,440
This is a bug device.

397
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,340
You need to place it under the counter.

398
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,630
There are many of them.

399
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,710
How can I put the device there?

400
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,980
Fail to follow an order.

401
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,800
This is a serious error.

402
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,840
Can’t you train me properly?

403
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,550
Do you really think I am training you?

404
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,780
Can’t you see that I’m trying to get rid of you?

405
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,500
I don’t want a lousy partner like you.

406
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,390
If I knew you would become my burden,

407
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,370
I wouldn’t have helped you.

408
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,340
You can’t do a simple task of planting a bug?

409
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,000
I guess this is your first and last case.

410
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,990
If you are that weak,
you should resign from the company.

411
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,160
Excuse me.

412
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,590
Can I have a brochure of your courses?

413
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,840
Sure.

414
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,570
Here.

415
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,400
Thank you.

416
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,310
Okay.

417
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,960
I gave it back to save the world.

418
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,970
I made it.

419
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,980
Can you give me extra points?

420
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,850
No.

421
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,370
It was so funny.

422
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,370
Last time, a customer ate durian in our gym.

423
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,970
Yes, I smelled it too.

424
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,480
It was so stinky.

425
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,520
We’ve been listening to them for some time
but we didn’t get any…

426
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,020
Shh!

427
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,760
Why aren’t you doing any live streaming lately?

428
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,310
Your followers are asking about it.

429
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,290
I don’t know what’s going on with Best.

430
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,690
She always disappears right after her class.

431
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,390
I don’t know where she goes.

432
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,230
Is she seeing another man?

433
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,580
Nonsense.

434
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,090
She doesn’t have anyone.

435
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,740
She has an amazing boyfriend like me.

436
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,790
You’re cool.

437
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,060
I agree with you.

438
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,900
She doesn’t see anyone else.

439
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,120
Wait here.

440
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,700
I’m sorry.

441
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,610
It’s okay.

442
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,660
Did you steal her car key?

443
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,520
No, I just borrowed it.

444
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,130
I’ll give it back to her.

445
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,330
Get in the car.

446
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,530
You, check the backseat.

447
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,470
I’ll check the front seats.

448
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,830
Not only the borrowing skills,

449
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,850
but there are many skills you need to learn.

450
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,370
You need to use all the skills you have.

451
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,180
Such as…

452
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,690
Sniffing skills.

453
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,130
I’m not calling you a sniffer dog, Buddy.

454
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,670
I mean Boss.

455
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,940
Tell me what scent you smell.

456
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,410
A cool scent.

457
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,840
I think it’s a car freshener.

458
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,620
And a luxurious flower scent.

459
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,300
I think it’s her perfume.

460
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,870
And a sweet fruity scent.

461
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,300
Isn’t that your perfume?

462
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,640
I’m right.

463
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,070
Remember this. A scent can cause a rift.

464
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,320
When people suspect their partner is cheating,

465
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,830
they usually sniff for perfume scent on the clothes.

466
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,390
What?

467
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,950
Why do you look stunned?

468
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,480
I’m not stunned.

469
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,980
I’m just surprised that you are training me for real.

470
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,230
I smell something suspicious.

471
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,220
Follow me.

472
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,530
Next is your job.

473
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,310
First, can we talk?

474
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,220
I’m sorry.

475
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,140
It’s almost time for me to do live streaming.

476
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,240
If you have any questions,

477
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,710
I’ll have a trainer help you.

478
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,260
First, don’t you want to know
why Best often disappears after her class?

479
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,740
Roeng, where is First?

480
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,220
I don’t know.

481
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,590
But we are late for the live streaming.

482
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Can you do it alone in the meantime?

483
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,310
Let’s do that.

484
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,720
Ready?

485
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,370
Three, two.

486
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,550
I’ll greet you guys first.

487
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,890
Do we have many viewers?

488
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:56,820
The number is increasing.

489
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,880
Hello.

490
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,680
Today, I’m going to answer the question
that many people have asked.

491
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,980
What is the best way to lose fat?

492
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,950
First is here.

493
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,950
Shall we punish him for being late
by having him answer the question?

494
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,000
Honey, what is the best way to lose fat?

495
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,520
Did you tell him?

496
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
Yes, Boss.

497
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,080
Stop eating high-calorie foods that you’re eating.

498
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,000
Now, you know how to play jokes.

499
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I’m not joking.

500
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,910
I know that you like to eat this.

501
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,290
I found it in her trunk.

502
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,920
(The fitness idol couple will be over,)

503
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,120
(if people find out
they don’t eat only chicken breast smoothies.)

504
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,090
(But she secretly eats durian every day.)

505
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,110
Nonsense.

506
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,240
I like durian?

507
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:15,940
See?

508
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,630
This is why I often get a durian smell in the gym.

509
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,020
You use a perfume and a diffuser in your class.

510
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,060
Yes, I love durian.

511
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
I hate chicken breast smoothies.

512
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,380
I like high-calorie foods.

513
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,070
That’s why I work out.

514
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,670
Can’t I do that?

515
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,800
If I do that, I’m not a fitness enthusiast?

516
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,670
You disappoint me.

517
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,670
I knew if you found out,

518
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,020
you wouldn’t forgive me.

519
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,700
So I guess it’s over between us.

520
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,520
Wait.

521
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,760
I’m not finished.

522
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,170
I am mad

523
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,980
because I heard it from someone else.

524
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,690
Not from you.

525
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,350
What do you mean?

526
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,340
Aren’t you mad at me?

527
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,800
I was mad at first. I admit it.

528
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,630
But someone told me to try to understand you.

529
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,780
I told you to show him the durian.

530
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,160
What did you say to him?

531
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,160
I just told him what I thought.

532
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,300
How could she do this to me?

533
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,840
This is against our slogan.

534
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,690
She did it because she loves you very much.

535
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,350
She secretly ate durian in her car.

536
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,170
She wasn’t happy about it.

537
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,190
If you love each other,

538
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,160
you should make each other feel at ease.

539
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,750
I’m sorry.

540
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,820
All this time,

541
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,300
it must have been hard for you

542
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,120
to hide it from me.

543
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,160
So it won’t bother me.

544
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,770
You don’t need to do it anymore.

545
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,070
You can be yourself.

546
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,530
I’m sorry, honey.

547
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,110
They are a perfect couple.

548
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,340
They shouldn’t break up
over a small thing like this.

549
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,530
But this is our job.

550
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,700
I don’t agree with you.

551
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,380
Fine.

552
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,530
If you can’t separate work from personal feelings,

553
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,400
you should quit this job.

554
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,660
Why did you throw my stuff away?

555
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,830
I told you that I don’t like diffusers.

556
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,300
Diffusers smell better than your sweat.

557
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,750
Have you ever smelled yourself?

558
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,970
Do you know how stinky you are?

559
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,380
Are you talking down to me?

560
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,630
What’s wrong with my sweat?

561
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,500
It smells better than the durian you eat.

562
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
It’s so stinky.

563
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,290
Durian smell is better than
your stinky chicken breast smoothies.

564
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,140
What about your eye-searing neon clothes?

565
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,420
Why? The color goes well with our gym’s theme.

566
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,510
Unlike your outfit,

567
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,940
its color is too blended with the furniture.

568
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,170
Another thing, I don’t like the name of our gym.

569
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,500
Why does your name come before mine?

570
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,000
What?

571
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,450
Did you say our names go well together?

572
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,790
It didn’t matter whose name came first.

573
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,930
I used to think that.

574
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,390
But not anymore.

575
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,190
How can you do this?

576
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,160
You did it first.

577
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,910
You threw my stuff away.

578
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,750
I told you that I don’t like diffusers.

579
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,300
Diffusers don’t go well with a fitness center.

580
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,640
They make people feel sleepy.

581
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,000
You can say it nicely.

582
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,490
(How was your first mission with the snake?)

583
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,660
The snake?

584
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,290
She’s still alive.

585
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,910
But she was at death’s door.

586
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,510
She didn’t follow the company’s rules.

587
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,780
She had no tactical thinking.

588
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,940
She was disrespectful.

589
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,440
She was predictable.

590
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,870
[Performance evaluation form]
Yesterday, my friend told me

591
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,780
she failed the probation and got fired.

592
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,650
Her boss was terrible.

593
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,660
He’s so cruel.

594
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,390
That’s right.

595
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,420
She was fired.

596
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,350
He’s gone.

597
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,820
He will definitely fire me.

598
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,210
It’s okay.

599
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,580
I’ll write you a good recommendation letter.

600
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,210
Her letter is the best.

601
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,680
You can get a job at another company.

602
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,180
That’s right.

603
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,790
When Boss is out of your life,

604
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,310
your life will be better.

605
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,420
Thank you, everyone.

606
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,710
I will never forget lovely coworkers like you guys.

607
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,680
Are you crazy?

608
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,160
Who are your coworkers?

609
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,570
We are…

610
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,970
your family.

611
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,030
I’m your father.

612
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,030
And your mother.

613
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,060
You’re my daughter.

614
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,290
Hey!

615
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,090
She can’t get fired.

616
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,930
You.

617
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:58,710
Come here.

618
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,490
But I discovered something unexpected.

619
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,020
I think…

620
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,790
I’m going to give the snake another chance.

621
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,550
Are you accepting me as your partner?

622
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,840
Though our mission is accomplished,

623
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,670
If you disobey my order again,

624
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,340
I’ll tell Mr. Chan to fire you.

625
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,910
I won’t do it again.

626
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,880
Thank you, Boss.

627
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,140
The snake has some skills that I don’t.

628
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,840
She was born to destroy relationships just like me.

629
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,000
If you love each other,

630
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,790
you should make each other feel at ease.

631
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,420
You don’t need to do it anymore.

632
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,740
You can be yourself.

633
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,530
Since you said what’s on your mind, I’ll do it too.

634
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,150
The durian smell is not that bad.

635
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,280
But can you tone down the diffuser scent?

636
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,410
It makes me feel sleepy.

637
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,210
I need to use the diffusers

638
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,300
because your sweat stinks.

639
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,030
What’s wrong with my sweat?

640
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,570
It smells better than the durian you eat.

641
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,030
I won’t endure it anymore.

642
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,820
If you can’t bear each other,
then don’t be together.

643
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,400
Let’s break up.

644
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,980
Fine. Let’s break up.

645
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,110
(Are you interested in the snake?)

646
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,290
Interested? No way.

647
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,850
Come on. Let’s go have a drink.

648
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,420
Wow!

649
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,360
Thank you, Boss, for letting me stay here.

650
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,830
I will never forget your kindness.

651
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,590
I’m not letting you stay here.

652
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,630
I sent you here to work.

653
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,650
If I successfully wrap up the case,

654
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,510
can you rent it to me at a special rate?

655
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,560
Wait.

656
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,260
Oops! My hands are full.

657
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,640
Can you pick it up for me?

658
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,810
Hey.

659
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:23,880
Hey!

660
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,900
I need to fine you 500 baht
for causing a mess in the elevator.

661
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,750
You’re now on his radar,

662
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,070
he will never let you go near Mocha.
