1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,660
Your next mission.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,290
You need to break up those two.

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,910
I’ll give you a bonus worth one million baht.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,590
I’m in Pranburi.

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,290
My goodness.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,640
If the situation doesn’t look good,

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,010
Destiny Wedding can help you.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,960
I’m sorry for being late, President.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,140
I’m the owner of Destiny,

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,970
your business competitor.

11
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,710
We suspected that
an insider sent our information to Destiny.

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,570
It might be true.

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,790
Jued will work with Team A.

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,250
We break up Kesorn and Stephen
before their wedding tomorrow.

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,520
If we can’t do what we said,

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,020
there will no longer be Team A of Break Up Service.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,150
Dad.

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,400
Do you want me to use this
to make up with your mom?

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,900
Why did you show your mom
my receipt from a strip club?

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,390
It’s your fault that I have to leave.

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,910
Mom.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,270
It’s over.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,640
There’s nothing you can do about it.

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,670
(Relationships are so fragile.)

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,770
(Once you ruin it.)

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,940
(There’s no way to fix it back.)

27
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,570
(Never.)

28
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,340
Jued will work with Team A.

29
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,950
We will break up Kesorn and Stephen
before their wedding tomorrow.

30
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,920
If we can’t do what we said,

31
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,050
there will no longer be
Team A of Break Up Service.

32
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,110
Are you saying if you fail to break them up
before the wedding,

33
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,870
Team A and Boss…

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
will resign from the company?

35
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,750
Yes.

36
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,040
Okay.

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
That’s fair enough.

38
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,940
Boss, I don’t want things to go that far.

39
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,610
I opened this company because of you.

40
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,610
This is also a high stake for me.

41
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
You’re looking for trouble.

42
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,470
But it’s okay.

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,160
If you’re willing to take that risk,

44
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,570
then let’s do that.

45
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,930
Team A, let’s go.

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,650
Didn’t you say we were family?

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,320
I’m sorry, Boss and Jued.

48
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,810
I’m not ready to lose my job now.

49
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,630
I still have bills to pay.

50
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,410
Is there anyone else who wants to join them?

51
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,030
I do.

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,460
Don’t.

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,760
This mission is for me and Jued.

54
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,930
It’s none of your business.

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,250
Didn’t you say you would leave me alone?

56
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,910
Why are you helping me?

57
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,750
If I didn’t help you,

58
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,440
You would have been ganked.

59
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,220
I told you not to mess with Rose.

60
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,840
See what happened?

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,040
Instead of catching a mole,

62
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,380
you are ambushed by a snake.

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,760
But you don’t need
to take responsibility for it.

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,280
Boss, I feel even worse
when you’re doing this.

65
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,930
Why do you need to feel bad?

66
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,410
Because you rejected me?

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,430
Then you just need to accept my love.

68
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,620
Stop crying.

69
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,330
Stop assuming that I’m helping you

70
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,890
because I still have feelings for you.

71
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,610
I’m helping you because you’re my partner.

72
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,920
After this mission,

73
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,130
You can quit being my partner if you want to.

74
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,800
I told you I wanted us
to go back to what we used to be.

75
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,500
That’s impossible.

76
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,810
You don’t need to feel bad about it.

77
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,490
My love for you will fade away soon.

78
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,760
I will stop holding on to you.

79
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,330
Let’s go.

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,760
Let’s do our last mission.

81
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,820
I think it doesn’t look bad.

82
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,920
Not at all.

83
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,930
It looks great.

84
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,630
Amazing.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,270
We need to start learning how to do this stuff.

86
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,920
Because Boss will no longer be with us.

87
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,820
We need to do it ourselves.

88
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,900
We’ve been heavily criticizing Boss.

89
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Now, we start to see the company’s future without him.

90
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,350
I can only see disasters.

91
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,200
Did I choose the wrong side?

92
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,570
Be gentle.

93
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,970
You are hurting me.

94
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,120
But I like this side of you.

95
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,360
You look tough.

96
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,020
Can I ask you for real?

97
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,280
Why did you need to pick on Jued?

98
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,310
What has she ever done to you?

99
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,140
Nothing but I just don’t like her.

100
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,780
I also want to eliminate a rival
competing for the bonus.

101
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,570
You are such…

102
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,080
Don’t you see?

103
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,300
I kill two birds with one stone.

104
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,110
I also get to ruin Boss.

105
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,620
I want to take his place
as the company’s ace for some time.

106
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,700
Don’t do this.

107
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
I know you hate him as much as I do.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,790
Instead of being mad at me,

109
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,210
you should be looking for the real Angel
to help your girlfriend.

110
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,910
If you still want to help her.

111
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,130
Is everything going as planned?

112
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,010
Yes.

113
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,570
Food, beverages, decorations, souvenirs,
and the priest are all set.

114
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,680
What about those troublemakers?

115
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,410
Tomorrow, we will set up
a double barbed wire fence.

116
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,470
If it’s not enough,
we can turn it into an electric fence.

117
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,920
Great.

118
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,300
You can go now.

119
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,970
Do you know
what the worst enemy in a relationship is?

120
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,850
The exes.

121
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,780
This is why I chose you to be my partner.

122
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,180
Our plan is that we will plant a bomb
in Kesorn’s room.

123
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,170
No man can tolerate
knowing his fiancée still isn’t over her ex.

124
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,180
They will have a huge fight
and cancel their wedding.

125
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,440
Our mission will be complete.

126
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,320
Boss, come and take a look at this.

127
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,290
How can I forget my wallet?

128
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,850
It’s right there.

129
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,890
Wait.

130
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,890
Didn’t they already clean the room
this morning?

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,740
Let’s check if anything is missing or unusual.

132
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,910
Why is this on your bed?

133
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,890
That’s not mine.

134
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,940
Just admit it.

135
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,030
You still miss Chan.

136
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,450
It is not mine.

137
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,180
Honey.

138
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,250
I tried but...

139
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,330
Honey.

140
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,920
As long as you’re still going through
with our wedding tomorrow,

141
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,720
you can take your time
to forget that bastard Chan.

142
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,610
I won’t rush you.

143
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,350
I understand.

144
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,480
It’s not easy.

145
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,320
Do you get it?

146
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,530
Yes.

147
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,260
Tomorrow,

148
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,010
let’s get married like we planned.

149
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,000
I love you.

150
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,210
It’s okay.

151
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,360
I love you.

152
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,580
I love you.

153
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,760
I haven’t put the photo in her wallet.

154
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,920
It means she has his photo in her wallet.

155
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,780
Is it possible that Kesorn still loves Chan,

156
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,550
and Chan also still loves Kesorn?

157
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,080
That’s why he’s trying to ruin her wedding.

158
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,490
You have done several missions.

159
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,520
You probably have seen…

160
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,230
that many couples broke up

161
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,860
even though they still loved each other

162
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,130
If they still love each other,

163
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,230
then what is the problem?

164
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,870
I was an intern at their company.

165
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,700
It was my last day as an intern.

166
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,500
You only had a fight over what to eat.

167
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,130
How can it lead to a divorce?

168
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,900
You need to ask Chan that.

169
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,580
He’s the one who wants a divorce.

170
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,410
I won’t sign it.

171
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,180
I’ll keep living like this.

172
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,290
Can you sign my internship completion letter?

173
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,920
We only had a fight over a meal.

174
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,030
But she refuses to talk to me for two months.

175
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,270
When I ask for a divorce, she won’t do it.

176
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,490
I don’t know what she’s thinking.

177
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,520
You should hold on to your single life.

178
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,650
So you won’t get a headache like me.

179
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,530
So…

180
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,230
Aren’t you going to try to reconcile with her?

181
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,250
Reconcile?

182
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,500
Why do I need to do that?

183
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,810
I didn’t do anything wrong.

184
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,820
What if I can help you divorce her?

185
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,020
Go ahead.

186
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,250
If you can do it, I’ll hire you.

187
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,780
Mr. Chan.

188
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,720
How is it?

189
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,470
Chan, you bastard.

190
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,260
Neither of them backed down.

191
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,230
That’s why their relationship came to an end.

192
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,600
These two,

193
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,340
I was the one who broke them up.

194
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,430
I know them well.

195
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,090
I think we’d better focus on your problem.

196
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,590
We know who Angel is.

197
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,210
The wedding presentation looks good.

198
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,190
Let’s go and check the beach

199
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,230
before we call it a day.

200
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,610
Let’s go.

201
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,160
(It’s clear.)

202
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,170
(You can go in now.)

203
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,970
Monitor team, how is the situation outside?

204
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,650
(Those three went to the beach.)

205
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,620
Okay.

206
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,700
Ying and Joy, you keep a lookout.

207
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,140
Nut, you come with me.

208
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
Find the wedding presentation.

209
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,440
Where is the presentation file?

210
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,430
You, find it.

211
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,870
You’re the only one who is doing nothing.

212
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,620
I can’t find it.

213
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,610
It’s so refreshing.

214
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,610
I feel so refreshed that I can find the file.

215
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,850
Give me a flash drive.

216
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,410
Here.

217
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,290
Why are you screaming?

218
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,330
It’s only a power flicker.

219
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:16,800
See?

220
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:17,990
It’s back.

221
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,680
Where is Nut?

222
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,480
Hey!

223
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,120
Why did you kidnap me?

224
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,690
Jued.

225
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,340
Why are you wearing a mask?

226
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,460
How do you know it’s me?

227
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,520
Of course, I know.

228
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,330
You’re wearing the same outfit.

229
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,860
Are you too embarrassed to face me?

230
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,600
You are not a scumbag like your partner.

231
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,340
Hey!

232
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,160
Let’s get to our business.

233
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,320
Don’t tell me…

234
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,430
you want me to come back to Team A?

235
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,970
Are you that desperate to get me back?

236
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,460
If you want me to join your team,

237
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,430
Sure, I’m happy to do it.

238
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,860
I want to go back to your team.

239
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,710
I don’t see any future on that team.

240
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,970
Rose was bossing me around.

241
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,180
I’m willing to do it.

242
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,590
You only need to ask me nicely.

243
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,030
You don’t need to tie me up like this.

244
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,460
I tied you up.

245
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,000
Because you are dangerous.

246
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,170
Huh?

247
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,890
I am dangerous?

248
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,860
What have I done to you?

249
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,290
Nut, how long have you been
in contact with her?

250
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,350
Boss, come and take a look at this.

251
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,940
[Do you want me to do it now?]
You secretly sent our info to Destiny

252
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,140
through Kesorn.

253
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,760
I forgot that you were her secretary.

254
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,550
When they got divorced,

255
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,920
you chose Chan’s side.

256
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,490
Chan offered higher pay.

257
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,070
And…

258
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,920
his work attitude is more compatible with mine.

259
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,540
That’s enough.

260
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,240
I don’t want to listen to you anymore.

261
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,900
Let’s check it.

262
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,910
Do you have anything to say?

263
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,400
Kesorn and I…

264
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,610
Keep this receipt.

265
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,430
Keep this letter.

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,040
[Nut, my friend is launching
a new money-sharing pool.]

267
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,650
[Do you want to join it?]

268
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,580
[Sure.]

269
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,770
I’m only in the same money pool with her.

270
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,910
I’ve been doing this
since I worked in my previous office.

271
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,670
Then why did you look nervous
when I was going to check your phone?

272
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,530
My chat is a personal matter.

273
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,190
Don’t snoop around other chat rooms.

274
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,620
What the heck?

275
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,830
I told you not to look at it.

276
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,530
Hold on.

277
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,930
I have a question.

278
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,050
You are the one
who arranged the outing options.

279
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,270
I didn’t do it.

280
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,230
I only showed the options to Chan.

281
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,440
Then who did it?

282
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,870
That’s…

283
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,790
I’m busy with work but he still asked me
to buy pennywort juice for Boss.

284
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,180
If you are not busy, can you help me
find accommodations for our outing trip?

285
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,210
Let’s say you agree to do it.

286
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,330
I’ll be right back.

287
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,570
Stop looking at me and

288
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,520
help me find a shop selling pennywort juice.

289
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,480
This room.

290
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,880
Tee, where is she?

291
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,520
I don’t see anyone.

292
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,680
But I saw it on the monitor.

293
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,150
Boss and Jued took Nut this way.

294
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,980
What do you mean?

295
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,760
Tee.

296
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,430
Tee, let me out.

297
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,610
What are you doing?

298
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,020
I got one of the Break Up Service staff.

299
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,450
Well done, Angel.

300
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,530
You’ve worked hard.

301
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,640
An infiltration mission is my expertise.

302
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,390
Team B, you can use the side door.

303
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,210
Hello.

304
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,280
Break Up Team uses the side door.

305
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,870
Destiny Team, you can use the back door.

306
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,920
The target is about to propose to her.

307
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,950
Tell Mr. Bee to come in.

308
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,250
It was so hard to find pennywort juice.

309
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,240
I spent ages looking for it.

310
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,270
Luckily, I found it.

311
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,300
You can show me the accommodation options for our company’s outing.

312
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,640
Hello, Miss.

313
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,790
I guarantee the makeover.

314
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,780
Here are the brochures of the resorts.

315
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,800
You can show them to Mr. Chan
in the order I have arranged.

316
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,320
Tee.

317
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,870
I want to praise you for
tricking Mr. Chan into coming to this resort.

318
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,970
It’s not that hard.

319
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,630
I only arranged the brochures
in the order that I planned.

320
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,260
So this resort brochure would be nearest
to his right hand, his handedness.

321
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,730
I used a prettier photo in the brochure.

322
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,430
But the photos must not
remind him of his wedding venue.

323
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,980
I closed the deal by…

324
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,620
It offers a discount.

325
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,640
We will have our company’s outing here, Nut.

326
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,050
This place?

327
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,660
Yes.

328
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,270
It’s all done.

329
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,800
So you are the real Angel, Tee.

330
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,320
Tee, did you let me take the blame for you?

331
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,710
Jued.

332
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,620
I’m sorry but…

333
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
I didn’t mean it to end up this way.

334
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,320
Everything that he did,

335
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,490
it came from good intentions, Jued.

336
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,920
Our company helps people fall in love.

337
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,610
I think you would understand it.

338
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,440
Don’t forget we have the same goal.

339
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,350
I love you.

340
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,800
Jued, you still can change your ways.

341
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,480
Change my ways?

342
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,120
Are you saying I’m a bad person?

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,730
You two, stop gaslighting Jued.

344
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,630
What kind of good person
would let someone else be a scapegoat?

345
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,380
Who is a scapegoat?

346
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,520
You.

347
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,880
Am I not a mole?

348
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,020
You are a mole

349
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,660
but you are accused of being a scapegoat.

350
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
Am I still a mole?

351
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,850
Or did I become a scapegoat?

352
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,270
She’s annoying.

353
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,290
You should go be with them.

354
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,020
You need to be with me.

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,580
Jued.

356
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,210
Come to me.

357
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,750
You still can change your ways.

358
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,280
Come to me.

359
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,490
I’ll let you handle this.

360
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,850
You two, follow her.

361
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,760
I’ll handle him.

362
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,600
Are you sure?

363
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,960
You want to fight me.

364
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,780
Why?

365
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,830
Are you that good at fighting?

366
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,270
I’m pretty good at it.

367
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:20,950
I’ll show you.

368
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,970
I’m a 10th Dan black belt in Taekwondo.

369
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,510
What do you have?

370
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,710
Grade A in Thai sword dance in junior high?

371
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,020
I’m a 10th Dan red belt in Judo.

372
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,030
There were only 15 people who achieved it.

373
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,580
I’m the 16th.

374
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,950
I almost got fired because of you.

375
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,280
Did you use a magic wand
or psychic power to fight?

376
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,690
Cupid ran away.

377
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,810
I don’t care.

378
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,910
Tie him up.

379
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,260
I heard the noises of your fighting.

380
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,540
It sounded intense.

381
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,850
I know it must be a legendary fight.

382
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,800
Since you caught the real Angel.

383
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,360
Why don’t we work together
to do this one-million-baht mission?

384
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,460
When we complete the mission,
we can share the money.

385
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,640
One, two, three, four.

386
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,500
It’s a win-win deal.

387
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,070
Ouch.

388
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,350
Why did you tie me up?

389
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,190
Let me go.

390
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,970
You are a poisonous snake.

391
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,060
You backstabbed us.
But you want us to share the bonus with you?

392
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,250
That’s right.

393
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,220
You are a poisonous snake.

394
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,590
Without me, you will never get that bonus.

395
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,120
Do you know what I found?

396
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,710
How did you tie her?

397
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,640
Here.

398
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,210
Tee’s phone.

399
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,350
Look, who is chatting with him?

400
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,120
[Angel, what’s going on
with the Break Up Team?]

401
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,560
Take the phone and tie her up.

402
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,610
How did you untie it?

403
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,640
Why are you tying me up again?

404
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,560
Take the phone and let me go.

405
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,100
Don’t tie me up.

406
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,290
Let me go.

407
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,200
[We have a slight problem.]

408
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,640
[I want you to come to meet me.]

409
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,040
[Sure, share me your location.]

410
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,730
That psycho Stephen Oppa is kidnapped?

411
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,090
No groom, no wedding.

412
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,670
President.

413
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,260
This plan is amazing.

414
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,360
But I don’t know who came up with the plan, Team A or Team B.

415
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,920
I don’t know either.

416
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,550
What I know is that she and I lost our chance
to get the one-million-baht bonus.

417
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,870
Forget about the bonus.

418
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,490
At least, the mission is accomplished.

419
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,940
I have to go somewhere right now.

420
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,210
Where?

421
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,970
You’re leaving?

422
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,470
Yes.

423
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,710
Gotcha!

424
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,420
I knew you would be here.

425
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,300
You must be heartbroken.

426
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,810
You didn’t even close the door.

427
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,360
Your boyfriend is gone.

428
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,140
The wedding will be canceled.

429
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,960
It’s over.

430
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,170
But it’s okay.

431
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,180
I understand you.

432
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,850
What a coincidence.

433
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,080
I have a red rose, your favorite flower.

434
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,110
Do you want it?

435
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,920
Take it.

436
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,510
I have no one else to give it to anyway.

437
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,280
Take it.

438
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,330
What?!

439
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,830
Aigoo.

440
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,040
Aigoo.

441
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,530
Where is Kesorn?

442
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,970
So you are the real president of Destiny?

443
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,280
Yes.

444
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,580
I’m the president of Destiny.

445
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,330
The real last boss.

446
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,550
So?

447
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,670
You didn’t see it coming, right?

448
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,160
I built Destiny to destroy Break Up Service.

449
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,240
You opened a company to compete with us.

450
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,140
That’s understandable.

451
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,220
It’s your way to take revenge on Mr. Chan.

452
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,300
But what I don’t understand.

453
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,930
Why did you trick us into coming here
to watch you getting married?

454
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,690
Seriously, what do you want?

455
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,850
Why do I need to tell you?

456
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,010
What are you doing?

457
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,150
Nut, you know my weak spot.

458
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,220
Stop it.

459
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,200
I’m going to piss myself.

460
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,690
Stop it. That’s enough.

461
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,900
Nut, stop it.

462
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,550
Stop.

463
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,580
I almost pissed myself.

464
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,930
Okay.

465
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,620
I built Destiny to destroy Break Up Service.

466
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,580
Chan breaks up relationships.

467
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,160
I will help people fall in love.

468
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,210
I’m good at it.

469
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,650
After I helped many couples fall in love,

470
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,230
I started to ask myself.

471
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
Is it possible for Chan and me…

472
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,560
to get back together?

473
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,340
You still love Mr. Chan.

474
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,390
Yes.

475
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,850
I still love him.

476
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,420
But I don’t know…

477
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,610
if he still loves me.

478
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,990
Angel, who you know by the name “Tee,”
was sent to your company,

479
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,750
for this reason.

480
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,570
His main job is not to spy on you,

481
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,530
not to get inside info,

482
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,950
or ruin your mission.

483
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,930
His job is to make Chan think of me.

484
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,560
Do you still miss her?

485
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,070
Miss her?

486
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,720
I just don’t know why it’s here.

487
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,970
Everything,

488
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,930
it’s a part of my plan.

489
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,630
Including the wedding.

490
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,420
So Stephen…

491
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,060
He’s one of the Destiny staff.

492
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,240
He’s my right-hand man.

493
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,190
Does our acting look convincing?

494
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,790
Jued, you have used our service.

495
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,610
You should know…

496
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,320
how good our acting is

497
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,840
Hey!

498
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,630
Just admit it.

499
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,420
You still miss Chan.

500
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,080
To be honest,

501
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,350
seeing him get jealous,

502
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,710
seeing him trying to ruin my wedding,

503
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,890
I have to admit…

504
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,320
it makes me really happy.

505
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,990
Your next mission.

506
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,080
You need to break up those two.

507
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,400
Anyone who can break them up,

508
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,530
I’ll give you a bonus worth one million baht.

509
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,040
It tells me he hasn’t forgotten me.

510
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,310
Can I take the second seat?

511
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,160
It offers the right amount of thrill.

512
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,430
Let me join you.

513
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,790
Thank you for allowing me
to see this side of you.

514
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
Let me go.

515
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,090
Let’s create good memories

516
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,410
to replace your bad memories.

517
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,530
I love you.

518
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,250
I love you.

519
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,850
You toy with his feelings.

520
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,810
You play mind games with him.

521
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,610
Is this how you show you still love him?

522
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,380
Boss, you have no right to say that to me.

523
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,650
Do you think I forgot?

524
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,390
It was your fault…

525
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,370
that Chan and I got a divorce.

526
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,660
You ruined every relationship around you.

527
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,010
Whoever is with you,

528
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,570
their relationship will be broken.

529
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,830
That’s why you are all alone now.

530
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,800
Do you get it?

531
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,790
It’s your fault that I have to leave.

532
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,040
It’s over.

533
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,660
There’s nothing you can do about it.

534
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,610
It was not his fault.

535
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,070
It was your fault.

536
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,010
You fell in love on your own will.

537
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,670
But when you broke up,
you blamed that it was someone else’s fault.

538
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
So you would feel less guilty.

539
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,550
Just admit it.

540
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,950
You don’t want to blame yourself.

541
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,400
But the truth is you cannot save your love.

542
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,450
Boss, I don’t think it was your fault.

543
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,580
You are not alone.

544
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,600
You have me.

545
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,840
You also have me as your family.

546
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,280
Although it was not my fault,

547
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,660
I still had a role in it.

548
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,690
Kesorn.

549
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,140
If I’m going to ask you to do something
we both are not good at,

550
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,820
will you do it?

551
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,830
(Mr. Chan, please come to the beach right now.)

552
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,340
(Go to the beach?)

553
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,970
Where have you been?

554
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,710
Everyone is looking for you.

555
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,610
What?

556
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,310
Is this your plan?

557
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,030
Why didn’t you tell me?

558
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,660
I almost called the police.

559
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,590
I’m sorry.

560
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,320
I’ll let her explain to you.

561
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,550
I…

562
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,640
I’m the real owner of Destiny.

563
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,070
I opened the company…

564
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,850
to destroy Break Up Service

565
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,910
Are you that resentful of me?

566
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,150
Yes.

567
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
I really resent you.

568
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,370
But I also miss you very much.

569
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,940
I never forget you.

570
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,360
In my wallet,

571
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,340
I still have your picture.

572
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,740
I haven’t put the photo in her wallet.

573
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,680
There already is his photo in it.

574
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,480
I even came up with a plan.

575
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,440
So you would think of me.

576
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,420
Our things that you saw in your office,

577
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,710
that’s a part of my plan.

578
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,430
This fake wedding, too.

579
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,740
Didn’t you go too far?

580
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,640
Because there’s nothing else I can do.

581
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,970
We are divorced.

582
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,820
I always regret the two months
that we didn’t talk to each other.

583
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,100
I don’t know why I did that.

584
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,600
But you also let another seven years pass.

585
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,290
Don’t you think it’s too late?

586
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,060
Yes.

587
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,250
It’s probably too late.

588
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,600
But it’s okay.

589
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,620
At least, I said what I wanted.

590
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,630
I’m sorry, Chan.

591
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,810
I’m sorry, everyone, for causing the trouble.

592
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,720
You said you are sorry.

593
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,430
What about me?

594
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,860
You feel better after apologizing.
What about me?

595
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,720
You put our things in my office.

596
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,520
Didn’t you see it?

597
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,710
I still kept our wedding ring.

598
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,310
Seven years have passed.

599
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,830
I still looked at it sometimes.

600
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,460
I told Boss to move on.

601
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,330
I couldn’t do it myself.

602
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,150
I recently threw it away.

603
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,120
I want to apologize to you, too.

604
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,770
I’m sorry.

605
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,820
I knew what you were thinking.

606
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,220
But I didn’t want to lose to you.

607
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,240
Now, I realize I didn’t win.

608
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,530
Because I no longer have you.

609
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,090
Here is your ring.

610
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,360
Did you throw it away for me?

611
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,480
Tee kept it.

612
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,910
Where is Tee?

613
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,570
He’s tied up with something.

614
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,090
I’ll make you pay when I get out of here.

615
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,480
Should I put it back on?

616
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,320
You ruined it.

617
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,420
You also fix it.

618
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,170
You did well.

619
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,480
Yes, Tee.

620
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,240
I’ll go see you.

621
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,300
Have a seat.

622
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,830
Jued.

623
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:40,720
I’m sorry for making you a scapegoat.

624
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,850
I mean, making you a mole.

625
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,810
It’s okay.

626
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,920
I have to apologize to you, too.

627
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,080
I hit you real hard.

628
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,620
It’s okay.

629
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,090
I deserved it.

630
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,260
Actually, I deserve a harsher punishment.

631
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,040
I was the one who told you

632
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,800
not to have a secret.

633
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
You aren’t the only one
who broke the promise.

634
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,940
Tee.

635
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,210
I have something to tell you.

636
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,840
I…

637
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,340
[I’m heading back, Oat. Let’s go get a drink.]

638
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,650
[A pennywort juice is fine.]

639
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,220
Boss.

640
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,480
Sorry, I was talking to Tee.

641
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,600
Did you two reconcile?

642
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,150
We…

643
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,000
I’m happy for you.

644
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,720
After receiving the bonus,
are you planning to resign?

645
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,560
No.

646
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,440
But I will stop being your partner.

647
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,640
Are you moving to Team C to be with Tee?

648
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,370
Hey!

649
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,670
Can you stop interrupting me and listen?

650
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,450
Boss.

651
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,680
When you said this would be our last mission,

652
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,130
my heart dropped.

653
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,180
Let’s do our last mission.

654
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,360
But you know what?

655
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,610
It didn’t feel as bad as when you said…

656
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,610
you would stop loving me.

657
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,590
What are you trying to say?

658
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,730
I think I’m falling in love with you.

659
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,730
I love you.

660
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,750
I just realized it.

661
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,250
If you still have feelings for me,

662
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,580
instead of being my partner,
do you want to be my boyfriend?

663
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,160
Do you know why I gave Mr. Chan the ring?

664
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,380
It’s because of you.

665
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,900
The look on your face and in your eyes.

666
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,550
When you see happy couples,

667
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,950
you feel happy with them.

668
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,950
I’m so happy

669
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,540
that I helped revitalize their romance.

670
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,870
It’s strange for us who work in the field.

671
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,990
But I want to keep seeing it.

672
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,170
So…

673
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,340
We received a request through our app

674
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,490
to destroy Boss and Jued’s relationship.

675
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:18,010
The Boss-Jued-Oat mission will be the first case
after the merger of Break Up Service and Destiny.

676
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,320
The first mission went well.

677
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,360
It’s time for the Destiny team to take over.

678
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,780
Every time I get hurt, I always come to you.

679
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,200
Where did you get hurt this time?

680
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,260
Let me heal your wound.
