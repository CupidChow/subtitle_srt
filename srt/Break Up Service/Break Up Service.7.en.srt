1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,620
How is it?

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,430
Don’t they look exactly the same?

3
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,600
I spent the whole night making it.

4
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,000
Boss, can we break them up tomorrow?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,980
What’s wrong with you?

6
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,660
Boss.

7
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,040
I’m asking you. Just one day.

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,510
It should be your name.

9
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,320
Nuch, your ex-girlfriend.

10
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,230
There’s nothing between me and Nuch.

11
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,470
Nothing?

12
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,320
What is this?

13
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,300
Say it.

14
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,090
We did it.

15
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,490
They broke up.

16
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,330
Well done.

17
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,880
Since our mission is complete.

18
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,410
Come on.

19
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,860
I…

20
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,050
The snake submits her resignation.

21
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,730
Your bag, tablet, and lunchbox,

22
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,650
make sure to take them.

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,020
Got it.

24
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,450
I haven’t taken a shower yet.

25
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,950
I was busy helping these two rascals get ready.

26
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,950
It was so hard to wake them up.

27
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,750
I’m getting to work.

28
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,420
She forgot it again.

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,290
Hello.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,660
Hello.

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,670
Hello.

32
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,160
Do you think there’s something between
the deputy marketing director and the new admin?

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,870
Right? I think it’s sketchy.

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,170
They have breakfast together every day.

35
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,820
There must be something between them.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,440
Yes.

37
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,940
Jued.

38
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,800
How was your job interview?

39
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,500
I’m still waiting for the result.

40
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,090
I still have a few more interviews

41
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,680
since I sent my resume to many companies.

42
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,350
I hope you get a new job soon.

43
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,950
Pop.

44
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,700
I can’t tell you
where Kormai is having her meditation retreat.

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,020
She wants peace.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,250
But she is away for 45 days.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,460
It’s only been one week
but I already miss her like crazy.

48
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,370
You can just tell me the name of the province.

49
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:42,990
I can’t, Pop.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,330
I can’t let you interrupt her meditation.

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,830
You need to be patient.
It’s only 45 days.

52
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,720
Trust me.

53
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,470
Time will heal your broken relationship.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,890
Come on.

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,080
You can do it.

56
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,180
Thanks for letting me stay with you, Jued.

57
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,220
I want to get over Pop,

58
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,860
but I can’t stand being far away from him.

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,160
It’s okay.

60
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,710
At least, while you are trying to move on,

61
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,690
you can use my wall as a barrier between you two.

62
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:04,410
I heard that if we keep doing the same thing
for 45 days, it will become our habit.

63
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,560
After 45 days,
you will be able to move on from him.

64
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,100
I heard that it takes only 21 days.

65
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,400
No, it’s 45 days.

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,280
Believe me.

67
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,660
Why does it have to be 45 days?

68
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,180
It’s because of the condition
in Break Up Service’s contract.

69
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,940
If the couple reconciles in 45 days,

70
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,980
it means the company fails the mission.

71
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,920
This is why

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,180
I need to delay your reconciliation for 45 days.

73
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,660
I have to do all this because of you.

74
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,980
Are you saying that you're doing this to help me?

75
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,960
If I didn’t do this,
Team A would have been disbanded.

76
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,200
You are a fool.

77
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,690
How can you believe Nut’s words?

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,580
How many times did she say
she would get me fired?

79
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,900
Has she ever been able to do it?

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,040
What if she can do it this time?

81
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,630
You resigned from the company.

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,730
Why would you care?

83
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,060
I don’t want you to lose your job.

84
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,620
Aren’t you going to tell me that you helped me?

85
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,810
You weren’t going to do anything
even if I told you.

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,310
You are heartless.

87
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,980
You are next.

88
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,550
Please wait a moment
while my boss looks at your resume.

89
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,200
Sure.

90
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,280
We will get back to you
with our decision soon, Mr. Pakorn.

91
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,730
Okay.

92
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,590
Thank you.

93
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,940
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,910
I should be the one who asks you that.

95
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,220
I’m here for a job interview.

96
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,210
But you…

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,880
Are you here for work?

98
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
The client of this case is Tao.

99
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,910
He’s 45 years old.

100
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,540
His wife is Mew.

101
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,520
They have been married for ten years.

102
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,790
Tao is a top-notch stay-at-home dad.

103
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,090
Mew works at this company.

104
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,700
She was promoted to deputy marketing director
earlier this year.

105
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,680
They look like a perfect couple in a movie.

106
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,270
But something is bothering Tao.

107
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,450
He discovered that

108
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,780
his wife only hires young men for her team.

109
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,500
These men compete to be her favorite

110
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,460
but none of them can beat this man.

111
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,430
Ryo.

112
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,360
Can you print out the resumes of today’s candidates?

113
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,890
Then go meet me in my room.

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,410
Yes, the deputy director.

115
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,150
He is the admin that we need to separate from her.

116
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,750
It’s not ‘we’.

117
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,790
It’s your job.

118
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,680
I’m here for the job interview,

119
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,440
not to do a mission with you.

120
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,970
I just ran into you.

121
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,560
Let’s call it my bad luck.

122
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,810
Since we are no longer partners.

123
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,400
Then don’t get in my way.

124
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,250
I won’t get in your way.

125
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,400
But if they offer you the job,

126
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,790
can you please reject it?

127
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,390
Please.

128
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,800
Why do I need to do that?

129
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,560
You already have a job.

130
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,640
But I don’t.

131
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,010
Please, Boss.

132
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,070
Do you really want this job?

133
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,070
If you want it,

134
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,510
then you need to beat me.

135
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,680
What?

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you saying you are better than me?

137
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,020
Ouch.

138
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,220
I’m sorry.

139
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,440
I won’t take this job.

140
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,950
I’ll apply for a job at other companies.

141
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,610
I’m sorry.

142
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,400
You shouldn’t do this to other candidates.

143
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,690
Ouch.

144
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,660
Please come in.

145
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,650
It says here that

146
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,710
you previously worked at an application company.

147
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
What is the application for?

148
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,670
It’s similar to a dating app.

149
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,360
But it’s the opposite.

150
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,680
Dating apps help people find love.

151
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,120
But this app helps break…

152
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,730
Excuse me.

153
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,710
I forgot about the sick leave.

154
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,370
You can take up to 30 days of sick leave.

155
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,840
If you take a sick leave for three consecutive days,
you need to submit a medical certificate.

156
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,570
Thank you.

157
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,370
Shall I continue?

158
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,860
The app helps break…

159
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,070
Excuse me, again.

160
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,790
I forgot to ask about personal leave.

161
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,390
You can take up to 3 days of personal leave.

162
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,910
If you take more than that, it will be unpaid leave.

163
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,630
Thank you.

164
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,530
Break…

165
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,530
What about vacation leave?

166
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,970
Break…

167
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,190
What about military leave?

168
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,380
Break…

169
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
What about ordination leave?

170
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,840
Break…

171
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,790
What about…?

172
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,730
What about paternity leave?

173
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,680
I’ll give you the document
about our employees’ benefits.

174
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,760
Ryo, can you take care of it?

175
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,980
That’s great.

176
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,990
Thank you.

177
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,040
Here.

178
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,840
Thank you.

179
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,010
It looks like he will take many leave days.

180
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,320
I think you should eliminate him.

181
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,820
But he seems polite.

182
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,770
He also looks cute.

183
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,350
So what is the application for?

184
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,620
The app helps break…

185
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,260
Break off a conversation.

186
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,480
See? You’re breaking off the conversation.

187
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,890
The app is for creating laughter.

188
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,390
Isn’t it funny?

189
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,300
Why did you have to interrupt me?

190
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,620
If you told them about Break Up Service,

191
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,040
they wouldn’t fall for my plan.

192
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,010
I told you if you’re not going to help,
then don’t get in my way.

193
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,620
But you interrupted my interview.

194
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,010
If I don’t get this job, it’s all because of you.

195
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,320
You had a good job.

196
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,670
But you chose to quit.

197
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,790
I quit because…

198
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,290
Because what?

199
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,890
Because I didn’t want to be a scumbag like you.

200
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,640
That’s the rent I owe you.

201
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,500
I’ll move out as soon as possible.

202
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,040
So I don’t need to see you again.

203
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,780
Hey, the general manager.

204
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,970
Can you move the empty desk out of my office?

205
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,100
I won’t move it because we’re canceling you.

206
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,850
You are the problem.

207
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,840
You’re surely the reason Jued quit her job.

208
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,850
Good.

209
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,900
Then you will choose between moving that desk
out of my office, or having your desks moved outside.

210
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,560
If that’s all you can do, then don’t do it.

211
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,380
Team B, you should retreat.

212
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,380
That guy couldn’t care less
about what’s going on in the office.

213
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,100
I don’t get it.

214
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,260
Why did Jued resign from the company?

215
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,740
It’s because Boss gaslit her.

216
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,250
That’s why she said he was not a bad person.

217
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,590
If she listened to me and let him mess up the mission,
he would have been fired by now.

218
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,200
Right.

219
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,580
Jued, honey.

220
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,670
I’m so worried about her.

221
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,400
Forget the 45-day period.

222
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,130
I’ll help them reconcile today.

223
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,150
Boss, I’ll get you fired.

224
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,550
Pop, I have something to tell you.

225
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,520
Actually, Kor…

226
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,330
Hi, Jued.

227
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,130
I want to seek your forgiveness
for my past mistakes.

228
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,080
I’m going to enter the monkhood.

229
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,800
Huh?

230
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,990
I have come to terms with my sadness.

231
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,870
I want to leave secular life behind.

232
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,910
Pop, you can’t do that.

233
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,170
Don’t you still love Kormai?

234
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,970
She found her peace.

235
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,780
I want to find mine too.

236
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,100
Please don’t try to stop my spiritual journey.

237
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,300
Excuse me.

238
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,710
I need to memorize my ordination prayer.

239
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,180
Kormai.

240
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,040
Kormai, you need to stop…

241
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,240
I haven’t seen Boss come to see you lately.

242
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,800
Did you two break up?

243
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
Did he cheat on you?

244
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,250
You want to take revenge.

245
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,600
So you make this voodoo doll.

246
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:27,950
Good.

247
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,960
Those cheaters should be punished!

248
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,550
He’s entering the monkhood.

249
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,480
She’s turning into a murderer.

250
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,800
I shouldn’t have broken them up.

251
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,230
Your situation sounds bad.

252
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,930
My name is Cupid.

253
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,300
I work at Destiny.

254
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,050
My job is to help people fall in love.

255
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,950
Like a dating app?

256
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,780
No.

257
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,940
Our job is on-site work rather than online.

258
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,580
Our motto is that love should be felt with the heart,
not through the screen.

259
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,820
We also provide solutions for reconciling relationships.

260
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,980
Do you want to get a consultation?

261
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,750
I have an errand to do. Excuse me.

262
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,110
Free consultation for one hour.

263
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,990
I got a free consultation
but I ended up paying the deposit.

264
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,400
I barely have money left.

265
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,130
Is she a scammer?

266
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,250
No, I’m a good person.

267
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,240
I’m not a scumbag like Boss.

268
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,210
Can I borrow it?

269
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,210
Let’s buy Somtam to eat.

270
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,710
Yes.

271
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,180
My desk.

272
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Boss!

273
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,510
If you want a war with me, I’ll give it to you.

274
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,120
Asshole. How dare you leave my desk outside?!

275
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,490
Douchebag.

276
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,210
[Mew]

277
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,770
Here is your water.

278
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,680
I think my husband started to suspect me.

279
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,160
Someone must tell him about us.

280
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,650
We should tone it down.

281
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,230
Does it mean…

282
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,020
I can’t have breakfast with you anymore?

283
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,300
But…

284
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,890
Can I still put roses on your desk every day?

285
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,650
Just one rose.

286
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,790
Flower from Mr. Ryo to Mrs. Mew.

287
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,950
I didn’t order it.

288
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,860
It said that it’s from Mr. Ryo, the admin.

289
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,120
[For Ms. Mew, from Mr. Ryo, the admin.]

290
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,110
You are the only Ryo in this department, right?

291
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,360
Yes.

292
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,820
Mr. Ter, your husband, wanted to surprise you.

293
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
So he asked me to order it.

294
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,020
But her husband’s name is Tao.

295
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,660
Not bad for your first time.

296
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,950
I’ll buy you drinks.

297
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,240
I don’t want your drinks.

298
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,640
I want to scold you.

299
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,600
Asshole.

300
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,030
You told me you need medical help.

301
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,300
But you tricked me into working for you.

302
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,910
Since when can’t you work alone?

303
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,700
I can.

304
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,710
But if I do, they may recognize me.

305
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,590
That’s bulllshit.

306
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,290
You are afraid that they may recognize you?

307
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,410
Even a chameleon can’t compete with you.

308
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,940
Just admit it.

309
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,210
You are now used to having a partner.

310
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,710
What, Nut?

311
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,540
Are you tired from moving your desk?

312
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,030
Huh?

313
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,460
What?

314
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,970
Jued.

315
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,670
Can we go somewhere else?

316
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,250
Pop is a regular customer here.

317
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,380
I don’t want to meet him.

318
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,110
I saw him leave the condo this morning.

319
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,760
We won’t run into him.

320
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,070
Come on.

321
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
Since you hired us.

322
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,330
All you have to do is
take Kormai here tomorrow at noon.

323
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,280
We will take care of the rest.

324
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
You don’t need to stay.

325
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,060
That’s so convenient.

326
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,540
Can you pay the deposit now?

327
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,460
Sit down.

328
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,480
Wait here.

329
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,750
I’ll order a drink for you.

330
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,510
Kormai.

331
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,290
Are you getting back together with Nuch
after breaking up with me?

332
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,730
No, Kor. Please hear me out.

333
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,390
I don’t want to listen to you.

334
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,030
I don’t love you anymore.

335
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,400
Let her go if she doesn’t want to hear you out.

336
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,980
I’ll listen to you.

337
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,500
I changed my mind.

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,940
I’ll hear him out.

339
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,630
Didn’t you say you didn’t want to hear him out?

340
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,190
I changed my mind.

341
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,320
But you said you wouldn’t listen to him.

342
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,260
Now, I want to hear him out.

343
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,920
I won’t let you hear him out.

344
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,590
I will hear him out.

345
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,550
Pop, tell her that you have nothing to say to her.

346
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,050
Pop, say it.

347
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,650
Pop, tell her.

348
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,240
Say it.

349
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,400
Hey!

350
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,440
Get down and give all your valuable items to us.

351
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,060
Come on.

352
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,900
Go.

353
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,300
Jued. It’s me, Cupid.

354
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,330
You are Cupid?

355
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,180
Yes.

356
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,660
This is a part of our plan.

357
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,300
You can slowly crawl out through the front door.

358
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,160
Your plan sounds fun.

359
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,750
I want to stay.

360
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,750
Then you need to show your acting skills.

361
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:49,970
Sure.

362
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,760
You, brat.

363
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,600
I told you to give me your bag.

364
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,350
Take it.

365
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,260
Everyone, give your bag to the robbers.

366
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,210
Give me your money.

367
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,050
I don’t have it.

368
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:03,980
Give it to me.

369
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,340
I don’t have it.

370
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,600
Go.

371
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,600
Walk!

372
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,970
These two don’t have money.

373
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,180
Shall we shoot them?

374
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,130
Wait, wait.

375
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,510
Don’t shoot my girlfriend, please.

376
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,590
I’ll give you money.

377
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,870
Sure.

378
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,590
Which one is your girlfriend?

379
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,090
Both of them.

380
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,780
How can you have two girlfriends?

381
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,150
You can only choose one of them.

382
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,500
What about the other one?

383
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,250
We will shoot her.

384
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,360
Stop asking.

385
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,080
Choose!

386
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,250
Pop.

387
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,960
Are you going to let Kormai,
the woman you love dearly, die like this?

388
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,660
You can let the other one die.

389
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,290
What a b*tch?!

390
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,690
Please shoot me instead.

391
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,650
You’re trying to be a hero?

392
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,540
I’m not.

393
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,770
But I can no longer live without Kormai.

394
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,320
Try this, honey.

395
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,620
Eat this, honey.

396
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,630
Whether it’s when I eat,

397
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,630
sleep,

398
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,060
or do anything, I always think of you.

399
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,950
You are the only one I love.

400
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,370
Liar.

401
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,480
If you no longer have feelings for me,

402
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,640
why did you take her to places we used to go?

403
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,100
Go to the park, eat the ice cream,

404
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,270
and ride a bicycle.

405
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,410
They are the things I like to do.

406
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,450
I’ll do it even if I don’t have a girlfriend.

407
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,840
I didn’t come to see you today as a date.

408
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,000
I want to ask for your forgiveness
before I enter the monkhood.

409
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,670
Kor.

410
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,540
I don’t know
how the mistake in the memory book happened.

411
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,730
But I didn’t do it.

412
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,820
I have proof but I guess

413
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,930
I won’t have a chance to show it to you.

414
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
From now on,

415
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,560
please take care of yourself.

416
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,880
I love you.

417
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,180
Then let’s die together.

418
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,130
The world without you,

419
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,600
it’s boring.

420
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,830
I still love you.

421
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,360
I’m sorry that I…

422
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,470
I was afraid to ask you because
I didn’t want you to think I acted unreasonably.

423
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,590
I’m sorry.

424
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,820
It’s okay, honey.

425
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,420
Hearing you say you love me,

426
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,070
now I can die in peace.

427
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,070
I love you.

428
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,580
If Boss saw this, he would throw up.

429
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,610
Freeze.

430
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,900
Put your weapon down.

431
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,730
This is the police.

432
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,460
Put your weapon down.

433
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,960
Get down.

434
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,630
Do what I said.

435
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,840
Nuch is also hired by you?

436
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,860
She is a guest star.

437
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,540
I invited her.

438
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,410
Her wage is a bit expensive.

439
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,540
But she did a good job.

440
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,090
Can I have my phone back?

441
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,020
Give Jued her phone back.

442
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,850
Thank you.

443
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,160
Are you ready to wire the money?

444
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,810
Not yet.

445
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,330
Wait a second.

446
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,320
If I’m not this desperate, I wouldn’t call you.

447
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,830
Please don’t ask me why I need the money for.

448
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,210
Fine.

449
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,580
But I have one condition. You need to help me.

450
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,890
Nut screws me over.

451
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,520
This is Tee.

452
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,840
He’s on the monitoring team.

453
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,370
Mr. Chan wants to promote him
to be the leader of Team C.

454
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,790
But he has no on-site experience.

455
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,830
Mr. Chan wants you to train him.

456
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,050
You are behind this, aren’t you?

457
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,330
Boss, you don’t have a partner right now.

458
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,500
I’ll leave Tee in your care.

459
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,810
He’s a bit nerdy.

460
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,040
Enjoy.

461
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,870
Please take care of me, Boss.

462
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,600
You need to help me
on Mew and the HR guy’s case.

463
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,640
So I’ll have something to negotiate with Mr. Chan
to get rid of Tee from Team A.

464
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,030
Okay?

465
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,710
He can’t keep his hands still.

466
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,970
Watch.

467
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,000
It’s okay.

468
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,400
I’ll share it with you.

469
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,600
I have a few of them.

470
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,880
No matter what I do, he doesn’t care.

471
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,940
Now, I get why you can’t stand him.

472
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,440
If you have something you want me to do,
you can tell me.

473
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,290
It’s not necessary.

474
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,120
Just play with your toy.

475
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,370
Let’s get to the point.

476
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,720
I called to cancel my interview.

477
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,180
You will be the only candidate
in the second round of the interview today.

478
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,150
Yes!

479
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,450
Then they will offer me the job anyway.

480
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,790
Before that, you need to do everything
to make the target fall for our trap.

481
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,000
I need photos to manipulate Mew.

482
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,870
Do you have any plans?

483
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,860
Thank you.

484
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,320
It’s on me.

485
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,250
You paid for my coffee.

486
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,580
Are you bribing me to help you with the interview?

487
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,920
Passing the interview is not the only thing I want.

488
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,110
What else do you want?

489
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,900
The job,

490
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,510
my number,

491
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,450
or me?

492
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,250
What if I want all of them?

493
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,920
Come closer.

494
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,550
I’ll tell you.

495
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,470
You should change your outfit
to your previous style.

496
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,880
Then I’ll hire you.

497
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,460
Don’t you like this style?

498
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,830
It’s not bad.

499
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,130
But you…

500
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,050
you dress like my boss.

501
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,990
Did you ask my colleagues about me?

502
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,040
It’s good that you did your homework.

503
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,940
But they fooled you.

504
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,360
What?

505
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,250
Why would I like a boomer like Mew?

506
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,280
Everyone tries to please her
to get ahead in their career.

507
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,630
Everyone in the department knows

508
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,260
that Mew likes to be pampered by young men.

509
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,490
She uses her position in the company
to fulfill her desire.

510
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,940
She should have gone to a host bar.

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,700
She only hires young men.

512
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,070
She barely hires women.

513
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,600
You can’t tell this to anyone.

514
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,820
I’m so uncomfortable with it.

515
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,170
Well done.

516
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,530
We only need to send the audio file
to the company.

517
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,170
They won’t be able to continue
with their relationship.

518
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,830
If you are doing that,

519
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,320
it will affect Mew’s career.

520
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,980
I think it’s overkill.

521
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,880
If we don’t use the drastic measure,
she will never break up with the HR guy.

522
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,360
Don’t you hear what he said behind her back?

523
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,190
Don’t we have a softer measure?

524
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,930
I have an idea. Can we do this?

525
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,770
(She uses her position in the company
to fulfill her desire.)

526
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,780
(She should have gone to a host bar.)

527
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,400
(She only hires young men.)

528
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,890
Are you going to leave your lovely family
for a guy like him?

529
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,460
No.

530
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,770
I’m planning to transfer Ryo to another department.

531
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,620
I was so mad at him about that gigantic rose.

532
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,960
His move was inappropriate.

533
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,270
Then he called me a boomer.

534
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,410
This really pisses me off.

535
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,920
It’s a relief to see you quickly get over him.

536
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,430
It’s easy to get over him.

537
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,730
I have no feelings for him.

538
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,990
I just like it when he was affectionate to me.

539
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,720
It gave me butterflies.

540
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,270
My husband used to give me butterflies.

541
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,050
Now, he is very busy.

542
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,850
He’s a full-time stay-at-home dad.

543
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,220
He barely has time for me.

544
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,630
Kissing him on the cheek feels like a difficult task.

545
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,150
Have you ever told him that?

546
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,510
About the things you want him to do.

547
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,910
If you never told him, why don’t you try it?

548
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,840
It might not be because he is too busy.

549
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,360
It might be because he didn’t know it.

550
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,510
Thank you for your advice.

551
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,010
You’re welcome.

552
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,240
Shall we get back to the interview?

553
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,630
Hold on.

554
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,040
Who do you think you are to give me advice?

555
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,180
How did you know about my family?

556
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,830
You showed me this audio file.

557
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,960
And you…

558
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,280
also copy my clothing style.

559
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
What do you want?

560
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,420
Do I need to call security?

561
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,040
I’m leaving.

562
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,910
[Dad, shall we go on a date this evening?]

563
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,660
My parents want to spend time
with our kids today.

564
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,120
Do you want to go on a date with me, Mom?

565
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,320
No, I mean baby.

566
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,240
So…

567
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,640
What do you want to have for dinner, baby?

568
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,180
Anything that you want.

569
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,550
But can you choose something light?

570
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,100
My suit gets a bit tight.

571
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,810
Let’s go.

572
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,690
Get in.

573
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,330
I’m so happy
that I helped revitalize their romance.

574
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,420
You complete the mission…

575
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,210
in your own way.

576
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,140
Do you want to come back
to work at Break Up Service?

577
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,770
But you already submitted my resignation letter.

578
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,210
I can fix it.

579
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,000
It’s up to you.

580
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,140
Do you want to come back…

581
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,620
to work with me?

582
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,950
I have something to confess.

583
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,310
You said I get used to having a partner.

584
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,590
It’s true.

585
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:48,990
See?

586
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,560
I can see through you like an open book.

587
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,570
Good.

588
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,900
You can ask your company
to get you a new partner.

589
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,440
So you can leave me alone.

590
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,390
But you guessed it wrong about this.

591
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,670
I don’t want a new partner.

592
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,450
There’s only one person who can be my partner.

593
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,890
What do you mean?

594
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,220
Oat,

595
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,100
you always see through me.

596
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,240
But I bet you never saw this coming.

597
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:21,470
I will do everything to get my partner back.

598
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,620
When I heard that she had resigned to protect me,

599
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,370
I really want to get her back.

600
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,230
Do you know where I went
before I came to see you?

601
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,820
You need to help me
on Mew and the HR guy’s case.

602
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,070
So I’ll have something to negotiate with Mr. Chan
to get rid of Tee from Team A.

603
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,530
Okay?

604
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,370
You kept denying that you care about her.

605
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,340
I don’t care about her.

606
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,070
I still insist on that.

607
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,370
But I like her.

608
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,980
Why it’s suddenly raining?

609
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,390
I have an umbrella.

610
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,180
This umbrella is a free giveaway.

611
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,920
Can I borrow it?

612
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,570
Our company is having a big problem.

613
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,060
Destiny helps the couple we broke up to reconcile.

614
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,950
It’s acting like our enemy.

615
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,450
Boss, where do you want me to sit?

616
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,400
Tee, you can use my desk.

617
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,810
Our target is coming.

618
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:19,860
Boss, go get the phone.

619
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,370
What’s wrong with you?

620
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,560
Why are you so distracted?

621
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,270
You finally realized your feelings for her.

622
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,190
But she’s now interested in another man.

623
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,840
Stop rubbing salt into my wound
and help me think how to beat that nerd.
