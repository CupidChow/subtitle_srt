1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,440
No matter how much we love each other,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,790
There’s no way it will work.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,660
Thank you.

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,610
You did a great job.

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,910
Boss, do you really feel nothing

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,360
when you break up couples?

7
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,190
No.

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,240
Let’s eat the noodles.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,540
You became a better person
after having Jued as your work partner.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,280
Okay, students. This is it for today.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,830
Don’t forget to submit your assignment next week.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,370
If you have questions, feel free to email me.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,430
I’ll answer it when I have time.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,400
Khao.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Jang.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,310
I took lecture notes for you.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,910
Really?

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,080
I’m struggling with this class.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,100
Thank you.

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,750
I also prepared this for you.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,410
I saw that when you order drinks,

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,950
you always ask for low sugar.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,420
So I chose this drink for you.

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,290
It’s the right level of sweetness for me.

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,180
Thanks.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,770
No one cares for me like you do.

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,800
It’s not a big deal.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,380
Don’t forget.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,060
I’m your best supporter.

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,800
What are you going to do next?

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,410
Do you want to have lunch with me?

32
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,670
There’s a new diner opening near the campus.

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,690
I heard their runny omelet with shrimp is the best.

34
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,380
I have to go to the library.

35
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,750
Are you going to study with your boyfriend?

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,520
No. I don’t have a boyfriend.

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,320
I want to have a meal with you.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,930
I want to buy you a meal.

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,350
You have been helping me.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,740
But today is not a good time. Sorry.

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,780
It’s okay.

42
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,910
I’m coming. I’m coming.

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,280
I’m sorry for being late.

44
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,550
Did you enjoy swimming so much
that you forgot the time?

45
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,250
No, I didn’t go swimming.

46
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,030
I didn’t even have time to sleep.

47
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,780
I’m transcribing audio to text at night as a side job.

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,760
My family is having a money problem.

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,380
The bank is collecting overdue payments.

50
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,660
My dad needs an abscess surgery.

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,060
My mom was scammed
by her rotating savings group.

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,300
My brother’s new semester will start soon.

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
You must be having a hard time.

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes, Nut.

55
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,740
I’m carrying the whole family on my back.

56
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,580
If there’s anything I can help you with,

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,520
just let me know.

58
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,080
I’m willing to help you with everything.

59
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,560
I mean it, everything.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,250
Can I borrow some money…

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,330
Except borrowing my money.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
Boss, are you going to lend me the money?

63
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,010
No,

64
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,540
I’m going to buy a coffee.

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,240
For me?

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,800
It’s for me. Why would I buy you a coffee?

67
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,580
Start the project brief.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,100
The client for this case is Jang.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,250
He’s a college student.

70
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,880
He has a crush on his classmate, Khao.

71
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,820
He suspects that Khao is dating someone.

72
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,210
The case is hard.

73
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,710
First, we need to find out who her boyfriend is.

74
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,840
Then we need to break them up.

75
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,760
What if Jang misunderstands
that Khao has a boyfriend?

76
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,370
Aren’t we going to waste our time for nothing?

77
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,750
Do you want to get your pay?

78
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,900
Yes. I’m pressed for money.

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,480
Then do your job and stop asking questions.

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,220
It’s time to go undercover.

81
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,760
(The first thing you need to do is
to get close to Khao.)

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,930
Khao, do you want to have a hotpot with us?

83
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,710
It’s okay. I have an errand to run.

84
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,510
Really? That’s too bad.

85
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,680
(The problem is that Khao is quite introverted.)

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,600
(I looked into her and found that
she always buys goods from this online shop.)

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,300
(You need to use a shared interest to befriend her.)

88
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,850
(Then you investigate who she is dating.)

89
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,710
Excuse me.

90
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,080
Are you staying at Chaemchan Apartment?

91
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,470
Yes.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,430
I also stay there.

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,200
I think you accidentally have my parcel.

94
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,910
I have yours.

95
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,610
I’m sorry. I got the wrong one.

96
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,670
It looks like we ordered the goods
from the same shop.

97
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,980
I guess we have something in common.

98
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,620
When there was a group assignment,

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,610
you always ended up doing everything by yourself.

100
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,010
Your group members just added their names
and took the credit for it.

101
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,560
That’s unfair.

102
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,150
Yes. So I no longer find group members.

103
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,070
I just do it by myself.

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,340
When I submitted it to the professor,

105
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,490
they didn’t have any objections.

106
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,630
Really?

107
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,070
That’s a good idea.

108
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,270
I should do that too.

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,920
I feel more comfortable doing it by myself.

110
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,670
(You need to use a shared interest to befriend her.)

111
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,940
The product from this shop is good.

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,820
Are you really using it?

113
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course.

114
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,170
It’s hard to believe because not many people use it.

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,940
Other people might not use it,

116
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,090
but I use it regularly.

117
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,220
I frequently use it.

118
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,210
I use it in the morning, during the day,
in the evening, and at night.

119
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,100
How do you use it during the day?

120
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,520
I always carry it with me.

121
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,790
(What the heck did you order?)

122
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,880
I guess you really love it.

123
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,080
Yes.

124
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,240
I never told anyone about it.

125
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,670
You are the first one I told.

126
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,340
Actually…

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,350
I don’t like socializing.

128
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,660
But it doesn’t mean I don’t want to have friends.

129
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,510
I just feel that I only need one good friend
who I can have a deep conversation with.

130
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,390
Me too.

131
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I’m glad to have you as my friend.

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,660
Nice to meet you, Jued.

133
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,840
Nice to meet you too, Khao.

134
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,670
See you later.

135
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,910
How is it going?

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,190
Do you have any updates on Khao?

137
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,790
I became close to Khao.

138
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,110
My gut feelings tell me that she has a boyfriend.

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,590
But I still don’t know who he is.

140
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,740
Who does she usually talk to in her daily life?

141
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,350
There are three candidates.

142
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,620
This is your order.

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,630
Thank you.

144
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,600
The first one is a food vendor.

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,220
A food vendor?

146
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,120
Yes.

147
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,250
That’s why they need to hide their relationship.

148
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,010
There’s another problem.

149
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,340
The food vendor has a wife.

150
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,950
Don’t let me find out

151
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,530
that you spend money on a girl.

152
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,310
His wife is very strict,

153
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,110
especially with their shop’s money,
which often goes missing.

154
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,890
I think he spends the money on Khao.

155
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,950
The second candidate.

156
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,740
Sorry.

157
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,450
He’s a campus guard.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,180
Thank you.

159
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
But he’s a lot older than her.

160
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,600
It’s a love with a big age gap.

161
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,930
The last candidate.

162
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,660
Thank you.

163
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,690
You’re welcome.

164
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
She is a college student.

165
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,050
Although our society is now more open to it,

166
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,250
I think they are not ready to come out.

167
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,540
Are you sure you have investigated her?

168
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,900
A college student?

169
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,400
Female.

170
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,050
A food vendor?

171
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,980
And a campus guard?

172
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,800
Yes.

173
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,630
The number might seem small,
but it’s enough for an introvert.

174
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,420
She is definitely dating someone.

175
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,880
My gut is never wrong.

176
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,200
I’ll wait and see if you are wrong or not.

177
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,500
Here is your order.

178
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,210
Thank you.

179
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,960
Yes.

180
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,560
Where is it?

181
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,050
How are things over there?

182
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,560
What is the guard doing?

183
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,440
What else can he do? He’s doing his job.

184
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,620
Let’s end the call. You’re wasting my time.

185
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,790
Hello.

186
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,460
You are on your way?

187
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,730
Let’s meet at the same place.

188
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,260
It’s a love with a big age gap.

189
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,930
That’s why they need to hide their relationship.

190
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,200
The snake has some skills that I don’t.

191
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,380
I think he’s chatting with Khao.

192
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,670
Here we go.

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,070
Why is he acting suspicious?

194
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,300
Is Jued’s guess right?

195
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,870
He’s definitely going to meet Khao.

196
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh.

197
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,970
Where did they go?

198
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,750
I should be the one asking you.

199
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,410
Where is the guard?

200
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,380
I don’t know.

201
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,310
I don’t know either.

202
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,110
- You’re so smooth.
- Shh!

203
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,180
What should we do?

204
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,820
How much is it?

205
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,220
That’s a good price.

206
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,070
Sure. I’ll wire the money to you right away.

207
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,300
Done.

208
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,470
It’s a good price.

209
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,700
I got the money.

210
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,320
Shall we?

211
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,130
Sure.

212
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,310
Here.

213
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,290
It’s a popular edition.

214
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,730
Yes, it is.

215
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,270
Two of the candidates are ruled out.

216
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,810
We still have the last candidate.

217
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,370
We need extra help on this one.

218
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,840
We need to push them to show their true feelings.

219
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,900
Are you done reading them?

220
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,360
Yes.

221
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,160
Is this for me?

222
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,240
No.

223
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,080
But…

224
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,370
Yes, the candies are mine.

225
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,410
I guess I accidentally put it there.

226
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,900
I’ll give you one.

227
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,940
Darn it. She took the whole bag.

228
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,000
You have incredible gut feelings.

229
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,880
We lost a bag of candies for nothing.

230
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,690
Stop being sarcastic.

231
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,540
Dating?

232
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,100
They don’t even know each other.

233
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,170
I shouldn’t have believed you.
What a waste of time.

234
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,670
At least, we rule out another candidate.

235
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,120
Let’s call off the day.

236
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,220
I have plans.

237
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,610
With a girl?

238
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,110
Don’t be nosy.

239
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,670
It’s not your business.

240
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,790
If you’re going to meet a girl,

241
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,550
you should wipe the lipstick off first.

242
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,060
Stay still.

243
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,880
Shh!

244
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,210
Who are you?

245
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,760
Here.

246
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,800
This is a gift from me.

247
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,790
You said you like it, don’t you?

248
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,400
Is this what I think it is?

249
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,640
Yes.

250
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,980
I gave you the whole set.

251
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,790
They come in various colors and sizes.

252
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,830
Oh, wow!

253
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,530
They really come in various colors and sizes.

254
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,490
It’s the whole set.

255
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,710
I’ll try every one of them.

256
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,090
What are you doing?

257
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,820
I’m transcribing audio to text
as a side job to get extra money.

258
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,180
Me too.

259
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,470
I also have a side job.

260
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,740
Are you also doing an audio transcription job?

261
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,010
Yes,

262
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,840
but I’m not doing it today.

263
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,210
Do you want me to help you?

264
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,180
Really?

265
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,600
You are so sweet.

266
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,680
I’m transcribing a lecture…

267
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,820
Who is that? He is a hunk.

268
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,450
Kong.

269
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,900
He’s a senior in my faculty.

270
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,730
I see.

271
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,400
Is that your parcel?

272
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,960
No.

273
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,120
But I saw your name on it

274
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,020
and it also has the same sticker.

275
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,180
You probably mistook it.

276
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
Since we are friends,
we can talk about everything, right?

277
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,530
Yes.

278
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,140
I’m sorry for lying to you.

279
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,670
That was my parcel.

280
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,660
Then why did Kong have the parcel?

281
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,920
Kong and I…

282
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,310
We are dating.

283
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,030
Huh?!

284
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,060
Khao has been dating Kong for three months.

285
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,270
But they keep their relationship a secret.

286
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,340
Because Khao thinks she’s just an ordinary girl.

287
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,940
She doesn’t deserve to be with him.

288
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,310
Why a sweet girl like Khao is dating a guy like Kong?

289
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,590
Because he’s good-looking.

290
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,590
Sis, he’s not asking you.

291
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,730
He’s just talking to himself.

292
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,530
You don’t need to answer it.

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,350
I thought he was asking me.

294
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,370
I’m sorry.

295
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,320
Kong is very handsome.

296
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,420
But he is a real scumbag.

297
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,690
Everyone on the campus knows it.

298
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,740
You’re right.

299
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,080
He is known for taking advantage of women.

300
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,980
Someone collected the data and summarized it.

301
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,000
Look.

302
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:21,320
The first girl got her heart broken by him
and dropped out of school.

303
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,120
This girl.

304
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,850
She was drinking beer for seven days straight.

305
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,040
She was sad and wasted.

306
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,090
I feel bad for her liver.

307
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,580
This girl became a nun
and lives in a remote temple.

308
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,500
This is scary.

309
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,080
Your gut feelings are right.

310
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,230
He’s a real scumbag.

311
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,200
It won’t be hard to break them up.

312
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,030
What about Khao?

313
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,630
What will happen to her?

314
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,260
Will she end up like these girls?

315
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,340
Don’t worry.

316
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,750
The sooner they break up,

317
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,090
the less attached they will feel.

318
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,360
We will break them up as soon as possible.

319
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,210
We will use the way
that will hurt her feelings the least.

320
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Thank you.

321
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,250
Please be mindful of her feelings.

322
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,360
She is a good friend to me.

323
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,050
I love her too.

324
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,880
Here.

325
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,310
It’s the lecture I want to ask you to transcribe.

326
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,060
The topic of the lecture is
“What to do when falling for a terrible person.”

327
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,760
I only transcribe the audio, right?

328
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,650
Yes.

329
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,690
You need to carefully listen to it

330
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,740
and transcribe every word.

331
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,180
Okay.

332
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,280
(I think you all have heard this proverb,
“Bad company corrupts good character.”)

333
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,200
(If you have a bad company,
it can lead you down the wrong path.)

334
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,100
(What you need to do is obvious.)

335
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,450
(You need to stop seeing them.)

336
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,210
(That’s right. Stop seeing them.)

337
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,060
(I’ll repeat it. Stop seeing them.)

338
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,530
(Stop seeing them.)

339
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,560
(I’ll repeat it. Stop seeing them.)

340
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
(Stop seeing them.)

341
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,470
(I’ll repeat it. Stop seeing them.)

342
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,920
(Stop seeing them.)

343
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,940
What do you think about the lecture?

344
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,260
I think…

345
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,740
If I have bad company,

346
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,330
they will keep bringing bad things into my life.

347
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,080
Right?

348
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,910
Then you should stop seeing them.

349
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,620
I also notice that this is your voice.

350
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,600
You want me to listen to it.

351
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,360
Because you want to warn me about Kong, right?

352
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,250
Yes.

353
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,840
If he were a good man,

354
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,490
he wouldn’t have kept your relationship a secret.

355
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,850
But this is what we want.

356
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,010
Is this what you want or what he wants?

357
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,560
Khao, you should break up with Kong.

358
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,960
If he was proud to have you as his girlfriend,

359
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,850
he wouldn’t think you were just an ordinary girl

360
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,100
who didn’t deserve to be with him.

361
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,100
I thought an ordinary man like me

362
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,150
deserves an ordinary woman like you.

363
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,510
Unlike Prang, I can go anywhere with her

364
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,030
without feeling embarrassed.

365
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,440
Unlike you, I only feel sorry for you.

366
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,910
He will go everywhere with you
without feeling embarrassed.

367
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,370
I don’t want you to go through this.

368
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,870
Khao, trust me.

369
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,030
I had been through it.

370
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,490
Kong is a terrible man.

371
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,550
He broke many girls’ hearts.

372
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,450
You think he’s a terrible man because he dated girls

373
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,520
and broke up with them when things didn’t work out?

374
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,750
But Khao…

375
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,310
Jued, don’t contact me again.

376
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,550
[Where are you?

377
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,130
Can you come to see me at the office?]

378
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,810
What’s up?

379
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,270
I dig up information on Kong.

380
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,590
I found his secret account promoting sexual content.

381
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,820
He posted his sex tape with Khao online

382
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,200
for subscription fees.

383
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,220
I know he is a horrible man.

384
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,620
But I never thought that he would be this horrible.

385
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,620
What are you doing?

386
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,870
But this is not bad.

387
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,300
Our mission will be much easier.

388
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,460
[Did you see it?]

389
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,760
[Our classmate is an OF content creator.]

390
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,160
[OMG! Who is it?]

391
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,190
[I saw her on the campus earlier this morning.]

392
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,050
[Is ‘K’ the guy in the video?]

393
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,810
[‘K’, the good-looking guy?]

394
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,440
[Can you share it?]
[Gosh! Are you sure?]

395
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,940
[Was it good?]
[She is probably pressed for money.]

396
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,440
[What is going on?]

397
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,870
[Everyone is talking about it.]

398
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,430
[She’s in my class.]

399
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,570
[I think I saw her on the campus before.]
[It’s so hot.]

400
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,320
[She looks familiar.]
[Did professors know about it?]

401
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,290
[This is unbelievable.]
[Someone please spill the tea.]

402
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,930
[This is the biggest buzz right now.]
[I want to see her partner’s face.]

403
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,140
Khao.

404
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,420
Khao.

405
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,800
What are we going to do about it?

406
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,570
Khao.

407
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,600
How did it happen?

408
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,360
Khao, wait.

409
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,810
I know you are still mad at me.

410
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,010
But I have something to tell you.

411
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,690
I’m busy.

412
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,980
Khao, please hear me out.

413
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,550
I told you I’m busy.

414
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,080
I can’t talk to you right now.

415
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,190
I have an errand to do.

416
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,420
Kong is in trouble.

417
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,120
Khao.

418
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,090
We can tell each other everything, right?

419
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,930
Kong is arrested.

420
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,390
For distributing pornography.

421
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,860
I…

422
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,670
I’m the victim.

423
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,470
Hello.

424
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,250
Boss, did you report Kong to the police?

425
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,110
Yes.

426
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,030
Don’t you think you cross the line?

427
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,360
(Cross the line?)

428
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,240
Kong is a scumbag. You know it.

429
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,610
It’s true.

430
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,620
But Khao is the victim.

431
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,730
She should be the first one to know about it.

432
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,820
It should be her call,
whether to report it to the police or do something with it.

433
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,080
I just do what I need to do.

434
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,840
What else do you want from me?

435
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,800
You are so selfish.

436
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,610
You only care about yourself.

437
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,690
You are acting unprofessionally.

438
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,610
You can’t separate work from personal feelings.

439
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,470
Khao.

440
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,220
I’ve been looking for you.

441
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,840
I’m sorry for what happened to you.

442
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,910
But it will pass.

443
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,060
I don’t think I can get through it.

444
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,170
I thought
my relationship with Kong was going well.

445
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,600
Think of it as lucky
that you got away from the horrible man.

446
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,490
You will find a better man.

447
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,280
Someone has a crush on you.

448
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,850
I don’t want a new guy.

449
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,170
I want to be with Kong.

450
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,440
Even when he did this terrible thing to you?

451
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,580
He didn’t do anything to me.

452
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,400
Khao, listen to me.

453
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,770
Kong secretly filmed you
when you were having sex.

454
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,730
He posted the video on the internet.

455
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,690
He didn’t secretly film me.

456
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,820
Huh?

457
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,980
I agreed to do it.

458
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,300
[Kong was arrested.]

459
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,410
[His charge is serious.
They will break up soon.]

460
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,930
[Okay, I’ll go to the campus to see her.]

461
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,880
Can you pay attention to me?

462
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,980
Can I have another beer?

463
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,920
Yes.

464
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,130
I just gave an update to my client.

465
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,750
You are so selfish.

466
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,170
You only care about yourself.

467
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,210
Kong and I used the video to earn money
to start our lives together.

468
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,660
I didn’t want anyone to know about it.

469
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,280
I was worried that we might be in trouble.

470
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,480
That’s why we chose to hide our relationship.

471
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,380
So Kong…

472
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,570
He’s not a terrible man like you and others think.

473
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,870
He takes the blame
and refuses to say that I agreed to do it.

474
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,550
He is worried that I will be in trouble.

475
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,780
I need to find money to bail him out.

476
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,130
How can I find the money?

477
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,410
If I ask the money from my parents,

478
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,470
they will find out about it.

479
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,520
If I can’t find the money,

480
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,550
Kong will stay in jail.

481
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,790
Jued is calling.

482
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,050
What is she going to scold me for this time?

483
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,500
(Are you with a girl?)

484
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,010
Yes.

485
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,210
Why?

486
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,790
Can I borrow 50,000 baht from you?

487
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,680
You just scolded me.

488
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,170
Now, you want to borrow money from me?

489
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,200
We misunderstood the situation.

490
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,570
Khao agreed to film the video.

491
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,810
Kong didn’t secretly film her.

492
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,060
That’s not our business.

493
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,950
But we caused their problem.

494
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,310
Khao is so stressed
that she wants to jump out of the building.

495
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,540
I think we should take responsibility for it.

496
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,460
Anyway, wire me the money.

497
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,990
No.

498
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,770
My job is to break them up. That’s it.

499
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,490
Right. I forgot that you are heartless.

500
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,400
You care about no one.

501
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:04,930
You, wazzock!

502
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,370
Hey.

503
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,250
Do you know what ‘wazzock’ means?

504
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,740
How would I know?

505
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,080
I haven’t scolded her back,
but she already ended the call.

506
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,020
You’re acting strange lately.

507
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,200
This umbrella is a free giveaway.

508
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,740
What happened to your hand?

509
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,310
When did you learn to treat a wound?

510
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,700
It looks sloppy.

511
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,610
Why didn’t you come to me like you always did?

512
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,340
Can we pay the bail bond in installments?

513
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,030
Every problem has a solution.

514
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,210
I know.

515
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,860
But when I don’t have the money, I feel lost.

516
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,560
Kong and I just tried to start our lives together.

517
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,160
What did we do wrong?

518
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,850
No.

519
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,490
You didn’t do anything wrong.

520
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,390
How can I find the money?

521
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,570
I can pay it for you.

522
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,720
I heard about everything.

523
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,060
I’ll pay for Kong’s bail bond.

524
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,700
Why are you helping him?

525
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,220
I’m not helping him.

526
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,720
I’m helping you.

527
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,930
Don’t forget.

528
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,820
I’m your best supporter.

529
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,560
Thank you.

530
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,170
I’ll slowly pay it back.

531
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,980
It’s okay.

532
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,050
You don’t need to pay it back.

533
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,210
But I want something in exchange.

534
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,430
You have to break up with Kong.

535
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,060
Huh?

536
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,570
Your mistake is dating the wrong man.

537
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,200
It’s okay.

538
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,410
You just have to forget
the terrible things that happened.

539
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,650
You can start again with me.

540
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,800
I can support you.

541
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,410
I will never let you do that kind of thing
to earn money again.

542
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,060
Khao.

543
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,370
I love you.

544
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,580
Umm.

545
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,210
It’s okay.

546
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,290
I’m okay with everything.

547
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,840
I don’t care what you have done

548
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,870
as long as you accept my love.

549
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,360
I’m sorry, Jang.

550
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,530
But I only see you as a friend.

551
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,640
But I’m a good man.

552
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,420
I care about you.

553
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,780
I’m sincere with you.

554
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,720
I’ve always been nice to you.

555
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,280
I take lecture notes for you.

556
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,260
I know what you like and don’t like.

557
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,440
It’s true.

558
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,660
You have been nice to me.

559
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,280
Thank you so much.

560
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,270
But I never think of you that way.

561
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,260
How dare a girl like you reject me?

562
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,580
A girl who is willing to get naked
and show it to anyone for money.

563
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,600
Jang, you…

564
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,930
Where did you get that kind of confidence from?

565
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,820
You are a total trash.

566
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,550
How dare you play hard to get?

567
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,640
If it weren’t for me, no one would have taken you.

568
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,370
Let her go.

569
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,410
Where did you get that kind of confidence
to say this to her?

570
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,350
Let’s go, Khao.

571
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,410
Don’t listen to him.

572
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,220
Come here.

573
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,130
Stop it.

574
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,570
If you don’t mind sleeping with Kong
and showing it to everyone,

575
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,330
you are like a town bike.

576
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,710
I can do anything to you.

577
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,700
Let her go.

578
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,530
Let me go.

579
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,450
What the hell is wrong with you?

580
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,560
You want to try me?

581
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,720
Get away from me.

582
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,030
Stop butting in.

583
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,390
I’m your client.

584
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,750
Then I will cancel your contract.

585
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,920
Go away.

586
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,440
Are you hurt?

587
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,590
Boss.

588
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,860
Boss.

589
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,210
(Sorry. The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at this time.)

590
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,640
(Please leave a message after the tone.)

591
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,900
(Jued.)

592
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,180
(Where are you?)

593
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,810
(I…)

594
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,980
(I miss you.)

595
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:01,570
(I want to thank you
for being by my side during the dark time.)

596
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,310
(Without you, I wouldn’t know what to do.)

597
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,720
(About Kong and I, you don’t need to worry.)

598
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,140
(Because…)

599
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:33,590
Kong.

600
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,680
Are you no longer worried
about going public with our relationship?

601
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,340
I am worried.

602
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,200
But I’ll accept the consequences of my actions.

603
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,830
Mr. Chan is very mad.

604
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,170
You not only fail to get payments from the client

605
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,180
but also need to pay compensation for attacking him.

606
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,890
The client crossed the line.

607
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,600
He attacked my partner.

608
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,560
I know that but…

609
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,210
But what?

610
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,730
But you usually have a better way to handle it.

611
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,050
What’s going on with you?

612
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,900
You have been acting strange lately.

613
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,830
Can I ask you something?

614
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,600
You never care what others think.

615
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,040
So why do you care about what she said?

616
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Look at me.

617
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,230
Why would I care about other people?

618
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,650
It’s okay.

619
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,350
I’m here.

620
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,760
Their relationship is going well.

621
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,700
Why does she want to break them up?

622
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,510
Because things are going well for them.

623
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,840
So his ex gets jealous.

624
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,780
This is normal.

625
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,040
I’ll handle this case alone.

626
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,780
Why?

627
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,220
When you get close to someone,
you always go soft and ruin our job.

628
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,740
Eat whatever I make you.

629
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,430
Give me the damn plate.

630
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,550
She is still mad at me.

631
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,540
Can you help me?

632
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,630
Let’s go on a double date tomorrow.

633
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,000
No woman can stand seeing other couples
being more lovey-dovey than their couple.

634
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,960
Let’s compete to see who will be more lovey-dovey.
