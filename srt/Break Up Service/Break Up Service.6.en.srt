1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,520
Stop butting in.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,920
You not only fail to get payments from the client

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,280
but also need to pay compensation for attacking him.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,840
The client crossed the line.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,260
He attacked my partner.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,330
You never care what others think.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,410
So why do you care about what she said?

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,690
Why would I care about other people?

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,120
Boss.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,510
Boss.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,490
It’s okay.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,170
I’m here.

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,830
I miss you.

14
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,250
[Our anniversary is coming.
Where should we go to celebrate it?]

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,380
[A mountain top.]

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,900
[A rooftop.]

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,600
[Anywhere is good as long as you are together.]

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,960
[Why don’t you go to Pop’s favorite park?
We used to go there together.]

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,600
[I want to go there.]

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,780
[Sure, Kormai.]

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,520
[Thank you for your suggestion, Nuch.]

22
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,100
I’ll report them all.

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,220
Go show off your love somewhere else.

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,990
[Do you want to break them up?]

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
[Do you want to break them up?]

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
[Do you want to break them up?]

27
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,700
[Client – Nuch]
What a brat!

28
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,780
Their relationship is going well.

29
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,750
Why does she want them to break up?

30
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,020
Because their love is going well.

31
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,400
That’s why his ex gets jealous.

32
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,410
It’s normal.

33
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,630
Why do you care so much?

34
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,210
You’ve only known her for a short time.

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,390
Kormai is super nice to me.

36
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,660
She helps me with everything.

37
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,380
When the water wasn’t running, the power went out,

38
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,230
the pipe was clogged, and a centipede was in my room.

39
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,660
She helped solve everything.

40
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,950
Recently, I had a stomach ache.

41
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,980
She took me to the hospital.

42
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,300
Where is the doctor?

43
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,770
Why does it take so long?

44
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,790
Stay strong.

45
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,560
No, I’ll get a doctor to help you.

46
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,180
Doctor, this way.

47
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,490
You can go back to the surgery later.

48
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,530
You need to help my friend first.

49
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,680
Doctor, hurry up.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,360
Jued.

51
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,190
Jued.

52
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,710
Did I come too late?

53
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,010
Why didn’t you wait for me?

54
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,480
Miss.

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,560
Miss.

56
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,430
Your friend is waiting at the counter over there.

57
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,390
Jued.

58
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,530
How are you? Are you okay?

59
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,840
You are not dying, are you?

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,290
I’m fine.

61
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,160
I went to the bathroom.

62
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,150
I was constipated.

63
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,680
But I’m fine now.

64
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,690
Together.

65
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,350
I’m sorry.

66
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,550
Huh?

67
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,890
Your constipation was so bad
that you needed to go to the hospital?

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,720
The last mission stressed me out.

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,500
I couldn’t sleep.

70
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,980
My body was acting weird.

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,500
My point is that Kormai has been so nice to me.

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,420
I understand you.

73
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,910
But you need to separate work from friendship.

74
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:03,920
Am I right, Boss?

75
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,470
Boss.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,120
So you failed your mission.

77
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,510
You also lent money to the couple
whom you were supposed to break up.

78
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,420
Yes.

79
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,670
You also get hurt to save Jued.

80
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,040
Can you now admit that you care about her?

81
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:25,990
No.

82
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,350
I don’t care about her.

83
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,090
Then why did you do that?

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,880
I just…

85
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,240
You can’t explain it.

86
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,590
If you can’t, then don’t.

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,170
You just admit that you care about the snake,
you stubborn farmer.

88
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,740
Just admit it. Don’t be shy.

89
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,730
Are you afraid that I will tease you about it?

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,590
Don’t worry, Boss.

91
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,830
I’ll definitely tease you about it.

92
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,630
I won’t miss the chance.

93
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,510
You’re in denial. You said you didn’t care.

94
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,090
You care about her, a big time.

95
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,000
I think I’m just confused
because I get too close to her.

96
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,220
I’ll show you, Oat.

97
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,890
I’ll quickly get rid of this rubbish energy.

98
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,880
Boss.

99
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,080
Boss.

100
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,670
Boss.

101
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,690
Ouch.

102
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,620
Why did you give me static shock?

103
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,680
What?

104
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,550
Did you two have a spark?

105
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,840
Are you talking about a romantic spark?

106
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,310
What romantic spark?

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,130
It’s a static spark due to dry skin.

108
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,200
You should put on some lotion.

109
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,700
Why did you touch me?

110
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,320
We were briefing the new case

111
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,780
but your mind drifted away.

112
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,040
You lost your touch.

113
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,160
You not only failed your mission

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,310
but also couldn’t stay focused.

115
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,110
I’ll let you two talk.

116
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,060
My work here is done.

117
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,530
Ouch.

118
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,940
I’ll work on this case alone.

119
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,300
Why?

120
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,330
When you are close to someone,
you always go soft on them and ruin our work.

121
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:39,960
Are you going to say it’s not true?

122
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,690
It’s true.

123
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,300
To be honest, I don’t want to break them up.

124
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,040
I’ll be your support team.

125
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,750
I’ll send you their information.

126
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,530
What do you know about them?

127
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,810
They love each other very much.

128
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,610
They get along very well.

129
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,170
Kormai knows how to pamper him.

130
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,020
She barely acts unreasonably.

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,420
Pop always goes along with what she wants.

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,740
If there is a weak point in their relationship,

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,490
it’s during Kormai’s period.

134
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,460
The yolk bursts.

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
It’s okay. I can eat it.

136
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,850
Then you eat this ruined egg.

137
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,430
[The five dangerous days!]

138
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,360
Here is a hot water bag for you, sweetie.

139
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,570
Why are you giving me the bag?

140
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,440
I want a plate.

141
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,250
If you want to break them up,

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,340
Then do it yourself.

143
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,530
You have to do it during the five days.

144
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,190
Honey, the bag.

145
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,150
DAY 1

146
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,650
Honey.
DAY 1

147
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,700
DAY 1

148
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,350
Honey.
DAY 1

149
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,850
DAY 1

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,360
DAY 2
Hello, Boss.

151
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,270
Hi.

152
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,820
Are you doing Jued’s laundry?

153
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,900
She went to a silent meditation retreat.

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,750
But that’s good.

155
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,360
She easily gets annoyed lately.

156
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,190
She’s having a period.

157
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,780
She always blames the hormones.

158
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,080
Does your girlfriend also act like this?

159
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,560
Sometimes.

160
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,390
Do you think it’s just an excuse

161
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,370
or do they want to control us?

162
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,530
It’s real.

163
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,440
I studied it.

164
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,090
Their hormones fluctuate.

165
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,500
It affects their bodies.

166
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,270
They get gassy, have breast swelling,
feel tired, and get pimples.

167
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,160
We should be more understanding of them.

168
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,830
So they choose to vent out on us?

169
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,990
Let’s say they’re just being sensitive.

170
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,840
So we need to be their rock.

171
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,990
Their rock?

172
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,670
We’re more like their punching bag.

173
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,670
Let’s say we have to be everything for them.

174
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,030
A shoulder for them to lean on.

175
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,220
An umbrella to shield them from the rain.

176
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,780
A bumper to protect them from crash impact.

177
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,790
This is a big burden for women.

178
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,650
That’s why there’s a song tribute to mothers.

179
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,960
♪ Mom, I am forever grateful… ♪

180
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,220
Okay, I get it.

181
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,740
You’re welcome.

182
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,180
We both have a girlfriend.

183
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,940
You can always talk to me.

184
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,860
I’m going to buy soy milk.

185
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,460
It can help ease mood swings.

186
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,240
Do you want one?

187
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,610
It will help ease your frustration with Jued.

188
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,490
No, thank you.

189
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,330
Fine.

190
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,410
Miss.

191
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,110
I’ll have one plain soy milk.

192
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,810
My girlfriend doesn’t like toppings.

193
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,640
Sure.

194
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,710
Thanks.

195
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,580
I’ll get rid of the toppings.

196
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,970
Honey, I’ll buy you a new one.

197
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,560
No, I don’t want to eat it anymore.

198
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,590
What the heck?!

199
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,120
I’ll buy you two cups.

200
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,260
Honey.

201
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,760
Honey.

202
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,260
Shut up.

203
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,050
Who cares about you?

204
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,970
See?

205
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,200
I can work well without you.

206
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,590
Jued, why did you give in to a has-been like him
and sleep over at the office?

207
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,270
You’re such a nice person.

208
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,760
Boss has a mission to do.

209
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,440
I’ve been waiting for this day for so long.

210
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,540
The day that we can bully
an arrogant brat like him.

211
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,220
Boss failed a mission.

212
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,120
There you go.

213
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,610
Jued, I know you hate him the most among us.

214
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,290
Do you want to try it?

215
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,270
Come on.

216
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,230
Hurry up. Come here.

217
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,500
Let’s enjoy it.

218
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,830
Give it a go.

219
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,320
Go.

220
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,240
Good.

221
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Why don’t we use this chance
to transfer Jued to the other team?

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,310
Sure.

223
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,430
You can write the reason for the transfer

224
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,020
it’s because your partner sucks and failed a mission.

225
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,940
Boss.

226
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,430
Boss.

227
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,250
I don’t want to transfer to the other team anymore.

228
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,530
Why?

229
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,500
After working with him for a while,
he’s not a bad person.

230
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,990
My goodness.

231
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,370
Jued, did he gaslight you?

232
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,270
You can tell me.

233
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,170
That’s right.

234
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,700
He must mislead you into thinking
that he’s a good person.

235
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,630
Calm down. He didn’t gaslight me.

236
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,870
My goodness.

237
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,790
Why are you defending him, Jued?

238
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:13,460
If he fails again, I’ll manipulate Mr. Chan to think
that Boss is no longer important to the company.

239
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,590
He should be fired

240
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,970
and Team A should be disbanded.

241
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,640
Is it a good idea?

242
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,690
Yes.

243
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,550
Don’t worry. We will help you out.

244
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,790
It’s okay.

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,550
DAY 3

246
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,860
I’m leaving, honey.
DAY 3

247
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,810
DAY 3

248
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,060
Are you going to work?

249
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,760
I have to fix bugs for my client.

250
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,660
Yes.

251
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,500
I’m a freelance programmer.

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,800
What about you?

253
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,670
I work from home today.

254
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,010
Work from home?

255
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,970
Yes.

256
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,160
Have a good day.

257
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,270
You too.

258
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,600
Honey.

259
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,730
I forgot my key.

260
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,590
You are so forgetful.

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,070
I’m sorry.

262
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,610
You can go back to your nap.

263
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,480
I can find it myself.

264
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,850
You said like you have ever found what you lost.

265
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,350
Where did you put it?

266
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,200
Honey, don’t get upset.

267
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,790
Is it over there? Where did you put it?

268
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,610
You never remember where you put it.

269
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,830
I’m sorry, honey.

270
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,890
Is it under the sofa?

271
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,080
You may be right.

272
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,240
Who is at the door?

273
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,100
Jued.

274
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,520
I haven’t seen you for a few days.

275
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,660
I went to Pattaya.

276
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,730
I bought dried giant catfish for you.

277
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,220
But your boyfriend told me
you went to a meditation retreat.

278
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,310
Why did you go to Pattaya?

279
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,440
The meditation center is located in Pattaya.

280
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,760
I also want to share the merit with you.

281
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,390
Let’s pray together.

282
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,650
One, two, three.

283
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,250
Amen.

284
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,910
(What are you doing there?)

285
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,980
Let’s fry the dried giant catfish.

286
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,950
Come on.

287
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,520
But we need to look for my key first.

288
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,740
I can’t remember where I put it.

289
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,510
Your key.

290
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,280
I can’t find it.

291
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,900
It’s probably under the rug.

292
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,980
That’s my key.

293
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,660
It was on the floor.

294
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,460
Thanks.

295
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,200
You are not only forgetful but also oblivious.

296
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,990
I’m sorry.

297
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,950
I got to go to work.

298
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,900
My bag.

299
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,850
They said if the dried fish is cooked by a couple,
it will taste even better.

300
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,350
Let’s try it.

301
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,730
I never heard of that.

302
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,310
Let’s try to see if it’s true.

303
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,520
Come on.

304
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,280
Open the bag.

305
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,920
You, open the bag.

306
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,360
I’ll get it for you.

307
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,840
Here.

308
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,380
But I have to go…

309
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,110
Didn’t you say you would work
as my support team?

310
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,420
Why did you come here?

311
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,460
But I just helped you out.

312
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,020
Even if you weren’t there,

313
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,370
I would have figured a way out anyway.

314
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,400
Your lie doesn’t make sense.

315
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,570
It was obvious
that you were about to get caught.

316
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,590
Don’t you know that Nut wants to get rid…

317
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,370
Get rid of what?

318
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,290
Get rid of mosquitoes.

319
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,670
Mr. Chan told her
to get rid of mosquitoes in the office.

320
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,930
I can’t sleep over at the office anymore.

321
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,390
So I came here to help you.

322
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,830
When did I ask for your help?

323
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,290
I changed my mind.

324
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,620
I want to prove that
I can separate work from personal feelings.

325
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,960
Please.

326
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,820
Let me help you.

327
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,900
No.

328
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,100
Go…

329
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,450
If you’re afraid of getting a spark,
then you’d better let me help you.

330
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,230
I’m not afraid.

331
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,650
Why would I be afraid of you?

332
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:54,900
Are you sure?

333
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,580
Fine. If you want to help.

334
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,110
Do whatever you want.

335
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,880
That’s all.

336
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,570
Boss.

337
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,560
You can sleep on the bed tonight.

338
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,610
I’ll sleep on the floor.

339
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,910
Why do we need to sleep in the same room?

340
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,670
You can sleep here.

341
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,100
Then we have to turn on another AC.

342
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,050
I’m paying for the electricity bill.

343
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,520
You are so stingy that you’re willing
to sleep in the same room with me?

344
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,760
I’m not your type anyway.

345
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,020
Am I wrong?

346
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,050
It’s good that you know that.

347
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,860
Fine. Let’s do what I say.

348
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,620
Why did you go into their room?

349
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,250
I…

350
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,350
I planted a few bombs.

351
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,270
Honey, are you done? I have to pee.

352
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,300
If you can’t control your direction,

353
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,450
then go use the condo’s public toilet.

354
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,540
Go!

355
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,570
You’re a genius.

356
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,310
That’s not my last bomb.

357
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,480
Go away.

358
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,840
What? I won’t give you a spark.

359
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,460
I already put lotion on my skin.

360
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,670
My skin is soft and smells nice.

361
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,360
Touch it.

362
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,150
No.

363
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,230
Touch it.

364
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,130
I said no.

365
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,050
I’m a human, not an electric eel.

366
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,010
It won’t kill you to touch me.

367
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,740
Come on.

368
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,240
No.

369
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,800
Come on.

370
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,430
No.

371
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,110
See? There are no sparks.

372
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,310
You’re doing this.

373
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,480
Aren’t you afraid of me?

374
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,110
No.

375
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,390
You said I’m not your type.

376
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,790
I know you won’t make a move on me.

377
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,430
Why is my heart beating so fast?

378
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,630
Am I…?

379
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,890
Boss, are you still up?

380
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,360
Boss.

381
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,720
Why is he sleeping with open eyes?

382
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,400
This is so creepy.

383
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,340
Boss.

384
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,230
Boss.

385
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,310
Boss.

386
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,200
Boss.

387
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,990
Why are you sleeping here?

388
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,750
Even if you have a fight,
you can’t sleep in the common area.

389
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,420
You should get up

390
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,190
before the condo manager comes.

391
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,220
Otherwise, he will fine you.

392
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,410
Hey, will you stop being mad at me?

393
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,220
I’m sorry for teasing you last night.

394
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,980
I didn’t know that you were that conservative.

395
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,300
It’s not that.

396
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,060
I couldn’t sleep because of you.

397
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,480
Me?

398
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,910
What did I do?

399
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,700
You…

400
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,420
(Shit. Let’s pretend that I’m sleeping.)

401
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,670
Why is he sleeping with open eyes?

402
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,370
This is so creepy.

403
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,320
You snored.

404
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,510
I snored?

405
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,460
Your snore was so loud.

406
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,360
I never knew I snored.

407
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,440
Then why didn’t you sleep in the living room?

408
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,940
You said it was energy-inefficient
to sleep in the living room.

409
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,190
That’s why I came to sleep here.

410
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,450
One more thing, if I slept in the living room,

411
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,190
I still could hear your snore.

412
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,230
You acted like I snored into a microphone.

413
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,970
You need to go to sleep at the office tonight.

414
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,260
The mosquito control should be done by now.

415
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,320
Fine.

416
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,400
But you have to let me help you with this case.

417
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,430
I just told the guy over there.

418
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,260
There’s another one here.

419
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,920
What’s wrong with them?

420
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,000
Pop,

421
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,880
why are you sleeping here?

422
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,730
Last night.

423
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,950
Honey, I cleaned the toilet. It’s shining like new.

424
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,470
Do you know how much this cream costs?

425
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,690
I didn’t do it.

426
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,630
Pop.

427
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:15,820
How many times did I tell you
not to shave your beard here?!

428
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,410
This bomb is destructive.

429
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,040
Right?

430
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,380
Why does her period seem so long this month?

431
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,180
Tomorrow is our anniversary.

432
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,730
If she is still mad at me,

433
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,970
she won’t go to celebrate with me.

434
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,140
Can you help me?

435
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,640
How?

436
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,200
Let’s go on a double date tomorrow.

437
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,920
If you go with me, she will agree to go.

438
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,150
Please.

439
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,270
Aren’t you two on the outs?

440
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,790
That’s great.

441
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,190
If we go together, it can help ease the tension.

442
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,330
Please.

443
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,820
DAY 5

444
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,670
Luckily, the sunlight is not strong today.

445
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,970
Are you hot?

446
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,210
Today is the last day of the five dangerous days.

447
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,810
If you can’t break them up today,

448
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:23,930
it will be harder to succeed.

449
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,440
Are you hot?

450
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,990
I have a plan.

451
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,310
A double date has both pros and cons.

452
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,980
If there are tensions,

453
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,120
she will feel even more stressed.

454
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,210
Can I borrow your arm?

455
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,230
No woman can stand seeing other couples
acting more lovey-dovey than their couple.

456
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,090
Let’s compete.

457
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,940
Where shall we go?

458
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,530
Who can be more lovey-dovey?

459
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,860
Sure.

460
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,380
I won’t go easy on you.

461
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,140
Is this lovey-dovey enough?

462
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,690
Not really.

463
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,280
Honey.

464
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,290
It’s hot.

465
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,330
It’s hotter than before.

466
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,200
Stop it.

467
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,090
Isn’t it delicious?

468
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,510
Have a bite.

469
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,650
I’ll fan you.

470
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,600
Let’s take a picture together.

471
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,310
Sure.

472
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,700
This is not enough.

473
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,650
I don’t want to do it anymore.

474
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,970
I’ll check on Kormai.

475
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,920
I heard that you two were fighting the other night.

476
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,230
Pop shouldn’t do that.

477
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,150
If I were you, I would be upset like you.

478
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,020
He told my boyfriend that you were acting like this
because of your period.

479
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,350
He said that?

480
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,100
Yes.

481
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,640
I’m not telling you this

482
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,840
to stir things up between you.

483
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,000
But I don’t like what he said.

484
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,430
Men always blame women for it.

485
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,740
But they are also partly wrong.

486
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,880
You are right.

487
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,820
This time,

488
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,810
my hormones are not the only reason I feel upset.

489
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,390
There is another thing

490
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,550
that has been bothering me for a few days.

491
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,690
[Our anniversary is coming.
Where should we go to celebrate it?]

492
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,310
[Why don’t you go to Pop’s favorite park?
We used to go there together.]

493
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,750
I know that they have a history together.

494
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,990
I never asked him about it

495
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,710
or checked out her social media.

496
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,520
But I can’t help it this time.

497
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,670
[I want to go there.]

498
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,320
[Sure, Kormai.]

499
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,200
[Thank you for your suggestion, Nuch.]

500
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,860
The things that we do together,

501
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,700
he did with her before.

502
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,230
Do you think

503
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,480
they still have feelings for each other?

504
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,490
Why don’t you ask Pop?

505
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,570
I don’t want Pop to think I’m being unreasonable.

506
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,000
Two glasses, right?

507
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,500
Yes.

508
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,770
Your couple looks very lovey-dovey.

509
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,130
My girlfriend is upset after seeing you two.

510
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,440
No way.

511
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,660
If Kormai were more cooperative,

512
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,860
your couple could be more lovey-dovey than ours.

513
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,240
It’s too bad.

514
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,010
Today is your anniversary.

515
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,050
If Jued did this to me, I would feel upset.

516
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,500
This is not over yet.

517
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,600
I’ll show you something.

518
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,650
A memory book for our anniversary gift.

519
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,820
I made it myself.

520
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,960
I sent the file to a print shop to print it out.

521
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,250
The book will be delivered to the condo
this evening.

522
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,320
You should make one for Jued.

523
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,060
She will say I copy you.

524
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,190
If I don’t tell, how would she know?

525
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,010
One more thing, we both have a girlfriend.

526
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,540
We can share our ideas.

527
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,820
Thank you so much.

528
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:46,300
Can you send me your file to use as a reference?

529
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,350
No problem.

530
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,550
I sent it

531
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,630
How is it?

532
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,950
Don’t they look exactly the same?

533
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,830
I spent the whole night making it.

534
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,630
It looks great.

535
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,640
Why do you have the real book?

536
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,880
This?

537
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,620
I took it from their mailbox.

538
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,850
I’m worried that Pop will see it first.

539
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,630
You’ll put the fake book into their mailbox.

540
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,910
I guarantee their love will end for good.

541
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,310
I changed my mind.

542
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,360
You will get rid of this book.

543
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,570
Do it before I change my mind.

544
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,530
(Kormai, it has been two years
since I first met you.)

545
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,650
(I still remember that day clearly.)

546
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,940
2 YEARS AGO

547
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,420
[You are boring. Let’s break up.]

548
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,850
Is it done?

549
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,470
Please wait a second.

550
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,590
The computer is not working.

551
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,410
Please wait a moment.

552
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,860
Do you want my help?

553
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,950
Could you wait in line?

554
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,440
There are a few customers
waiting before you to pay bills.

555
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,300
The computer isn’t working.

556
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,140
You will need to wait a few minutes.

557
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,840
I mean…

558
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,050
I can help take a look at the computer.

559
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,510
I work in the IT field.

560
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,180
Sure.

561
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,480
(On my darkest day,
you brought a smile into my life.)

562
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,380
(One year later,

563
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,560
we became each other’s smiles.)
1 YEAR LATER

564
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,020
Kor.

565
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,000
What does this mean?

566
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,950
[Will you be my girlfriend?]

567
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,850
What does it mean?

568
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,290
(From that day,
we have been together for one year.)

569
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,370
(Thanks to whatever brought us together.)

570
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,840
(Love you always and forever,
my dear Kormai.)

571
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,590
Boss.

572
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,720
Can we break them up tomorrow?

573
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,770
What’s wrong with you?

574
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,550
I don’t want to ruin their relationship
on their anniversary.

575
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,490
You aren’t doing it.

576
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,880
I am.

577
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,850
Boss.

578
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,550
I’m asking you.

579
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,600
Just one day.

580
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,920
This is their beautiful memory.

581
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,270
If we want them to break up for good,

582
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,550
we need to destroy their beautiful memories.

583
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,290
Boss.

584
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,740
- Just one day.
- Let me go.

585
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,640
I’m asking for just one day.

586
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,420
Let me go.

587
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,350
Can we do it another day?

588
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:47,880
Get out of my way.

589
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,610
Just one day.

590
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,170
Give it to me.

591
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:50,670
No.

592
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,440
You are doing it again.

593
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,560
Why does he always sleep in the common area
when you two are fighting?

594
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,170
I’m sorry.

595
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,860
I’ll take him back to the room.

596
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,580
Good.

597
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,350
Hello, Nut.

598
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,650
(I have tea to spill.)

599
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,830
(Is Boss with you?)

600
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,210
No. What’s up?

601
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,650
(I told you
I would manipulate Mr. Chan to fire Boss.)

602
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,730
(I did it.)

603
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,690
What did Mr. Chan say?

604
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,590
(He also scolded Boss.)

605
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,990
(He didn’t defend him like he always did.)

606
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,600
(I feel so satisfied.)

607
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,390
(He asked you to keep an eye on Boss.)

608
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,380
(He said he wasn’t serious about it anymore.)

609
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,650
Is he sure
that Boss won’t resign from the company?

610
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,180
(No. He doesn’t care if Boss quits.)

611
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,990
(He’s no longer his favorite.)

612
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,810
(If he fails his mission again,
his team will be disbanded.)

613
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,940
(If he makes a mistake this time,
you can turn a blind eye.)

614
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,590
(You don’t need to help him.)

615
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,430
(You should start packing your things
and get ready to move to the support team.)

616
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,920
(Our first job is
to throw a party celebrating his departure.)

617
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,270
Kor.

618
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,120
I know you are still mad at me.

619
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,830
But today is our anniversary.

620
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,880
Will you accept this?

621
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,470
This book.

622
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,180
Did you write and make it yourself?

623
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,000
Yes.

624
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,330
But I hired a print house to print it out.

625
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,660
Do you like it?

626
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,760
You are busy with work
but you still find time to make this gift for me.

627
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
But I…

628
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,140
I never did anything for you.

629
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,820
I have been upset with you lately.

630
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,230
I’m sorry.

631
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,010
It’s okay, Kor.

632
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,670
I often make mistakes as well.

633
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,220
I promise.

634
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,050
I will be better.

635
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,380
Don’t cry.

636
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,550
Smile.

637
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,890
Open it.

638
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,620
Wow.

639
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,010
I worked really hard to make it.

640
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,250
[My Dear Nuch.]

641
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,460
This is wrong.

642
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,010
It should have been your name.

643
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,750
What is this?

644
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,940
Nuch, your ex-girlfriend.

645
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,690
You are still connected to her on Facebook.

646
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,990
Did you check out her social media?

647
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,990
If I didn’t do that, how would I know?

648
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,810
The places you take me
are the same ones you went to with her.

649
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,590
Kor.

650
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,620
There’s nothing between me and Nuch.

651
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,690
Nothing?

652
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,340
Don’t try to lie to me.

653
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,710
I don’t know how this happened, Kor.

654
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,470
It’s not what you think.

655
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,220
The book said everything.

656
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,330
Even though you are with me,

657
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,910
you never forget her.

658
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,850
It’s not true, Kor.

659
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,690
Please hear me out.

660
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,380
- No. There’s something between you two.
- It’s not what you think.

661
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,070
I didn’t…

662
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,020
Kor.

663
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,960
Say it.

664
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,230
Kor, please hear me out.

665
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,840
Clam down.

666
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,510
Then say it.

667
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,900
I don’t know how this happened.

668
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,870
I didn’t write her name.

669
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,040
I wrote your name.

670
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,280
You said you made the book yourself.

671
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,540
Kor, listen to me.

672
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,920
Listen to what? What do you have to say?

673
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,530
I didn’t write it.

674
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,450
So what?

675
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,880
I don’t know how it happened.

676
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,060
How can you not know?

677
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,570
- You made it yourself.
- You’re not listening to me.

678
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,150
I’m listening.

679
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,480
I didn’t do it.

680
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,740
- I don’t know how it went wrong.
- That’s all you can say?

681
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,570
We did it.

682
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,220
They broke up.

683
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,020
Kormai has been insecure about his ex all along.

684
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,730
You know her weak point and attack it.

685
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,650
Your plan…

686
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,720
makes more sense than mine.

687
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,230
You told me

688
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,590
if we wanted to ruin their relationship,

689
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,630
we needed to destroy their memories.

690
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,060
Well done.

691
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,900
You’ve leveled up.

692
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,010
You can separate work from personal feelings.

693
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,480
Since our mission is complete.

694
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,610
Come on.

695
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,100
Boss.

696
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,400
I…

697
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,300
Did you get rid of that rubbish energy?

698
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,190
No.

699
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,900
I don’t need to do it anymore.

700
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,070
Are you going to make a move on Jued?

701
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,350
The snake submits her resignation.

702
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,420
Jued, how was your job interview?

703
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,520
I not only want to pass the interview.

704
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,700
Pop, I have something to tell you.

705
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,550
The truth is Kor…

706
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,170
I’m going to ask for your forgiveness.

707
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,620
I’m entering the monkhood.

708
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,510
Kormai.

709
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,220
Kormai, you need to stop…

710
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,590
He’s going to enter the monkhood.

711
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,320
She is turning into a murderer.

712
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,660
I shouldn’t have broken them up.

713
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,840
Your situation sounds really bad.

714
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,580
I’m Cupid. I work at Destiny.
