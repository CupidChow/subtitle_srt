1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,770
My name is Cupid.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,360
My job is to help people fall in love.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,610
If I’m not this desperate, I wouldn’t call you.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,280
Please don’t ask me why I need the money for.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,250
You said I get used to having a partner.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,100
It’s true.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,990
You kept denying that you care about her.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,190
I don’t care about her.

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,560
I still insist on that.

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,450
But I like her.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,040
There’s only one person who can be my partner.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,040
I will do everything to get my partner back.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,700
[Cherry 461 Company]

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,280
Next.

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,160
Bananas.

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,540
Flip-flops.

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,300
Next.

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,520
A pineapple.

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,350
Three salted fish.

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,630
[You are so pretty.]

21
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,680
[Do you have a boyfriend?]

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,790
[Can I ask you out?]

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,010
I’m selling goods.

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,060
Why are you asking me about my love life?

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,630
I’ll say it only once.

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,540
My ideal guy?

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,010
He must be handsome, rich, and nice.

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,280
It’s hard to find a guy who has all three qualities.

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,120
But it’s okay.

30
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,410
Why do I need to date only one guy?

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,980
I’ll show you my boyfriends.

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,390
My first boyfriend is a hunk.

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,820
My second boyfriend.

34
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,660
He’s filthy rich.

35
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,140
My third boyfriend.

36
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,300
He’s so sweet.

37
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,530
But if you like me and have all three qualities,

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,910
you can hit me up.

39
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,250
I don’t mind having one more boyfriend.

40
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,350
If you don’t have them, don’t bother me.

41
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,890
It’s annoying. Let’s get back to our business.

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:37,790
Come on.

43
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,970
A cleaver.

44
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,460
Darn.

45
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,930
A coaster.

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,210
An empty box.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,050
[Tee helps me carry my things today.]

48
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,180
[I just realized that he’s such a gentleman.]

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,970
[He also helps me.]

50
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,110
[He helps me too. He’s so sweet.]

51
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,660
Sorry, everyone.

52
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,730
I’m on vacation.

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,140
Our company is having a big problem.

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,240
There’s a company that helps people find love.

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,430
It interferes with our business.

56
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,470
My name is Cupid.

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,200
I work at Destiny.

58
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,580
My job is to help people fall in love.

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,920
Destiny not only uses marketing strategies
to compete with us,

60
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,230
but also helps the couples we split up reconcile.

61
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,350
We needed to refund several clients.

62
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,500
They position themselves as our enemy.

63
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,790
How can you still be in a good mood?

64
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,870
Especially you, Nut!

65
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,170
How can you do this to me?

66
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,730
What?

67
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,070
That.

68
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,980
Huh?

69
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,640
Don’t you know I’m sensitive right now?

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,320
I’m going to throw it away now.

71
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,180
It’s too late.

72
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,050
I’m going to throw it away now, eight words.

73
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,030
I’ll cut your pay for eight days.

74
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,530
What?!

75
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,710
Sorry.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,350
Jued.

77
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,850
Yes?

78
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,930
I don’t know and have never heard of Destiny.

79
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,880
I just want to know how Tee is doing
when he works with Team A.

80
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,090
Oh?

81
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,230
He’s good.

82
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,180
He’s better than I thought.

83
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,100
I agree.

84
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,930
Tee is ready to run Team C.

85
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,110
No, I think he should be trained with us for a while.

86
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,040
Didn’t you say he’s done well?

87
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,750
Why does he need more training?

88
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,310
He can be better.

89
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,810
Enough.

90
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,160
That’s your opinion.

91
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,140
Let’s ask him what he thinks.

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,400
Boss, where should I sit?

93
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,140
Tee, you can use my chair.

94
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,840
It’s okay.

95
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,150
Can I borrow one of your chairs?

96
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,480
Can I share your desk?

97
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,640
Sure.

98
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,320
You can use this desk.

99
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,000
Get ready for the briefing.

100
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,020
Is the fruit basket for me?

101
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,560
No.

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,450
Then who is it for?

103
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,250
It’s none of your business.

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,830
The fruit basket is for you.

105
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,740
First of all, I want to apologize to you.

106
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,990
I’m not good at technology.

107
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,130
I got this black card from the bank,

108
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,490
but I don’t know how to use it.

109
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,170
For your app,

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,680
I have no idea how to use it.

111
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,760
That’s why I invited you to my restaurant.

112
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,510
It’s not a big deal, Mr. Ong-art.

113
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,120
We’re happy to help you.

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,990
What can we do for you today?

115
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,580
I have a girlfriend. Her name is Cherry.

116
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,550
She’s an online vendor.

117
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,640
A pineapple.

118
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,150
Next.

119
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,710
I love her very much.

120
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,720
She is the youngest among all my wives.

121
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,100
Because she is so pretty,

122
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,410
she has many admirers.

123
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,510
I hired a famous private investigator

124
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,850
to find her other men.

125
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,360
I have their photos.

126
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,500
Bee and Art.

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
They are photos from her Instagram.

128
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,470
You don’t need
a famous private investigator to do it.

129
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,130
He scammed you.

130
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,620
Even an elementary student can do it.

131
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,490
If it’s something you are not good at,

132
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,390
it’s the right thing to hire a professional.

133
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,010
Well said.

134
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,600
I have another problem.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,420
Cherry likes me because I’m rich.

136
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,900
But her wealth has been increasing.

137
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,690
When she becomes richer than I,

138
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,540
she will definitely leave me.

139
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,340
Besides my wealth,

140
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,440
I had nothing else to offer her.

141
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,330
That’s why

142
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,760
I want you to get rid of my two love enemies.

143
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,190
Two men? Then it will be two cases.

144
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,510
Can I pay with cash?

145
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,560
Of course.

146
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,790
But we are currently very busy.

147
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,160
But we can jump the queue
if you pay for the VIP package.

148
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,370
Great.

149
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,310
Okay. Everyone, please dig in.

150
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,790
Kor.

151
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,670
Yes?

152
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,960
If I have a crush on my colleague,

153
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,180
what should I do?

154
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,640
You broke up with Boss not long ago.
You found a new guy quickly.

155
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,430
What kind of guy is he?

156
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,020
He…

157
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,330
He’s reserved.

158
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,020
Reserved?

159
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,940
If you come on strong, it might scare him off.

160
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,500
You should do some digging
to find his ideal type.

161
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,770
Then you adjust your style to it.

162
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,840
So he will develop an interest in you.

163
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,240
This is a smooth move.

164
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,930
You look beautiful.

165
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,740
Thank you, Nut.

166
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,060
What is this?

167
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,120
It’s a price tag.

168
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,390
You bought the outfit and wore it out of the store.

169
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,060
Aren’t you afraid you will get a rash?

170
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,980
I made cookies for you.

171
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,210
You made them yourself?

172
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,170
Yes.

173
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,970
You are pretty and kind.

174
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,990
You’re surely not human.

175
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,840
You must be…

176
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,990
an angel.

177
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,450
I’m kind of hungry right now.

178
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,100
It smells good.

179
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,630
Let’s eat it.

180
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,040
Tee, I saw you working hard.

181
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,260
I think a sweet will help you feel energized.

182
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,430
This is a homemade cookie.

183
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,410
I made it myself.

184
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,210
Thank you.

185
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,110
I never got this kind of gift before.

186
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,930
Really?

187
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,040
I made it for everyone. This one…

188
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,520
It looks yummy.

189
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,420
What is this?

190
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,160
Cockroach eggs?

191
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,150
No, they are chocolate chips.

192
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,550
I shouldn’t throw it away.

193
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,560
It’s delicious.

194
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,110
Boss #@!&%$

195
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
We are late for our meeting.

196
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,540
This is information about Art and Bee.

197
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,240
Isn’t this supposed to be my job?

198
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,930
It’s okay. I want to do it.

199
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,350
Thank you.

200
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,310
Hey.

201
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,960
You work for my team.
You should come with me.

202
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,260
No. I’m wearing a dress.

203
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,600
I don’t want to ride on a bike.

204
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,690
Fine.

205
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,460
If you want to ride in the van, then go.

206
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,560
Let’s go.

207
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,100
Come on.

208
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,780
Go.

209
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,980
Bee. His pen name is Masao_B.

210
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,620
He’s an online novel writer.

211
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,810
He has been dating Cherry the longest.

212
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,410
They have been together since they had nothing.

213
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,120
Yes?

214
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,930
Honey.

215
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,590
I just wired 50,000 baht to our joint account.

216
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,390
Though she became rich and has many boyfriends,

217
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,630
he still loves her very much.

218
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,410
I’ll do it too.

219
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,290
But I can add only 10 baht.

220
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,310
It’s okay, honey.

221
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,360
You can add the amount that you can afford

222
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,200
The money is for our future together.

223
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,590
Have a good day.

224
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,680
Bye.

225
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,600
Bee’s weakness is his dream and finances.

226
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,770
So…

227
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,090
Here.

228
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,200
It’s your time, rookie.

229
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,560
Do anything to lure him
to use the money from their joint account.

230
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,770
Then they will have a fight and break up.

231
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,440
Mission accomplished.

232
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,690
(Hello.)

233
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,880
Hello. Is this Masao_B?

234
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,360
I’m working at a series production company.

235
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:07,160
We are interested in buying the adaptation rights
of your novel “The Saleslady and the Young Writer.”

236
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,080
(Really?)

237
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,490
(My hard work finally pays off.)

238
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,840
(What do I need to do?)

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,450
It’s very easy.

240
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,230
We will handle the process of obtaining the copyright.

241
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,560
But you need to pay the fee.

242
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,100
So the copyright will be yours.

243
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,130
(Yes. How much is the fee?)

244
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,820
150,000 baht.

245
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,290
Can you wire the money to me now?

246
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,810
(Wire the money?!)

247
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,410
(I registered copyrights for my novels several times.)

248
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,410
(It’s free of charge.)

249
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,440
(You’re a nasty scammer.)

250
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,410
(I’m not a fool to fall for your stupid scheme.)

251
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,580
You have no skills to spin stories.

252
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,110
It’s okay, Tee.

253
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,730
Everyone makes a mistake on their first try.

254
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,160
I’ll handle it from here.

255
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,570
Of course, that should be the case.

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,910
Oh.

257
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,060
Are you Masao_B?

258
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,500
Yes.

259
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,060
I’m your fan.

260
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,580
I’m reading your novel

261
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,440
“The Saleslady and the Young Writer.”

262
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,710
I love it.

263
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,780
It’s so fun.

264
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,060
It’s very touching.

265
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,670
Thank you.

266
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,110
What do you like about it?

267
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,830
I like everything.

268
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,180
Is there anything you like in particular?

269
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,110
Umm.

270
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,930
Tell him you like the male protagonist who is rich.

271
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,570
He has unlimited money to pamper the girl.

272
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,460
I like the rich leading man.

273
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,080
He has unlimited money to pamper the girl.

274
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,790
But my male protagonist is not that kind of man.

275
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,000
That’s an antagonist.

276
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,630
Right.

277
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,110
Jued, tell him that you like the male protagonist
because he is sweet and hard-working.

278
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,490
He tries hard to prove his love for her.

279
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,730
I got it wrong.

280
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,980
I like the male protagonist
because he is sweet and hard-working.

281
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,440
He tries hard to prove his love for her.

282
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,390
What does the female protagonist do for a living?

283
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,830
She’s an online vendor. She sells everything.

284
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,480
How does the novel end?

285
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,770
This is a trick question.

286
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,920
You haven’t finished the novel.

287
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,440
I’m curious how their story will end.

288
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,130
You are really my fans.

289
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,430
I’m sorry for suspecting you.

290
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,380
There are so many scammers lately.

291
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,620
It’s okay.

292
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,070
It’s not a surprise
that a celebrity like you will be their target.

293
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,190
A celebrity?

294
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,220
Yes, you are a famous writer.

295
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,470
Don’t you know how famous you are?

296
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,470
How famous am I?

297
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,250
You can hold your own fan meeting.

298
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,430
Do you mean a small get together?

299
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,350
I mean a real fan meeting.

300
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
You have a fandom.

301
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,320
You can fill this café with your fans.

302
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,830
You need to book the whole café for the event.

303
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,140
The whole café?

304
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,620
Why don’t you hold a fan meeting?

305
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,860
So you will see how many fans you have.

306
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,350
I’m just an uncelebrated writer.

307
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,470
I don’t dare to hold that kind of event.

308
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,410
It’s a bit too much for me.

309
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,470
[The Saleslady and the Young Writer]

310
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,890
Honey.

311
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,900
Congratulations! You finally became famous
and have your own fan meeting.

312
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank you.

313
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,420
But…

314
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,300
I don’t see anyone here.

315
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,620
My fans are probably on their way.

316
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
But it’s time for the event to start.

317
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,390
Why don’t they want to come early to the event
they bought tickets for?

318
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,010
I didn’t sell tickets.

319
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,380
I paid for everything myself.

320
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,870
What?

321
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,750
I want to hold an event to thank my fans.

322
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,030
So I paid for everything.

323
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,480
I rent this place

324
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,010
and pay for the drinks, snacks, and souvenirs.

325
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,860
How can you afford it?

326
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,580
I used the money from our joint account.

327
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,140
Are you stupid?

328
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,670
If you don’t have any fans,
why are you holding a fan meeting?

329
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,890
I have many fans.

330
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,870
Where are they? I see no one here.

331
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,170
You are sweet, but you’re the biggest fool.

332
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,210
Let’s break up.

333
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,680
One down.

334
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,480
Jued, well done.

335
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,240
You were incredible
when you pretended to be his fan.

336
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,430
I can do that
because you helped me do the research.

337
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,350
Can you stop praising each other?

338
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,070
You should start planning for our next target.

339
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,600
Our next target is Art.

340
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,460
He was a popular host
at the host club that Cherry often visited.

341
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,740
Mushroom.

342
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,040
She likes him.

343
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,360
So she takes him as her sugar baby.

344
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
He doesn’t need to do anything.

345
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,110
She provides him with a comfortable life.

346
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,820
Bananas.

347
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,140
Songkla mini mangoes.

348
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,130
Can you adjust the camera for me?

349
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,210
Go a bit to the right.

350
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,960
I haven’t checked the stock upstairs.

351
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,140
Can you go help me?

352
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,160
The target is moving.

353
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,190
Boss, get his phone.

354
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Hurry and clean up the mess.

355
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,560
My wife will be upset if she sees it.

356
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,850
Yes.

357
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,590
I’m sorry.

358
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,380
What’s wrong with you, Boss?

359
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,200
Why are you distracted?

360
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,560
I’m sorry.

361
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,900
Let’s begin the next step.

362
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,660
I miss you so much, sweetie.

363
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,350
Your sticky fingers are working well.

364
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,860
But your skills to stir the pot still sucks.

365
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,630
Give it to me.

366
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,480
[Sweetie, can you come to see me?]

367
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,200
This is an eggplant.

368
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,340
No.

369
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,940
Watermelon.

370
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,530
Next.

371
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,050
[Are you hungry? I have a banana.]

372
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,960
This is a banana.

373
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,500
No, they are rubber balls.

374
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,140
[Or do you want to taste a bitter melon?]

375
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,450
[Sweetie, go straight.]

376
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,580
[Which way should I go next?]

377
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,480
Boss, tell her to turn right.

378
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,350
[Keep going straight.]

379
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,780
Boss, why didn’t you listen to Tee?

380
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,050
Turning right will take longer than going straight.

381
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,170
But that way is…

382
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,630
[Are you kidding me?

383
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,720
I’m going back to my live streaming.]

384
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,430
Hey!

385
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,760
How could you do this to me?

386
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,950
It’s not what you think.

387
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,780
The first step is successful.

388
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,970
What a surprise!

389
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,250
Can I join you?

390
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,910
What?

391
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,140
I took the lead.

392
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,380
You finally realized your feelings for her.

393
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,760
But she’s now interested in another guy.

394
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,630
Stop rubbing salt into my wound

395
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,750
and help me think how to beat that nerd.

396
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,970
You can’t beat him.

397
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,770
Asshole.

398
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,870
Watch your mouth.

399
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,250
I mean it.

400
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,140
You’re having a crush on her.

401
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,810
She doesn’t even know how you feel.

402
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,160
That’s why she’s interested in that guy.

403
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,060
What if she knows how I feel?

404
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,140
Do you have the guts to tell her?

405
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,060
After finishing this case, I’ll give it a try.

406
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,970
I’ll wait and see if you can do it.

407
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,480
Give me your hand.

408
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,900
Now, you feel refreshed, right?

409
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:50,680
Yes.

410
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,310
Hello.

411
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,800
Wait a sec. I have a patient.

412
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,550
Hello, Mr. Adisak.

413
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,870
How is your condition?

414
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,630
It’s much better.

415
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,920
I’m lucky
that my wife didn’t scold me for getting gonorrhea.

416
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,160
You are so lucky to have an understanding wife.

417
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,010
Some couples broke up because of it.

418
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,350
Yes, I’m very lucky.

419
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,340
Thank you.

420
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,930
Can you tell me your conditions?

421
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,900
I have rashes all over my body.

422
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,870
It’s itchy.

423
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,340
It looks serious.

424
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,620
Did you recently do something out of the ordinary?

425
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,000
Can I join you?

426
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,370
No.

427
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,300
I only apply the lotion
that I usually use before going to bed.

428
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,310
Can I see the lotion?

429
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,340
Here.

430
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,180
It looks normal.

431
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,400
I think you have an STD called gonorrhea.

432
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,540
Gonorrhea on my arms?

433
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,470
It’s an emerging disease.

434
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,950
It’s called pansomatic gohorrhea.

435
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,600
It’s very serious.

436
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,000
You need urgent treatment.

437
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,850
Otherwise, it will spread to your legs and knees.

438
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,240
Lastly, it will spread to your head.

439
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,360
Am I dying?

440
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,570
No.

441
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,260
This is just an initial stage.

442
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,640
My advice is to stop having sexual intercourse
for the meantime.

443
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,020
You should inform your family,
especially your partner, immediately.

444
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,400
To stop the disease from spreading.

445
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,620
I can’t tell my girlfriend.

446
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,980
If she finds out,

447
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,910
I’ll be dead before it spreads to my head.

448
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,650
It’s too late.

449
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,870
The messenger is delivering
your examination result to your address.

450
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,180
It should be delivered within ten minutes.

451
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,390
Excuse me. I have another patient.

452
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,100
Here is your lotion.

453
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,670
I have mail for you.

454
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,170
The mail is delivered.

455
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,160
Hey.

456
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Do you see my mail?

457
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,420
It’s in the letter tray over there.

458
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,210
Next.

459
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,300
A cat collar.

460
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,820
A coaster.

461
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,710
Next.

462
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,380
A pan.

463
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,350
Can you help me find my letter?

464
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,880
Sure.

465
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,090
Why do you two look familiar?

466
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,200
I have a generic-looking face.

467
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,700
You got the wrong person.

468
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,020
I found it.

469
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,610
Thanks.

470
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,880
Sorry.

471
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,250
What is this, honey?

472
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,510
A sexually transmitted disease?

473
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,980
Does it mean I also have it?

474
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,230
I think so.

475
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,660
Me too?

476
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,850
Me too?

477
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,190
Me too?

478
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,860
How could you do this to me?

479
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,610
Stop.

480
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,940
Sweetie, please hear me out.

481
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,920
No, I don’t want to listen to you.

482
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,760
Get the hell away from me.

483
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,360
Go away.

484
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,340
Go.

485
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,510
Good job, Jued.

486
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,080
I’m sorry, sweetie.

487
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,450
Sorry?

488
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,360
Boss, watch out.

489
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,720
I’ll take you to the hospital.

490
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,790
It might sting a little.

491
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,460
Ouch.

492
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,420
Almost done.

493
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,390
I never knew Boss has a friend.

494
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,070
I think I’m his only friend.

495
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,240
Other friends have cut ties with him.

496
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,840
Why didn’t you run away from him?

497
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,600
I want to do that too.

498
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,880
But he always gets injured
when he finishes his mission.

499
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,360
I’m a good person.

500
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,100
I need to adhere to my professional ethics.

501
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,460
You are a good person.

502
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,770
You shouldn’t be involved with Boss.

503
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,220
He’s a sinner.

504
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,710
Karma always catches up with him.

505
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,690
You’re right.

506
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,180
He’s a devil from hell.

507
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,440
That’s why he’s punished by heaven.

508
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,820
Did he tell you?

509
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,810
What?

510
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,540
So he hasn’t told you yet?

511
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,060
Tell me what?

512
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,720
What?

513
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,360
You are annoying.

514
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,170
I already knew that.

515
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,810
Good.

516
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,910
(What are you doing?)

517
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,590
(Why didn’t you tell her?)

518
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,300
Follow me.

519
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,380
This way.

520
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,230
Yes.

521
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,740
I closed my restaurant for you guys.

522
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,600
Where is he?

523
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,780
That foul-mouthed guy.

524
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,770
If you don’t want him here,
we will not let him come.

525
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,140
Good.

526
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,030
Sure.

527
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,110
I have a surprise.

528
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,980
I’m going to propose to Cherry.

529
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:18,870
Really?

530
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,400
Congrats to you in advance.

531
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,920
Huh?

532
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,780
No, I don’t want to order gas.

533
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,960
I think we are talking about different things.

534
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,020
When I give you the signal,

535
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,890
you’ll pop confetti poppers.

536
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,670
Yes.

537
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,730
I’ll give you a big bonus.

538
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,320
Bonus?

539
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,310
I’m joking, Mr. Chan.

540
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,530
Wait for me.

541
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,810
Watch your steps.

542
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,110
Can I play it too?

543
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,810
Come and sit down.

544
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,840
Let’s eat.

545
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,670
Go, go.

546
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,510
This is a big meal.

547
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,460
Boss, how did you get here?

548
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,610
I rode my bike.

549
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,400
He means he didn’t invite you.

550
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,210
What are you doing here?

551
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,460
I completed my mission.

552
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,810
Even though I’m not invited,
I will come anyway.

553
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,790
Boss, get up. It’s my seat.

554
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,090
I don’t see your name on it.

555
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,000
Get up.

556
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,530
Get up.

557
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,420
Get up.

558
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,210
I’ll move to another table.

559
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,900
So you can have a seat.

560
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,460
What are you doing here, looking so down?

561
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,590
I want to be like you.

562
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,710
What do you mean by that?

563
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,720
You don’t care about anything.

564
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,430
Nothing can hurt your feelings.

565
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,340
What hurt your feelings?

566
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
I feel like I’m not good enough.

567
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,590
I’m poor.

568
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,780
I’m a loser.

569
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,620
I’m foul-mouthed.

570
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,950
My sweets taste bad.

571
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,260
I don’t look good when I wear a girly dress.

572
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,860
This is why…

573
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,240
no one loves me.

574
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,640
Why do you think you are not good enough?

575
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,370
You are understanding others.

576
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,230
You are caring.

577
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,640
You are honest.

578
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,450
Those who get to know you are lucky.

579
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,460
You are a good person.

580
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,400
Maybe…

581
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,320
you are too good for someone.

582
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,600
Do you mean it?

583
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,430
Yes.

584
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,110
You should believe that you are good enough.

585
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,050
Everyone loves you.

586
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,290
I also love…

587
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,330
Tee, I like you. Can I ask you out?

588
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,850
Jued, aren’t you dating Boss?

589
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,570
What?

590
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,890
Boss and I?

591
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,570
No way.

592
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,350
Why did you think that?

593
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,550
Then it means…

594
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,970
We are just work partners.

595
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,720
So…

596
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,120
my answer is yes.

597
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,920
I like you too.

598
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,700
Thank you.

599
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,970
Thank you.

600
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,790
There’s a bone.

601
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,640
How did it get in here?

602
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,590
Although I can’t get down on one knee,

603
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,710
my whole heart belongs to you.

604
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,210
Will you marry me, Cherry?

605
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,080
Congratulations!

606
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,570
Cherry.

607
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,610
Honey, please come back to me.

608
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:24,950
I’m now rich.

609
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,880
Bee won the lottery jackpot in the latest draw.

610
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,760
He received 60 million baht.

611
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,960
He hired Destiny.

612
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,430
We completed the mission.

613
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,990
But they didn’t stay separated for 45 days.

614
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,500
We need to refund the client.

615
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,610
You don’t need to refund him.

616
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,560
We will break them up again.

617
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,630
Where are you, Boss?

618
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,720
This is Rose, Team B of Break Up Service.

619
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,790
I asked her to help us with this case.
