1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,260
For this unclear relationship,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,620
is it worth all the effort you’re giving?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,260
You are quite…a good person.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,320
Don’t say I’m a good person again, alright?

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,820
It gives me creeps.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,860
Are you agreeing to rent me the condo?

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,150
Are you asking because you don’t want it?

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,450
Yes, I want it.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,620
But I have another favor to ask.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,700
Can you do the two-finger sign?

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,780
I invented the hand sign for Team A.

12
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,580
Does it resemble the letter ‘A’?

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,020
When we finish our work,
we can do the hand sign.

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,840
It looks so cool.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,730
[Mai and Mhon were born on the same day
at Taweesuk Hospital.]
(Mon, will you go to study in Australia with me?)

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,400
[They are next-door neighbors.]
(I can’t go.)

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,370
(Look at my shop. It’s so small.)

18
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,490
(My parents can’t afford
to send me to study abroad.)

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,560
[They went to the same school.]
[The first gift Mai gave Mo.]

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,740
(Mai, if you want to continue to date me,)

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,170
(you need to live here.)
[They went to the same college.]

22
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,370
5 YEARS AGO
But my family already moved there.

23
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,120
They prepared everything for my study.

24
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,620
I don’t care.

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,110
If you still want to have this relationship,

26
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,660
then it has to be a long-distance relationship.

27
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,380
Even when we are living close,
you still talk to other guys behind my back.

28
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,260
How can we make it work
if it’s a long-distance relationship?

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,830
It won’t work
because of your unreasonableness.

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,310
Take it back.

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,310
This is the first gift I gave you.

32
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,690
I don’t want it anymore.

33
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,470
Even when we are living close,

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,020
you still don’t trust me.

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,590
If we are living in different countries,
there is no way we can make it work.

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,910
I think we’d better end it now.

37
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,590
You can’t wait to date a new guy, right?

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,370
Fine.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,040
Let’s break up.

40
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,420
PRESENT TIME
Two wide rice noodles for Table No.6.

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,530
What about Tables No.3 and No.4?

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,070
Table No.7, please wait a second.

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Order No.102 is ready.

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,050
The other rider, please wait a moment.

45
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,990
Please wait a second.

46
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,030
What do you want to order?

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,230
One rice noodle, one Tom Yum rice noodle,
and one dry egg noodle.

48
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,640
Wait a moment.

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
Your cooking skills
are now as good as your father's.

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,370
I can no longer tell the difference.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,180
Thank you.

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,220
You’re so busy making noodles
that your hair gets messy.

53
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,140
You let the snake rent your condo.

54
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,210
Then, where will you take a girl to hook up?

55
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,160
Hotels are convenient.

56
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,570
I’m busy lately anyway.

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
That sounds like you.

58
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,640
You are a real scumbag.

59
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,420
Who knows?

60
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,240
Maybe I could be a good person like others.

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,280
Because of what you said,
Made decided to walk out of the unfair relationship.

62
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,980
You are quite…a good person.

63
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,380
You became a better person

64
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,830
after having Jued as your work partner.

65
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,050
I…

66
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,550
Boss.

67
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,100
Hey.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,570
What the heck?

69
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,870
Why do you look so happy?

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,230
I woke up, went to the gym and swim,
and took a walk in the garden.

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,820
Thank you so much, Boss.

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,700
What do you thank me for?

73
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,020
For letting me rent your condo.

74
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,690
I’ll work hard to repay your kindness.

75
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,290
Don’t mess up our work.

76
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,080
Don’t try to deny it.

77
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,690
You like it, don’t you?

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,800
You like it, don’t you?

79
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,630
You are quite…a good person.

80
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,130
Like what?

81
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,930
Having me as your partner.

82
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,900
He hired you. What else can I do?

83
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,060
You’d better work hard

84
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,350
to deserve my compassion.

85
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,410
Go get briefed.

86
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,920
Our next target is Mai and Mhon.

87
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,620
They broke up but rekindled their relationship.

88
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,920
They became even more lovey-dovey
than before.

89
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,680
Our job is to kill the romance
and split them up for good.

90
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,580
No return ever, right?

91
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,380
Who are you?

92
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,440
It’s me, Jued. Who else could it be?

93
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,700
Can you stop joking around?

94
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,550
Who is our client this time?

95
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,880
The client is willing to pay us
but wants to remain anonymous.

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,220
The client probably has a crush on one of them.

97
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,940
The client told us
that we could attack Mhon’s weak points.

98
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,730
Mhon has three major weak points.

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,990
I have emailed it to you.

100
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,400
Their love was once broken.

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,290
It’s not hard to break it again.

102
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,070
I’ll do all the planning to repay you for the condo.

103
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,860
It’s lunchtime. What do you want to eat?

104
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,930
Anything is fine.

105
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,680
Sukiyaki, barbeque, or shabu shabu?

106
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,790
I don’t like any of them.

107
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,020
Then what do you want to eat?

108
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,970
Anything except sukiyaki,
barbeque and shabu shabu.

109
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,470
How about this?

110
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,430
Each of us picks one food we want to eat.

111
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,760
Then decide with rock, paper, scissors.

112
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,870
I chose steak.

113
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,510
I chose Thai food.

114
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,660
Thai food?

115
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,160
Okay.

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,060
Rock, paper, scissors.

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,620
You lose on purpose, don’t you?

118
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,470
You always throw paper.

119
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,380
If I didn’t do this,

120
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,670
when could we decide what to eat?

121
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,760
I’m sick of you. You always read my mind.

122
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,870
Shall we have Thai food today?

123
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,440
Yes.

124
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,250
Can I go to the bathroom for one minute?

125
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay.

126
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,680
(Mhon’s first weak point is
that she likes to chat with other men.)

127
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,150
(I snoop through her Facebook
back to when they were dating.)

128
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,570
(Many guys left flirting comments on her posts.)

129
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,690
(She replied to every comment.)

130
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,030
(This was probably the reason Mai was upset.)

131
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,930
(He was very jealous.)

132
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,910
(He often posted songs expressing his frustration.)

133
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,420
♪ The trust I placed ♪

134
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,580
♪ It’s me, can you recognize? ♪

135
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,120
♪ I’m the one left behind ♪

136
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,680
[What’s wrong?]

137
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,100
What is your plan?

138
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
I’ll use a fake account to flirt with Mhon.

139
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,810
Mr. Handsome and Wealthy?

140
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,100
The name is so lame.

141
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,140
Who would fall for it?

142
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,540
The profile photo looks good,
that should be enough.

143
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,560
isn’t that my photo?

144
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,330
[I want to say hi.]

145
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,390
[Sure.]

146
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,680
Are you the owner of the pork noodles shop?

147
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,690
[Yes.]

148
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,270
I saw you on one of your shop’s reviews.

149
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,880
I want to taste your noodles.

150
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,020
Your message will never work.

151
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,080
The review said the noodles are delicious

152
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,390
and the owner is also cute.

153
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,520
[That’s true. I can’t argue with that.]

154
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,610
Isn’t it too obvious?

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,240
You have a successful business
at such a young age.

156
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,870
You are so talented.

157
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,920
Who are you chatting with?

158
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,780
A customer.

159
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,790
A guy?

160
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,040
Yes.

161
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,840
What are you two talking about?

162
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,400
Why?

163
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,480
Are you going to pick a fight over nothing again?

164
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,400
No.

165
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,800
If it were back then,
we would have had a big fight.

166
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,940
But now I understand
that you are simply a friendly person.

167
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,560
It’s a common trait of vendors.

168
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,300
The problem is not you.

169
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,200
The real problem is the customer.

170
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,810
Can I see your phone?

171
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,810
Look, the account was recently created.

172
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,080
There are no other photos
except the profile photo.

173
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,620
Look at his name and face.

174
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,890
They are so fake.

175
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,300
He might be a scammer.

176
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,640
Yes, it looks fake.

177
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,400
I just replied to him without checking.

178
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,670
You should block him for your safety.

179
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,370
I’ll report the account too.

180
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,480
So he can’t scam others.

181
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,020
Done.

182
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,040
Let’s go have lunch.

183
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,910
I told it looked fake.

184
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,360
Are you talking about your face?

185
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,520
I’m talking about your plan.

186
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,110
This means
they have overcome their first problem.

187
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,470
Please give me another chance.

188
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,020
Let’s move on to my second plan.

189
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,440
I’ll have Pad Thai with shrimp.

190
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,420
(Her second weak point is
that she is a picky eater.)

191
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,130
Can you change fresh shrimp to dried shrimp?

192
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,000
No peanuts, eggs, and green onions, please.

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,060
No, add a little green onion
to add its fragrance to the dish.

194
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,250
What about you?

195
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,730
I’ll have the same.

196
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,190
Two Pad Thai
with extra peanuts, eggs, and green onions.

197
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,080
Here is your order.

198
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,830
Excuse me.

199
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,920
This is not what I ordered.

200
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,310
I told you to change fresh shrimp to dried shrimp.

201
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,450
No peanuts and eggs

202
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,390
and only a little green onion.

203
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,500
I’m sorry.

204
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,010
I must have got it wrong.

205
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,740
Please don’t tell my manager.

206
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,640
I’m a new employee.

207
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,280
If he knows, he will deduct my wages.

208
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
It’s okay, Mhon.

209
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,910
I’ll eat both of them.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,210
You can order a new one.

211
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,550
What if they make it wrong again?

212
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,150
Will you eat the third dish too?

213
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,600
I’ll write your order myself.

214
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,800
Can you give me paper?

215
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,240
No, Mai.

216
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,940
You miss the point.

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,250
We are customers.

218
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,130
We should get what we ordered.

219
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,140
Miss, I also run a restaurant.

220
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,180
You can’t mess up customers’ orders.

221
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,030
I’m sorry.

222
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,030
You don’t need to be so harsh on her.

223
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,250
I’m not being harsh.

224
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,660
I only advise her.

225
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,970
I mean well, Mai.

226
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,520
Miss.

227
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,410
I’m sorry.

228
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,330
If you have a choosy customer like this,

229
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,400
how would you feel?

230
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,330
That’s not the point.

231
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,680
This is the point.

232
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,840
You want me to explain it?

233
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,650
If you want what you ordered,

234
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,720
Then let’s do it yourself.

235
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,640
Are you joking with me?

236
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,620
No.

237
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,930
You need to do it yourself.

238
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,680
Mhon may seem to be a picky eater

239
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,910
who is high-demanding.

240
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,270
But she actually has her reason.

241
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,840
8 YEARS AGO

242
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,150
This is Pad Thai with shrimp
from my favorite shop.

243
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,960
I bought one for you.

244
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,950
Does it taste good?

245
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,850
Yes,

246
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,930
it’s delicious.

247
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,950
You should eat it too.

248
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,950
She has a food allergy.

249
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,880
But she doesn’t know
what exactly triggers her allergic reaction.

250
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,270
She doesn’t like to explain herself.

251
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,450
During the time we were apart,

252
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,000
I studied more about allergies.

253
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,830
I don’t think she has a food allergy,

254
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,800
but rather a food sensitivity.

255
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,160
Food sensitivity usually
doesn’t display symptoms right away.

256
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,510
It takes some time for the symptoms to show.

257
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,740
So the patients are unsure of what causes it.

258
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,540
After finishing the meal, let’s go to the hospital.

259
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,790
I booked a food sensitivity test for you.

260
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,720
I already set up your appointment.

261
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,720
I care about you, Mhon.

262
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,300
Just like you tried to secretly choose
Thai food for today’s lunch.

263
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,210
So I can eat my favorite food,
Pad Thai with shrimp.

264
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,960
I know that you also care about me.

265
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,440
So?

266
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,200
We still have her last weak point.

267
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,730
You need to help me this time.

268
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,430
[Rod Lert Pork Noodles]

269
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Hello, Dad and Mom.

270
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,870
Hello.

271
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,700
I’ll help you clear the table.

272
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,790
Good.

273
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,870
Where is our daily worker?

274
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,950
I told them to wash the dishes at the back.

275
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,410
Hello.

276
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,500
Here is the menu.

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,360
I’ll come back to take your order.

278
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,540
(Her last weak point is
that she has an overprotective father.)

279
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,510
Sorry, it slipped out of my hand
when I was cutting the pork.

280
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,190
Why did you do that?

281
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,740
You scared him.

282
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,650
Hello, Dad and Mom.

283
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,380
I bought snacks for you.

284
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,290
Leave it over there.

285
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,790
Over there.

286
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,370
Why are you so cold to him?

287
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,700
Dad, do you like the gift
I bought you from Australia?

288
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,930
I haven’t opened it.

289
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,220
The shop is crowded with customers.

290
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,220
I’m too busy.

291
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,100
Is there anything I can help with?

292
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,540
Do whatever you want.

293
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,420
But don’t come near here.

294
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,520
You will get in my way.

295
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,020
Mai, can you take the dishes to the back
for the workers to clean them?

296
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,640
What about you?

297
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,580
I’ll have the same.

298
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,440
Hello, big bro.

299
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,940
Honey, say hi to him.

300
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,150
My wife is very introverted.

301
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,870
I know that you have an eye
on the shop owner’s daughter.

302
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,460
If you want to win over her dad,

303
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,550
You can’t be shy.

304
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,480
Otherwise, you will lose your chance.

305
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,280
Come here. I’ll tell you something.

306
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,990
Hello, Dad and Mom.

307
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,890
I’m here to help you today.

308
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,700
What a trouble.

309
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,010
Hey, you’d better talk to him nicely.

310
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,090
It’s good to have more help.

311
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,440
The shop is usually very busy on Saturdays.

312
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,120
I’ll help you arrange the counter.

313
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,310
Great. So we will get to know each other.

314
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,670
Who wants to know him?

315
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,460
I do.

316
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,080
Mai, don’t worry.

317
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,590
He only barks but doesn’t bite.

318
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,470
I’m not a dog.

319
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,730
But you are acting like one.

320
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,730
Don’t you know it?

321
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
You need to become close to her dad.

322
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,240
You need to win him over.

323
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,780
This is how I got my wife.

324
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,520
Become close to him?

325
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,720
How?

326
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,730
It’s not hard.

327
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,330
You need to find what you have in common.

328
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
There must be something
you two have in common.

329
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,610
My parents also opened
a restaurant in Australia, Dad.

330
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,030
I always help them at the restaurant.

331
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,040
Selling Thai food in a foreign land?

332
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,260
Do the foreigners even like it?

333
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,760
We are doing quite well.

334
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,130
What is on your menu?

335
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,110
Noodles, just like your shop.

336
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,760
How many tables does your restaurant have?

337
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,040
We have no tables. We offer delivery only.

338
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,700
Your shop also has a delivery service.

339
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,460
We have something in common, Dad.

340
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,190
Delivery service was Mhon’s idea, not mine.

341
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,590
I don’t like the idea.

342
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,800
Food tastes best when it is freshly cooked.

343
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,960
It should be eaten right away.

344
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,480
Delivery ruins its taste.

345
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,390
Where do you order the pork from?

346
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,090
Order?

347
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,760
No, I woke up at dawn to buy it at the market.

348
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,430
This is how I get the best quality pork.

349
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,720
Dad, my shop also has a calculator like this.

350
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,590
I usually use it as a paperweight.

351
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,060
What kind of vendors need a calculator?

352
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,860
Why can’t you calculate it in your head?

353
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,100
Using a calculator is a waste of time.

354
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,690
My restaurant also uses paper the same size.

355
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,940
You use it to write down orders, right?

356
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,640
Write down orders? I memorize the orders.

357
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,860
If you can’t memorize customers’ orders,
you shouldn’t run a restaurant.

358
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,690
What are you upset about?

359
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,340
Why can’t you talk to him nicely?

360
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,350
Look, he is feeling bad.

361
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,790
Mai, go help Mhon cut morning glory.

362
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,680
Now, it’s your turn.

363
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,300
This one is yellow.

364
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,470
Yellow.

365
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
Is morning glory available in Australia?

366
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,660
Yes.

367
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,180
He doesn’t look trustworthy.

368
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,210
Do you want me to get rid of him?

369
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,470
Excuse me.

370
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,650
This is not what I ordered.

371
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,880
I’m sorry.

372
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,700
Her husband told me
that she is very introverted.

373
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,150
The shop owner told me to give this to you.

374
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,230
What the f*ck!

375
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,740
You are a big man

376
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,130
but you are scared of a tiny cockroach.

377
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,620
Your cool image is gone.

378
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,930
Go wipe the floor.

379
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,160
I finish the rest.

380
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,000
It’s okay.

381
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,910
If you help him clean the shop,

382
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,750
you can definitely win him over.

383
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,670
Dad, watch out.

384
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,810

Dad.

387
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,880
Mhon told me you like snacks from this shop.

388
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,240
I bought it for you.

389
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,170
Dad, take it.

390
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,660
He bought it for you.

391
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,210
Thank you.

392
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,920
This is mine.

393
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,910
I put it in when I bought the snacks and forgot.

394
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,550

396

What are you planning to do with my daughter?

397
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,440
Get out of my shop.

398

399
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,250
Mai, you should leave.

400

Get out.

401
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,440
- Dad.
- Calm down.

402
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,930
Dad, calm down.

403
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,710
You should leave.

Please leave.

406
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,000
Mai, please leave.

407

No.

411
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,290
I won’t leave.

412
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,180
I don’t know how the condoms got in there.

413
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,920
If you ask me

414
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,970
if I have a plan to do something with her.

415
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,020
Yes, I do.

416
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,550
That’s why I came back.

417
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,350
I have an important thing to talk to you about.

418
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,350
I want to marry your daughter.

419
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,590
I want to take her back to Australia with me.

420
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,550
I have a business there.

421
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,390
I can take care of myself.

422
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,120
I can take care of her, too.

423
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,480
Can you give me your daughter’s hand?

424
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,140
What do you think?

425
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,410
What do you think?

426
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,180
If he is the man you love.

427
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,030
If he is a good man.

428
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,010
If he can take care of you.

429
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,690

Yes.

434
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,820
Can I ask you something?

435
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,050
What?

436
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,090
Let’s play rock, paper, scissors.

437
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,040
If I win,

438
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,080
Can I kiss you?

439
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,210

Rock, paper, scissors.

How would you win?

447
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,240
Do you want me to win?

448
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,380
No.

449
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,970

450
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,170
So…

Can I collect my prize?

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,140
Boss.

453
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,010
Boss.

454
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,880
That’s enough.

455
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,080
You can talk normally now.

456
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,700
I want to have this too.

457
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,060
What are you talking about?

458
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,910
Do you know that your plan is going down?

459
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,080
You’re right.

460
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,010
We are trying to break them up

461
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,660
but instead, they are getting married.

462
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,180
They fall even deeper in love.

463
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,860
We used all of Mhon’s weak points.

464
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,370
What else can we do?

465
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,910
There are things we can do.

466
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,870
We just need to change our target.

467
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,430
It’s my time to act.

468
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,690
We need to take care of the shop today.

469
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,450
I can’t go out.

470
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,460

It’s okay, Mhon.

478

Your mom and I can take care of the shop.

479
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,930
I’ll show you
that we can run the shop without you.

480
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,860
When you go live abroad,

481
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400

Are the noodles for Table No. 3 ready?

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,770
They are waiting.

00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,560
Today, the noodles taste different.

497
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,510
Wait a moment. I’ll make you a new bowl.

498
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,250

508
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,410
It has expired for several months.

509
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,000
You need to pay a fine for it.

510
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,540
The total amount is 30,000 baht.

511
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,840
30,000 baht?

512
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,950
Why is the fine so expensive?

513
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,570
This is our normal rate.

514
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,000
I’ll pay it right away.

515
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,370
You can wire the money to this account.

516
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,320
What is the money for?

517
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,070
It’s for…

the fine for your shop’s expired license.

519
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,580

The district…

523
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,990

527
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,460
You can’t wire money
without asking for the details.

She said she was an officer of the district office.

Can you move back to Thailand to live with me?

But I have a business there.

544
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,960
I also have my shop here.

Mom almost fell for a scam.

551
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,870
I can’t leave them.

552
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,290
I understand you.

553
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,700
I also have my family there.

554
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,640
I can’t leave them either.

555
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,820
What should we do?

556
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,050
Let’s decide with rock, paper, scissors.

557
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,490
If you win, I’ll go to Australia with you.

558
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,350
If you lose, we will live here together.

559
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,730
Okay?

560
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

561
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,940
Mhon, are you sure?

562
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,280
We won’t see each other again.

563
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,480
Mhon, please come with me.

564
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,380
You keep it.

565
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,120
You are a noodle cook.

566
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,100
You shouldn’t let your hair get messy.

567
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,100
I’m sorry.

568
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,300
You don’t need to apologize.

569
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,020
It’s not your fault.

570
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,020
It’s nobody’s fault.

571
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,860
Good luck.

572
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,190
You too.

573
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,630
Hey.

574
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,280
What’s wrong?

575
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,870
I have this strange feeling.

576
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,640
It’s probably
you have been working hard for several days.

577
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,950
Your body probably needs chlorine.

578
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,460
You should go swimming.

579
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,060
I guess so.

580
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,680
I went swimming this morning and
had a cacao drink at a shop in front of the condo.

581
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,850
It’s so delicious.

582
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,570
Hello, Miss Daily Worker.

583
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,610
There is an error in your app’s payment system.

584
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,090
So I came to make the last payment.

585
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,630
What do you mean?

586
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,540
I am the anonymous client of this case.

587
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,030
When you were disguised as a waiter at the
Pad Thai restaurant or an officer of the district office,

588
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,020
I recognized that you are from the company.

589
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,390
That’s why I was very cooperative with you.

590
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,230
Why did you do this?

591
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,360
I want to end this relationship.

592
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,220
At least, the pain will not drag on.

593
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,480
No matter how much we love each other,

594
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,490
But the conditions in our lives…

595
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,230
are too different.

596
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,920
There’s no way it will work.

597
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,650
I know…

598
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,550
that I’m strong enough…

599
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,340
to break up with him.

600
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:32,130
That’s why I hired you, Break Up Service.

601
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,590
Thank you.

602
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,500
You did a great job.

603
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,470
These are noodles from my shop.

604
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,400
This time, they don’t taste bad anymore.

605
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,130
Thank you.

606
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,920
She thanks us
even though we ended her relationship.

607
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,520
She wanted to break up with him.

608
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,670
That’s why she hired us.

609
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,020
It’s not our fault.

610
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,740
I know that.

611
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,620
You need to learn
to separate work from personal feelings.

612
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,670
I told you none of our missions are easy.

613
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,160
There are a lot of tougher things waiting for you.

614
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:39,760
We completed the mission.

615
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,870
Aren’t you going to do the Team A hand sign?

616
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,000
The stupid hand sign you invented.

617
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,730
Boss, do you really feel nothing
when you break up couples?

618
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,210
No.

619
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,230
Let’s eat the noodles.

620
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,230
Does it feel burning?

621
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,780
Of course. What a stupid question!

622
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,450
That’s good. At least, you feel something.

623
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:27,860
Hold it.

624
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,250
What is good about it?

625
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,070
Our client this time is Jang.

626
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,290
He’s a college student.

627
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,550
He has a crush on Khao.

628
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,900
He thinks she is dating someone.

629
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,060
We need to find out who her boyfriend is.

630
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,020
Then we will break them up.

631
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,900
Boss, don’t you think you cross the line?

632
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,110
Khao is so stressed
that she wants to jump out of a building.

633
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,800
Cross the line?

634
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,480
Khao.

635
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,100
I just do what I need to do.

636
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,010
You are so selfish.

637
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,430
You only care about yourself.

638
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,900
You are not being professional.

639
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,710
You can’t separate work from personal feelings.

640
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,980
Khao.
