00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,369
<i>Ugh, I want real blood.</i>

2
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:10,349
<i>Put your big boy pants on and become full-fledged vampires!</i>

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,824
<i>It's a man's job to protect his family's happiness!</i>

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,949
<i>You think you can be a strong man by buttering up your wife and kids?</i>

5
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,349
<i>Why can't a man love his wife and kids?!</i>

6
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:24,599
<i>I must become strong for my family!</i>

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,049
<i>Don't you want to become real vampires?</i>

8
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:30,690
<i>I think we should change. It's the "new normal" now.</i>

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,974
<i>I agree with Aoi.</i>

10
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:36,824
<i>I'm banishing you both!</i>

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,474
What happens if we're banished?

12
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:52,015
I don't know.

13
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:58,932
I've heard humans send people to this far-away forgotten island.

14
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:03,315
A forgotten island, huh...

15
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,265
You know who might know more?

16
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,724
A forgotten island?

17
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,365
No, you two can still live here even if banished.

18
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:25,365
Really?

19
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,265
Yeah.

20
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:30,490
Oh, thank goodness.

21
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:37,199
But once banished, you'll have to pay for stuff yourselves.

22
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:42,932
Like the rent for this place and the cafe.

23
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,324
Also,

24
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:49,532
the blood supply from Romania,

25
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:51,865
counseling for vampires,

26
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:55,199
your dental bills, your living expenses stipend,

27
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,474
you can kiss all those goodbye.

28
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,699
Seriously?

29
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:04,590
That's worse than the island.

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,032
Plus...

31
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:11,890
I won't be able to help you out anymore.

32
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:19,299
But you haven't been officially banished yet.

33
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:22,599
Maybe try apologizing?

34
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,465
We didn't say anything wrong!

35
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:26,782
Right?

36
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:30,490
Y-Yeah...

37
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:34,749
Yet, you can't base your whole lives

38
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:40,432
around childish concepts like "right" or "wrong."

39
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:45,649

57

Don't think.

Don't think?

59
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:23,617
Yeah, to think is to look at yourself.

60
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:29,892
Do that and you start to question and doubt yourself, and that causes anxiety.

61
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:32,100
It's impossible to live like that.

62

I totally agree.

64
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:46,075
The pandemic has affected our mental health big time.

65
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:51,075

Yes?

88
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,591
I'll be back again...

89

90
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,551
Okay...

91
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:20,851

92
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,327
I don't mind this fake blood.

Go on, eat up.

184
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:59,288
Okay then, thank you.

185
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,189
That book...

186
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:20,689
Huh?

187
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:23,022
It's Kafka's "Metamorphosis".

188
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,614
Yeah, you know it?

189
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:30,314
I read it before for summer reading.

190
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,806
Umm...

191
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:40,781
I'm Asami Nagae.

192
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:43,281
I'm Aoi Shitou.

193
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:54,331
Sometimes I think I'd like to wake up as an insect.

194
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:57,314
Why is that?

195
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:03,397
If I was a bug, I'd have no worries anymore.

196
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:10,922
Have you ever wanted to transform into something?

197
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:19,750
Me? No, I guess.

198
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:22,556
I see.

199
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:29,497
When COVID hit,

200
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:35,181
I was fired from my long-term job at a Portuguese restaurant.

201
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:41,572
I've only ever done restaurant work, so I couldn't find another job.

202
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:46,797
So my husband is supporting me right now.

203
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:52,931
Until then, there was respect, as equals,

204
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:58,039
but he soon started reminding me that he's paying for everything.

205
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,914
It just became too much, so I left.

206
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,472
But I forgot my wallet.

207
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,581
I'm such an idiot.

208
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,289
I'm the same.

209
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,156
Oh, crap!

210
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:09,256
My body's really craving blood.

211
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,031
Aoi...

212
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,472
What happened?

213
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,589
I was worried sick.

214
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:34,723
Mia?

215
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:38,857
I told you I'd come to say goodbye.

216
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:51,698
- Here.
- Thanks.

217
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:56,615
My last time drinking your coffee, huh.

218
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,107
Please come again.

219
00:18:58,107 --> 00:19:00,416
Aoi is out?

220
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,857
Yes.

221
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:07,041
I've been meaning to ask, what's your relationship with Aoi?

222
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:11,974
My relationship with Aoi?

223
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:20,491
Starting today, you two shall live together.

224
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:23,607
Until the day comes...

225
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,157
We're cousins.

226
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,982
- Cousins?
- Yep.

227
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:34,149
Oh! I totally thought you two were together, together.

228
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:38,691
I'm gay, too, so I just had that feeling.

229
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,941
So, Mia...

230
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,207
Have you always been gay?

231
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:49,166
Yeah, I've liked girls ever since I was small.

232
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:54,524
Then... you've never been with a guy?

233
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:58,699
Nope, no dating, no sex.

234
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,116
Really?

235
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:06,173
Really. Why would I lie about that?

236
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:10,149
<i>So that means Mia is...</i>

237
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:31,166
This is it.

238
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,082
I don't want your money.

239
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:36,599
I insist on it. Wait here.

240
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,957
Okay.

241
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,641
Where'd you go?

242
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,457
Just shopping...

243
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:56,516
I told you to have food ready for me.

244
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,382
I'm sorry.

245
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:03,349
Don't make me repeat myself! I'm tired from working all day!

246
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,849
I'll make it now.

247
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,324
Who do you think pays for all this?

248
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:11,975
Huh?

249
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,216
Be grateful for what I give you!

250
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:16,841
<i>Okay...</i>

251
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,816
<i>- You understand?
- Yes...</i>

252
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:21,233
<i>- Why are you playing around?!
- I'm sorry.</i>

253
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,750
<i>- This is your fault!
- I'm sorry...</i>

254
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,533
<i>You're lucky to have such generous elders.</i>

255
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:35,040
<i>It's your fault I have to work so much!</i>

256
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,240
<i>You don't seem to understand.</i>

257
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,350
Thank me for putting food on the table.

258
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,416
Thank you...

259
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,608
Louder!

260
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:50,025
Thank you for putting...

261
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,858
Don't say it.

262
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:55,333
Aoi!

263
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,617
Who're you?

264
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,608
Hey.

265
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,983
You fooling around while I'm working?

266
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:05,042
No, I forgot my wallet and he lent me money.

267
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,225
Shut up!

268
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,358
You think I'll believe that?

269
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:12,025
Come here.

270
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,209
Come here!

271
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:16,526
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

272
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,834
Let go!

273
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,750
Husband, are you okay?

274
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,467
What the hell is he?!

275
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,076
Let's go.

276
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,184
Aoi?
