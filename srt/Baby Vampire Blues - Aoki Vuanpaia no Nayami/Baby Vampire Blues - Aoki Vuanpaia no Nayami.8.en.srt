Hey!

3
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,307
You okay?

4
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:37,107
Yeah.

7
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:46,507
<i>Found it!</i>

8
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:57,766
Sorry, being alone with you makes me nervous.

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,182
Really?

10
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:00,641
Yes...

11
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:03,566
Actually, me too.

12
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,749
What?

13
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,932
Since this is goodbye,

14
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:14,832
the reason I frequented the cafe
was to see you, not for the coffee.

15
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:19,682
Is that... so?

16
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:21,107
Yeah.

17
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,391
That's why I came here today.

18
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:26,674
To be with you...

19
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:33,107

31
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,142
I'm not cold.

32
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,784
Thank you.

33
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:17,084
I think I'll go back to him.

34
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,792
Why? You finally left.

35
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,159
If you go back...

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,642
I'll be fine!

37
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:25,617
If I apologize, he'll forgive me.

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,300
Let's go.

39
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,992
Go where?

40
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,184
My parents sent me these apples.

41
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:57,217
I wanted you to try them. They're "dee-lish".

42
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,017
"Dee-lish"?

43
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:03,192
It means "delicious" in my dialect.

44
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,017
Like "gustos".

45
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:06,559
Gustos?

46
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:10,475
It means "tasty" in Romanian.

47
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:13,959
You can speak Romanian?

48
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,692
Just a bit.

49
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:22,142
When I think of Romania, I only know Count Dracula.

50
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:25,984
Dracula really existed. Right?

51
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,559
The character was inspired by a real person,

52
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,117
but vampires are made-up creatures.

53
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:34,517
Ouch!

54
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,767
Ow... I cut my finger.

55
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,834
Are you feeling sick again?

56
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm okay...

57
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,084
I'll make you feel better.

58
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:17,984
Here, let me see your face.

59
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,242
Mia?!

60
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:34,859
Just what I thought.

61
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,284
You blood-sucking vampire!

62
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,800
Wait, Mia!

63
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:53,392
I'll make it all better.

64
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,184
Take this!

65
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,300
I'm back.

66
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,201
What's going on?

67
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,734
Aoi...

68
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,576
Wait... why?!

69
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:14,018
Why won't you burn?

70
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,476
You're right.

71
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:27,993
Sou and I aren't vampires yet. We're still baby vampires.

72
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:30,284
Vampires?!

73
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,401
Baby vampires?

74
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,643
Ugh, seriously?

75
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,126
Yup... still babies.

76
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:56,034
Since when were you a vampire hunter?

77
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:57,409
Four years ago.

78
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,909
I was scouted at a Budapest Airport when I was a flight attendant.

79
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,284
On and off since.

80
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:12,186
What's with all that sniffing around?

81
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,477
I'm checking for the scent of musk.

82
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,877
- Musk?
- You don't know?

83
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:19,544
Of course, I do.

84
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:23,194
It's a fragrance made from musk deer secretions.

85
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:28,377
That's right. Male musk deer use this substance to attract females.

86
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:35,061
Vampires are rubbing it over their bodies and homes, to imitate them.

87
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:36,536
Huh?

88
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:43,977
Aren't women attracted to vampires because they're mesmerized by their masculinity?

89
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,561
Don't be ridiculous.

90
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:50,436
I don't know about before, but nowadays, they all rely on musk.

91
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,552
No more vampires rely just on their charm.

92
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,311
Damn! They tricked me.

93
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,144
Who tricked you?

94
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:01,727
Nothing... No, nobody.

95
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:12,777
I don't smell any musk.

96
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:15,427
You really are a baby vampire.

97
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,561
I never knew vampires really existed.

98
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,936
Shocked?

99
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,036
Yeah.

100
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:33,769
But to think of it now, you've never looked human to me.

101
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:38,269
I'm no human, but I'm no vampire either.

102
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,402
I don't know what I am.

103
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,386
But I'm glad I'm not a vampire.

104
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,169
How come?

105
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:56,102
If I were a vampire, I'd have already drunk your blood.

106
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:03,436
Don't be scared. I'll never do that.

107
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:05,177
No.

108
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:08,244
I'm not scared.

109
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,719
I...

110
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,994
I wouldn't mind if you drank my blood...

111
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,027
<i>You should mind!</i>

112
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:38,244
Don't get carried away by your momentary feelings.

113
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,069
As a grown woman, you should know better!

114
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:45,419
Yes. You're absolutely right.

115
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,194
Understood?

116
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,286
What?!

117
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,602
Bring them virgin blood?

118
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:59,127
As in the blood of a virgin girl?

119
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:07,078
Damn those old vampire geezers with outdated ideas.

120
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,745
Listen. Even for vampires, it's now a "genderless" world.

121
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,453
What's "genderless"?

122
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,770
It means no gender distinctions.

123
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,436
Vampires in other countries don't pick their prey based on gender.

124
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:26,453
But Japanese vampires are only allowed to drink women's blood.

125
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:29,995
Not only that, but they still worship virgins.

126
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,661
How rotten!

127
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:32,953
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,203
She doesn't mean you.

129
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:40,811
To begin with, their idea of virgins is a prejudiced notion based on heterosexual love.

130
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:47,203
For example, lesbians like me are "virgins" because we've never slept with a man.

131
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:50,028
It's not that simple!

132
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,961
- True.
- It's messed up.

133
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:57,853
Outsiders don't get to define who's a virgin and who's not.

134
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:01,036
You decide that for yourself.

135
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,761
Um...

136
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:09,411
Can I say something, too?

137
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,111
Sure thing.

138
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:17,745
When I lost my virginity, I didn't bleed.

139
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:23,429
Then, the guy I was dating at the time suddenly went from being kind to angry.

140
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,545
I didn't do anything wrong.

141
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,687
I don't get why men get so hung up on those things.

142
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:33,620
It's just blood, isn't it?

143
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,287
Exactly!

144
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:41,270
Men don't have the right to discuss or take away women's blood!

145
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,162
It doesn't matter if you're a human or a vampire.

146
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:53,620
<i>Virgin blood is the best.</i>

147
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,295
<i>It's virgin blood or no blood.</i>

148
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:01,470
<i>Get me some virgin blood, right now!</i>

149
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:10,479
Tell me the whereabouts of these geezers wanting virgin blood.

150
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:13,979
That's...

151
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:16,829
Didn't they threaten to banish you?

152
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:21,645
I'll do you a favor and banish them to hell first.

153
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,854
If you don't tell me, I'll assume you're one of them.

154
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,045
We are.

155
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:47,912
Just like them, vampire blood runs through our bodies.

156
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:50,604
I can't betray them.

157
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,337
What about you?

158
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,770
I can't, either.

159
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:57,845
I see.

160
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:00,712
Got it.

161
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:09,887
If you're one of them, you give me no other choice!

162
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,162
- Wait!
- Move!

163
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:12,512
No!

164
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,454
Aoi told me he'll never drink my blood.

165
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:18,079
You actually believe that?

166
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,637
You're in la-la land.

167
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,637
What's a vampire hunter doing here? Those two aren't vampires.

168
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:52,058
- I know.
- Then get the hell out.

169
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:53,887
No can do.

170
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:59,172
Didn't you just say you've let vampires drink your blood?

171
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:03,190
- So?
- That makes you a vampire, too.

172
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,397
- Huh?
- Don't play dumb.

173
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,322
Here.

174
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:20,947
What?

175
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,913
Thanks. I love garlic.

176
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:29,480
How are you not afraid of garlic if you've been bitten by a vampire?

177
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,347
Even if I've been bitten, women can't become vampires.

178
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:35,622
Oh, please. That's impossible!

179
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:38,788
There are women vampires in Europe!

180
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:44,822
Not in Japan. Not since I was first bitten in the Heian period.

181
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:47,138
As in 900 years ago?

182
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:51,522
Didn't you say you were 90 years old?

183
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:54,738
Yeah, she told us she was 90.

184
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:57,205
Oopsies!

185
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:04,105
Being around you young boys, the little girl in me made me want to tell a tiny fib.

186
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,788
That's not a tiny fib!

187
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:10,147
How old are you really?

188
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:14,597
I was born in 1120, so exactly 900 years old!

189
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,913
900 years old?

190
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:19,808
Talk about lying!

191
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:30,805
For 900 whole years,

192
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,080
thousands have drunk my blood, and I've attained eternal youth.

193
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,388
But I feel empty.

194
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:45,538
Being a patriarchy, the vampire world discriminates against women.

195
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:49,763
I asked to be turned into a vampire a million times,

196
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,847
but nobody listened.

197
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:55,955
So I gave up.

198
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,922
I see...

199
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,122
Screw them.

200
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:12,122
What do vampires in this country think women are?!

201
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,955
They won't drink the blood of men,

202
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,520
but will only allow men to become vampires!

203
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,555
Are women just tools to them?

204
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:27,338
Do they think all we want is eternal youth?!

205
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:31,120
<i>Is this the right way to go?</i>

206
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:35,456
<i>Are we on the right path?</i>

207
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,747
<i>Where do we go from here?</i>

208
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,539
Ms. Osono,

209
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:57,064
please don't give up on becoming a vampire.

210
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,439
What?

211
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:03,931
You tried to give me and Aoi your blood,

212
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:08,514
even though us being baby vamps, it wouldn't have benefited you.

213
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:15,682
If someone like you were to become a vampire, I feel things will change.

214
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,832
Sou...

215
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,349
I want that, too.

216
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,124
Aoi...

217
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:33,020
For you to become a vampire,

218
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,080
Aoi and I need to make an effort.

219
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,874
But we also need your help too, Mia.

220
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,732
Me?

221
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,290
I can't.

222
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,774
Since when does a vampire hunter help someone become a vampire?

223
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:55,815
It's unheard of!

224
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:57,690
You're right.

225
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,620
But...

226
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,090
abandoning old ways and doing the unthinkable is the "new normal."

227
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:11,457
You're the one who taught me that.

228
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,282
<i>It's the "new normal."</i>

229
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,957
<i>"New normal"?</i>

230
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,674
<i>You've got to adapt...</i>

231
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:26,274
<i>and change.</i>

232
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,665
Aoi and I adapted,

233
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:52,290
and worked during the day and interacted more with humans.

234
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,132
We've done the unthinkable.

235
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:59,882
We never got the blood we came for,

236
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,420
but...

237
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,860
we did figure out how we want to live our lives going forward.

238
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,900
I...

239
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,780
don't want to be a vampire who takes other people's blood.

240
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,915
You might laugh and think I'm naive.

241
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:27,065
After all, I need blood to survive.

242
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:33,215
You might not believe me, and think what I say is impossible.

243
00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:39,957
But I want to challenge myself to do the unthinkable.

244
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:45,590
I want to transform myself into a new kind of vampire.

245
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm sorry if I sound arrogant.

246
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,724
But I have confidence...

247
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:02,849
You can. We can.

248
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:05,749
We'll be vampires who don't drink blood.

249
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,749
I...

250
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,524
I don't really understand what's going on,

251
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:21,258
but I'm getting emotional.

252
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:29,841
I'll also do the unthinkable...

253
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:33,516
and restart my life.

254
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,491
Asami...

255
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,730
I'll...

256
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,540
become a blood-suck...

257
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,058
I'll become a vampire.

258
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,130
I need your help.

259
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,340
Please.

260
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,641
Let's change the world.

261
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,390
Let's show them.

262
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:38,860
final credit

263
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,374
<i>Let me tell you what happened after that day.</i>

264
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:48,058
<i>Despite the rejections, Mr. Ooyabu never gave up writing proposals</i>

265
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:52,649
<i>and directed a movie for the first time in five years.</i>

266
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:57,666
<i>It was titled, "The Return of the Killer Briefs."</i>

267
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:03,716
<i>Nishino started giving private guitar lessons. It was a huge hit.</i>

268
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:09,199
<i>With ten new students, he's quite the busy man.</i>

269
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:12,583
<i>Asami got a divorce right after that day.</i>

270
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:18,341
<i>She now helps Mia's family with their apple orchard in Aomori.</i>

271
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,349
<i>Mia didn't go back home.</i>

272
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:28,483
<i>She's been traveling the country as a devoted vampire hunter.</i>

273
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,858
<i>Thanks to Ms. Osono and Mia,</i>

274
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:37,808
<i>the vampire world has begun showing signs of change.</i>

275
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:43,883
<i>Ms. Osono's dream of women becoming vampires</i>

276
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:46,230
<i>might come true soon enough.</i>

277
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:51,717
<i>And finally, as for me and Aoi...</i>

278
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:58,284
<i>Two days after that night, the day of our given deadline,</i>

279
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,900
<i>Kishioka came.</i>

280
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:06,267
Your banishment has been revoked.

281
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,450
Good for you!

282
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:14,667
<i>He left soon after.</i>

283
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:19,642
<i>He didn't explain why, but we have a pretty good idea.</i>

284
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:25,590
<i>And so, Aoi and I...</i>
