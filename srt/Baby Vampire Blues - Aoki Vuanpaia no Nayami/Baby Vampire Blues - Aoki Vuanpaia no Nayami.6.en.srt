Are you a sleepyhead?

16
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:05,683
What kind of vampire has a pet cat?

17
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:08,224
We're baby vamps, so it's fine.

18
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:10,474
Right, Pisică?

19
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:12,141
Pisică?

20
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,391
Isn't that "cat" in Romanian?

21
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,599
It's fine. I've already decided.

22
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:22,533
Hey, about Mr. Hakkaku...

23
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,783
He's still on your mind?

24
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:30,075
Let's go check out the workshop one more time.

25
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:35,891
Man, you're hopeless. Go home!

26
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,474
Go on home!

27
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:41,991
If you can't cut it, I'm sending you home. Got it?

28
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:43,574
Get the hell out!

29
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:46,308
You, stop crying. Stop it.

30
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:50,541
Listen! Men don't cry. Got that?!

31
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,857
- Don't cry! Understood?
- Yes!

32
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,291
You.

33
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,708
Did you do...

34
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,949
what I ordered you to do yesterday?

35
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,058
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,399
Good.

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,816
Then tell everyone about the guy you mopped the floor with.

38
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,033
Well...

39
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,949
Um...

40
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,133
He...

41
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,991
You.

42
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,858
Did you really do it?

43
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,283
I saw him!

44
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,008
What?

45
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:53,158
Last night, there was a drunk causing a scene.

46
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:59,416
I saw that man over there giving him a mean headbutt.

47
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,659
Is that true?!

48
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,084
Yes!

49
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,367
Yes, sir!

50
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:18,075
You took your first step towards becoming a strong man!

51
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,659

52
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,825

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,867
You turned your passion into a career.

Yeah... I guess so.

80
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:19,242
Being able to follow your heart is admirable.

81
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:22,534
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

82
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,334
- Thank you.
- Of course.

83
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:37,751
Why did you participate in the workshop, Mr. Hakkaku?

84
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,984
I want to make money.

85
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:44,893
To do that, I need to fix my timid personality.

86
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:46,910
That's why.

87
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:51,476
Is that... it?

88
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,810
Yes.

89
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,493
What?

90
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:55,951
Why?

91
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:58,385
- Mr. Hakkaku.
- Yes?

92
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:01,901
Did you get...

93
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,585
laid off?

94
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes.

95
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:18,627
The company wasn't doing well because of the pandemic.

96
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,602
They had to downsize.

97
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:25,344
My boss...

98
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:30,744
He tried convincing me, saying I'd easily find a new job.

99
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,244
So I agreed.

100
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,044
Does your wife know?

101
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:36,894
Absolutely not!

102
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,244
- I can't tell her!
- Why not?

103
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:44,794
I can't let my family worry, no matter what!

104
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:49,227
It's a man's job to protect his family's happiness!

105
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,835
But you can't hide it forever...

106
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:55,419
That's why I'm desperately searching.

107
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,852
I can't be a pushover anymore.

108
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:04,094
I can't survive without the strength to tear others down!

109
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:09,660
Thank you for the coffee.

110
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,694

112
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:24,127
I heard from Kishioka.

113
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,077
So they're pushing you out of baby vamphood?

114
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:29,560
They're not necessarily pushing us...

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Maybe within the year?

116
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,477
You shouldn't be so relaxed about this.

117
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:38,602
Old, conservative vampires are on the rise, especially in Japan!

118
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:42,160
We need young vampires like you to make changes.

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,610
- Right...
- Right...

120
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,894

121
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,869

122
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,744
Come on, bite me!

123
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:54,535
It's time for you to lose your virginity.

124
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:57,727
Come on, give it a good bite!

125
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,410
Okay.

126
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,926
Be a man!

127
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,922
Excuse... Excuse me.

128
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,577

00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:46,236
Sou, what's wrong?

131
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:51,452
Maybe my blood wasn't compatible...

132
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:54,561
Is that possible?

133
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,302
Sou!

134
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:03,819
Vampires and their human prey must have compatible blood.

135
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,319
Are you okay?

136
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:10,836
Yes...

137
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,636
No...

00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,394

141
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,770
Black garlic...?

142
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,820
Yup, it's good for hangovers.

143
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,952
Sorry, but...

144
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:36,928
I don't like garlic.

145
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:41,420
You won't even taste it. Just try one.

146
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,195
Here's some water.

147
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:05,578

We're no different...

179
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:07,204
than Mr. Hakkaku.

180
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,788
What?

181
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:16,163
Blood rations have been suspended because of the pandemic,

182
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:21,938
and in order for us to survive, we must become real vampires quickly.

183
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:27,196
To do that, we have to "man up."

184
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:34,105
We need the strength to tear others down?

185
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,897
What kind of a world is that?

186
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:48,697
Is being strong that important?

187
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,880
I don't need that kind of strength.

188
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:11,688
Not going to the workshop today?

189
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,320
Nah, I've had enough.

190
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,872
Let's go buy food for Pisică.

191
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:20,538
Sounds good.

192
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,513
Sou!

193
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,938
Because of your tardiness,

194
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:50,805
everyone here is being forced to do squats!

195
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:56,380
Tell me why you were late.

196
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:00,597
My train was late.

197
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,930
Is that the truth?

198
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,772
No.

199
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,056
Don't mess with me!

200
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:14,314
Only cowards lie.

201
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,789
Tell me the truth!

202
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,497
I was knitting.

203
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:23,106
- What?
- Show me!

204
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:40,731
Knitting is for chicks with too much time on their hands.

205
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:46,406
If you want to become a strong man, tear that apart right now!

206
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,356
What's wrong, man?

207
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:53,997
Hurry up.

208
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,914
Rip it.

209
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,597
Come on.

210
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,831
I can't!

211
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,464
What?

212
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,581
This is my daughter's birthday present!

213
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:10,889
Come on, give me a break.

214
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,264
Listen to me.

215
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:17,081
Do you think you can be a strong man by buttering up your wife and kids?

216
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,947
Rip it apart already!

217
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,564
Rip it apart!

218
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,497
- Rip it apart! Come on!
<i>- Rip it apart!</i>

219
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:31,897
<i>Rip it apart!</i>

220
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:40,272
Come on, tear it up!

221
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:46,006
Fine, I'll do it. Give it to me!

222
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,514
<i>Master Hanawa!</i>

223
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,872
<i>Hey!</i>

224
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:59,064
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

225
00:16:59,064 --> 00:17:01,047
<i>Hands off!</i>

226
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,613
You have no right to touch this!

227
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:08,290
Why can't men knit?

228
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,315
Why can't he love his wife and kids?!

229
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:16,131
They're...

230
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:20,048
They're too good for me!

231
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,956
That's why I can't be weak.

232
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,373
It's so hard.

233
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:29,248
Do you understand?! Who do you think you are?

234
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,550
It's so hard.

235
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,123
It's unbelievably hard.

236
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:38,130
But I have to become strong for my family.

237
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,815
Give me a break.

238
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:47,498
But I was stupid.

239
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,690
I tried to become strong

240
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,615
without even knowing what strength is.

241
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,773
I...

242
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,673
I...

243
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,366
COVID has...

244
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,407
Papa!

245
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:38,707
What are you...?

246
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,274
I lost my job three months ago!

247
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,299
I was laid off.

248
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:21,541
I didn't want you to worry,

249
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:26,374
so I decided to hide it until I found a new job.

250
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,957
But I've had no luck at all.

251
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:37,141
I'm sorry I'm so unreliable.

252
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,182
You're not unreliable.

253
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,874
All this time...

254
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:58,274
you've worked so hard...

255
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,541
to keep us happy.

256
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,107
That's why...

257
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,141
from now on...

258
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:24,760
let's do this...

259
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,890
together.

260
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,917
Thank you.

261
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,900
Thank you...

262
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,725
Papa!

263
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:42,250
Thank you.

264
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,833
Thank you. Thank you.

265
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,233
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:53,267
I'm sorry for everything.

267
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:58,183
This is true strength, huh...

268
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,358
Thank you.

269
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:27,583
<i>I'll cherish my family, but also myself from now on.</i>

270
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,500
<i>You two taught me that.</i>

271
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,850
<i>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</i>

272
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:41,642
<i>PS, I started to teach knitting.</i>

273
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,533
They're warm.

274
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,392
<i>So, have you boys drunk blood?</i>

275
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,242
I did.

276
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:07,850
But it was incompatible, so I threw it up.

277
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,759
I'm still a baby vamp.

278
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,317
<i>What about you, Aoi? Did you drink blood?</i>

279
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:17,726
Nope.

280
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:22,376
<i>Don't you want to drink chicks' blood and become real vampires?</i>

281
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,067
I have a question.

282
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,042
<i>Sure.</i>

283
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:29,559
Why does it have to be a woman's blood?

284
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,642
<i>That's because...</i>

285
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,759
<i>It's always been that way.</i>

286
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,667
That's not a reason.

287
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:42,476
I think we should change. It's the "new normal" now.

288
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:45,334
<i>How presumptuous.</i>

289
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,734
<i>Hey, Sou!</i>

290
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,059
<i>Teach that little brat</i>

291
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:54,542
<i>that obeying your superiors is the law among vampires.</i>

292
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,976
If I may, I agree with Aoi.

293
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:04,251
<i>What did you say?!</i>

294
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,042
<i>A cat!</i>

295
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,876
Oh, this is Pisică.

296
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,167
<i>Pisică?</i>

297
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:19,234
<i>What kind of vampire keeps a cat?!</i>

298
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:21,584
That's what I thought at first,

299
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:25,434
but once I got used to her, she's been therapeutic.

300
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:28,492
Why don't you all get a cat, too?

301
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:33,920
<i>Sou.</i>

302
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,001
<i>Aoi.</i>

303
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:40,050
<i>I'm banishing you both!</i>
