<i>[Children of the Night]</i>

70
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:48,467
Back when Japan used to have wars, men were required to join the army

71
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:52,242
and take physical exams prior to that.

72
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:56,229
And so, soldiers were considered to be the ideal man.

73
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,710
And then, fighting became equivalent to manliness.

74
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,575
So manliness means being a fighter...

75
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:12,530

No, no, no!

In the modern day, men fight not at war, but in the office.

00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:27,075
They pledge their loyalty to the company.

79
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:31,383
They fight for their companies.

80
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:35,367
They are the manly ones.

81
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,108
In Japan, at least.

82
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:45,200

182
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,888
Come on!

183
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,571
Guys.

184
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:58,479
Never late or absent?!

185
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:04,054
- Only a wuss would boast about that.
- I'm sorry!

186
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:06,629
Give me 50 push-ups, now.

187
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,104
Make some noise, come on.

188
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:15,588
Three! Four! Five!

189
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:18,013
What wusses.

190
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:19,688
Hey!

191
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:22,563
Don't you want to be a strong man?

192
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,146
Don't you want to make money?

193
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:25,954
I do! I do!

194
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:28,563
- Really?
- Really!

195
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,079
Really?

196
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,638
Well then...

197
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:38,325
On your way home today, beat someone up.

198
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:42,496
Here's rule number four.

199
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:44,204
Beat others up.

200
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:50,179
Men grow stronger the more people they beat up.

201
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,646
Beat them up!

202
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:55,263
Do it. Give it to them.

203
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:57,063
Beat them up. Yes.

204
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:59,154
More.

205
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:03,963
Yes, yes! Like that!

206
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,397
We're not made for stuff like that.

207
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,438
Definitely not.

208
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,413
Isn't that...

209
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,255
Mr. Hakkaku?

210
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:40,630
Who are you? Huh? What?

211
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,747
I'm sorry! Uh... I'm just... sorry!

212
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:48,230
Please! Please, don't.

213
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,205
Sorry...

214
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:05,563
<i>It's all his fault, that's right.</i>

215
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:09,230
<i>He's just a moron.</i>

216
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,913
<i>See, that stupid guy lost the documents.</i>

217
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,989
- You want some too?
- You...

218
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,147
Come, come, join me.

219
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:30,864
You...!

220
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:36,039
You're causing people problems, drinking there.

221
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,122
People? There's no one around.

222
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:40,772
That's not the issue.

223
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:43,314
Besides, where's your mask?

224
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:46,189
There's no one around.

225
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,789
That's not the issue.

226
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,331
There are rules in society.

227
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:56,439
If you don't obey those rules, it makes problems for everyone.

228
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,497
Society has rules.

229
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:03,814
And people like you...

230
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:08,664
Guys like you who don't follow...

231
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:36,356
Who do you think you are?

232
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,372
Sorry.

233
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,114
Sorry...

234
00:16:48,356 --> 00:16:50,306
You awake?

235
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,373
Are you okay?

236
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:59,081
Did I beat him?

237
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,523
No...

238
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:03,006
He beat you.

239
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:09,273
- Can you stand?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.

240
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:12,556
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

241
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:14,265
Are you okay?

242
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,290
I'm fine.

243
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,331
I'm fine, really.

244
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:28,381
I'm fine.

245
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,531
I'm fine, yeah...

246
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,831
I'm worried.

247
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:36,498
About what?

248
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,415
At the workshop, when I looked into his eyes,

249
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:45,940
it felt like he was struggling with something.

250
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,474
Maybe I'm wrong, but...

251
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:52,224
Let's go.

252
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:11,657
Be strong...

253
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:16,824
Be strong!

254
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:27,390
Strong...

255
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,799
I'm home!

256
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,357
Welcome home!

257
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,174
Hi, I'm home.

258
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:19,257
You came down for me? Come on, let's go in.

259
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,415
Papa, what happened to your face?

260
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:25,124
Nothing! Nothing happened.

261
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,332
Come on, inside, it's cold.

262
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,852
Do I ignore him?

263
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:33,874
No, I can't let a groper go! Papa won't run away!

264
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:39,574
So I summoned all my courage and stopped him.

265
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:42,524
Papa, did you catch him?

266
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:47,882
Papa, you're amazing! Right, Mama?

267
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,500
Yes, amazing.

268
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,190
Your papa's a hero.

269
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:58,149
Hey, Papa?

270
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,115
What's my birthday present?

271
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:06,200
That's... a secret.

272
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,041
I want an AI assistant.

273
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,816
AI assistant?

274
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:17,066
Yeah, one that answers all your questions.

275
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,249
Is that popular at school now?

276
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:22,666
Yeah, one of her friends has one.

277
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:27,724
Then... I'll add it to my list of choices.

278
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:31,566
Yippee!

279
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,108
Good for you.

280
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,666
Yes! Yes!

281
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,691
Lucky you.

282
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:43,266
He doesn't seem very troubled.

283
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,541
Maybe you were wrong?

284
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,766
Wow, so exciting.

285
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,666
Yay! Yay!

286
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,333
Yes!

287
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:59,385
Papa, good luck at work.

288
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:02,611
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

Yes.

It's just 8:00 a.m.

294
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,767
Are you perhaps... looking for work?

295
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:25,909
- No.
- It's been hard on everyone.

296
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:28,484
You look pretty strong.

297
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:31,900
I've got a great high-paying job for you.

298
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,400

How about it?

302
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:51,092
- I'll pass.
- What, why? You're totally missing out.

303
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,360
Come on, we need to go.

304
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,735
What is he skipping work for?

305
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,818
I thought he liked booze and gambling.

306
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:37,943
I really think he's got some sort of problem going on.
