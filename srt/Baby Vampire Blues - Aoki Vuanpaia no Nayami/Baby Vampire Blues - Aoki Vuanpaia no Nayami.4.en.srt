4

5

<i>And then came the era of "new normal".</i>

6
00:00:27,974 --> 00:00:31,049
<i>We all had to change.</i>

7
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:37,057
<i>But it wasn't just humans that had to change...</i>

8
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:39,865

<i>but you're still baby vamps, so...</i>

11
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:50,157
<i>It's the "new normal." You've got to adapt and change.</i>

12
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:53,490
<i>We may also have to go "new normal."</i>

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,307
<i>Ow!</i>

14
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:57,874

<i>- Apparently, they get blood in return for their services.
- Ow!</i>

17
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:13,149
<i>That was super tempting.</i>

18
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:15,309
<i>This is not what you promised.</i>

19
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,890

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,074
<i>Don't do it!</i>

22
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:27,015
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

23
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,740
<i>Worth it?</i>

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,324
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

25
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,874
<i>I ruined it for everyone.</i>

26
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:36,279
<i>Ruined it?</i>

27
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:41,865
<i>The magazine I'm in charge of has lost sales due to the pandemic.</i>

28
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:45,765
<i>The company ordered a drastic restructuring.</i>

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,449
<i>My team members were outraged.</i>

30
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:55,482
<i>Apparently, the other magazines all went along with the restructuring.</i>

31
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,782
<i>So I couldn't say no.</i>

32
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,331
<i>You should just leave other people alone.</i>

33
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:07,049

You'll help me, right, Aoi?

39
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:34,479
Sure, but help her out how?

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,090
She lacks self-confidence. She has low self-esteem.

41
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,132
So we have to change her, make her believe in herself.

42
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:45,949
No can do.

43
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,049
Why not?

44
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,682
I don't have confidence in myself, either.

45
00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:53,498
Seriously?

46
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:57,469
Why would I? I'm in my 20s and still a baby vamp...

47
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,910
I'm an embarrassment.

48
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:02,058
Hold on.

00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:07,508
What does that make me? I'm older than you.

50
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:23,325
I guess we're both embarrassments.

00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,908

Yes.

Sure I do. Believe it or not, I'm a ball of confidence.

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,483
Did you just laugh, Nishino?

68
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,700
Mr. Ooyabu,

69
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,767
every time your movie proposal flops, you post on social media,

70
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:12,567
"I have no talent! I'm worthless!" You call that confidence?

71
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:18,825
That's... you know...

72
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:22,467
When my proposals flop... I just...

73
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:27,283
It's like a rite of passage. I'm not actually upset.

74
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:30,583
Mr. Nishino, do you believe in yourself?

75
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,725
I am quite the brilliant musician, so yeah, I guess.

76
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,725
- How can you say that?
- What?

77
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:48,056
Every time you play live, you text me saying,

78
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:53,156
"No one's coming! No one will listen to my songs!"

79
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:54,908
That's not...

80
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:58,383
You have no right to talk, then.

81
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:03,575
No... she's wrong! Those are all drunk texts...

82
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:07,200
Who drunk texts long texts like these?

83
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,245
Look here.

Whoa! That's like, over 10,000 characters!

85
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:16,226
Then what about you, Mia?

86
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,810
I don't have any confidence either. I'm a woman with low self-esteem.

87
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,893
If I lived a life full of confidence, I wouldn't be here simmering away.

88
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:31,193
Just like all of you. Right?

89
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,051
- True.
- True.

90
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,007
Dunno why but...

91
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:41,185
we're sorry.

92
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:42,610
- No!
- No!

93
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,535
That's not what I meant!

94
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:47,185

00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:21,285

00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:25,668
Hey! This spice...

101
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,868
It's so touching.

102
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,535
I agree...

103
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:42,335
I don't know why, but it's making me feel emotional.

104
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,010
What did you put in there?

105
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,518
Devil's Cinnamon.

106
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:05,710
- It makes your emotions go wild. Wanna try?
- No.

107
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,593
Really?

108
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:12,368
In any case, it seems no one has any self-confidence.

109
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,880
Yeah...

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,110
What about her?

111
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:28,060
Of course I do! How else could I have survived for 90 years?

112
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,347
How can we boost our confidence?

113
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,155
Easy there, tiger.

114
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:42,136
Your eagerness reminds me of an over-excited virgin.

115
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:45,261
So... sorry.

116
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:48,411
Everything has a process.

117
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,819
Even Lincoln said, "You can't have a promise without process." You hear me?

118
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,077
Yes!

119
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,186
Good boy.

120
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:05,536
There's always a cause for someone's lack of confidence.

121
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:09,544
Figure out the cause, and you'll find a solution.

122
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:13,011
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

123
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,286
I'm Aoi Shitou.

124
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:26,536
Aoi studied psychology at university.

125
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:31,169
I bet you he can offer good advice.

126
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:35,886
I'm sorry for the trouble.

127
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:42,944
What do you think has caused your lack of confidence?

128
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,536
I have a brother who's three years older than me.

129
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:59,877
He's smart and athletic, and was always praised by my parents.

130
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:03,869
But even when I worked hard,

131
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,140
my parents never praised me.

132
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:12,961
Instead, they kept telling me what I was doing wrong.

133
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,327
Being criticized since I was a child,

134
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:26,319
even as an adult, I constantly worry about being called out.

135
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:29,830
So before that happens,

136
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,261
I end up criticizing myself.

137
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:35,920
Criticizing yourself?

138
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,594
Yes.

139
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,511
The day I met Mr. Kurosawa,

140
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:45,469
I was actually in the middle of a self-evaluation.

141
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:55,202
<i>The woman from before...</i>

142
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:57,511
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

143
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,250
<i>Stupid me! Why? Dummy! Idiot!</i>

144
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:07,277
<i>What am I doing?</i>

145
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,928
Right.

146
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,286
I see.

147
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,745
That's typical.

148
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:25,611
You have to give it to girls like her.

149
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,612
Give it to her...?

150
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:32,437
It's not what you think. Give her... compliments!

151
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,020
When you compliment her, make sure it's about something she hasn't noticed about herself.

152
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,620
That sounds hard.

153
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,954
Any moron can insult someone, but praising requires intelligence.

154
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:51,445
Here, try it on me.

155
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,270
You're beautiful.

156
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,662
Everyone knows that.

157
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:01,870
Aoi, compliment me.

158
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,312
If I could put your beauty into words, it would become a poem.

159
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:10,829
Excellent! Here's a reward for you.

160
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,412
Can't eat it, but thanks.

161
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:14,779
- Got one!
- Okay.

162
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,879
You are a walking work of art!

163
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,370
A walking work of art?

164
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,870
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,412
Sou, I knew you could do it!

166
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:29,754
A reward for you.

167
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:33,162
I can't eat this, but thank you.

168
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:37,537
Got another one! Your words are more touching than any novel.

169
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:41,720
Me too! Meeting you was the climax of my life.

170
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,245
- Beautiful!
- Wonderful!

171
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:44,720
- Cool!
- Sweet!

172
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,729
- Sexy!
- Dynamite!

173
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,454
Give me more!

174
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:51,762
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

175
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,287
Momoka, you're talented but modest.

176
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:01,412
Your humbleness is admirable.

177
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:04,112
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,347
That's not true. I don't have any talents.

179
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,730
I'm not confident...

180
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,672
- Lacking confidence now means you'll gain confidence in the future.
- What?

181
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:21,980
In other words, you have potential.

182
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,605
Me? Potential?

183
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,372
- Yup!
- Yup!

184
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,980
Rather than feeling grateful,

185
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,588
your encouragement makes me feel more like a burden.

186
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:44,330
I think it's amazing that you can put yourself aside

187
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,272
and be so considerate of others.

188
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,263
What?

189
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,597
Thank you.

190
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,980
- Of course!
- Of course!

191
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,013
She thanked you instead of apologizing?

192
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:05,230
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,205
That means she's showing signs of change!

194
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,872
Do you think?

195
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:15,438
The final step is to make her believe in herself by overcoming her fears.

196
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:20,022
If she can do that, it's farewell to her low self-esteem!

197
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,205
Yes, ma'am!

198
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,413
No, I can't do it.

199
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:48,388
I've never sung in public...

200
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,597
Don't worry, you can do it.

201
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,330
Come on, let's go.

202
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,981
He's here!

203
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,072
Sorry we're late.

204
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:22,314
No worries. Sorry for calling you last minute.

205
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:27,181
It's okay. I've been itching to play for a crowd.

206
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,331
- Is that her?
- Yes.

207
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:32,439
I'm Momoka Sakurada. Thank you for coming.

208
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,939
Pleasure!

209
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:36,431
Should we get started?

210
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,981
Break a leg.

211
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,747
Good luck.

212
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,664
Will she be okay?

213
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:53,081
Yeah. I know she can do it.

214
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,414
You'll sing "I Think I Can Do It," right?

215
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,339
Yes.

216
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,247

I hope so...

232
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,107
Here, take this.

233
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:01,065
It's cardamom coffee.

234
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:05,015
It'll relax you, so drink it before the meeting.

235
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,015
Thank you!

236
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:27,232

241

I can do it.

242
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,641
I can do it.

- Yeah.

- Night.

00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,540
Shoot!

246
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,790
I mixed up the spice!

247
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,524

250
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,840
Please have a seat.

251
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,499
Boss, the managers are ready for you.

252
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,290
Okay.

253
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,432
What can we do at this point?

254
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:57,282
I don't know, but we can't just look the other way.

There she is!

256
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,958
If we don't value our current readers,

257
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,083
there's no future for this company!

258
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,300
Oh?

259
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,625
She isn't crying.

260
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:29,833
It's easy to opt for a total overhaul in response to a drop in sales.

261
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:36,519
But what happens to the readers who've enjoyed our content all this time?

262
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:44,050
What happens to us, who've cherished those readers?

263
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,125
We aren't machines. Nor are our readers.

264
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,000
Looks like she didn't drink it.

265
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:04,808
You're the one who taught us we can't sell anything without heart!

266
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,708
That's all I have to say.

267
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,666
Please reconsider the restructuring.

268
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:26,233
Okay. I'll convince the Board of Directors tomorrow.

Thank you very much.

270
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:12,542

Yeah.
