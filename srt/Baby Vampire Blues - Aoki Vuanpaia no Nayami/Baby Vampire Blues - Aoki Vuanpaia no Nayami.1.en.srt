00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,048
They don't cover vampires.

175
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:20,715
Right...

176
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:28,565
Dried blood doesn't have many nutrients.

177
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:33,023
We'll never become real vampires at this rate...

178
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,482
Sou...

179
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,482
What?

180
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:46,196
We may also have to go "new normal."

181
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,440
<i>[Children of the Night]</i>

182
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,148
<i>[Do-or-die! We offer lunch now!]</i>

183
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,707
Table three, Spaghetti Napolitan...

184
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,315
Your Spaghetti Napolitan...

185
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,873
- Are you okay?!
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,948
- Your water...
- Pasta Peperoncino, please.

187
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,440
Right away...

188
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,400
And...

189
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,432
extra garlic, please!

190
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:45,415
No, no, we don't use garlic!

191
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,148
Oops, sorry.

192
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:51,223
What's wrong with you, dear? Are you okay?

193
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,948
Yes...

194
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,190
Excuse me a moment.

195
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,973
Sorry about that.

196
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:16,557
<i>[Today's lunch all sold out]</i>

197
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,815
Ugh, I want real blood.

198
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,540
Should we call Osono again?

199
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,823
- Hell, no.
- Why not?

200
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:30,832
She'll let us drink for free.

201
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:32,832
I think she's nice.

202
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:35,729
Even so, Osono's skin is tough as jerky.

203
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:39,750
I'll lose another fang.

204
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:47,248
Baby vamps like us need tender fillet mignon skin.

205
00:18:47,248 --> 00:18:49,890
And how do we find that?

206
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,498
We'll go out and find some.

207
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,873
And if that fillet mignon has COVID?

208
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:59,098
We'll die with our weaker immune systems.

209
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:02,123
Just find someone who's not infected.

210
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:06,773
How? Test them before biting?

211
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,732
Less impulse, more thinking!

212
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,773
I know!

213
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:24,198
What if we find a shut-in? Then there's no risk! Right?

214
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,807
Yeah, but how do we find a shut-in?

215
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:31,040
Go from house to house?

216
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,165
Sou!

217
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:45,982
Don't sulk!

218
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:51,748
Come on, Sou! Don't be like that! I'm sorry!

219
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:59,240
Leave me alone, I'm just an impulsive, useless dummy!

220
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,315
Oh, don't sulk! I said, I'm sorry! Sou!

221
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,848
I'm worried about you, Nishino.

222
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,524
- Why?
- No school, no work, just playing your guitar.

223
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,957
And you? Recently it's all script, no filming.

224
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:31,099
Shouldn't you be working?

225
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,916
It's fine.

226
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,391
My girlfriend is paying the bills.

227
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,957
And my parents are paying the bills.

228
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:44,632
I guess in these difficult times, those who can work can work.

229
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:48,041
You betcha! We'll pay them back in our own way.

230
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,741
Right.

231
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,891
Welcome.

232
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,916
My usual.

233
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,232
Right away.

234
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,875
What's wrong, Mia?

235
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:10,658
I just had an interview for a part-time job. I didn't get it.

236
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:13,950
What? What a bummer.

237
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,541
What job was it?

238
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,916
Private tutor.

239
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,983
Tutor? As in like a guru?

240
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,860
That's "mentor."

241
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:28,749
50,000 yen to tutor a shut-in high school girl once a week.

242
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:31,833
That's 200,000 a month.

243
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,041
I really needed that job.

244
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,125
Huh? Something wrong?

245
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,150
Do tell us more.

246
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,250
About what?

247
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,808
The shut-in high school girl.

248
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,250
If you can't answer a question, use hypnosis.

249
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,541
Baby vamps hypnosis is so weak, it's useless.

250
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,041
You think?

251
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,325
I'm good at transformations though.

252
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,233
Isn't that it?

254
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:38,000

- We're here for the private tutor interview.

255
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,725
<i>I'll be right down.</i>

256
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,325
All right.

257
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,766
Sorry, I know we look sketchy.

258
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:53,141
We're just both super sensitive to ultraviolet light.

259
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:54,583
Right, my friend?

260
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,490
- Is that so?
- Yes.

261
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,548
Please come in.

262
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:02,282
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
