I can't even go out for a second.

But I can't.

00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,580
I'm the only one she has now.

183
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,482
She's not home yet.

184
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:28,305
Phew. I'll go now.

185
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,362
Mom?!

186
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,330
You're fired!

187
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,055
No! I asked him!

188
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:44,064
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

189
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,489
No, wait!

190
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:47,880
Mom!

191
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,030
Sweetie, is he more important to you than me?

192
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,881
What?

193
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:57,231
So you're going to leave me, too!

194
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:59,356
Just like your father!

195
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,648
Mom...?

196
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,648
You're the only one I have left!

197
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:10,290
Why can't you understand?!

198
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,115
I'm sorry. I won't go anywhere.

199
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:21,473
I'll stay by your side forever.

Who gets fired just for taking a walk with their student?

203
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,823
Did you...?

204
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,456
You got fired trying to bite Hana's neck, didn't you?

205
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:07,081
No! We were just taking a walk.

206
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,849
We could've gotten both blood and money...

207
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,632
Sou.

208
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,007
Will you do me a favor?

209
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,632
Why? How did you get in?

210
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,132
Don't you want to leave?

211
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:53,874
But... if I leave, Mom will...

212
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:57,316
"I'm an individual before I'm a mother, a wife."

213
00:17:57,316 --> 00:18:01,791
The protagonist in A Doll's House left thinking that, too.

214
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,557
So... be brave.

Vampires helping humans?

217
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,916
I guess this is another "new normal."

218
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,582
Shoot!

219
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,791
Wait! I think she heard us.

220
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,300
What?

221
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:41,832
Take Hana outside. I'll distract her by mimicking a cat.

222
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:43,566
Got it.

223
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,741
Is someone there?

224
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,807
Is that a cat?

225
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,041
Okay, let's go.

226
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,449
I can't.

227
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,874
I have to tell her how I feel first.

228
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:19,849
Hana...

229
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,483
What are you doing here?

230
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:33,200
Stop it!

231
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,183
Mom.

232
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:42,108
Hana, what are you doing? And you, too!

233
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,550
Don't tell me... Were you two trying to take her outside?!

234
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,033
I'm calling the police!

235
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,733
They did nothing wrong!

236
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,741
They were just trying to help me leave!

237
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,208
Leave?

238
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,016
You're going to dump me, too!

239
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,858
Don't say it like that!

240
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,416
Why do you all do this to me?

241
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,441
Do you know how much I've cared for you?

242
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:19,516
I've loved you so much, all this time.

243
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:25,950
I can't believe you'd betray me knowing what I've done for you!

244
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,408
Mom...

245
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,575
Hey, lady.

246
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:39,471
It is the duty of the parents to shower their children with love.

247
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,385
You're not the only one in pain over your husband.

248
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:49,710
Even your daughter lost her father, too!

249
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,416
But here you are crying that you're the only one suffering.

250
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm... We're all suffering, too!

251
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,583
What?

252
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,833
Not just us. It's been hard for everyone!

253
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,625
But we're all doing our best!

254
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,026
So why don't you accept your new life,

255
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:22,126
your "new normal," and start fresh?

256
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,651
Another order.

257
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,192
Huh? An order?

258
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,292
My bad, gotta run. I'll leave the rest to you.

259
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:56,392
Seriously?

We couldn't get any money or blood after all.

267
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:58,217
But we got the satisfaction of doing a good deed.

268
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,150
Satisfaction doesn't satiate hunger.

269
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,867
Let's hit the sack.

270
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,476
If we sleep, we'll forget about our hunger.

271
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,320
- Good night.
- Night.
