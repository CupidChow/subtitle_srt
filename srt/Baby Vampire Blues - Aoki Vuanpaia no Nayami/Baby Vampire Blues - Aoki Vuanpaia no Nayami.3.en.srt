00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:44,847
That was super tempting.

185
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:52,772
<i>Here's the next yoga pose for when you're fasting.</i>

186
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,272
<i>Place one foot in front...</i>

187
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:57,614
So, why didn't you bite her?

188
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,247
I don't know, actually.

189
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:05,622
Aoi, what are you doing?

190
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:12,272
Learning yoga poses that'll make me forget that I'm hungry.

191
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:15,381
A yoga-loving vampire? Come on.

192
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,422
Want to try? It feels good.

193
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,030
Pass.

194
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,706
More so than that, I bet you that girl's going to come to me like a dog.

195
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,156
A dog?

196
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:30,781
I gave her our card.

197
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,731
She won't come.

198
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,831
Why not?

199
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:38,506
She saw you and ran. Right?

200
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,406
Well...

201
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,260
If you want to put it that way, yeah.

202
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:52,189
She looked like she wanted to say something, though.

203
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:57,297
Come on, you try. Down you go.

204
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,647
Arms up. Like this.

205
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:02,106
Deep breaths. One, two.

206
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:06,439
Wow, you're good! Perfect! Perfect!

207
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:12,164
<i>[Children of the Night]</i>

208
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,414
Sou, we should really label the spices.

209
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:27,397
They all look the same.

210
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,206
Sou?

211
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,110
Huh?

212
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,650
What?

213
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,210
She won't come this late.

214
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,022
She might, on the last train.

215
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:42,806
It's 2:00 a.m.

216
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:45,697
Taxi, then.

217
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,830
She's not coming.

218
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:50,274
Come on, give up.

219
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,840
Okay?

220
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:57,874
Fine.

Yes?

226
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:14,649
I'm so sorry I never came. To think you gave me your card...

227
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,315
It's fine.

228
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:18,915
So... you work here?

229
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,590
Yes, I do.

230
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,790
Kidney Stone...

231
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,207
"Monthly Kidney Stone" Editorial Department?

232
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:38,377
Right, "Monthly Kidney Stone."

233
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,399
It's that way.

234
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,515
Thanks.

235
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,049
So, um, I have a meeting to get to.

236
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:03,915
<i>You liar!</i>

237
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,899
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

238
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,243
This is not what you promised.

239
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:19,151
You promised you'd persuade them.

240
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:23,843
We won't accept your half-hearted excuses.

241
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm sorry...

242
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:32,638
Tell me what you said to the manager. What did you say?!

243
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,622
I'm sorry...

244
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,234
Say something other than sorry!

245
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:50,028
Where do you think you're going?

246
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,967
Don't do it!

247
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:47,200
No!

248
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,875
It's not the answer!

249
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,692
I have no clue what's going on, but it's not worth it.

250
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,720
Worth it?

251
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:03,375
You were just climbing the fence...

252
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,234
You've got the wrong idea.

253
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,384
Yeah?

254
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:09,030
Yes.

255
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,800
Look there.

256
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,400
<i>[500 yen]</i>

257
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,675
500 yen?

258
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,575
Thanks...

259
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,767
I think it was wrong for your boss to scold you in front of everyone.

260
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,525
I'm the boss.

261
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:04,542
You're his boss?

262
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,042
Yes.

263
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,850
He was shouting at his boss?

264
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,567
- Pretty common...
- No, it isn't.

265
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,742
It's just me.

266
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,359
Of course, he'd yell at me.

267
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,917
I ruined it for everyone.

268
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,942
Ruined it?

269
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,334
The magazine I'm in charge of has lost sales due to the pandemic.

270
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:38,292
The company ordered a drastic restructuring.

271
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,150
My team members were outraged.

272
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,134
So as their boss...

273
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,559
So... you managed to persuade them?

274
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,875
No.

275
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:58,792
Apparently, the other magazines all went along with the restructuring.

276
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,230
So I couldn't say no.

277
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:06,409
You should just leave other people alone.

278
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:11,359
I can't! I'm no good at persuading people.

279
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,117
But you're in charge, right?

280
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:21,193
I was only put in charge because a project I worked on sold well.

281
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,618
It was a fluke.

282
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,693
I need to get back.

283
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:35,010
Sorry for complaining to you.
