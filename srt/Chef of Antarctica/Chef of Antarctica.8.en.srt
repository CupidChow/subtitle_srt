1
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:05,055
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:06,055
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,464
(Thanks to the ham slicer, )

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,065
(they have some extra time until dinner.)

5
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:12,564
What are some Korean desserts?

6
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:14,335
- Do we need to make dessert?
- Pardon?

7
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:15,934
(Korean dessert?)

8
00:00:15,935 --> 00:00:17,605
Korean dessert?

9
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,435
Now?

10
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,345
Right now, we could make...

11
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,145
dalgona...

12
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,444
Dalgona?

13
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:25,975
I saw there was baking soda.

14
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:27,785
- Really?
- Yes.

15
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:30,355
- Is there baking soda?
- Yes.

16
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:32,854
They bake their own bread here.

17
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:34,155
It'd be a good way to bring up "Squid Game."

18
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:37,024
(The hottest Korean dessert)

19
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:38,355
(Dalgona)

20
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,795
(With the drama, "Squid Game," becoming a hit, )

21
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:46,365
(the whole world became interested...)

22
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,765
(in the dalgona challenge.)

23
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,334
(With sugar...)

24
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:55,374
(and baking soda, )

25
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,815
(you can make it in 1 minute.)

26
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,175
(A nostalgic Korean dessert, dalgona)

27
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:02,345
(Time to make dalgona)

28
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:05,084
(Making dalgona for the first time in a while)

29
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,715
(Mixing)

30
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:08,954
When the sugar melts...

31
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:10,495
(First, melt the sugar.)

32
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:11,854
Next.

33
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,695
(Add some baking soda.)

34
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:16,465
About a quarter or a fifth. About this much.

35
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,665
(Swish, swish!)

36
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:20,834
Let's try it in a chunk first.

37
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:21,965
Like this for now?

38
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,805
(Jong Won hurries over.)

39
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:28,845
It was my idea.

40
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,445
I like it.

41
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,945
I love it, Crew SUHO.

42
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:36,084
(Crew Paik came outside with the dalgona.)

43
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:37,354
Let's utilize Antarctica.

44
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:38,785
(Let's utilize Antarctica.)

45
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:43,055
(The weather in Antarctica is perfect for cooling dalgona.)

46
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,595
That's hot.

47
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,295
(Tapping)

48
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:51,035
How did you press that?

49
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,234
Did you just press it?

50
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:53,334
With my hand.

51
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:54,665
(Laughing)

52
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:56,464
I'm really utilizing the cold weather of Antarctica.

53
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:57,774
(Gathered around)

54
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,275
- Dalgona.
- Oh, it's cold.

55
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:01,244
That looks delicious.

56
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,505
I bet this will be a hit.

57
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,174
It's nice and fluffy.

58
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,475
Gosh, it's cold.

59
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:06,875
Hey.

60
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,185
- Yes?
- When this is ready,

61
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:09,685
I'll cut a piece off,

62
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:11,814
- so have the chef try it.
- Okay.

63
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:14,124
Ask if he's had it before.

64
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,255
Carefully.

65
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:16,525
Do you know "Squid Game?"

66
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,925
There, it was very small.

67
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:20,224
Too stingy.

68
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,564
We make it big.

69
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:23,095
(We make things big on Chef of Antarctica.)

70
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,735
(One, two!)

71
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:30,604
(Crunchy)

72
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,074
(Pulling the sticky dalgona)

73
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:33,075
Okay. Let's go.

74
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:34,104
Cheers.

75
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:35,145
(Dalgona cheers)

76
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:40,845
(How does dalgona cooled with Antarctic wind taste?)

77
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,014
"Squid Game!"

78
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,415
("Squid Game!")

79
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:47,455
Oh, the dalgona is sweet.

80
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:48,984
That's why it's called dalgona.

81
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,225
(Dalgona is so sweet.)

82
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:53,995
(Soo Hyang goes directly to the chef.)

83
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:58,195
Chef.

84
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:02,165
Have you tried this before?

85
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,534
Dalgona.

86
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,675
(Does this Argentine chef know about dalgona?)

87
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,545
No.

88
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,415
Do you know "Squid Game?"

89
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,215
Yes!

90
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,085
(The chef reacted to "Squid Game.")

91
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:20,184
They had this in "Squid Game."

92
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:21,655
They go like this.

93
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,384
(Dalgona is more well-known as the "Squid Game" snack.)

94
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:25,625
If you don't cut out the star, you die.

95
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:30,165
Did you just make this, or did you bring it?

96
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,234
We just made it over there.

97
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,334
(We just made it!)

98
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:34,505
Really?

99
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,165
Try.

100
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,905
- Very sweet.
- Very sweet.

101
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:43,375
Super sweet.

102
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,214
I'm curious if you think the Argentine crew members...

103
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:47,445
will like this.

104
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:51,355
They'll go crazy when they see the "Squid Game" snack.

105
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,885
(Hold on.)

106
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,185
(The chef suddenly goes somewhere.)

107
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,224
(He goes into the storage room.)

108
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,695
He said he liked it.

109
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:02,165
(Rummaging around)

110
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,264
(The chef hands SUHO something.)

111
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:05,434
Amazing!

112
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,435
(Laughing)

113
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,705
We got it.

114
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,375
(Our passionate man comes out looking excited.)

115
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,274
Wait. This...

116
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:14,805
Are you trying to kill them all?

117
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,544
The dalgona challenge with this?

118
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:18,045
Talk about being cruel.

119
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,485
(It'll basically be a massacre.)

120
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,154
- Mr. Paik.
- SUHO's morality...

121
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:26,485
Look at this. He wants to do the dalgona challenge with this.

122
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,325
I think this is too easy. Let's use this instead.

123
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,355
- Hey...
- Let's use this instead.

124
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,694
There could be a scandal about your...

125
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:36,665
- My character?
- Yes, your character.

126
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:38,265
- I'm going to use this.
- Do what you want.

127
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:40,064
It is pretty.

128
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,104
- He knew what it was.
- Really?

129
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,365
He got this out for us.

130
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,135
(I have more.)

131
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:47,874
Awesome.

132
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,675
(You're the best.)

133
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:50,815
Exactly.

134
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:52,874
This will do.

135
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,014
(Today's dessert, dalgona)

136
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,784
Dalgona will be easy to make with these.

137
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:56,844
(Time to make dalgona with their cookie molds.)

138
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:57,985
Press it.

139
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:00,854
With that...

140
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,285
That's good. Don't press too hard.

141
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:04,655
That's good. We got one.

142
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:06,455
(A big reaction)

143
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,925
(The first dalgona created at the Argentine base)

144
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:10,964
(They finally made one.)

145
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:13,195
We just need to make 30.

146
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,704
When they're done, take them out and make a layer of sugar.

147
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,275
- I'll give you 3 or 4 at a time.
- Okay.

148
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:21,505
(This time, it's a dalgona factory.)

149
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:24,375
Here we go.

150
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,674
Here it comes.

151
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:27,815
(Here it comes!)

152
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,285
When he pours it here,

153
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,255
let's each press one.

154
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:32,784
Move.

155
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,785
(Crew Paik stirred the dalgona with all of his might.)

156
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,584
(It's time to press in the shapes.)

157
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:37,625
Press this one.

158
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,455
They're hardening.

159
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,525
Why is this happening?

160
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,594
- This won't come off.
- Pull it off carefully.

161
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,865
Be careful.

162
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,965
(Their original plan was to press them flat...)

163
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,405
(and press in pretty shapes with the cookie cutters.)

164
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,775
Be careful.

165
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:56,974
It's not working.

166
00:05:56,975 --> 00:06:00,075
(The dalgona is getting stuck and isn't coming off.)

167
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:03,515
The dalgona kept sticking.

168
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:09,024
I wanted to serve them prettier dalgona.

169
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,854
It only worked well at first.

170
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:13,654
I don't know why they kept on sticking.

171
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:15,225
(I don't know why they kept on sticking.)

172
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:19,064
I started to think that it was happening...

173
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,805
because our ladles got too hot.

174
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:25,474
(After thinking for a while, our sous chef...)

175
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,535
Let's see.

176
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,245
Is there no ice?

177
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:34,514
I was wondering if it would be better to press...

178
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,285
the dalgona with something cold.

179
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,285
"Let's utilize Antarctica."

180
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,184
(Where did our sous chef go in search of ice?)

181
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,295
Oh, it's cold.

182
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:45,554
It's so cold.

183
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,065
(This is Antarctica, the land of snow and ice.)

184
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:49,724
I thought pressing it with snow...

185
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,895
would make them pretty...

186
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,335
without having them stick.

187
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:54,765
Oh, it's cold.

188
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,874
(Soo Hyang brought a bunch of Antarctic snow.)

189
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,005
Antarctic water.

190
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,375
Antarctic ice.

191
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,644
- Okay.
- Okay.

192
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,845
(Will it not stick this time?)

193
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:13,254
One.

194
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,285
(Pressing)

195
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,654
It's working.

196
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:19,295
(It came off easily!)

197
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,695
It's working.

198
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,695
(Thanks to our sous chef's idea, )

199
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:30,265
(the dalgona is coming off much more easily!)

200
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,535
How many do we have?

201
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,274
One, two, three, four, five, six,

202
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,504
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,

203
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,675
twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

204
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:36,845
This looks nice.

205
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:38,345
Let's keep the factory going.

206
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,175
That didn't come out nicely.

207
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:41,745
I think this is enough.

208
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:42,885
Twenty-two.

209
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,484
- What time is it?
- Let's see.

210
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:46,755
It's 6:31pm.

211
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:51,895
(Mom, it's time to eat.)

212
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:53,554
(Dinner time: 6:30pm)

213
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:54,724
The first round of grilling is done.

214
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,965
Yes!

215
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:02,035
(Sous Chef Soo Hyang heads out to greet the guests.)

216
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:03,564
(Smile on)

217
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,805
Hello.

218
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,235
Please come.

219
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:08,074
Come. Come sit.

220
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:09,405
(The entrance is already full.)

221
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:11,945
- Hello.
- Hello.

222
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,184
Oh, they were waiting outside.

223
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,185
(All 30 came at once.)

224
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:21,985
(The chefs for the Argentine base take their seats too.)

225
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:24,395
(We were waiting.)

226
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:27,324
The room feels different with the white, right?

227
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,764
(The room feels different with the white, right?)

228
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:29,964
This isn't ours, right?

229
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,065
No, it's not.

230
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:34,635
(The eye-catching tablecloth)

231
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,104
I'll quickly try...

232
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:38,435
setting...

233
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,075
the table.

234
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,404
(He laid out each tablecloth...)

235
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,475
(for the Argentine crew members.)

236
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,075
(From the classic, Argentine mood...)

237
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:51,015
(to a clean, luxurious mood)

238
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:56,155
(When else will we have a Korean chef cooking for us?)

239
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,395
- In Antarctica, at that.
- In Antarctica, at that.

240
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:02,425
(For the crew members, who are very excited for Korean food, )

241
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:06,565
(SUHO and Jong Hyeop do some last-minute work.)

242
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:10,605
(So their bulgogi can stay warm during the whole meal, )

243
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,834
(they lay charcoal under the pan.)

244
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,975
Amazing!

245
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:15,944
Oh, that smells good.

246
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:18,345
(Add the delicious bulgogi, and everything is ready.)

247
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,745
(Your bulgogi is here.)

248
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:24,314
There it is.

249
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,955
(There it is.)

250
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:28,755
(Jong Hyeop serves it himself.)

251
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,255
(Today's main dish, Korean bulgogi)

252
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,895
(Applauding)

253
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:37,765
(Smelling)

254
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:41,865
It smells good.

255
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:46,275
That seriously smells amazing.

256
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:54,745
(The Argentine crew members already love the smell.)

257
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,555
You're going to love it.

258
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:01,555
Let me give you a bit of an explanation.

259
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,855
With Argentine asado,

260
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,624
you use thicker meat...

261
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,624
and just some salt and grill it for a long time...

262
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,664
with lots of care.

263
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:14,805
With Korean barbecue, Korean bulgogi,

264
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,874
we put a lot of care into the marinade.

265
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,274
You have the taste of the meat...

266
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,574
and also an authentic Korean flavor. There's something called soy sauce.

267
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,475
Instead of salt, we use soy sauce and sesame oil.

268
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,145
In Korea, sesame oil, soy sauce,

269
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,315
and garlic are important.

270
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,654
We add those three things in...

271
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:37,454
and massage the flavors in the meat with care.

272
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,425
(Mix it well to let the meat absorb the sauce evenly.)

273
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,924
With Korean barbecue, we cook the meat very fast...

274
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,464
over very high heat...

275
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:46,564
to keep the juices and seasoning inside.

276
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:49,465
(Grill it once over a strong fire to trap the juices inside.)

277
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,274
With love, care, and affection.

278
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:54,505
(Grill it over charcoal once more to make it extra savory.)

279
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:56,044
You have to do it over the fire.

280
00:10:56,045 --> 00:11:01,045
(Juicy and full of that smoky aroma)

281
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:05,615
(A piece of smoky meat)

282
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,185
We're still grilling more meat.

283
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,825
Take your time and enjoy.

284
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,165
(Thank you for the meal.)

285
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:19,335
(Will the Argentine crew members like Korean bulgogi?)

286
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:23,235
(Cutting it up and taking a bite)

287
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,735
(Chef Andres takes a bite too.)

288
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:28,945
(What is this flavor?)

289
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,315
(He takes another bite right away.)

290
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:39,155
(Everyone quickly digs in.)

291
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,185
Very good.

292
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:45,325
They grilled it quickly, but it's tasty.

293
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,295
The meat is sweet.

294
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:50,025
We need to get that recipe.

295
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,995
(I can't stop eating it.)

296
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:58,575
Maybe it's the sesame oil,

297
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:02,645
but the meat has a smoky aroma.

298
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,715
(The nuttiness of sesame oil and the smokiness of charcoal...)

299
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:10,245
(make the bulgogi nice and smoky.)

300
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:13,584
It's delicious.

301
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:14,585
(Thumbs up)

302
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,425
Very good.

303
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:18,495
(Taking a bite)

304
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:23,765
(Everyone is enjoying the bulgogi.)

305
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:28,005
(The Argentine crew members loves Korean bulgogi.)

306
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,235
See how much of the meat they've gone through.

307
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,575
- We can serve them more.
- Sure.

308
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,445
(He quietly slips out...)

309
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,915
(and scans the table with the eyes of an eagle.)

310
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,445
(Empty)

311
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,385
(The bulgogi is completely gone.)

312
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:48,555
They're done with it.

313
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:49,654
- I think we can serve more.
- Really?

314
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,654
They're enjoying it more than I expected.

315
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:52,825
Of course.

316
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,965
It'd be hard for people not to like this.

317
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,734
(Adding more delicious bulgogi onto the charcoal)

318
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:00,834
Should I grill it one more time?

319
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:02,265
(Adding more delicious bulgogi onto the charcoal)

320
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:05,405
When you pile them up,

321
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:06,834
the residual heat cooks them a bit more.

322
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:08,475
(Plating up the nicely-cooked meat)

323
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:10,705
Would you like some more?

324
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:16,385
(Jong Hyeop is working hard to serve the food.)

325
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:20,085
"Mashita."

326
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,385
- Amazing. Good.
- Thank you.

327
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:23,925
Thank you.

328
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:26,654
"Mashita."

329
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,395
(He said he liked the food in perfect Korean.)

330
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:36,465
(The taste of the bulgogi made their language barrier disappear.)

331
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:37,805
They're enjoying it.

332
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,775
Right. I saw that they were almost done.

333
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,574
Yes,

334
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,674
but the lettuce thing is very...

335
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:45,215
- Is it popular?
- Yes.

336
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:46,775
They love that.

337
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,285
(What is the green dish the Argentine crew members like?)

338
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:52,684
You must eat all of this.

339
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,225
(You must eat all of this.)

340
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:57,955
(Laughing)

341
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:01,665
(What is this dish?)

342
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:04,334
(Looking carefully)

343
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,435
It's lettuce.

344
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,364
Lettuce?

345
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:09,265
(Lettuce?)

346
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,035
(What is this dish...)

347
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:15,205
(next to the bulgogi?)

348
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:18,474
Like us, they mustn't have...

349
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,685
gotten to eat fresh greens.

350
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:25,185
So we decided to make a salad using spring cabbage.

351
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,914
This salad you're eating now...

352
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:30,255
was made with the vegetables that were grown...

353
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:31,854
at the Korean station.

354
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,695
We made a chimichurri-like sauce.

355
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:38,565
(Korean chimichurri?)

356
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:42,734
It's a sauce eaten in South American countries...

357
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,774
where people eat asado...

358
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,805
that feels like a salad dressing or a sauce we put over tofu.

359
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,874
They love it.

360
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,274
(The Antarctic-style chimichurri they ate at lunch)

361
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:52,644
It's tasty with just salt,

362
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,245
but it's also really tasty with chimichurri.

363
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:01,825
Normally, it's made with green vegetables,

364
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,754
but fresh greens are hard to come by here,

365
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:05,794
so they used dried herbs.

366
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:06,825
(Made with dried herbs and olive oil)

367
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:11,435
(Meanwhile, King Sejong Station has a greenhouse.)

368
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:17,065
(For the Argentine crew members)

369
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:20,035
You just snap these off.

370
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,875
- Spring cabbage.
- Spring cabbage.

371
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,444
Let's take some of these.

372
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,645
(They're going to make chimichurri with spring cabbage!)

373
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,144
Chimichurri isn't that hard.

374
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:29,615
With the right ingredients, it turns out very well.

375
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:31,415
So I thought,

376
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:32,955
"We should make them chimichurri."

377
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:37,055
(That's why they made spring cabbage salad.)

378
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:41,165
(Watch out for that forward head posture.)

379
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:44,325
(1. Finely chop the rinsed spring cabbage.)

380
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,794
We'll still be a while.

381
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,035
(We'll still be a while.)

382
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:50,834
I chopped so much by myself.

383
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,475
It's been a while since I've done any chopping.

384
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:59,315
(A mountain of cabbage)

385
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,814
You can do it.

386
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:02,845
(Set aside the finely chopped spring cabbage for now.)

387
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,385
I finely chopped spring cabbage for the salad.

388
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:09,884
Minced garlic. Vinegar.

389
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,055
Lemon juice.

390
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:14,025
And olive oil.

391
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:15,925
I'll season it with salt.

392
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,535
Let's add a bit of a kick...

393
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,265
with some pepperoncino.

394
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,634
(What is this green sauce he's adding?)

395
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:24,334
The chef gave us...

396
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:26,475
some pesto he made himself.

397
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:29,575
It was basil pesto.

398
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:34,415
(While the crew members were cooking...)

399
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:35,545
Chef.

400
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:36,584
(Chef, look at this.)

401
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:37,684
Chef.

402
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:39,214
(What is it?)

403
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,255
What's that?

404
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:41,485
Is it pesto?

405
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:44,154
Oh, pesto. Oh, good.

406
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:46,825
(Basil pesto)

407
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,594
I mixed in a bit of basil pesto.

408
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,525
(The rich, herby aroma of the basil pesto...)

409
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,465
(added a deep, savory richness.)

410
00:16:56,565 --> 00:17:00,905
(Add in the finely chopped spring cabbage.)

411
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:06,245
(Mix it nicely to evenly coat with the sauce, and it's done.)

412
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:10,985
(The sauce for the bulgogi grilled in the asado oven)

413
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:16,285
(Korean-style spring cabbage chimichurri)

414
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,025
It's a salad.

415
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,565
It's been such a long time since we had vegetables.

416
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,994
I missed lettuce so much.

417
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,005
(I missed lettuce so much.)

418
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,464
When was the last time we had vegetables?

419
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,275
Didn't we have them last around March or April?

420
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,044
We haven't had vegetables for 11 months.

421
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:38,445
(We haven't had vegetables for 11 months.)

422
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:43,315
(How do vegetables taste after not having them for 11 months?)

423
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:46,715
(Yummy)

424
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,954
(Speechless)

425
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,195
It's so nice to have vegetables again.

426
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:54,594
The salad is so good.

427
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,195
(The salad is so good.)

428
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,965
(You don't have to tell me twice.)

429
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:00,495
(Sighing)

430
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,034
I feel like I could spend another year here.

431
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:05,235
(I feel like I could spend another year in Antarctica.)

432
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,705
This is what lettuce should taste like.

433
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:19,315
(Rediscovering the true taste of vegetables)

434
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:23,955
(Meanwhile, Chef Andres)

435
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:27,655
(Scraping the bowl down to the last drop)

436
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:30,725
(Is everyone enjoying the food?)

437
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,234
(Proud)

438
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:33,635
We did a chimichurri sauce,

439
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:37,435
and it was received better than I had anticipated.

440
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:40,235
I regretted not bringing more lettuce.

441
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,975
I thought I had brought too much spring cabbage,

442
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,474
but they loved it.

443
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:47,175
Because of that, I learned that those stationed in Antarctica...

444
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,044
have been craving fresh vegetables.

445
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:52,885
(They've been craving fresh vegetables.)

446
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:58,355
(In Antarctica's harsh environment)

447
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,795
(They stay for about a year to conduct research.)

448
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:06,835
(It's been a while since they had green vegetables.)

449
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:08,735
It's so good.

450
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,275
It's delicious.

451
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:13,775
Absolutely incredible.

452
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,905
(Absolutely incredible)

453
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,015
Gosh, this is so good.

454
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,714
(The spring cabbage salad adds umami...)

455
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:26,085
(and cuts through the heaviness of meat.)

456
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:30,084
(The crew members are in love with the sweet and tangy combo...)

457
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,495
(of bulgogi and spring cabbage salad.)

458
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,224
Is it good?

459
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,895
- It's so good.
- It's delicious.

460
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,395
(What a relief.)

461
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,365
(It's really good.)

462
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:44,605
We made it with love.

463
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:49,305
(We made it with love.)

464
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,574
We made it with love.

465
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,885
(We made it with love.)

466
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,225
(As the dinner made with love comes to an end)

467
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:07,424
(You know...)

468
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,695
(When will dessert be served?)

469
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,095
(Well...)

470
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,005
Do you know "Squid Game?"

471
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,474
(We know it!)

472
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,035
Do you know...

473
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,405
the sugar candy the characters had to trim...

474
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,575
in order to survive?

475
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,915
(Of course, we know it.)

476
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:31,654
In Korean, it's called dalgona.

477
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:34,085
That's what we prepared for you today.

478
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:38,395
(They can't hide their excitement.)

479
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:42,525
(Dalgona!)

480
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:44,734
(In "Squid Game")

481
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:47,395
(Trimming)

482
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:51,705
(The dalgona announces the start of the game.)

483
00:20:56,145 --> 00:21:00,515
(Instead of a pink soldier, Passionate SUHO serves the dalgona.)

484
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:02,785
Will something happen to us?

485
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:06,085
(Bang)

486
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:08,785
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

487
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,495
This is a dessert with a homemade feel.

488
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:14,864
Okay, it's a homemade-style dessert.

489
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:16,295
It has a homemade feel.

490
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:17,894
(Looking at his colleague's dalgona, )

491
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,665
(and then at his)

492
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:21,135
It's a heart.

493
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,264
(Glancing)

494
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:25,905
They all have different shapes.

495
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:29,305
(A person, a flower, a heart)

496
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,575
Yours is a flower.

497
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:39,185
(He was given the dalgona with the toughest shape.)

498
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:42,085
I'm worried I might break it.

499
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:46,855
(A victim of SUHO's massacre)

500
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,925
Please, no.

501
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,095
Did you already break yours?

502
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:55,835
(He lost the game the second he picked it up.)

503
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:59,934
(Darn!)

504
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:03,545
Look. I already ruined mine.

505
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,145
(You're dead, my friend.)

506
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,715
(Carefully)

507
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,315
(Let's give it a taste.)

508
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,885
(A bite)

509
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,795
Isn't the dalgona delicious?

510
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:20,724
It's really good.

511
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:22,165
(It's really good.)

512
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:26,665
It tastes like a caramel-flavored meringue.

513
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,705
Isn't this basically melted sugar?

514
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:34,004
Sugar is stirred.

515
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:35,344
(Like this)

516
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,575
Then it's left to cool down.

517
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:38,715
The dalgona melts in your mouth.

518
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,015
(Dalgona, aren't you sweet?)

519
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,615
They're loving the dalgona.

520
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:43,984
Apparently, they all know what it is.

521
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:45,255
- Really?
- Yes.

522
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:46,984
What an idea from SUHO.

523
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:48,015
(Happy)

524
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:52,095
They didn't come out in the prettiest shape,

525
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,795
but I was glad to see the crew enjoying them.

526
00:22:55,895 --> 00:22:57,295
It turned out...

527
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:59,595
to be the perfect meal from start to finish.

528
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:02,735
(The K-fusion meal was a huge success.)

529
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:06,675
Chef, thank you for the wonderful dinner.

530
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:09,305
It was an honor to have you in our kitchen.

531
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:12,474
It was a joyful and satisfying time for the Argentine crew.

532
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,915
(It was a joyful and satisfying time for the Argentine crew.)

533
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:16,815
Thank you so much.

534
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:18,815
Chef.

535
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:21,985
People in Argentina...

536
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:27,455
love Korean dramas and culture.

537
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:31,595
We are your greatest fans, and your meal today made our day.

538
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:33,094
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

539
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,234
Thank you.

540
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:38,105
(A joyful meal for those who made it and for those who ate it)

541
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:40,135
While in Antarctica,

542
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:42,545
we got to visit a neighboring foreign station,

543
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:44,045
and despite lacking in many ways,

544
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:47,815
we still managed to serve them a hearty meal.

545
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:52,455
The crew expressed their gratitude in so many ways,

546
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:57,355
making us realize we brought them comfort...

547
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:59,525
and were of help.

548
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,964
Our long trip to Antarctica...

549
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:05,734
ended up being more than worth it.

550
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,295
(Our long trip to Antarctica ended up being more than worth it.)

551
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:11,635
(With the special meal service finished, )

552
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:15,704
(it's time to go back to King Sejong Station.)

553
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:20,045
Here's a small gift from our crew and station.

554
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,314
Thank you so much.

555
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:25,154
(A gift of cooking ingredients for King Sejong Station)

556
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,355
Thank you so much.

557
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:28,284
(This morning, they brought cooking ingredients...)

558
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,084
(from King Sejong Station for an exchange.)

559
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:34,095
(Apple jam)

560
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:37,495
(Fish)

561
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,834
(The Chef of Antarctica team...)

562
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:43,904
(delivered food and condiments the Argentine station might need.)

563
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:45,075
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

564
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:50,975
(As a token of gratitude, meat was given in return.)

565
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,074
Thank you so much.

566
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,545
They were so generous.

567
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:56,814
As we were leaving, they gave us...

568
00:24:56,815 --> 00:24:58,085
a big box of meat.

569
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:59,415
They sure love their meat.

570
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:01,954
The people are very affectionate.

571
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:03,185
(The people are very affectionate.)

572
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:06,955
(Have a safe trip back.)

573
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,525
Bye!

574
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,795
(The Argentine crew waved them off until they were gone.)

575
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:18,065
(A precious encounter in the coldest winter world)

576
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:19,704
Bye.

577
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:22,105
(Carrying the memories of a hearty meal, )

578
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:29,015
(they return to King Sejong Station.)

579
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:33,315
(Because it was unclaimed, )

580
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:36,084
(the land could belong to everyone.)

581
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:39,355
(Antarctica)

582
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:43,765
(Crew members from 58 countries all over the world)

583
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:48,265
(Choosing to cooperate rather than compete)

584
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:53,005
(They not only exchange food and cooking ingredients, )

585
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,544
(but also research together...)

586
00:25:56,545 --> 00:26:01,215
(and share each other's culture.)

587
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:05,585
(They open their doors to all those around them.)

588
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,585
(Antarctica, where people cooperate and assist each other)

589
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:14,095
(A day of experiencing Antarctica's culture firsthand)

590
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:19,465
(The following evening)

591
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:22,104
Hello. Come on in.

592
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:23,264
(They gather after being called over by Leader Lee Hyeong Geun.)

593
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:24,535
Please take your seats.

594
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:29,575
I'd like to go over your schedule for tomorrow.

595
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:31,074
You probably already know this,

596
00:26:31,075 --> 00:26:34,145
but many countries have stations here on King George Island.

597
00:26:34,315 --> 00:26:37,744
And because of the Antarctic Treaty System,

598
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:40,514
only scientific research for peaceful purposes...

599
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,855
can be conducted here.

600
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,295
It's a continent shared by all of mankind.

601
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,454
Because of that, we have close relations...

602
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:50,665
with foreign stations and interact with them often.

603
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,834
One of them happens to be the Chinese station.

604
00:26:52,835 --> 00:26:56,265
Since China's Great Wall Station and our King Sejong Station...

605
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,634
are both from Asia,

606
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:02,275
we have a lot in common culturally.

607
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:04,245
The stations are in close proximity,

608
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,715
which enables collaboration on many fronts.

609
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,085
For instance,

610
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,685
when China's icebreakers come our way,

611
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:15,125
they help us ship equipment and gear...

612
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,825
that are too large for us to bring by boat to King Sejong Station.

613
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:22,564
Meanwhile, what we have is a barge.

614
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:26,635
There's a barge that lets us carry and unload cargo on the water.

615
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,534
When unloading heavy goods and cargo,

616
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,305
our barge is essential,

617
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:32,005
so we once lent it out...

618
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:35,405
and helped them unload their shipment.

619
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,504
Without the help of China's station,

620
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:40,444
we'll have trouble operating our own.

621
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:42,685
(In Antarctica, they get by through cooperation.)

622
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:44,885
That's something I didn't know.

623
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:48,455
(I see.)

624
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:51,084
That being said, we were hoping...

625
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:53,795
that Crew Paik and the rest of the crew...

626
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:55,695
would go to China's station...

627
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,095
and serve them a delicious meal.

628
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,634
It would help immensely...

629
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:04,705
when we need favors or cooperation from them.

630
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:07,204
You'll see when you get there,

631
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:08,205
but everything they have is frozen too.

632
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,744
It's the time of year...

633
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:13,644
when unfrozen ingredients are impossible to find.

634
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,215
Please keep that in mind.

635
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,314
Are we set to visit...

636
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:20,885
- China's station tomorrow, then?
- That's right.

637
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:23,625
(Coming up)

638
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,054
Has this ever happened to me while filming before?

639
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:27,155
(Has this ever happened to me while filming before?)

640
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:28,995
Can't we wait a little while longer?

641
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:30,924
What do we do?

642
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:32,665
(What do we do?)

643
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:33,864
It's too dangerous.

644
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:38,065
(Leader Lee's urgent orders)

645
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:43,505
(A worried look on the Chinese station's leader)

646
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:49,315
(He leaves the room, leaving the crew behind.)

647
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:50,985
It's the worst.

648
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:53,284
It can't get worse than this.

649
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:56,285
I'm scared about what's happening, but I also feel guilty.

650
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:00,095
I never imagined something like this happening.

651
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:10,034
You must be tired, so get a good night's rest.

652
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:11,364
- Sure.
- Thank you.

653
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:13,435
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

654
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,705
(Morning of Day 5 in Antarctica)

655
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,345
Good luck to us today.

656
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,345
(They board the RIB to head to China's station.)

657
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,384
Have a safe trip.

658
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:26,654
See you!

659
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:28,185
I see you're not coming with us.

660
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,024
Please cook a delicious meal for the Chinese crew.

661
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:32,255
- Sure.
- Got it.

662
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:39,865
(Feeling excited, they head to China's Great Wall Station.)

663
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:42,405
The weather's calmer today.

664
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:43,804
Really?

665
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:45,435
- Look.
- Calm waters are so much better.

666
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,745
The weather can change at any second.

667
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:52,445
That's why we must keep up with the weather forecast.

668
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:55,314
Can it suddenly get windy out of the blue?

669
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:56,345
That's right.

670
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:01,785
(The weather in Antarctica is unpredictable.)

671
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:04,255
What's that?

672
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,024
Those jumping over there.

673
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,824
- They're penguins.
- Penguins?

674
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:09,225
(They're penguins!)

675
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:12,864
So that's how they swim.

676
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,264
- They swim like dolphins.
- That looks like breaststroke.

677
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:16,435
That's wild.

678
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:20,875
(Penguins are expert divers.)

679
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:24,345
(But since they have less lung capacity, )

680
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:27,775
(they pop up above the water to breathe.)

681
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:31,215
Can you also see whales around here?

682
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,084
- You might be able to see them.
- Really?

683
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:36,055
What should I be looking for?

684
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,555
(If you ever see a whale spout water into the air)

685
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:43,724
We'd be lucky to see a whale.

686
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,025
(You can call yourself extremely lucky.)

687
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:46,994
Are there whales around here?

688
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,235
(Channeling his mischievous side)

689
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,304
Whales.

690
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,435
(Smirking)

691
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:52,374
(Tapping)

692
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:53,435
What is it?

693
00:30:56,475 --> 00:31:00,575
(Jong Hyeop even tricked the cameraman.)

694
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:03,785
I almost fell backward.

695
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,054
That's how startled I was.

696
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:07,454
Hey, come on.

697
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:09,524
Your acting was too good.

698
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:12,525
(Putting his day job skills to use)

699
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:18,425
(Leaving behind the sad feeling of not being able to see a whale...)

700
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:21,735
Over there. Do you see that passenger ship?

701
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:25,775
That must be the passenger ship we saw.

702
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:29,044
- You're right.
- It's massive.

703
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:30,075
(Compared to the RIB, it's massive.)

704
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:32,874
I think those passengers...

705
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,714
are here to see the drift ice.

706
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:36,785
Aren't I right?

707
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:42,625
(RIBs floating in front of the huge iceberg)

708
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:46,054
(Passengers exit the ship...)

709
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:49,225
(and transfer onto a RIB.)

710
00:31:50,565 --> 00:31:52,394
That's a huge drift ice.

711
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,034
(They're able to see an enormous iceberg up close.)

712
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:55,195
No way.

713
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,474
But since...

714
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:04,344
there's a chance the drift ice might flip...

715
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:06,545
(Since the iceberg could flip and shatter)

716
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,644
That's why they must be cautious.

717
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:10,715
(They can't get close enough to touch it...)

718
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:14,255
(or climb onto an iceberg.)

719
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:15,884
Penguins can climb them.

720
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:17,525
- There's a penguin over there.
- Right.

721
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,594
(Only we can climb them!)

722
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:21,554
- Isn't the way they walk so cute?
- So cute.

723
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:23,525
(Only we can climb them!)

724
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,434
(Unfortunately, that's all the sightseeing they'll do.)

725
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,564
I'm sad to leave.

726
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,265
(Unfortunately, that's all the sightseeing they'll do.)

727
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:32,534
We're five minutes from the Chinese station.

728
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,535
(They leave the passenger ship and iceberg behind.)

729
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,804
That must be the Chinese station.

730
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:37,975
That's right.

731
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:41,144
The Chinese station is huge!

732
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:42,145
(China's station can be seen in the distance.)

733
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:44,685
They hoisted our flag to welcome us.

734
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:46,385
You're right.

735
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,225
(Hi!)

736
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:54,654
(They arrive at China's Great Wall Station.)

737
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:56,264
- Hello. Welcome.
- Welcome!

738
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,825
(Secretary Li Zhuang, Leader Wang Jianzhong)

739
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:00,095
Welcome to the Great Wall Station.

740
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:01,865
Hello.

741
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:03,635
Hello.

742
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,575
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

743
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,845
- Welcome.
- Hello.

744
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,275
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

745
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:12,445
Be careful.

746
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:16,445
Thank you.

747
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:18,244
- Thank you.
- Okay.

748
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:19,585
Gosh, you're so handsome.

749
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:23,084
Thank you for inviting us.

750
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,625
No worries.

751
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:26,355
- This is our leader.
- The leader?

752
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,825
- He's our leader.
- He's the leader.

753
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:30,594
Welcome.

754
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:31,725
(After greeting everyone including Crew Paik)

755
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,165
Our chef will give you a short tour.

756
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:35,935
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

757
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,804
I can't believe we're at the Chinese station.

758
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:41,905
(They now head to the Chinese station!)

759
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:44,205
- Hello.
- Hello.

760
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:47,214
(The second neighboring station they're visiting...)

761
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,275
(is China's station.)

762
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,715
(Special ingredients only found at the Chinese station?)

763
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:52,884
What's this?

764
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:54,215
That's a lamb heart.

765
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:56,284
They have bullfrogs.

766
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,555
(Shocked)

767
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,094
(They have bullfrogs...)

768
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:00,455
(but no onions?)

769
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:01,925
(They don't have carrots either.)

770
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:03,665
(Worries begin to creep in.)

771
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:06,395
(But that was only the beginning.)

772
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:08,165
(A self-proclaimed expert at cooking egg dishes)

773
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:09,534
(The 1st bad sign)

774
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:11,505
(The expert at cooking egg dishes crumbles.)

775
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:14,604
(The 2nd bad sign)

776
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:17,175
(The ingredients aren't what they expected.)

777
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:20,075
(What do we do?)

778
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,015
It's snowing heavily.

779
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,514
(The 3rd bad sign)

780
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:25,215
(A blizzard?)

781
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:27,384
(They experience a drastic shift in weather...)

782
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:28,885
(for the first time in Antarctica.)

783
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:31,684
(It's impossible to go out on the RIB.)

784
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:33,225
It's too dangerous, so no.

785
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,825
(Sighing)

786
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,364
I thought we could die trying to get back...

787
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:39,765
to the station in a RIB.

788
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:41,164
I was scared...

789
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:42,805
and extremely worried.

790
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:44,264
I first thought the staff...

791
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,205
was playing a joke on us.

792
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:48,105
(What happened to them?)

793
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:51,005
(Chef of Antarctica)
