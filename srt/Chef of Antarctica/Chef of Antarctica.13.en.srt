00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:18,498
(It's another busy day in Antarctica.)

4
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:28,448
(Fueled by a warm meal, )

5
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:36,048
(the crew members complete their tasks.)

6
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,618
(I'm getting off work now.)

00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,197
(Knocking)

11
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:54,238
Come in.

12
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:58,037
- Sir.
- Gosh, come on in.

13
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,408
- Hello.
- Hey.

14
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:01,377
(Who is this crew member happily greeting Jong Hyeop?)

15
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:02,408
Hello.

16
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:09,048
(Lee Chang Jae, in charge of heavy equipment)

17
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:15,688
(He handles heavy equipment at King Sejong Station.)

18
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:19,527
(He's also the leader responsible for maintaining all the machinery.)

19
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:23,838
(He's also the leader responsible for maintaining all the machinery.)

20
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:28,038
(The reliable, versatile worker at King Sejong Station)

21
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:29,637
(Why has Jong Hyeop come to the maintenance team?)

22
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:31,637
- Yes. This is where I work.
- I can see you in a photo...

23
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,677
(Why has Jong Hyeop come to the maintenance team?)

24
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:37,848
During the meeting this morning,

25
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:42,018
I was informed that I would be working here today.

26
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:43,758
- So I'm here.
- I see.

27
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,557
It's Wednesday morning, November 27.

28
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:48,888
We're already at a halfway point of the week.

29
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:53,568
Our four newly arrived crew members...

30
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:55,427
ought to experience night duty.

31
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,598
Night duty is required to to keep our station safe...

32
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:00,938
and prevent any safety accidents at night.

33
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,177
(A special mission is assigned...)

34
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:07,878
(while everyone goes to sleep.)

35
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,147
The night-shift crew members are like lighthouses at the station.

36
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,648
They surveil every nook and corner of the station...

37
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:15,048
and keep watch to make sure the station is safe.

38
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:17,987
(Even when everyone gets off work, )

39
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:19,557
When our crew members get off work at 6pm,

40
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,127
their posts will be left unattended.

41
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:24,157
But the machines will continue to operate.

42
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:26,428
(the machines operate around the clock without a break.)

43
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:29,028
(Whenever...)

44
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:32,367
That means accidents could potentially occur there.

45
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:36,237
To prevent various accidents from happening...

46
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,378
(As accidents could take place unexpectedly...)

47
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,437
(From 6pm to 8am)

48
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,648
(A total of 14 hours)

49
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,147
Those on night duty go on patrol...

50
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,478
and check up on the machines.

51
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:50,357
They continue to ensure researchers are safe here.

52
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:51,558
(They keep the station safe on night duty.)

53
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:56,388
(Night duty: An important task after regular work hours)

54
00:02:56,728 --> 00:03:00,628
(There are two night duty locations.)

55
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,967
Two people will be on night duty.

56
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,797
One will be in the communication room.

57
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,738
(Min Jun Hong on night duty in the communication room)

58
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,367
The second crew member will be in the maintenance office...

59
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:12,008
to make sure the machines are running safely.

60
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:15,407
Divide your tasks between yourselves...

61
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,748
to fulfill your night duty.

62
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:21,588
(These crew members will be the lighthouses at the station.)

63
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,887
You've never been to our office, right?

64
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:25,258
- Right. I've never been in here.
- Yes.

65
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:29,528
The communication team and our team take turns to go on patrol.

66
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,598
We do an hour before them.

67
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:34,627
Then they go on patrol an hour after us.

68
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,567
- So you alternate hourly?
- Yes. We alternate every hour.

69
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:38,768
(They alternate patrolling 3 times a day.)

70
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:43,237
All right. Let's go out on patrol now.

71
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,238
Yes, sir.

72
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,138
We must take this before we go on patrol.

73
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:47,607
We have to carry that?

74
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:50,347
Yes. We use the tablet...

75
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,078
to keep a log during our patrol.

76
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:55,917
During our patrol, we have to check these locations.

77
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:58,387
We must check if everything is running smoothly.

78
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:00,258
We'll check that and then record it here.

79
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,658
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

80
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,057
(The patrol course of the maintenance team)

81
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,127
(Machinery Storage, Power Station, )

82
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:09,167
(Small Craft Storage, Emergency Dormitory)

83
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:12,898
Jong Hyeop, could you hold the tablet?

84
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:14,637
This shows the water level in the tanks.

85
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,668
(The first thing to check, the water level)

86
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:18,737
You can check the water level...

87
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,678
- in the middle here. Right?
- Yes.

88
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,378
- Can you see the red mark?
- Yes.

89
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,417
It's in the normal range if it falls...

90
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:29,218
- between 16.2t to 17.7t.
- Right.

91
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:35,487
If the water level goes below 16.2t,

92
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,798
it means the water pump doesn't work.

93
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,268
(For life in Antarctica, )

94
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:44,638
(water is the most important factor.)

95
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:49,168
(Water would be running without a problem.)

96
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:53,678
(No water comes out.)

97
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:57,118
(The water supply can easily be interrupted.)

98
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,217
Even drinking water...

99
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,948
(Every drop of water at King Sejong Station...)

100
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:07,988
(is supplied from a lake formed by melted snow.)

101
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:13,098
When Hyundai Lake froze a long time ago during winter,

102
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:16,867
we couldn't have access to drink water, and it was a huge problem.

103
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,298
(They can't use the water from the frozen lake in the winter.)

104
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:20,067
(So they desalinate the seawater to drink water.)

105
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:21,267
- When the water ran out, - Right.

106
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:25,208
we desalinated the seawater and used it as drinking water.

107
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,578
(They must regularly check the water level in the tanks.)

108
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:34,218
We have to inform the crew member in charge of machinery right away...

109
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,748
even if it's late at night.

110
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:37,987
Even if it's late at night?

111
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,858
Yes. Even if it's late at night, we must tell them.

112
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:41,087
- No matter what time it is?
- Yes.

113
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,088
I got it.

114
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,897
Let's head over to the Power Station.

115
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:44,898
Okay.

116
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:45,898
(Next up is the Power Station.)

117
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,628
Here's what you need to pay attention closely here.

118
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,567
If the machines here stop working, our station won't...

119
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,737
- have access to electricity at all.
- Okay, electricity is not provided.

120
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:57,138
Right. If the generators turn off, we'll be in big trouble.

121
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,778
(Dropping as low as minus 25°C...)

122
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,748
(Even in extreme conditions, )

123
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:10,088
(power station must be operated around the clock for survival.)

124
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:14,258
(The heart of King Sejong Station, Power Station)

125
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:16,727
(Checking on the generators is an important task.)

126
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:19,527
- Pressure.
- It's at 356.

127
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:20,668
Yes. It's at 356.

128
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,028
- This is for current tank.
- Okay.

129
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:26,137
It doesn't require much to check. Just check it with your eyes.

130
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:30,368
(Chang Jae and Jong Hyeop check thoroughly.)

131
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,538
(Their patrol at the Power Station is complete.)

132
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,707
All right. Let's go out.

133
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,948
(They head out now.)

134
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:38,348
Isn't this amazing?

135
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:43,388
Actually, our viewers won't think that...

136
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,488
it's 8pm here.

137
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:47,628
They'll think, "It's morning."

138
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:48,728
(That's right.)

139
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,188
That's really possible. When I first came here,

140
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,398
I was surprised that the sun really didn't go down.

141
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:54,928
It looks like it's 3pm here.

142
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,428
- We can't get any sleep.
- Right.

143
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:58,338
I couldn't get used to it before.

144
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,938
(They continue their night patrol.)

145
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,837
Although my patrol shift was brief, I realized...

146
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:07,278
how tough this job was moment after moment.

147
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,408
Participating in night duty...

148
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:13,918
gave me a stronger sense of responsibility for this job.

149
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,218
All right. It's this way.

150
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,027
You know your way around our station.

151
00:07:21,028 --> 00:07:22,688
(While Jong Hyeop is on his patrol...)

152
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,957
- Hello.
- Hello.

153
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,667
- Gosh, you worked so hard here.
- Thanks.

154
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,798
(Soo Hyang is also on night duty.)

155
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,498
What do we need to do now?

156
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:33,668
The first thing we must do...

157
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:37,108
is checking the number of people staying at our station.

158
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,077
- We must check if anyone is...
- Okay.

159
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:44,148
- leaving or entering our station.
- I see.

160
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:46,648
We must also be aware of where they are...

161
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,687
- and what they're doing.
- Okay.

162
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,957
- So take a look.
- We can watch from here?

163
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,958
Yes.

164
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,688
(Her first task is checking the surveillance cameras.)

165
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,688
Right now, seven people...

166
00:07:56,558 --> 00:08:00,058
are playing badminton in the gym, quite far from our station.

167
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:04,837
I see. They're penguin researchers...

168
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,068
- and the culinary team.
- That's right.

169
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:10,138
They'll be super fit by the time they go back to Korea.

170
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:11,578
Right.

171
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:13,778
By the way, how's our late-night meal coming along?

172
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,618
- Why don't we check?
- Let's check.

173
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,578
That looks tasty. Today's late-night meal is...

174
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,758
It looks like it's almost done.

175
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,058
(Jong Won and SUHO are in the kitchen?)

176
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,957
Soo Hyang, take part in night duty.

177
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,967
Okay.

178
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:37,228
So they've always cooked their own late-night meals...

179
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:39,168
and have never been served a proper meal together, right?

180
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:41,767
That's never happened here.

181
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:45,307
Since I'm not on night duty today, I can prepare the late-night meal.

182
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,938
That would be even more wonderful.

183
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:50,108
The crew members must always eat ramyeon for a reason.

184
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:55,148
(The crew members working late into the night...)

185
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:58,087
The station has ramyeon and instant food...

186
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:01,158
so they usually eat that when they get hungry.

187
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,858
(Or they have leftovers from their meals.)

188
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:09,568
(They can also cook their own meals.)

189
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:11,567
So I've given it some thought.

190
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,168
I saw a lot of dried anchovies in the cold storage.

191
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,037
I'll cook anchovy noodle soup.

192
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:17,638
It's been a while since you had that, right?

193
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:18,808
(That sounds tasty.)

194
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,308
I'll cook anchovy noodle soup.

195
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,148
I tried to figure out what to cook for them.

196
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:26,517
We've been going in and out of the station for tasks.

197
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:27,587
Though it's not as much as the crew members,

198
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:28,687
we've been outdoors every day.

199
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,118
We've been moving around a lot, though.

200
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:34,088
So after all that, I craved a warm bowl of soup.

201
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,398
(It's tastier on a cold day.)

202
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:42,828
(Anchovy noodle soup)

203
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,338
I wanted to cook something that required a lot of effort.

204
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:48,737
We have dried anchovies. So I'll prepare every single one...

205
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,877
and pour my heart into it for good energy.

206
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,638
(Removing the heads and innards that give a bitter flavor)

207
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:56,748
(Separating them neatly)

208
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,848
(Stir-fry the anchovies to remove any fishy smell.)

209
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:06,918
(Add stir-fried anchovies to the water.)

210
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,528
(From 2pm...)

211
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,528
Let's boil them for eight hours.

212
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:16,098
Anchovy broth requires a lot of time and care.

213
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:20,138
My gosh. It reduced nicely. It's the anchovy extract now.

214
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:21,438
Here's the anchovy broth.

215
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:24,538
(How does the broth taste after being brewed for a long time?)

216
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,708
(Amazed)

217
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:29,608
(Approving)

218
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:31,618
It tastes amazing.

219
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,017
It's excellent.

220
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,647
My gosh, this is it.

221
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:37,658
(A satisfying anchovy broth is ready.)

222
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,058
Let's make the sauce first.

223
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:45,798
(He'll make the sauce which will decide the flavor of the dish.)

224
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:49,398
(Generously adding garlic)

225
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:53,198
(He adds chives instead of scallions.)

226
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:57,638
(He also adds chili powder, sugar, and soy sauce.)

227
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:02,308
(Black pepper will balance out the flavors.)

228
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:06,678
(Humming)

229
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:12,958
(Adding the savory sesame seeds to the rhythm)

230
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:18,098
(Stirring nonchalantly)

231
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:23,868
(He makes the sauce in a matter of seconds.)

232
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:26,167
- Wash the chives.
- Okay.

233
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,168
(It's time for the garnish.)

234
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:31,207
You'll see the chives harvested from the green house in the fridge.

235
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,208
Go and bring them.

236
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,208
(Fresh chives harvested from the greenhouse)

237
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:36,148
(Wash the chives in cold water.)

238
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,748
- Should I blanch them?
- Yes.

239
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,078
Thirty seconds.

240
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,088
(30 seconds!)

241
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:48,588
(Briefly blanch them to maintain the texture and freshness.)

242
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,827
(After blanching them...)

243
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,567
I need to rinse them in cold water after blanching them.

244
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:55,568
Okay.

245
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:56,568
(Rinsing with cold water from Antarctica)

246
00:11:57,068 --> 00:12:01,868
(The chives from the greenhouse are ready to be a garnish.)

247
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,808
(The second garnish, spinach)

248
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:10,608
(The crunchy texture will enhance the flavor and make the dish fun.)

249
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:14,148
(Cutting into bite-sized pieces)

250
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,718
(After cutting the chives...)

251
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:24,298
(blanched by SUHO...)

252
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:25,558
(Spinach and chives)

253
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,327
(The green garnishes are ready.)

254
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,368
The frozen carrots.

255
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:31,968
(The last garnish, carrots, will make the dish colorful.)

256
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,707
I have to play house with carrots.

257
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,508
(Baby carrots)

258
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:39,878
(Julienned full-sized carrots)

259
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:43,178
(Can he julienne baby carrots?)

260
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:44,848
What do you need me to do?

261
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:48,248
Do you think you can do this?

262
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:49,348
Yes.

263
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:51,017
- I can do it.
- You practiced your knife skills.

264
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,058
- Yes.
- All right.

265
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:55,088
(Starting with pickled radish...)

266
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:01,028
(SUHO chopped potatoes.)

267
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:04,868
(He also chopped sweet pumpkins.)

268
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:09,438
(Baby carrots are a piece of cake.)

269
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,238
(It's time to show off my cutting skills.)

270
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:15,578
(Cutting carefully)

271
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:21,148
(Chopping)

272
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,718
(Fully focused)

273
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,518
(Slipping)

274
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,658
These carrots are slippery.

275
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,527
They are so slippery.

276
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,798
(The carrots are getting slippery as they thaw.)

277
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:38,938
I should've done it quickly.

278
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:43,968
The carrots had thawed too much.

279
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:47,778
If they were big, I could have chopped them easily.

280
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,148
Because they were small, I had to be more careful.

281
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:55,788
It felt like I was cutting soft jelly.

282
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,058
(Today's task will be chopping what seems like endless carrots.)

283
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:03,188
My gosh.

284
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,128
Oh, no!

285
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,628
I hope someone can line them up neatly.

286
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:15,138
(Engaging his forearm muscles fully just for baby carrots)

287
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,807
It's stressful because they're tiny.

288
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,878
(While he's battling the baby carrots...)

289
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,377
Grab the walkie-talkie. And then let's head out.

290
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,378
Okay.

291
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:26,378
- Which building should...
- Yes?

292
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:29,048
the night-duty communications member patrol first?

293
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,558
"Life Jacket Changing Room."

294
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,017
(The patrol course of the communication team)

295
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:35,827
(Life Jacket Changing Room, Fitness Room, )

296
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:38,928
(Upper-Atmosphere Monitoring Facility, Research Building)

297
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,898
We must check the Life Jacket Changing Room first.

298
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:44,338
It's generally cold all over our station.

299
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:47,868
So many places have heaters or are equipped with heating systems.

300
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,837
- I see.
- We must check these places...

301
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,278
to prevent any risk of fire.

302
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:58,218
(A white desert, Antarctica)

303
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:00,818
(As the winds are strong, )

304
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:04,588
(a fire can spread very rapidly.)

305
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:11,158
(Brazil's Antarctic station caught fire in 2021.)

306
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:16,628
(If a fire destroys their emergency shelter, )

307
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:20,067
(they will be exposed to severe cold, )

308
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,438
(putting their lives in danger.)

309
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:27,478
(As a fire can start whenever and wherever, )

310
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,148
(checking the heaters all over the station is essential.)

311
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,148
So this is... You've been here a lot, right?

312
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,448
- It's Life Jacket Changing Room.
- Yes.

313
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:36,818
What kind of heating appliance do you see here?

314
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,558
I see radiators here.

315
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:41,328
- They look like they're turned on.
- Right.

316
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:43,128
What?

317
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:47,058
- That's not good.
- Right. That's dangerous.

318
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,197
This could cause a big accident. It could burn.

319
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,198
Right.

320
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:51,638
Turn it off.

321
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:54,407
No. You can't turn it off.

322
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,038
- Really?
- It must stay on the whole time.

323
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,267
Why?

324
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:59,708
Or this room will get too cold and freeze.

325
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,348
- I see. Right.
- So water pipes freeze and burst.

326
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,048
That could cause another problem.

327
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,847
To maintain a stable temperature,

328
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:13,258
radiators are placed all over the station.

329
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:20,127
Please turn off the light when you come out, my dear crew.

330
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:21,167
(Being thorough with her patrol to keep the station safe)

331
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,228
That's great.

332
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,038
It's cold. Gosh, it's so windy.

333
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,168
I can feel it even more when I face this gust of wind.

334
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:31,478
- That we're in Antarctica.
- That we're in Antarctica.

335
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:36,508
(Staggering)

336
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:38,848
Gosh, this is no joke.

337
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:42,247
Gosh, it's so windy.

338
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,848
(They walk through the strong wind and head over to the next location.)

339
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:48,887
You mentioned the other day that this was your third time here.

340
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:49,888
Yes.

341
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:53,258
Despite that, you said a part of you was always wishing for more.

342
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,098
I was really curious about what you meant by that.

343
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:03,168
I always feel that way toward the end of my time here.

344
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:05,038
How should I put it?

345
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,038
"I could've done a better job."

346
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:11,048
"I should have done better." I have such regrets.

347
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,748
That's a bit disappointing.

348
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,987
But you can't just come here...

349
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,657
every time you want. Right?

350
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,018
Right. I can't.

351
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,058
If you think about it, I'm very lucky.

352
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:28,328
You're so cool.

353
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,497
If you don't mind me asking, how long have you been married?

354
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:35,938
I got married, and I have three daughters.

355
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:37,408
- Three daughters?
- Yes.

356
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:41,107
(He's been married for 19 years...)

357
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,678
(and is the breadwinner for a family of five.)

358
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,817
You have many daughters.

359
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:47,248
(The father of three daughters)

360
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:50,648
It feels like I'm only chasing my ambition by being here.

361
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:52,888
I feel the most guilty about my family back home.

362
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:55,657
That must've been a really tough decision.

363
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,327
(It can't have been an easy decision.)

364
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:00,698
I haven't been able to attend my children's graduations.

365
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:02,628
(The dad couldn't be there for his kids' special days.)

366
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:06,637
I missed the days when my youngest started middle school...

367
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:07,738
and when she graduated.

368
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,508
I missed all those days.

369
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:15,208
I'd be stuck with the blame forever.

370
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:16,507
Oh, no.

371
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:17,648
(Smiling bitterly)

372
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:22,117
But you're contributing to something bigger.

373
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,688
(Always feeling sorry as a father and husband)

374
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:29,858
(Everyone has their own reason...)

375
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:34,598
(for traveling 17,240km to be here.)

376
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:38,098
It's never going to be an easy job.

377
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,738
It's never an easy job.

378
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,407
They'd understand what it means to have their father away.

379
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,838
(I wish they would.)

380
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:49,948
Look, Crew Paik is cooking there. Can you see it?

381
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,518
How much longer on the carrots?

382
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,118
What? Just about five more minutes.

383
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,547
This is tough. It's really tough.

384
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:57,618
(Cutting carrots is almost done.)

385
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:01,888
(The broth and the sauce are ready.)

386
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,758
Hurry up. I'll start the noodles while you finish cutting.

387
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:05,858
Okay.

388
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:09,228
(Putting noodles in)

389
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:12,468
(Stirring it well for even cooking)

390
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:16,707
(Once the foam starts to rise, )

391
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,108
(add the water.)

392
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:24,278
(Once the noodles are cooked through, take them out.)

393
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:29,488
(Rinse them in cold water.)

394
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,088
It's cold. Oh, it's hot.

395
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:38,128
(Toughing out the cold water and the steaming noodles)

396
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,098
(Rinsing them in Antarctic water)

397
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:43,827
(The reason for rinsing noodles in cold water)

398
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:47,138
(It removes the extra starch, keeping the firm and chewy texture.)

399
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:50,338
(After rinsing them in cold water, )

400
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:57,448
(plate them nicely in a bowl.)

401
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:58,948
Oh my gosh.

402
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:02,418
Okay.

403
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:04,048
(SUHO is finally done cutting carrots.)

404
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:05,758
- Well done.
- Okay.

405
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:09,128
(Happy)

406
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:10,228
- Should I put the garnish on?
- Yes.

407
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:11,228
I'll do it.

408
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:15,268
(He knows what to do now.)

409
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:17,828
(Smiling)

410
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,468
I'm gaining confidence and getting the hang of cooking.

411
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:24,038
I even got compliments from Crew Paik.

412
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:26,408
So, I was so happy.

413
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:30,548
(Compliments motivated him to work harder.)

414
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,817
(Crew Paik places the noodles in a bowl.)

415
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:36,548
(Approaching)

416
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:40,258
(Working together seamlessly)

417
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,528
(They made 20 bowls of noodles without any trouble.)

418
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:55,438
(Crew Paik is bringing something.)

419
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,707
I made something while you were away.

420
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,177
- Do you know what it is?
- It's a key point.

421
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,907
You could've told me. Is it anchovy?

422
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:01,908
It's anchovy oil.

423
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,748
(The secret ingredient for the anchovy noodle soup)

424
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:11,247
This is anchovy oil that's been simmered for 8 hours.

425
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:14,058
(The anchovy oil that's been simmered for 8 hours)

426
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,127
I only added some garlic.

427
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:17,227
(He simmered the anchovies and garlic in oil.)

428
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:20,557
The unpleasant smells have completely gone,

429
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:21,828
and the only thing left is the savory aroma.

430
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:25,197
(How does the anchovy oil taste?)

431
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:26,738
(Wow!)

432
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:28,668
Doesn't that smell amazing?

433
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,208
(Sniffing)

434
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,008
Gosh, you didn't add sesame oil, did you?

435
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:36,408
It was really savory with a rich flavor of anchovies.

436
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:39,878
(Exclaiming)

437
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,947
(Satisfied)

438
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:44,818
One spoonful of this in the noodles will make it taste incredible.

439
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,358
(It'll taste incredible.)

440
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,488
You shouldn't only learn things like this.

441
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:57,928
(Anchovy oil, the secret ingredient)

442
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,167
It's ready to serve.

443
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,798
(Ready to serve!)

444
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:02,637
What time is it?

445
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,568
(Current time: 10pm)

446
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,037
It's 10pm.

447
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:07,838
(People should come by now.)

448
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:15,388
(The first late-night group munchies in Antarctica)

449
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:17,848
They came right on time.

450
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:19,858
Hello.

451
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:22,358
- Hi.
- Give us a second.

452
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,998
Welcome. Chef An.

453
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,258
- Get ready.
- Yes.

454
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,498
Once you finish your noodle soup, please feel free to ask for more.

455
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:30,798
We can give you more.

456
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:35,108
(Excited)

457
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:39,038
(Rinse the noodles and garnishes in the bowl)

458
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:42,608
(with hot water, )

459
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:48,448
(hoping it will be a warmer dish for them.)

460
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:53,657
(Adding the anchovy broth, simmered with care for 8 hours...)

461
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:55,888
I simmered it for 8 hours, starting at 2:30pm.

462
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:59,228
(and the sauce to season the anchovy noodle soup...)

463
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:02,467
The oil dropped on the soup is...

464
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,127
anchovy oil.

465
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:05,737
I started simmering it at 2pm.

466
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:08,468
It means I simmered it for eight and a half hours.

467
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,438
We made plenty of noodles, so have more once you finish yours.

468
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:11,538
It's ready for two people.

469
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:12,808
(The anchovy noodle soup is ready.)

470
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:14,638
I've been waiting for this.

471
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,518
- I can't wait to try it.
- It tastes really good.

472
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,418
I bet it's delicious.

473
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,287
(What is this?)

474
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:26,358
It's anchovy oil.

475
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:29,588
(It's interesting.)

476
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,358
(Excited)

477
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,198
(Uncontainable excitement for the first late-night meal)

478
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,468
Enjoy your meal.

479
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,097
- Thanks.
- Thanks for the food.

480
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:41,607
The chives are what you picked up for us.

481
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,067
- We used them.
- Thanks for the food.

482
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:46,278
We used the chives, and they were so fresh.

483
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:48,807
- Thank you for the food.
- Thanks for the good food.

484
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:49,847
Sure. Enjoy your meal.

485
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:51,048
- Thanks for the food.
- Thank you.

486
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,647
Let me know if you need more broth. We have a lot.

487
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:56,087
- Yes.
- We also have a lot of noodles.

488
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:57,448
(The 1st late-night meal in 11 months)

489
00:23:57,588 --> 00:23:58,787
(Sniffing)

490
00:23:58,788 --> 00:23:59,788
(Smelling)

491
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:01,258
(Smelling)

492
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:03,928
(Smelling)

493
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:06,457
He made anchovy oil.

494
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,198
- This is...
- The aroma is incredible.

495
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:14,567
I only gave it a quick stir, and the rich anchovy aroma hit me.

496
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:17,638
(The rich anchovy aroma hits their noses.)

497
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:20,778
I was going to get it for him, but he already got it.

498
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:23,707
This is just amazing.

499
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,548
It's anchovy noodle soup.

500
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:26,918
It's so good.

501
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:32,688
(The rich, savory taste of anchovy broth)

502
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,558
It doesn't taste fishy.

503
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,528
There's no fishy flavor.

504
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:40,098
If you add too many anchovies, it'll taste fishy.

505
00:24:40,498 --> 00:24:42,398
If you reduce it down like this, and only use a small amount,

506
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:45,068
you'll get a rich, savory flavor without any fishy smell.

507
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,438
He put so much time and care into making it all day.

508
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,208
That must've taken a lot of work.

509
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:52,878
The vegetables had to be prepared too.

510
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:55,908
(Slurping)

511
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,817
I shouldn't have eaten so much for dinner.

512
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:03,088
I didn't eat much for dinner.

513
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:08,217
(Blowing on the noodles)

514
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:12,828
(Slurping the noodles)

515
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,098
(Having a big mouthful)

516
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:29,048
If it's just plain noodles, the texture is really boring.

517
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:33,347
But the garnishes give different textures to chew on.

518
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:35,048
- You're right.
- If we have a drink now...

519
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:41,157
(Exclaiming)

520
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:42,158
It's good, isn't it?

521
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,358
(Nodding)

522
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:47,058
(Satisfied)

523
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,698
(Relieved)

524
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:52,668
I feel hot.

525
00:25:55,608 --> 00:26:01,578
(The hot soup warmed him up.)

526
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,707
It feels like eating at a street food stall.

527
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:05,878
It's a shame we don't have soju.

528
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:09,048
What? Windows are open?

529
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:11,617
You guys are eating with the window open,

530
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:13,057
showing you're people in Antarctica.

531
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:14,058
(They're definitely people living in Antarctica.)

532
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:15,527
You guys are feeling hot in here.

533
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:16,587
(Getting warmer in the cafeteria)

534
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:17,928
You have to eat the noodle soup while it's hot.

535
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:23,368
(The chilly Antarctic wind)

536
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:32,678
(The hot noodle soup)

537
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,237
It feels like getting...

538
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:36,147
a hot udon soup at a rest area after driving all night.

539
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:38,248
(The crew members are happy with a bowl of noodle soup.)

540
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,947
In Antarctica, you need more stamina.

541
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,618
(Current time: 10:30pm, What is the night-shift crew doing?)

542
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:47,858
We finished our patrol route.

543
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,687
We've already done this on the tablet.

544
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:53,898
(Working the night shift in their respective positions)

545
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:57,328
- Two for delivery.
- Oh, okay.

546
00:26:58,668 --> 00:26:59,897
I'll pack some kimchi.

547
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:01,468
(For the night-shift crew who are working hard, )

548
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,108
(we'll have the anchovy noodle soup delivered to them.)

549
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,878
- Have a good delivery run.
- Yes. Thanks.

550
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:15,318
(Starting from the communication room upstairs)

551
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:17,518
The communication room. Hello.

552
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:21,218
- Hello.
- Hi.

553
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:24,258
- Have a late-night meal.
- Oh, my. Thanks.

554
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,028
(Exclaiming)

555
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:28,568
I can't believe we have a late-night meal.

556
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:30,498
It's awesome.

557
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:32,498
(Hot anchovy noodle soup)

558
00:27:32,598 --> 00:27:34,297
This is incredible. It's so good.

559
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:35,938
- Thanks for the food.
- Thank you.

560
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,738
It looks so delicious.

561
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,808
It smells so good.

562
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,718
- Enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

563
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,718
It tastes just like something I could get at a restaurant.

564
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:50,017
My gosh, it's so good.

565
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:51,748
- Doesn't it warm your heart?
- Yes, it does.

566
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,487
(Heartwarming)

567
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,688
Enjoy your meal.

568
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:57,527
- Thank you.
- Thanks for making this.

569
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:58,528
Sure.

570
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,028
It's really good.

571
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:03,298
I'm so grateful.

572
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,437
It really warms my heart.

573
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,707
(The heartfelt warmth from one bowl of noodle soup)

574
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:11,438
Food can make you feel like that.

575
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:14,578
I think SUHO went to the communication room first.

576
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:17,308
It was my first time doing the night shift,

577
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,547
and honestly, I was pretty hungry.

578
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,718
I was definitely craving the late-night meal.

579
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:27,057
It's probably hard to carry, since it's soup.

580
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,788
(Another man, waiting for the late-night meal)

581
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:31,528
Oh, look! He's coming up.

582
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,327
He's coming up. He's coming.

583
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,727
(Finally, the late-night meal is coming.)

584
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:39,238
Crew Lee, the food is coming now.

585
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:40,368
Is the food coming?

586
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:43,538
(Exclaiming)

587
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,007
Let's be careful. I can do it.

588
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,238
(Being careful not to spill)

589
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:50,948
(Going through the wind)

590
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:55,688
(Delivering the late-night meal to the maintenance team)

591
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:58,418
(Excited)

592
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:00,788
It's the first time anyone’s brought you a late-night meal, isn't it?

593
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:01,988
Yes, it is.

594
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,187
It's a privilege of the night shift.

595
00:29:04,188 --> 00:29:05,658
(A privilege of the night shift)

596
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,328
Excuse me.

597
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:09,128
Excuse me.

598
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:10,168
Yes.

599
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,168
- I'm coming in.
- Yes.

600
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:14,468
He's not coming this way.

601
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:16,038
I'm here.

602
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:22,847
(In his excitement, he opened the wrong door.)

603
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:23,878
He's not coming this way.

604
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:25,478
I'm here.

605
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:27,448
(I am here.)

606
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:29,288
Hello.

607
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:30,688
Have the late-night meal.

608
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,518
Gosh, when did you make this?

609
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:36,588
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

610
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:39,798
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you for the food.

611
00:29:39,998 --> 00:29:41,028
Go back safely, SUHO.

612
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,327
Let's go back.

613
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:48,298
(Heading back to the kitchen after delivering them safely)

614
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:51,538
(Exclaiming)

615
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:53,308
It looks so hearty.

616
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:56,908
(Excited)

617
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:59,348
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's eat.

618
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,648
(They're both starting with the soup.)

619
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:06,587
(Satisfied)

620
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:07,688
(Humming in approval)

621
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:09,088
- It's so delicious.
- It's really good.

622
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:11,388
It's so good.

623
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:12,928
(Slurping)

624
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,198
(Slurping)

625
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,138
(Slurping)

626
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:29,848
(Enjoying the noodles with his mouth full)

627
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,578
(Good!)

628
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:35,888
This is just so good.

629
00:30:37,818 --> 00:30:42,057
I've never had anyone cook me a late-night meal...

630
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,287
during my night shift.

631
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:44,628
- Haven't you?
- No.

632
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:47,828
(Feeling proud somehow)

633
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:50,128
By the way, what is this?

634
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:52,898
This is...

635
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,338
(Chives and spinach)

636
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,438
Give me a second.

637
00:30:58,338 --> 00:31:01,038
You know I came here as a member of the Chef of Antarctica.

638
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:07,448
(Let me see.)

639
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,748
(Hoping)

640
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:13,288
- There are two kinds.
- Okay.

641
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:15,427
This is water parsley.

642
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:16,527
(One of two is water parsley?)

643
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:18,388
(Watching the reaction)

644
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:21,028
Is it water parsley? Okay...

645
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:24,028
(It is chives.)

646
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,468
Isn't it what water parsley looks like?

647
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,238
Please don't look at me like that.

648
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:31,508
Is it water parsley?

649
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:32,838
Or is it mugwort?

650
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,278
(Watching the reaction again)

651
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:35,877
I don't think it's mugwort.

652
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,608
I don't think it is.

653
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,647
I tried to guess what it was.

654
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,648
(He failed to guess it was chives.)

655
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:45,758
(Trying another garnish, spinach)

656
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:49,928
(He's also trying to guess it this time.)

657
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,388
Okay!

658
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:53,528
I think I know what it is.

659
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:56,668
- I think I know what it is.
- Really?

660
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,238
I actually know what it is too.

661
00:32:01,468 --> 00:32:04,568
We have some juice in the fridge made with this.

662
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,378
I don't remember the name, though.

663
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:11,547
(Making juice with this?)

664
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:13,018
I don't think it's that one.

665
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:15,488
- Isn't it that one?
- Is it?

666
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:17,887
It's that long one...

667
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:20,188
that's a little wide.

668
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,288
Do you mean kale?

669
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,228
Kale? Yes.

670
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:24,857
Is it kale?

671
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:25,858
(Kale in anchovy noodle soup?)

672
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,358
Isn't it spinach?

673
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:31,198
(The answer is spinach.)

674
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:32,837
Spinach? Is it?

675
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:33,838
(Chae Jong Hyeop: 0 percent correct)

676
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:36,638
(So embarrassed)

677
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:38,408
(They're both embarrassed.)

678
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:41,108
(The two men are trying to laugh it off.)

679
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,848
So, what is this?

680
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:44,677
It's chives.

681
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:45,878
(Finally, they found out what it was.)

682
00:32:46,178 --> 00:32:48,918
I knew it as soon as I tried it.

683
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:50,947
I think I know what it is.

684
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,657
(Chae Jong Hyeop, Actor)

685
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:53,658
It's chives.

686
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:56,728
Goodness.

687
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:58,658
(Playing along with him)

688
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:00,327
It's embarrassing.

689
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:01,328
(An overwhelming sense of shame)

690
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:03,528
- I'm in trouble.
- It's really chives.

691
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:06,368
(Feeling embarrassed)

692
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:08,968
- Oh, no.
- The taste was familiar.

693
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,268
I forgot to tell them what was in it.

694
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:16,948
(I'm sure Jong Hyeop would know what it is.)

695
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,948
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure!

696
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:20,678
- Thanks for the food.
- Did you like it?

697
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:21,678
Yes, I did.

698
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:26,018
The crew said they were happy to have some great comfort food.

699
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:29,758
They also said it reminded them of home.

700
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,758
I was happy to hear that.

701
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:37,668
(The brief comforting warmth of home in a bowl of anchovy noodle soup)

702
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:40,668
It seemed to fill their stomach.

703
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:43,107
So, I felt very rewarded.

704
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:44,368
(The heartier meal than ever)

705
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:47,778
(After everyone finished eating, )

706
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:49,408
All right.

707
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:51,908
(the two chefs are finally having their late-night meal.)

708
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:54,778
(Exhausted)

709
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:01,558
(Satisfied)

710
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:04,988
Eating anchovy noodle soup in Antarctica.

711
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:11,328
(It tastes even better after hard work.)

712
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:18,068
(Their relaxing and cozy time with noodle soup)

713
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,608
- It's good.
- Yes, it's so good.

714
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,978
This is good. It warms me up.

715
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,318
Since we had a great late-night meal,

716
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:32,718
- let's crush this night shift.
- Of course.

717
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:37,687
For installing machinery, I ask, "Is it correct? Did we do it right?"

718
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:40,928
(There's no loneliness because they have each other.)

719
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:43,968
Watching Crew Chang Jae work the night shift...

720
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:45,068
How can I put it?

721
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:48,698
Maybe because he's a father,

722
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,368
I found it touching.

723
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:55,138
His dedication and hard work really resonated with me.

724
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:57,877
I've never experienced...

725
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:00,678
being on the night shift.

726
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:05,047
So, actually, it was really new to me.

727
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:06,917
It felt like I became...

728
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:12,557
truly part of the winter crew.

729
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:14,758
(Feeling like becoming truly part of the winter crew)

730
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,067
(Crew members briefly became the lighthouse of the station.)

731
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:19,237
Thanks for chatting with me.

732
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:20,267
It was my pleasure.

733
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,538
You did a great job.

734
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:24,937
It's pushing me to go back faster.

735
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:25,938
It is pushing us.

736
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:28,807
The wind is carrying me. I'm not even walking myself.

737
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:32,208
(A tougher day than usual is over.)
