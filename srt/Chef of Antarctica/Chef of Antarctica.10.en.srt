00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:05,063
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:06,063
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:09,533
This is King Sejong Station.

4
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:12,003
(Actually, we were in serious danger.)

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:16,043
(The waves are rough, and the weather suddenly shifts.)

6
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:21,013
(2 hours ago)

7
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:25,383
(The crew members are busy preparing the food.)

8
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,152
It was an uneasy feeling.

9
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:29,353
I could see the weather outside the window while cooking.

10
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:31,793
I kept observing while working in the kitchen.

11
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:36,823
I was anxious. The snow...

12
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:41,402
At first, I just thought, "I guess we are in Antarctica after all."

13
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:44,203
But the snow grew heavier and began striking the windows.

14
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,233
Gosh, it's snowing pretty hard.

15
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:49,073
It's windy too. The snow is blowing horizontally.

16
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:51,073
At first, I thought, "What a beautiful sight."

17
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:55,983
"I guess we're lucky to see some snow in Antarctica."

18
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,583
But as time went on, the snowflakes got thicker.

19
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,112
And it snowed harder.

20
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:03,083
All of a sudden, I got scared.

21
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:05,553
Oh, my. It's very windy.

22
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,363
(Worried)

23
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:10,663
My goodness. The wind is quite strong.

24
00:01:11,993 --> 00:01:13,602
(As the weather worsens, )

25
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:15,162
(people outside the kitchen also become busy.)

26
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:16,403
What on earth is going on?

27
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:19,833
Look over there. The flag is about to get ripped away.

28
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:26,983
(They suddenly find themselves in rapidly worsening weather.)

29
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:32,782
(The weather worsens to the point...)

30
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:36,683
(where visibility disappears.)

31
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,452
(With the weather crisis unfolding, )

32
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:41,623
(the production crew and crew members gather in private.)

33
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:44,132
Sir, the wind is very strong.

34
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,693
And the tides are very poor.

35
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,303
I suggest no sail.

36
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:49,933
It won't be safe.

37
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,943
Leader Lee, this is Kwon Young Hoon.

38
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:57,213
(Secretary Kwon updates the station with the latest news.)

39
00:01:57,543 --> 00:02:00,613
The waves are too high. We're turning back.

40
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:02,312
It'll be absolutely impossible...

41
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:04,482
to sail on the boat against these waves.

42
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,413
Anyway, it's impossible because it's too dangerous.

43
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:09,352
- I understood.
- Okay.

44
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,893
(He finishes his radio call with the leader at the station.)

45
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,293
(Afterward, )

46
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:15,762
(an emergency contingency meeting was held immediately.)

47
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:19,292
When we were leaving this morning, the weather forecast seemed okay.

48
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,302
But the weather is taking...

49
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:23,533
a worse turn than we expected.

50
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:27,143
As you can see out the windows,

51
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,942
the wind speed is at 15m per second.

52
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,273
(Current wind speed: 15m per second)

53
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:37,753
According to the safety policy, when it goes over 10m per second,

54
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:39,812
(Boats can't be operated.)

55
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:42,122
boats can't be operated.

56
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,623
- That's the policy.
- What do we do?

57
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,222
If we were to try to power through...

58
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:47,962
and return to King Sejong Station in this blizzard,

59
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:50,193
we might end up dead.

60
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:51,763
So has it been decided?

61
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,903
We looked at the data from our station and the Chinese Station.

62
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:59,202
If anything, the weather could only get worse.

63
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:01,143
We doubt that its conditions would improve.

64
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,943
After analyzing the situation from different angles,

65
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:06,743
we believe that returning to our station will be impossible.

66
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,952
I wasn't sure if it was actually happening or a prank.

67
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,913
I was so flustered I couldn't make sense of anything.

68
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,023
Honestly, I couldn't believe it was happening.

69
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,753
I was a bit scared.

70
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,322
This is the worst.

71
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:21,392
(As no one saw this coming, )

72
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,162
Everything about this situation is just terrible.

73
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,533
(they are confused.)

74
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,392
This doesn't affect just us.

75
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,133
It affects the production crew too. That's over 20 people.

76
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:32,533
Including the production crew, there are 29 of us here.

77
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:38,012
So due to these reasons, could you ask him...

78
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:41,642
if there would be a problem for all 29 of us to stay...

79
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:44,553
at this station? Could you check that again?

80
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,822
Could all of our staff stay? We're 29 people.

81
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:49,552
(Otherwise, the crew members of Antarctica...)

82
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,322
(will have to walk in the blizzard to another station.)

83
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:52,952
- Is there any problem?
- Today?

84
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:53,963
Yes.

85
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,062
- No problem.
- No problem.

86
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:04,703
(Giving permission within 0.1 seconds)

87
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:08,302
(Their generosity makes the crew members smile...)

88
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,142
(without any concern.)

89
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,143
Don't worry.

90
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,143
(Don't worry about anything.)

91
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,143
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:14,942
Seriously. This is crazy.

93
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:18,753
We came here to cook for them because they've done a lot...

94
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,023
- for our station.
- Right.

95
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:23,483
No way. We owe them another one.

96
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,592
- Luckily, they will let us stay.
- Yes.

97
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:27,022
- They said we could stay.
- Yes. They did.

98
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,423
That's a relief, for sure.

99
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:32,732
I think we'll have many chances to go to Korea.

100
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:36,202
And you will also have many chances to visit China...

101
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,132
because we're neighbors.

102
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:42,273
So I welcome everyone to our station.

103
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:45,913
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

104
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:47,713
No worries. It's my pleasure.

105
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:49,313
You saved our lives.

106
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:53,953
(Thanks to them, they can finally relax.)

107
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:56,283
They gladly took us in.

108
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,023
I'm very grateful to them.

109
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,663
We could've frozen to death outside.

110
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:03,323
I'm really relieved that they let us spend the night.

111
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,232
The weather conditions keep on changing.

112
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,362
- I'll keep in touch...
- Keep talking to them.

113
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:09,502
with our station.

114
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,932
- I should pray.
- If we see any improvement...

115
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,702
- in the weather conditions, - Let's hurry up then.

116
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:15,542
we'll try to head back.

117
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,372
To do that, we'll stay prepared.

118
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,542
(They will communicate and try to return to the station.)

119
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,613
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

120
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:25,053
(The emergency meeting is over.)

121
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:32,053
(They can't seem to leave the table.)

122
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,753
We should be happy.

123
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:36,823
But we were isolated without having prepared anything.

124
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:39,992
(The crew members came unprepared for this possibility.)

125
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:41,563
I didn't bring anything.

126
00:05:41,663 --> 00:05:42,763
I'm in big trouble.

127
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,732
Could you ask...

128
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,503
if they have contact lens solution and a container?

129
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,673
None of us thought, "We might end up sleeping over."

130
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:52,813
"We should bring some toner and lotion."

131
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:56,243
It was our first time experiencing capricious weather in Antarctica.

132
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:57,513
My first concern was,

133
00:05:58,113 --> 00:06:00,013
"We might not be able to return tomorrow even."

134
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,122
"Or the day after tomorrow."

135
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:04,123
"What if we end up isolated here for 2 to 3 days?"

136
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:05,993
I wasn't scared or anything.

137
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:09,192
I was mostly concerned about meals for our crew back at the station.

138
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,293
That's what worried me.

139
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,062
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. It's so cold.

140
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,263
(The crew members head over to their accomodation.)

141
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,733
Oh, my. The weather is a complete change from this morning.

142
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,902
- Right. This is unbelievable.
- It's cold.

143
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,903
(Surprised by experiencing the weather change firsthand)

144
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:25,372
(When arriving at the Chinese Station, the weather was clear.)

145
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:27,783
The weather kept changing minute by minute.

146
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,512
My gosh, it was no joke.

147
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,113
(The station is covered in snow within a short period of time.)

148
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:35,453
I was too busy cooking. I didn't think about the weather.

149
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,523
It changed so quickly.

150
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:41,123
(It's shocking how quickly the weather changed.)

151
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:46,363
(Will they be able to return tomorrow?)

152
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:53,703
(The unexpected night out of their station begins.)

153
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:58,913
(Soo Hyang is resting in her room.)

154
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:02,042
I'll tell you where you can use hot water. Here.

155
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:05,612
(Crew: 37.8, Name: Im Soo Hyang)

156
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:07,212
- I see.
- You can drink water here.

157
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:10,053
- We have cold and hot water.
- Hot water.

158
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:11,593
Thank you.

159
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,823
If you need snacks, you can take everything.

160
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,763
If you like, you can take everything. Okay?

161
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,432
Thank you. You're so sweet.

162
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,533
(Leader Wang looks after her in case she feels awkward.)

163
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,173
- Hello.
- Do you want to play PlayStation?

164
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:29,602
Gosh. Yes. But later, maybe.

165
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,173
I'm quite tired now.

166
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:33,272
- Thank you.
- Later.

167
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:34,343
Later, thank you.

168
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:36,612
I'm grateful that...

169
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:39,082
(Crew: 37.8, Name: SUHO)

170
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,653
The Chinese Station let us sleep here.

171
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:43,323
I'll get a good night of rest here and then go back.

172
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,122
(Due to this unexpected situation, )

173
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,232
(the production crew will spend the night here too.)

174
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,693
Be careful. There's a lot of glass.

175
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,433
- It's colder in this corner.
- The bathroom is...

176
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:03,403
(We truly felt the warmth and care from our neighbor in Antarctica.)

177
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:13,213
(The night of the blizzard passes.)

178
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:22,323
(The sky clears up magically as the sun rises.)

179
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:39,413
(The next morning)

180
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:45,013
(The crew members set out to return to King Sejong Station.)

181
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,052
Thank you, sir.

182
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:49,883
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it. We're friends.

183
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:56,193
The blizzard disappeared as if it were never here.

184
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:57,563
Right.

185
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,263
(While they put on a life jacket, )

186
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:03,703
(boats arrive one after another.)

187
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:06,273
Move slowly.

188
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,942
(As they bonded overnight, they're sad to say goodbye.)

189
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:12,312
Everyone came out.

190
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,743
(It's already time to say goodbye.)

191
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:17,583
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

192
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,383
Thank you so much.

193
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,253
We came to repay your kindness, but we owe you once again.

194
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,823
We were going to give you this yesterday.

195
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,122
This is a bell that brings good luck.

196
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:32,093
We have a souvenir from our show. You like souvenirs, right?

197
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:33,932
It's a small present.

198
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:34,962
(It's a small present.)

199
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:37,532
Can you hear the bell? It brings good luck.

200
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,632
(But it comes with love and care.)

201
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,773
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

202
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,143
If a good opportunity arises, I'll see you again. Thanks.

203
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,213
- Everybody, are you okay?
- Thank you.

204
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,212
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

205
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,512
(Everyone shakes hands to say goodbye.)

206
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:48,713
Thank you.

207
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:51,282
Take care.

208
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:53,583
- Yes. You too. Take care.
- Yes. Take care.

209
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:55,352
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

210
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,552
(With heavy hearts, they head back to the station.)

211
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:57,553
Thank you.

212
00:09:58,453 --> 00:09:59,593
You're welcome anytime.

213
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:02,022
All right.

214
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:03,193
(Leaping onto the boat energetically)

215
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:07,763
(The crew members of Antarctica are ready to set sail.)

216
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,863
Take care!

217
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,902
- Take care.
- Bye!

218
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:16,073
(Take care of yourselves too!)

219
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:18,213
Bye, Li!

220
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:20,313
We're setting out.

221
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:27,522
(Just as they welcomed us when we first arrived, )

222
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:31,593
(the Chinese crew members are sending us off wholeheartedly.)

223
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:36,422
(Out of gratitude, the crew members of Antarctica...)

224
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:39,363
(wave at them until they can't see the Chinese crew anymore.)

225
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,802
(They slowly sail away from the Chinese crew...)

226
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:46,073
(with whom they bonded overnight.)

227
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:50,473
(Capturing the unforgettable moment)

228
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,043
They helped us out a lot. So the experience taught me this.

229
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:57,512
The stations have to rely on each other...

230
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,713
in case they get isolated.

231
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:01,083
I wanted to help them in any way.

232
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,053
We had to rely on each other.

233
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:04,353
It was a great experience.

234
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:08,963
When I was cooking a meal for the crew members,

235
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:11,732
I wanted them to feel well-treated...

236
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:14,562
as they enjoyed our food.

237
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:17,833
I wanted them to feel a sense of warmth through the meal.

238
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,932
That crossed my mind.

239
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:21,202
(Treating them with a meal, prepared wholeheartedly)

240
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:23,703
We couldn't return on the same day due to the weather conditions.

241
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:27,143
But the Chinese crew gladly offered us a place to stay for the night.

242
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,283
They said they had tasty food, so we could ask for it anytime.

243
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:33,013
It was a special experience.

244
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:40,392
(They take a good look at the station one last time.)

245
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,323
Doesn't it feel like we're going home?

246
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:49,003
(The crew members go back home.)

247
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:53,433
(Looking around)

248
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,203
That's King Sejong Station, right?

249
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:57,913
- Is that it?
- Yes.

250
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,142
It's quite close.

251
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:01,043
(Before they knew it, King Sejong Station came into view.)

252
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:05,583
Communication room. This is Sejong 12.

253
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,953
Sejong 12. Go ahead.

254
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,392
Im Soo Hyang and eleven crew members are returning...

255
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:15,463
to the station on Sejung 12 now.

256
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:17,493
We'll arrive in five minutes.

257
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,732
Five minutes before the arrival of Soo Hyang...

258
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,532
and eleven crew members.

259
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,303
We've confirmed it.

260
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,473
Thank you.

261
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,813
(After their special experience in Antarctica, )

262
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:37,543
(everyone safely returns.)

263
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:42,953
(Next day)

264
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:48,393
(2nd floor of Machinery Storage)

265
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:54,263
(Soo Hyang is busy preparing something.)

266
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:59,173
(Are they hair-cutting shears?)

267
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,273
(Her lips are getting dry.)

268
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:08,683
(Why is she setting up the hairdressing tools?)

269
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,313
Here's what I heard.

270
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:14,523
The crew members have long hair because they can't get haircuts.

271
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:21,993
(As the winter crew is isolated in Antarctica for 1 year, )

272
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:28,632
(they can't properly take care of their hair.)

273
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:32,772
I thought about what else I could do for them.

274
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:34,643
That had been on my mind.

275
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:39,112
So I thought, "Why don't I learn how to cut hair?"

276
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:42,683
I thought the crew members would like that.

277
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,482
So I mustered up some courage and learned it.

278
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:46,483
(She bravely learned how to cut hair for the first time.)

279
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:49,483
(Three months ago in Korea before entering Antarctica)

280
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:52,192
Life is a series of learning moments.

281
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:54,093
(She enters a hair salon with excitement.)

282
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,363
- I'll teach you how to hold them.
- Okay.

283
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,692
Put the scissors in your palm first.

284
00:13:58,693 --> 00:13:59,693
(She learns how to cut with the shears.)

285
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,233
At a 45° angle.

286
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:02,402
(It's her first time cutting hair.)

287
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:04,903
I bet my hands will shake a lot when I cut actual hair.

288
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:06,733
Oh, my gosh.

289
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:08,643
It's all about confidence.

290
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,312
It has to be the same length.

291
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:13,343
(Confidently trimming)

292
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:15,142
How does it feel?

293
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,613
It feels nice.

294
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:23,123
(She comes in every day to get her practice in.)

295
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:24,353
This is hard.

296
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,552
(Practicing using the clippers which she learned with confidence)

297
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,523
(Surprised)

298
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,762
It is...

299
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:31,892
(What happened?)

300
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,033
This looks...

301
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,233
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,433
(She accidentally trimmed the upper part she wasn't meant to.)

303
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:42,143
(She calmly continues practicing.)

304
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,243
Oh, no.

305
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,943
I messed it up. I did it again.

306
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:47,913
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,743
(Sighing)

308
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:52,913
This is bad.

309
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:55,753
I was scared.

310
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,752
As for food, if I mess it up, I can eat it and redo it.

311
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,263
But it's not the case for hair.

312
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:04,663
I have to cut their hair on my own.

313
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:07,462
I'm a bit more nervous about that than cooking.

314
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,463
(Cutting hair carries a greater emotional burden than cooking.)

315
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:14,943
(Practicing is the only way she'll pull it off.)

316
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:18,112
I wanted to make the crew members happy.

317
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:19,713
So I did my best to train.

318
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:24,282
(Before setting out to Antarctica)

319
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:26,313
I'm scared to cut the back hair.

320
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:27,923
I'm scared I might cut their ears.

321
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:29,983
Then make sure that you don't.

322
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:33,693
How about this?

323
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:34,822
(For the first time, she gives a haircut to her dad, )

324
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:35,922
(who has difficulty walking.)

325
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:36,963
Isn't it too short?

326
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:38,633
- No.
- It's not short. It's fine.

327
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:43,633
(Careful)

328
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:44,773
- I'm trimming around your ear.
- Yes.

329
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,302
I was worried that...

330
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:51,102
you might give awful haircuts to the people in Antarctica.

331
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,813
But I was wrong. You're good.

332
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:58,112
Who knew you would give your dad a haircut?

333
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,453
Who would have guessed that?

334
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:02,453
I've learned a useful skill.

335
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:04,923
(Chuckling)

336
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:05,923
- You know?
- Right.

337
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,023
- This came in handy.
- Yes.

338
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:09,663
What a good daughter you are.

339
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,132
(She's been practicing for three months.)

340
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,263
(All the preparations are done.)

341
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,303
(Finally, it's the day of the haircuts.)

342
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:21,702
Welcome.

343
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:22,742
(Soo Hyang Salon opens up in Antarctica.)

344
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,443
My gosh. Are you guys all coming in at the same time?

345
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,282
- How many people?
- Other people...

346
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,913
I wonder if I can cut everyone's hair by today.

347
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:33,752
(Her customers are waiting.)

348
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:35,453
I wonder how he'll look with the new haircut.

349
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:37,782
I'm a bit nervous because you're all watching.

350
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:41,123
(Her salon was packed with excited crew members.)

351
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:45,433
(The first customer is Kim Eun Su, the youngest member.)

352
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,662
Gosh, your hair is really long.

353
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:51,063
I haven't had a haircut since the Lunar New Year.

354
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,233
- Since the Lunar New Year?
- Yes.

355
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:55,902
- When I was in Korea, - This reminds me of the military.

356
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:58,143
I wore my hair in a deep side part and brushed it over like this.

357
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,372
You used to have short hair.

358
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:02,842
I did. It was short on the sides and long in the front.

359
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:04,243
- You want the sides done like this?
- My back hair fell behind my ears.

360
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:05,613
That's actually her specialty.

361
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:07,383
Yes, I'll leave it up to her.

362
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,923
I can't wait to see him with Cha Eun Woo's hairstyle.

363
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,193
Cha Eun Woo's hairstyle?

364
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,623
- Cha Eun Woo's hairstyle.
- Cha Eun Woo's hairstyle?

365
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:18,762
(The style Crew Eun Su is seeking)

366
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,563
It's a really popular haircut in Korea these days.

367
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:23,733
It's a see-through dandy cut.

368
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:26,273
I'll give you a great haircut.

369
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:28,943
- What do you think?
- I'd like that.

370
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,173
- It sounds good, right?
- Yes.

371
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:37,813
(Can she give him Cha Eun Woo's see-through dandy cut?)

372
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,512
How old are you?

373
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:41,983
- Can you guess it?
- You're pretty young, right?

374
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,993
Guess how old I am, just based on my looks.

375
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,293
I'd say 27?

376
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,163
I'm younger than that.

377
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:52,793
- What?
- I'm younger than that.

378
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,802
You should try a lower number.

379
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:58,403
(Laughing)

380
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:01,033
(He's younger than 27.)

381
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:03,773
(Having a headache)

382
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:05,773
I was born in the 1990s.

383
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:08,012
- Were you born in 1999 then?
- Yes.

384
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:09,912
If you were born in 1999, you're 26.

385
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,413
- Yes, I'm 26.
- I was close.

386
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,452
You're 26 in Korea, but by international age, you're 25.

387
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:15,453
- You're right.
- I see.

388
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:19,493
- Eun Su.
- Yes.

389
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:23,293
Do you have a girlfriend?

390
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,662
- I mean, in Korea.
- Why did she ask him that?

391
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:27,663
I don't.

392
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,333
(Stirring)

393
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,372
Your question came totally out of nowhere.

394
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:33,373
I just asked.

395
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:36,543
Many crew members break up after they come here.

396
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:38,372
- It must happen after coming here.
- After getting this job?

397
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,543
- After coming here?
- Yes, it happens a lot here.

398
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:41,912
Please go easy on us.

399
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,882
That was a pretty harsh question out of nowhere.

400
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,153
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:48,882
I'll give you a great haircut, so you'll get a girlfriend...

402
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,122
as soon as you go back.

403
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:52,393
Give him the Cha Eun Woo haircut.

404
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:53,693
The Cha Eun Woo haircut?

405
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:54,992
(Her mission has become even more important.)

406
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:56,523
I'll help you look like Cha Eun Woo.

407
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,663
- I'll begin.
- Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

408
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:03,803
(Exhaling with determination)

409
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:05,902
(The Barber of Antarctica is finally making her debut.)

410
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,673
- I'll cut the long section first.
- Yes.

411
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:13,743
(Excited)

412
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:18,013
(Cutting his hair with hair clippers as she learned)

413
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:23,783
I was so nervous when it was time to cut his hair.

414
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:26,122
I was worried...

415
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,923
that my poor haircut skills might the crew members' hair.

416
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:31,633
There was a mirror.

417
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,963
I just hope they'll be happy with it.

418
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,543
Seeing my hair get cut like this reminds me of when I enlisted.

419
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:46,843
No, it's not like that.

420
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:48,442
You look great now.

421
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:52,683
(Layering the hair to make it feel lighter)

422
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,682
(Transforming him into Cha Eun Woo of Antarctica with delicate cutting)

423
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:57,823
It looks neat.

424
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:00,892
- You look like a professional.
- Really?

425
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:02,663
You're doing it well. You're really good at this.

426
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:05,592
I practiced really hard before I came...

427
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:07,593
because I wanted to give you great haircuts.

428
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,333
I'm really looking forward to it.

429
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:16,543
(Even though she's covered in hair clippings...)

430
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,643
I'm putting my heart into it.

431
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:25,153
(she is putting her whole heart into it.)

432
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:29,353
What is the first thing you want to do when you go back?

433
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,023
I want to see my family first.

434
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:38,733
I'm returning to my previous job right at the start of the year.

435
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,992
When I was working at the port, my job was working on ships.

436
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:42,463
Oh, I can totally see that.

437
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:44,732
I majored in marine engines,

438
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,702
so I just stayed in that field for my career path.

439
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,002
(Crew Eun Su's main job is managing marine engines and generators.)

440
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,873
- By the way, - Yes.

441
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:53,672
what made you want to come to Antarctica?

442
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,742
(The reason Crew Eun Su came to Antarctica)

443
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:57,112
When I got on the subway in Incheon to go home,

444
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:58,582
- Go on.
- I saw the recruitment ad.

445
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,222
The recruitment ad said something like,

446
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:03,823
"Apply for the 0.001 percent."

447
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,853
And that made my heart race.

448
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,623
The government did a good job with the ad.

449
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:13,862
(The ad slogan drove Eun Su to Antarctica.)

450
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,362
- He's right.
- That was great marketing.

451
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,263
It was Leader Lee Hyeong Geun who came up with that slogan.

452
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,033
- Really?
- Yes.

453
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,742
- Yes, he did.
- It sounds really motivating...

454
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,103
and gets the adrenaline pumping.

455
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:24,542
(Living in Antarctica)

456
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:26,012
(A chance for just 0.00001 percent of Koreans)

457
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:27,073
(That's me. I made it.)

458
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,412
That's amazing.

459
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,383
I think it came out well.

460
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,553
You look great. Nice.

461
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:36,452
He looks way better.

462
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,883
I look like a totally different person.

463
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:39,553
- I'll blow-dry your hair.
- Okay.

464
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:44,263
SUHO has a great eye for hairstyles.

465
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:46,933
(Getting the hair mousse)

466
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:51,303
(Spreading his legs apart)

467
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:55,772
Getting your hair styled right is crucial,

468
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,973
especially for men's cuts.

469
00:21:58,003 --> 00:22:00,213
(Everyone is amazed.)

470
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,042
(Falling for myself)

471
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:04,613
You need to let this down to look sexy.

472
00:22:04,713 --> 00:22:06,513
- You look great.
- Thanks.

473
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:07,652
I love it.

474
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,223
- Really?
- Yes.

475
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:12,792
- Thank you for the haircut.
- I did it!

476
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14,523
(The first haircut was done successfully.)

477
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:17,822
(Cha Eun Woo's see-through dandy cut)

478
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:18,832
He looks great.

479
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,463
(A perfect fit for him)

480
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,003
You pulled it off.

481
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:29,643
I was completely clueless about men's hair.

482
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:32,772
- It's the best.
- Doesn't his haircut look great?

483
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:34,112
- I love it.
- His hair looks great.

484
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:35,282
(Crew Eun Su loves his new haircut.)

485
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:37,183
(Taking a photo)

486
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,623
(Soo Hyang is happy to see him like his haircut.)

487
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,682
I can't even recognize you.

488
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:46,553
(That sharp new haircut makes his confidence shoot up.)

489
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:50,493
(Her clothes are covered in hair clippings too.)

490
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:52,232
I'm exhausted.

491
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,793
(But she's proud.)

492
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:59,333
(Who's the next one with the long bob?)

493
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:00,703
Is everything set, Assistant?

494
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:03,843
You seem super confident.

495
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:10,183
Do you remember getting that bob haircut...

496
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,782
halfway through the series...

497
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:14,852
when you were doing that TV series?

498
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,882
It could be longer.

499
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:18,523
- It's similar to your current hair.
- Yes.

500
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,352
You've really grown your hair out.

501
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:21,923
It's been exactly a year.

502
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,623
Please cut my hair short.

503
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:25,462
I'll trim it this much for now.

504
00:23:25,463 --> 00:23:29,133
(The Soo Hyang-style bangs he wanted)

505
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,802
Sideburns are men's pride.

506
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:33,233
(Don't forget. Sideburns are men's pride!)

507
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:36,573
I wonder what others would think.

508
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:38,743
They'd say it looks good on you.

509
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:44,413
(Amazed)

510
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:50,053
- Do you like it?
- Why are you looking so bashful?

511
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,493
- It's done.
- You look great.

512
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:53,923
Great.

513
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:56,623
It's awesome.

514
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:57,763
(Bashful)

515
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,902
His hairstyle looks like the one I wore in "Beauty and Mr. Romantic."

516
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:02,903
It looks great on him.

517
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,702
(Soo Hyang is also super satisfied.)

518
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:06,833
Do I look funny?

519
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:08,902
- It's cute.
- I like it.

520
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:10,642
- You look pretty.
- I agree.

521
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:11,643
I really mean it.

522
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:14,712
(She cuts everyone's hair with great care.)

523
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:15,713
That looks great.

524
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:18,812
You've mastered how to trim sideburns.

525
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:19,853
It looks good.

526
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:21,612
Thanks. I love it.

527
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:24,223
(Everyone is 100 percent satisfied. They love it.)

528
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:28,523
The crew members looked so happy.

529
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,362
It felt rewarding for me too.

530
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:34,963
Soo Hyang did a fantastic job, so I wanted to tell her...

531
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:36,762
how amazing she was.

532
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:39,333
(I wanted to tell Soo Hyang she was incredible.)

533
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,572
I thought about this while I was giving them haircuts.

534
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:43,773
(Crew: 37.8, Name: Im Soo Hyang)

535
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:47,173
They trusted me completely...

536
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:51,883
and put a part of their body in my hands.

537
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:54,113
Please don't feel pressured and take it easy.

538
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:59,823
I felt some emotional interaction, even just from it.

539
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:02,093
I was able to talk to them more.

540
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:05,033
I started putting in more care and attention.

541
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:08,332
I felt like I got closer to them.

542
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,563
(Crew: 37.8, Name: Im Soo Hyang)

543
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:13,303
I felt so relieved they liked it. They're angels.

544
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:23,183
(Hopefully, Soo Hyang's efforts and sincerity reached the crew.)

545
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:29,522
(In frigid Antarctica, )

546
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:32,993
(a day full of warmth comes to an end.)

547
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:39,893
(Before long, morning breaks.)

548
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:45,873
(The animals are starting their day.)

549
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:49,343
(Good morning)

550
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:55,983
(The 37th winter crew is having a busy start to the morning.)

551
00:25:57,613 --> 00:25:59,783
(Where are the crew members of Antarctica?)

552
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:02,623
(Crew Paik shows up.)

553
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,993
(They start boarding the boat, one by one.)

554
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:10,993
(Where is the destination?)

555
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,393
This is Sejong 12.

556
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,762
Kwon Oh Seok and the group of thirteen...

557
00:26:15,763 --> 00:26:17,403
are departing for the Uruguay Base.

558
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,632
- Bye. See you later.
- Bye.

559
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:22,343
(Uruguay Base?)

560
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:26,543
Unlike us, they came in as a summer crew.

561
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,812
All the new crew members have arrived.

562
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:32,212
King Sejong Station has interacted with the previous crew,

563
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:34,152
but they haven't connected with this new one yet.

564
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,583
(The last winter crew left.)

565
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:41,723
(The new summer crew arrived.)

566
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:44,892
So we can use this opportunity to cook for them...

567
00:26:44,893 --> 00:26:49,402
and help build a relationship between the two bases.

568
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:50,763
(They're going to serve a meal and exchange greetings.)

569
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,072
(Russia, Chile, China, Uruguay, Korea, Argentina, Poland, Brazil)

570
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:55,843
(King George Island, home to eight permanent bases)

571
00:26:56,043 --> 00:26:57,702
(China, Argentina)

572
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,413
(The crew visited two neighboring bases.)

573
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:05,553
(Argentina Carlini Base)

574
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:12,123
(China's Great Wall Station)

575
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:16,393
(The next place to visit)

576
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:21,193
(Uruguay Artigas Base)

577
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,263
(Chef of Antarctica)

578
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:25,772
(Heading to the Uruguay Base!)

579
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,032
(King Sejong Station)

580
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:29,572
(About a 15-minute trip to Uruguay Base)

581
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:32,043
The sea is pretty calm today.

582
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:35,042
The conditions out on the water are good today.

583
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:38,043
Yes. The weather's great today, so I even spotted whales earlier.

584
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,453
You'll see them if you pay attention.

585
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,522
Only good people can see them.

586
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:48,222
I guess I'm a bad person.

587
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:49,322
(Crying)

588
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:51,623
Look. There are whales. There's a pod of whales.

589
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:55,263
(Annoyed)

590
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,203
(Riding into the RIB that they're now used to)

591
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:05,643
(Sailing across the Antarctic Ocean)

592
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,912
(The third neighboring base)

593
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:10,683
(Uruguay Artigas Base)

594
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:12,813
I guess it's that one.

595
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:16,052
(Uruguay Base in the distance)

596
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:18,223
They made a building with a flag.

597
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:24,392
(What special meal will they serve to the Uruguayan crew?)

598
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:25,933
There is a Korean flag.

599
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:30,932
The waves are high, so you might get splashed.

600
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:31,933
(They arrive at the Uruguayan Artigas Base.)

601
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:38,472
Oh, gosh.

602
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:39,642
(Getting off safely with the help of the Uruguayan crew.)

603
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:40,673
Thank you.

604
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:42,083
Good morning, sir.

605
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:44,912
- My name is Petra.
- Petra.

606
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,213
- Petra.
- I'm Paik.

607
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:49,522
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm a colonel...

608
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:51,882
and a commander of the base.

609
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:53,753
She's the commander. I'm Paik.

610
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:55,893
A female commander is cool.

611
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,422
She looks so cool.

612
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:00,593
(The commander of Uruguay Base, Petra da Costa)

613
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:05,833
(In the history of the Uruguayan Artigas Base, )

614
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:10,103
(she's the first female commander.)

615
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:11,773
Let's go.

616
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:14,743
Yes.

617
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:16,642
Thank you so much for having us.

618
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:18,913
We're happy to have you here.

619
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,553
It's exotic. It's already got that exotic vibe.

620
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:26,053
I like that neat and compact feel.

621
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:27,193
Right.

622
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:30,822
- Oh, my. It's crazy.
- I know.

623
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:32,563
(Uruguay Base impresses the crew.)

624
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:35,333
The base seemed pretty small.

625
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:41,033
(Clustering around the lodging painted with the Uruguayan flag)

626
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,473
It was neat,

627
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:45,913
snug, and small.

628
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,742
It felt really cozy.

629
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,813
(The base has a cozy and snug vibe.)

630
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:54,083
The name of our base is...

631
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:58,553
Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base.

632
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:02,563
It was founded on December 22, 1984.

633
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:08,333
We are researching Collins Glacier.

634
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:13,703
(Collins Glacier)

635
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:17,903
(A key indicator of climate change)

636
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:25,853
(The primary subject of research at the Uruguay Base)

637
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:32,293
(Collins Glacier)

638
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:40,393
(Amid the climate crisis that causes ice walls to collapse, )

639
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:56,413
(Uruguay Base is monitoring glacial and ecosystem changes.)

640
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,883
This is a cafeteria.

641
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:07,423
It's a place...

642
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:12,463
where soldiers and scientists gather and try all sorts of dishes.

643
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,833
(What food will they serve at Uruguay Base?)

644
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:20,173
(Gimbap)

645
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:23,643
Just make nine rolls of each kind of gimbap.

646
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:25,643
(Chef of Antarctica will prepare gimbap for today's meal.)

647
00:31:25,713 --> 00:31:27,743
(Don't ever give up.)

648
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:29,442
(Under Crew Paik's leadership...)

649
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,943
(Is that the leader's badge?)

650
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:34,212
(Just like they practiced, )

651
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,423
(rolling it with care)

652
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:36,553
(Rolling)

653
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:38,923
(Gimbap in the making)

654
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:42,362
(Will it be a success?)

655
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:43,493
(Clattering)

656
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,933
(The faucet suddenly falls off.)

657
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:48,832
(And on top of that, )

658
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,303
(is the water cut off?)

659
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:53,933
(What's wrong?)

660
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,002
Why did this turn off?

661
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:57,003
(Rice!)

662
00:31:58,473 --> 00:32:00,243
(An unexpected crisis hits Chef of Antarctica.)

663
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:02,883
(Beeping)

664
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:05,653
(Beeping)

665
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:06,883
(What's this sound?)

666
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:08,752
(What is it...)

667
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:10,182
(again...)

668
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:11,683
(this time?)

669
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:13,823
(At last...)

670
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,192
(At last!)

671
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:17,322
We're in trouble.

672
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:22,602
(Will Chef of Antarctica be able to serve gimbap?)

673
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,803
(Dessert)

674
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:26,133
(Do Uruguayans have a sweet tooth?)

675
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,333
(Yes, we love sweets.)

676
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,702
(It's really sweet.)

677
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:30,703
(Watch how much sugar I use.)

678
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,212
(Pouring over)

679
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:34,743
(It's really sweet.)

680
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:37,213
(I'm the sugar lover.)

681
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,682
(Jaw-dropping)

682
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:41,282
(How's this going to taste?)

683
00:32:41,283 --> 00:32:42,452
(Amazed)

684
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:43,782
(It's so good.)

685
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:45,552
(It's sweet and really delicious.)

686
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:46,553
(Exactly!)

687
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:48,692
- What?
- What is it?

688
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:51,092
(Happy...)

689
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:53,593
(birthday?)

690
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:56,103
(Birthday decorations cover the whole wall.)

691
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:58,902
(An unusual sight at King Sejong Station)

692
00:32:58,903 --> 00:32:59,903
(A birthday party?)

693
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,033
(Impressed)

694
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:03,542
(In awe)

695
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:04,543
(Surprised)

696
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:07,172
(Cook the dish the birthday person wants!)

697
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:09,712
(Rose tteokbokki)

698
00:33:09,713 --> 00:33:10,713
(Regular milk!)

699
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:11,983
(We don't have regular milk.)

700
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,813
(I'd say it's kind of a trick.)

701
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:16,653
(Rose Tteokbokki with a secret twist)

702
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:18,053
(A celebratory drink...)

703
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:20,923
(with King Sejong Station's exclusive drift ice?)

704
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:26,233
(In charge of collecting the drift ice)

705
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,493
(Chef of Antarctica)
