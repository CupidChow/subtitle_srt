00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:05,124
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,155
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:09,525
(This way.)

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:12,725
(Walking toward the penguin nests)

5
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,035
(The crew members of Antarctica carefully approach them.)

6
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:21,135
(At the penguin research site, where thousands of nests are found, )

7
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,404
(what tasks are the crew members of Antarctica expected to help with?)

8
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:26,844
Where is the GPS team?

9
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,174
It's me, Dr. Ji Hui, and the GPS team.

10
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:30,175
How about you, SUHO?

11
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,414
We're going to write down.

12
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,784
(SUHO and Jong Hyeop: Assisting with measuring the size of penguins)

13
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,455
I'm going to write the basics for you.

14
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,125
We measure the penguins' body size...

15
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:41,025
because those who eat well and grow well tend to be healthier.

16
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:45,295
Assuming that stronger penguins breed more successfully,

17
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:48,434
we plan to compare their body size.

18
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:51,005
When we catch a penguin,

19
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:53,104
- we measure five things.
- Okay.

20
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:55,804
Its weight, the length of the bill,

21
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,405
the depth of the bill, the length of the wing,

22
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,415
and the length of the foot.

23
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,274
These numbers are used as actual research data.

24
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:04,945
When we say the numbers,

25
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:08,185
please repeat them and write them down.

26
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,485
- Okay.
- I'll tell you in order.

27
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:13,255
(I should write it down well.)

28
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:15,124
Doctor, I should capture a penguin.

29
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,555
I'll go and help.

30
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,364
Who are we taking?

31
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:20,995
(How will they capture a penguin?)

32
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,234
I heard penguins are aggressive. Aren't they the penguins...

33
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:26,105
- whose droppings can fly 40cm?
- Yes.

34
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:28,035
They can shoot their droppings.

35
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:30,844
We're going to capture one now. Take a look.

36
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:33,504
(They carefully approach the nest.)

37
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,415
Grab the tail.

38
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:37,585
It actually bites.

39
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:49,255
Oh, my gosh. What's wrong with its belly?

40
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,434
(It has no feathers on its belly.)

41
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,794
It's used for incubating eggs.

42
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:58,205
Do they have no feathers on the area where they incubate their eggs?

43
00:01:58,305 --> 00:01:59,305
Yes.

44
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:00,475
(The brood patch is used to brood their chicks and eggs.)

45
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,104
- It's very warm.
- Is it?

46
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:04,105
- Yes.
- What did you say?

47
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:05,845
It's warm.

48
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:08,245
(With its exposed skin, its body heat is transferred directly.)

49
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:09,845
That's interesting.

50
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,614
It can't move when you hold it by its tail.

51
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:17,385
(The penguin is captured in a special bag.)

52
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,524
(The research team takes the egg from its nest as well.)

53
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:24,825
Did you take the egg because other animals could steal it?

54
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,295
Yes.

55
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:28,765
(A skua)

56
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,135
(After looking around, )

57
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,875
(it approaches the egg and snatches it quickly.)

58
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:40,004
Other animals could take the egg while the penguin is absent.

59
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,014
Yes.

60
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:44,085
(The egg must be collected as other animals might steal it.)

61
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:47,154
Careful with the precious egg.

62
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,155
(The research team must not let its guard down.)

63
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:50,685
- Okay.
- Yes.

64
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,254
- Let's weigh it first.
- The weight.

65
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,255
(1. Weight)

66
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,124
(Connecting the measuring device)

67
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,595
(Pooping)

68
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,094
(Attacked by the poop)

69
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,395
Is it because it's scared? It pooped.

70
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,034
It's okay.

71
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,604
(It's not an easy task.)

72
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,475
(They carry on with the measurements even when hit by droppings.)

73
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:14,344
It's 4kg. Please write 4.

74
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:15,345
Four.

75
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:16,444
(Jong Hyeop repeats it and writes it down carefully.)

76
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:17,485
Okay.

77
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:21,355
I'll measure the bill length 1st. It's 52.4mm.

78
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:22,755
It's 52.4mm?

79
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,724
Let me see.

80
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:25,754
(3. Bill depth)

81
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,255
It's 17.81mm.

82
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:30,124
- It's 17.81mm.
- It's 17.81mm.

83
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,665
(Writing each number carefully)

84
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,864
- Foot length.
- Okay.

85
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:34,895
(4. Foot length)

86
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,305
So this is how it looks.

87
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,105
- It's interesting.
- It looks interesting.

88
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,304
(The anti-slip pattern allows the penguin to walk on the ice.)

89
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,405
It's 79.8mm.

90
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,705
I can't write it well because my hands are frozen.

91
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:48,875
- So it's 9.8.
- It's 9.8.

92
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:50,015
(My hands are cold.)

93
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,014
- My hands are frozen.
- Here. Do you need gloves?

94
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,514
How about these?

95
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:54,755
(Sweet)

96
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:58,685
Here.

97
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,224
(Hearing that Jong Hyeop was cold, SUHO quickly took out the gloves.)

98
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,525
When did you take these?

99
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,224
I should take care of you since I'm older than you.

100
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,695
(He puts the glove on him himself.)

101
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,434
Thank you, SUHO.

102
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:08,894
(They seem like a pair of good brothers.)

103
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,295
- Thank you.
- You'll be able to write well.

104
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:12,135
Gosh, it's...

105
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,975
(5. Wing length)

106
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:16,635
It's 183.5mm.

107
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,505
- It's 183.5mm.
- It's 183.5mm.

108
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,445
(All five measurements have been completed.)

109
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:27,084
What's in there?

110
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:28,884
- This is called a PIT tag.
- Okay.

111
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:31,854
By injecting this into the penguin, we can track it...

112
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,285
- and distinguish each individual.
- Each individual?

113
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:37,424
We have a long device shaped like Excalibur.

114
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,395
When you scan with it, it shows a number.

115
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:41,295
(Injection begins.)

116
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:42,334
It would hurt.

117
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:45,365
(He's too into it.)

118
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:49,374
(Flapping)

119
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,675
It hurts.

120
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:52,974
(He's flapping as well.)

121
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:56,015
It would hurt. It's okay. It'll just sting a little.

122
00:04:57,585 --> 00:05:00,244
You don't say something like this. "It'll just sting a little."

123
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,985
They say this to people.

124
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,885
Instead, I thoroughly rub the skin.

125
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,755
Now, we're done with one penguin.

126
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,824
You need to do everything by hand,

127
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,725
- so it takes a long time.
- Right.

128
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,764
It'd be hard to measure many penguins in a day.

129
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,565
- In a day...
- Ten?

130
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,905
- Ten in one day is...
- It's a lot, right?

131
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,535
It's really a lot.

132
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:22,975
You did it a bit faster with us,

133
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,304
but with just the three of you, it won't be as quick.

134
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:26,975
(Measuring penguins takes more effort than one might think.)

135
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:30,685
(How is the other team attaching the tracking devices?)

136
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,045
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

137
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:34,114
- Soo Hyang, do you have a notebook?
- Yes.

138
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,685
Number three. Prepare the tape.

139
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:38,524
It pooped.

140
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,185
(It shot its droppings.)

141
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:41,894
(Research always begins with poop.)

142
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,095
I already got poop on my clothes.

143
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,895
Penguins poop a lot.

144
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,435
- Prepare the tape.
- Okay.

145
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:53,164
Could I have four 12cm strips of tape?

146
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:54,175
Sure.

147
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:58,675
(Jong Won prepares the tape.)

148
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,285
(His hand is shaking.)

149
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:10,354
(He's struggling with super-strong waterproof tape.)

150
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,354
- It's hard to tear it, isn't it?
- It is.

151
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,825
The adhesive is strong,

152
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:16,895
so it's difficult to tear it off.

153
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,435
(The tracking device will be attached here.)

154
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:28,605
(She carefully secures it with waterproof tape.)

155
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:31,574
Prepare the GPS.

156
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:33,005
- Okay.
- GPS.

157
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,514
The GPS number is 00.

158
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,515
(She secures the tracking device with waterproof tape.)

159
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:43,315
(Date, the number assigned to the penguin)

160
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,525
- Prepare the dye.
- Okay.

161
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:50,965
(While Soo Hyang is preparing the dye, )

162
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,264
(Jong Won is observing something.)

163
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:54,865
(Staring)

164
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,435
Is the penguin carrying stones to the nest a male?

165
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,304
Both males and females do it.

166
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:02,075
They're a nice couple.

167
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,245
They're probably a couple,

168
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,445
but they might be cheating.

169
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,645
- Penguins cheat too?
- Yes.

170
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,915
(Sometimes, if a penguin isn't satisfied with its mate...)

171
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:18,484
(Honey, where are you going?)

172
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,325
(Oh, my gosh!)

173
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:24,064
(Penguins have affairs too.)

174
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:26,165
They have affairs just like humans.

175
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:31,334
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

176
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,435
- Should we flip the penguin?
- Yes.

177
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,004
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,005
(They're careful not to hurt it.)

179
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,844
Oh, my.

180
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,944
(A number is marked on its white belly.)

181
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,115
You wrote three.

182
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:45,044
- Yes. Number 3.
- Number 3.

183
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,114
With an extra line.

184
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,315
Because its mate has been given number three.

185
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,155
It means it's the mate of number three.

186
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:54,154
(Numbers are marked on the penguin's body with dye...)

187
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,724
(so that it can be quickly identified...)

188
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,055
(when changing the devices.)

189
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:00,064
Soo Hyang, shall we go and put the egg back in the nest?

190
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,065
Yes.

191
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:04,565
(Give my egg back to me right now!)

192
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,534
It's angry.

193
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:07,675
(I'm sorry. Please wait a little.)

194
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:12,045
(She returns the egg first.)

195
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,975
This is number 3. That's number 13.

196
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:21,315
(She releases the penguin by the nest.)

197
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:24,455
(Figuring out where it is first)

198
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,125
- Can they find the nest?
- Yes, they know where it is.

199
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:32,465
- Amazing.
- It's interesting.

200
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,764
They don't know sometimes,

201
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,135
but most of them find their nest right away.

202
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,605
Won't the penguins try to remove the tracker?

203
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:43,205
We should change it every five days.

204
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,404
They won't try to get it off,

205
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,245
but they might lose it while swimming.

206
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:49,515
Are we doing it together?

207
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,144
(They can't study the Antarctic ecosystem...)

208
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,615
(without the help of penguins.)

209
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:57,014
This task takes a lot of effort.

210
00:08:57,015 --> 00:09:01,025
Right. It would be very difficult to do it alone.

211
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:05,165
The penguin research team went through a lot.

212
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:10,195
They were literally working among the penguins.

213
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:14,135
With the high altitude, the wind blew fiercely.

214
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,844
When I briefly took off my gloves, my hands froze,

215
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:19,145
making writing difficult.

216
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,645
Watching them continue their research...

217
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,715
despite being hungry,

218
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,415
I felt a mix of sympathy...

219
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:32,325
and admiration for them.

220
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:36,455
They wouldn't be able to do this job without a sense of purpose.

221
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:42,035
I was reminded once more...

222
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:43,735
of the importance and significance...

223
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,634
of penguin research for humanity.

224
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:47,635
(He realized how important penguin research is.)

225
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:53,275
(Once again, they get closer to Antarctica through experience.)

226
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:59,285
(Another day has passed at King Sejong Station.)

227
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:00,714
(Chef of Antarctica)

228
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:05,085
(It's already the 4th day since they arrived in Antarctica.)

229
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:15,365
(The crew members are busy getting ready to move in the morning.)

230
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,334
Hello.

231
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:23,505
(The crew members of Antarctica get on the boat.)

232
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,175
(As everyone waves them off, )

233
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,644
Bye.

234
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,174
(where are they going?)

235
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,715
See you later.

236
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:37,285
This is Kwon Oh Seok and 12 others, leaving for the Argentine Base.

237
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:40,455
(Argentine Base?)

238
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,395
(Why are they going to the Argentine Base?)

239
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,925
The weather is nice today.

240
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:48,195
- Hello.
- Hello.

241
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:52,365
Thank you for adapting so well to the harsh conditions in Antarctica.

242
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,035
We should thank you.

243
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:57,174
I want to brief you...

244
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,845
on the tasks you'll be performing today.

245
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:03,114
Each country carefully inspects its supplies...

246
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:04,915
- and ships plenty, - Okay.

247
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,414
but there's always a shortage in Antarctica.

248
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,284
Especially when it comes to food,

249
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:14,354
some items are plentiful while others are scarce,

250
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:17,724
so we exchange what's abundant...

251
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,724
and what's lacking...

252
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:20,794
among ourselves.

253
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:21,835
Does the Korean base borrow a lot of food?

254
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:24,905
Yes. For example, lamb...

255
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:28,105
- isn't commonly used in Korea.
- Right.

256
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:30,534
But South American bases have it in abundance,

257
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,444
so they share it or exchange it for something else.

258
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:38,084
That can only happen among brothers.

259
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,484
In Antarctica, no matter how powerful a country is,

260
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:45,384
it's not enough to survive on its own.

261
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:46,784
Everyone has to help each other to get by.

262
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,654
That's awesome. I like that.

263
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,494
It's natural in Antarctica.

264
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,624
Regardless of politics or ideology,

265
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,334
we help each other like brothers.

266
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,494
That's awesome.

267
00:11:56,495 --> 00:12:00,865
(They prepare Korean food and invite people from neighboring bases.)

268
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,235
(Their collaboration extends beyond research, fostering bonds as well.)

269
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:05,275
- That's okay.
- Very good.

270
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,915
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi.

271
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:10,545
One more time.

272
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:14,285
We visited the Argentine Base before.

273
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,785
It seemed...

274
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:20,125
they were struggling...

275
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:23,454
because they lacked jams, fish, and vegetables...

276
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:24,725
at the Argentine Base.

277
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:29,665
The weather is nice today, and the winter crew needs to go there.

278
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:31,635
So I want you to accompany them...

279
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,664
and share the ingredients with the Argentine Base.

280
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,435
Where is the Argentine Base?

281
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,404
- It lies south of our base.
- This side?

282
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,944
Yes. Argentina Carlini Base...

283
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,214
is the farthest base...

284
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:42,514
we can reach by boat,

285
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,015
according to the Korea Polar Research Institute's regulations.

286
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:46,944
While we're at it, if the weather permits,

287
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:48,614
we could make dinner for them.

288
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:50,555
- That'd be great.
- Are you okay with the idea?

289
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,155
I like the idea. Let's go.

290
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,195
(Another reason Paik Jong Won came to Antarctica)

291
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,335
How should I put it? This is how I feel.

292
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:07,164
A mother goes to Seoul to cook for her son,

293
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:08,505
who has moved to Seoul.

294
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,674
But she can't only cook for him.

295
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:12,405
She would want to cook for his friends too.

296
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,214
She could invite his friends over and cook for them,

297
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,314
or prepare some side dishes to bring to them...

298
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,385
- since she's visiting Seoul.
- Yes.

299
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:24,015
I'd also like to try my best...

300
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,224
and cook for the crew members there.

301
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:27,485
(He wants to cook for the crew members at the neighboring bases.)

302
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,225
We'll get the food from the storage.

303
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,525
Thank you.

304
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,095
(It's our chance to show our sincerity!)

305
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:33,794
We should bring some vegetables.

306
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,695
(Let's prepare some vegetables first.)

307
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,304
So this was it.

308
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:39,665
(Vegetables in Antarctica?)

309
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:40,835
- Can I open it?
- Yes.

310
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,675
Oh, they have Korean melons.

311
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,575
This is nice.

312
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:51,445
(What is this place where Korean melons are growing?)

313
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:55,715
(A small container...)

314
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:59,355
(in the freezing, harsh Antarctica)

315
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:07,225
(Inside grows green life.)

316
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,594
(The warm nature of Antarctica, )

317
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,665
(Sejong Greenhouse)

318
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:18,005
(Since 2010, container-type smart farms have been introduced, )

319
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:22,775
(providing fresh vegetables year-round...)

320
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:28,085
(to the crew members who endure harsh weather.)

321
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:32,785
(Thanks to the greenhouse, they can enjoy fresh vegetables.)

322
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,554
(The warm nature of Antarctica, Sejong Greenhouse)

323
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,365
Why are you growing so many Korean melons?

324
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,665
We tried growing various fruits like watermelons and Korean melons.

325
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:45,964
And it turned out Korean melons are their favorite.

326
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:46,965
They're sweet.

327
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:50,275
That's why we've been growing Korean melons.

328
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:53,405
(Sweet yellow Korean melons tailored to the taste of the crew members)

329
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,445
These are chili peppers.

330
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:57,444
Cherry tomatoes and peppers.

331
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,415
Yes. Cherry tomatoes and peppers.

332
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:03,185
Some prefer spicy, while others prefer mild.

333
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:05,355
Chili peppers have good yields, don't they?

334
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:06,884
That's why we chose to grow them.

335
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,254
- We tried growing different crops.
- I tried growing them too.

336
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,224
With minimal effort,

337
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,525
- they grow enough to eat plenty.
- Yes.

338
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,025
Is this kale?

339
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,495
Yes. It's meant for juice.

340
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:17,394
- Is it?
- Yes.

341
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:20,034
- What does it mean?
- It's for making juice.

342
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,405
Oh, it's for juice?

343
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:23,105
Where are you from?

344
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,745
I'm from Hadong, Gyeongsang Province.

345
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,875
That's why you pronounced the word differently.

346
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,515
I didn't understand at first. So it's for juicing.

347
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,844
(Kale for juicing)

348
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,514
- Those are for wraps.
- Yes. Those are for wraps.

349
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,585
(Kale for wraps)

350
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:36,784
(Rinsing)

351
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:39,754
(Cutting)

352
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,354
(Trimming)

353
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:44,295
(Keeping his mouth shut in concentration)

354
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:49,235
(He plans to use kale in various ways...)

355
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:55,975
(to serve a delicious and healthy meal.)

356
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:00,504
(Please look forward to his fresh leafy green dishes.)

357
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,044
Wait. We should bring fish as well.

358
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,045
(The Argentine Base asked for fish.)

359
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,045
It's here.

360
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,785
Halibut. Let's take this.

361
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:10,615
How many do you need?

362
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,885
Three would be enough.

363
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,755
Since we're going, let's bring the seasonings too.

364
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:16,955
Got it.

365
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,864
They might want some soy sauce.

366
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:23,235
We have a lot of it.

367
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:25,404
Sesame oil, which is essential for Korean cuisine.

368
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:28,105
Sesame oil is insanely popular these days.

369
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,444
It's Korea's equivalent of olive oil.

370
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,875
- Please put these on the boat.
- Got it.

371
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,815
(Heading to the Argentine Base with lots of Korean seasonings)

372
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:42,185
(It takes around 40 minutes.)

373
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,725
That ice floe is big.

374
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:47,325
It's incredible.

375
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:50,825
That's magnificent.

376
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,865
(They can see the Argentine Base in the distance.)

377
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:03,034
I wonder what that is.

378
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,505
It's standing there all alone.

379
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:08,215
- It looks amazing.
- It's beautiful.

380
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,474
You can't tell how deep it is.

381
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,545
(What is this that stands tall in the glacier?)

382
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,215
That looks cool.

383
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:17,185
- The 3 Brothers Peak.
- The 3 Brothers Peak.

384
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,325
Really?

385
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,425
(As they get closer to the Argentine Base, )

386
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:29,365
(what are the peaks that greet them first?)

387
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:34,504
Like how we manage ASPA 171,

388
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:36,205
the Penguin Village,

389
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,345
Argentina manages ASPA 132.

390
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,315
Antarctic Specially Protected Area.

391
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:45,415
They manage southern elephant seals.

392
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,085
I want to see them. I've always wanted to see them.

393
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,754
- Are there seals?
- You'll see them when we're closer.

394
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:52,955
- We can?
- Yes.

395
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,995
The whole area from the station along the shoreline...

396
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:57,295
is designated as a protected zone.

397
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:04,635
(The crew sails on with excitement.)

398
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:10,105
I see a few of them over there.

399
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,745
- Are those them?
- Yes.

400
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,014
Those are the seals, right?

401
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,615
Yes, it seems like it.

402
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:18,715
Over there.

403
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:21,114
(Impressed)

404
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,115
What is it?

405
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,255
- Seals.
- Seals.

406
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:30,125
(What are southern elephant seals like in person?)

407
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:33,594
(Nice to meet you.)

408
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:34,595
How cute.

409
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,234
That one sleeping right in front of us, right?

410
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:38,304
(Southern elephant seal)

411
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,365
Look at it looking at us.

412
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:45,205
The male southern elephant seal's nose resembles an elephant's.

413
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:46,675
Nice.

414
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,814
(During breeding season, the male's nose swells up, )

415
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:50,945
(making it look like an elephant's.)

416
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:53,085
It's huge.

417
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:55,055
It really is.

418
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,955
It was much bigger than I imagined.

419
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,454
And kind of cute.

420
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,165
(Female, Male)

421
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,324
(Males are 4 to 6m long and can weigh up to 4t.)

422
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:08,335
It was massive.

423
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,365
I was amazed.

424
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,835
Their bodies are full of fat, keeping them warm.

425
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,635
Even if they don't eat for days,

426
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,944
they can survive on their fat reserves.

427
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:19,945
(The largest marine mammal after whales)

428
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:22,644
It makes a sound through its nose...

429
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:23,975
like an elephant.

430
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,415
That sound shows the male's power.

431
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:32,424
To win a mate, male southern elephant seals fight fiercely.

432
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,795
(A fierce battle between males to win the female)

433
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:46,604
While fighting, male seals show no concern even if females...

434
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:49,204
- or pups get crushed to death.
- Yes.

435
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:50,274
I saw it.

436
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:52,475
(They pay no attention to the crushed or injured.)

437
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:57,314
(Bearing offspring in Antarctica is the species' survival strategy.)

438
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,215
The shore must be their hangout spot.

439
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:01,615
It's not really their habitat.

440
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:06,555
Amazing.

441
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,624
Are seals the main research focus at Argentine Base?

442
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,894
Yes. The Argentine Base...

443
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,135
manages this Antarctic Specially Protected Area.

444
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:19,464
They study the seals'...

445
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:23,305
habitat and ecosystem.

446
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,245
(Key indicators for the conservation of Antarctica's marine ecosystem)

447
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:38,985
(Chef of Antarctica)

448
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:40,885
Over there.

449
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:46,465
How interesting. It has a Western vibe.

450
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,564
The station does, right?

451
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,995
(A different vibe from King Sejong Station)

452
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:54,734
(Argentina Carlini Base)

453
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:57,435
It felt like we had just gone to a silent village.

454
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:01,245
Probably because the buildings...

455
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:06,045
are made of wood, it felt like...

456
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,255
we were...

457
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:12,185
in a fairy-tale hut.

458
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:13,925
I can see the Argentine flag.

459
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:16,225
(Welcome.)

460
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,425
They even put up the Korean flag.

461
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:22,335
(Hi.)

462
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:24,195
- Hello.
- Hello.

463
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:29,734
Incredible.

464
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,505
(The crew welcomes them offshore despite Antarctica's cold.)

465
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:36,515
Let's get off.

466
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,315
Thank you.

467
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,185
Welcome.

468
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:45,454
- Carlina? Carlini?
- Its name is Carlini.

469
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,754
- Carlini.
- Yes.

470
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,354
(Arrived at Argentina Carlini Base)

471
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,194
My name is Victor Jara.

472
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:51,825
(Victor Jara, Base Commander)

473
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:54,295
Our crew members...

474
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,765
were waiting to welcome you.

475
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,134
(Thank you.)

476
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,364
Many people were outside to greet us,

477
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,805
which was heart-warming.

478
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:05,805
Honestly, I get nervous when I go to an unfamiliar place.

479
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,774
But I relaxed when getting off the RIB.

480
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:09,775
I think I did.

481
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:13,245
Hello, my name is Micaela. I'm the doctor here.

482
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:15,314
- You're a doctor.
- Yes.

483
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:16,684
Hi, my name is Soo Hyang.

484
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,055
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

485
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:20,685
Thank you for inviting us.

486
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:22,294
Thank you for inviting us...

487
00:22:22,295 --> 00:22:23,795
- to be here. Thank you.
- It's really an honor.

488
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,965
Me? I'm Jong Hyeop. Just call me Chae.

489
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,734
- Thank you.
- Hello.

490
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:31,034
- Welcome.
- Thank you. My name is Paik.

491
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:33,365
- Paik. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

492
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:36,235
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

493
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:37,835
My name is Paik.

494
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:39,204
- Hello.
- Alex.

495
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:40,245
My name is Paik.

496
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,075
My name is Paik.

497
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,345
I'm SUHO from Korea.

498
00:22:45,785 --> 00:22:46,785
Yes.

499
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,885
I'm a chef of...

500
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:51,854
- Antarctica.
- Okay.

501
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:52,985
(Chef of Antarctica)

502
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,125
Nice to meet you.

503
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:58,125
We came here to cook for you guys.

504
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,124
(We look forward to it.)

505
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,735
- There are many crew members here.
- Yes.

506
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:05,805
How many crew members are there?

507
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,874
We have a total of 29 members.

508
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:12,475
But some are cooking and working right now.

509
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,774
(11 more winter crew members than King Sejong Station)

510
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:18,545
The base is bigger than I expected.

511
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:20,015
It's like a village.

512
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:21,515
I know, right?

513
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,314
(What's Argentina Carlini Base like?)

514
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:27,125
We'll show you around part of our base.

515
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,525
Thank you.

516
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:34,625
(Moving together)

517
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,565
What's that?

518
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:41,465
What is that?

519
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:42,975
It's...

520
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:49,975
(The first mysterious thing that caught their attention)

521
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:52,945
Those are the bones of a whale.

522
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:56,415
I see, so those are whale bones.

523
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:58,724
Whale bones?

524
00:23:58,725 --> 00:23:59,984
(It's whale bones?)

525
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:02,595
Would you like to touch it?

526
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,195
Can we touch it?

527
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:07,294
Really? Then I'm going to touch it.

528
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:09,034
(Whale bones, the symbol of Argentina Carlini Base)

529
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,035
These are real bones.

530
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:14,305
Look at the size. If that's the size of one vertebra...

531
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:17,175
Vertebrae?

532
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:18,845
Interesting.

533
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:21,945
Human vertebrae are this small.

534
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:25,384
With this size...

535
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:26,514
(Huge whale bones)

536
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,545
Amazing.

537
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,715
It's so cool.

538
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:32,685
It's such a big whale.

539
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:37,495
We think it's a humpback whale.

540
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,394
- Humpback?
- Humpback.

541
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,094
- Humpback?
- Humpback whale. It's a species.

542
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,895
- Humpback whale.
- Yes.

543
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,664
(Apex predators that help balance the marine ecosystem)

544
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:51,435
(Humpback whales)

545
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:54,104
Did people hunt whales here in the past?

546
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,015
It was common in the past.

547
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:02,214
(To satisfy people's greed, )

548
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:04,755
(Antarctica once became the center of the whaling industry.)

549
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:11,195
(When whales became an endangered species, )

550
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:16,695
(the Antarctic Ocean was designated as a whale conservation area.)

551
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:22,075
(A symbol highlighting the importance of conserving whales)

552
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:24,634
The altitude of the Three Brothers Peak...

553
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,975
over there is 194m.

554
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:29,614
It's called the Three Brothers Peak because it has three peaks.

555
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:32,044
(The Three Brothers Peak was formed by volcanism.)

556
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:33,115
Cool.

557
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:34,815
It's amazing.

558
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:40,055
It's one of the symbols of the Argentina Carlini Base, right?

559
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:43,695
You can spot the Argentine Base from afar because of that.

560
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,995
You're right. That's serving as our datum point.

561
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:56,135
(The crew climbs the Three Brothers Peak.)

562
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:00,004
(It's an important place for researching...)

563
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:03,015
(the unique geological history of Antarctica.)

564
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,815
You're right. Another datum point is Yamana Nunatak.

565
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,415
That one over there?

566
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:12,384
I was curious about it on our way here on the RIB.

567
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,525
(A sharp peak everyone noticed on the way to the base)

568
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,024
(Another landmark...)

569
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:18,054
(of Argentine Base)

570
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:19,995
Is that snow on top?

571
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,064
Is that all snow?

572
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:25,865
Those are glaciers. It's called the Fourcade Glacier.

573
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,074
Amazing.

574
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:30,075
(A peak rising out of a glacier)

575
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:34,475
(Yamana Nunatak)

576
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:36,775
It's cool.

577
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:42,984
Isn't it pretty? Normally, it'd be dark around the base...

578
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,054
and bright on top,

579
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:48,084
but here, it's the opposite, right?

580
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,125
Exactly.

581
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,295
It was incredible.

582
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,025
The landscape was amazing.

583
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:58,194
(A unique landform where wind keeps the peak free of snow)

584
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:01,104
Because of the wind, the snow doesn't accumulate on top.

585
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:02,535
It's a one-of-a-kind landform.

586
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:06,175
That's really cool.

587
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:09,315
(Even Crew Lee Jin Woong is amazed.)

588
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:13,115
I don't usually feel awe at a landscape, but this one does it.

589
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,515
Can we go there?

590
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,955
It's dangerous now that the glaciers have cracked from melting.

591
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,064
Because of the warmer temperatures,

592
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:29,865
the snow is melting and the glaciers around them are cracking.

593
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:33,365
It's a magnificent sight, but also heartbreaking.

594
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,935
(Two exquisite symbols of Argentine Base...)

595
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,045
(that stand tall as important research markers)

596
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:44,744
I like this base. I mean, your base.

597
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:47,485
- It's a large base.
- Yes.

598
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,784
It feels completely different from our base, doesn't it?

599
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:51,785
Yes.

600
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,624
Each country has its own...

601
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,125
- distinct characteristics.
- Right.

602
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,554
What's that? There's smoke coming out.

603
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,125
Is something being cooked?

604
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,865
I can tell even if they don't say anything. Isn't that the cafeteria?

605
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,635
- We have a brick oven. For Asado.
- A brick oven.

606
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:06,835
Asado?

607
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,975
The smoke looked like the kind you see when grilling meat.

608
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:14,505
Let us treat you to our lunch. How about we go to the cafeteria?

609
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:17,174
Our crew members are probably eating right now.

610
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:18,885
- Let's go.
- Nice.

611
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:20,215
I'm most curious about it.

612
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:22,714
(Crackling)

613
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:23,884
That's the sound of firewood burning.

614
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:24,885
(The sound of firewood burning somewhere)

615
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:26,825
I can smell it.

616
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:30,795
You can smell it, right?

617
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:32,495
I can smell it too.

618
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,565
(What's producing the smell and sound?)

619
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,634
(Smiling brightly)

620
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:37,335
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

621
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:39,305
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

622
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:44,635
(A place that makes their jaws drop as soon as they walk in)

623
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,405
The sight of it made me hungry.

624
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:51,744
When talking about Argentina, meat is a must.

625
00:28:51,745 --> 00:28:54,545
(There's a brick oven for grilling meat even in Antarctica!)

626
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:58,085
(Grilling various kinds of meat over a charcoal fire)

627
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:00,684
(Traditional South American barbecue)

628
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:04,125
(Asado)

629
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:07,824
(Asado is prepared at special events, )

630
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:11,295
(including weddings, funerals, birthdays, and more.)

631
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:16,205
(Argentinians take asado very seriously.)

632
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,075
(And this man, )

633
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:22,445
(responsible for the crew members' meals, )

634
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:26,645
(is Andres Blanco, the Argentine chef.)

635
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,114
(Surprised)

636
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:30,915
Yes, that's what you call asado.

637
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:32,885
Nice.

638
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:36,424
(Asado, keeping it traditional and grilling in a brick oven)

639
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:38,155
This is so cool.

640
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:40,495
It's the real deal. They even have the intestines.

641
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:43,864
Argentina is known for its meat.

642
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,034
(Beef short ribs, beef tripe, blood sausage, beef pancreas, )

643
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,135
(brisket steak, ribeye steak, thinly sliced ribs)

644
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:50,675
(Able to enjoy various parts of meat)

645
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,475
For how many minutes must they be grilled?

646
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:54,704
- It's not minutes.
- Is it hours?

647
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:55,914
The meat is grilled for hours.

648
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:57,845
How long have you been grilling it for?

649
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,215
Two hours.

650
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:05,154
Charcoals are made over here.

651
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,525
It's transferred when used.

652
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,625
The meat is grilled slowly.

653
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:14,994
Look. The meat gets smoky when the fat drips down.

654
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:16,395
(The fat drips off, and a smoky flavor is added.)

655
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:21,304
Nothing other than salt is added...

656
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,175
to the taste of the meat.

657
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:26,704
The meat becomes tender when grilled slowly for a long time.

658
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:27,705
(Grilled slowly to make the meat tender)

659
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,315
It has a great meaty aroma.

660
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:34,944
(The recipe may look simple, but...)

661
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:39,055
Asado takes a long time and requires great effort.

662
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:42,024
The wait makes it even more delicious.

663
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:43,525
(The time and effort put into asado can be felt.)

664
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:45,364
This is interesting.

665
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,325
If only I had one at home.

666
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:49,894
Right?

667
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,135
(But Jong Won...)

668
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:56,035
(At Penguin Village, )

669
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:59,245
(before seeing the cute penguins, )

670
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:03,215
(he just watched.)

671
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:09,015
(Even earlier, in front of the southern elephant seals, )

672
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:13,755
(he was the only one not taking pictures.)

673
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:18,225
(But in front of the asado, )

674
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:20,224
This is the definition...

675
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,764
- of beautiful.
- Beautiful.

676
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:22,765
(he films passionately.)

677
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,795
(Happy)

678
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:27,905
Would you like to try it?

679
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,035
I'd really appreciate that.

680
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,844
(The chef wants them to try...)

681
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:33,845
Right here?

682
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:35,575
(the warm asado on the spot.)

683
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:40,145
(Mouth-watering)

684
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,584
(Cutting)

685
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:43,585
Great.

686
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:44,855
(Looking delicious)

687
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:46,355
It's different from what we eat.

688
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,425
With bread?

689
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:53,295
(It's normally enjoyed with bread.)

690
00:31:54,365 --> 00:31:55,365
Thank you.

691
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:57,894
Give it a smell first.

692
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,304
It smells amazing.

693
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:01,835
(The subtle smokiness tickles the nose.)

694
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,405
Isn't the meaty aroma a killer?

695
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:05,645
And it's not even seasoned.

696
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:10,374
(How's the asado?)

697
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,485
- It's good.
- It has a nice chew to it.

698
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,415
Asado. The smokiness was...

699
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:18,085
The flavor just spread through my mouth.

700
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:19,955
The smoky flavor filled my mouth.

701
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,425
(Savoring it)

702
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,265
It has a nice chew to it, doesn't it?

703
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:29,935
It's hot.

704
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:34,734
(Very satisfied)

705
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,205
(Feeling proud)

706
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:41,744
The inside is juicy, while the outside is crispy.

707
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:43,015
(Crispy outside, juicy inside)

708
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,774
- Rico.
- Thank you.

709
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,514
- What?
- Rico means delicious.

710
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:47,845
- Rico.
- Rico.

711
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:50,554
- Double rico.
- Double rico.

712
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,255
Are we having this for lunch?

713
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,225
- Is this for lunch?
- Yes.

714
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:56,994
We'll go and wait for it. Let's go.

715
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:58,095
Come on. Let's go wait.

716
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:00,664
(Looking forward to the asado even more)

717
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:01,695
Thank you.

718
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:04,065
(And...)

719
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:05,365
It's freezing cold.

720
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:07,404
Made with the winds of Antarctica.

721
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,205
Amazing.

722
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:11,875
It looks delicious. I bet it'll be popular.

723
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:15,845
We started on a happy note.

724
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:19,685
You guys have no sense of responsibility.

725
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:24,885
(What happened to them?)

726
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,155
(In the next episode)

727
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,094
(A meat paradise, )

728
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:32,125
(Argentina)

729
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,195
(I wanted to shock them with bulgogi.)

730
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,365
(Do you want a taste of bulgogi?)

731
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:38,764
(Asado is no big deal.)

732
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:39,765
(Sizzling)

733
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:40,805
(The fire died right away.)

734
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:42,575
(It's not easy at all.)

735
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,745
(Confused by how hard it is to use the oven)

736
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,774
(What Korean desserts are there?)

737
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,775
(We can make...)

738
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,875
(dalgona?)

739
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:50,914
(Crack)

740
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:51,915
(It's broken.)

741
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:54,414
(Making Korean desserts...)

742
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:55,985
(is not as easy as expected.)

743
00:33:56,855 --> 00:33:59,155
(I'm not good with Argentina.)

744
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:03,395
(And...)

745
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:06,125
(What made them emotional?)

746
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,295
(I teared up as well.)

747
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:13,205
(That made it even more touching.)

748
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:18,075
(What happened to them?)
