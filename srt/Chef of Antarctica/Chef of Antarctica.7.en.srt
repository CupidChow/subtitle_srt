00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:10,703
(A task had been assigned to the crew members of Antarctica.)

00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:12,063
(Jam, )

5
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:13,303
(fish, and vegetables)

6
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,102
(Their task was to share ingredients...)

7
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:18,643
(with neighboring stations facing shortages.)

8
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:22,243
(Then they were off to the first neighboring station.)

9
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:25,243
(Where did they arrive after leaving the King Sejong Station?)

10
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,813
(Argentina Carlini Base)

11
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,913
(Their base had a lot more members than the King Sejong Station.)

12
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:32,283
(The Argentine crew gave them a warm welcome.)

13
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:34,153
(Paik)

14
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:35,253
(My name is Paik.)

15
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:37,322
(I am...)

16
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:38,592
(The crew members of Antarctica...)

17
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:40,433
(became utterly excited.)

18
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,633
(Afterward, they got to check out their base's signature features.)

19
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:46,003
(Asado)

20
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:50,773
(The pride-and-joy kitchen of the Argentine Base)

21
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:52,872
(As Argentina is known as the country of the meat, )

22
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,543
(no country is more serious than them when it comes to meat.)

23
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,282
(The Argentine people showed them a traditional dish.)

24
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,182
(A traditional South American barbecue)

25
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,953
(Asado)

26
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,852
(Munching)

27
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,583
(The taste was impossible not to give a thumbs-up.)

28
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:06,823
(The crew members seemed more excited than ever.)

29
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:11,323
(They set out to eat asado.)

30
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,363
(12pm: Lunchtime)

31
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:14,363
- It's very delicious.
- Is it very delicious?

32
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:15,733
- It's very delicious.
- Thank you.

33
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:20,163
(It's time for lunch.)

34
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,473
(Amazed)

35
00:01:25,273 --> 00:01:27,572
(The cafeteria at the Argentine Base)

36
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:28,643
This is...

37
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:32,083
- Hello.
- Hello.

38
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:33,283
Hello.

39
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,713
- Hello. Welcome.
- Thank you.

40
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,552
There's a family vibe here.

41
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:40,692
(The crew members are sitting together for lunch.)

42
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:41,952
There are a lot of people here.

43
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:43,793
(The crew members are sitting together for lunch.)

44
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,893
- This has an antique feel.
- Yes.

45
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:50,633
Look at the photos. They represent their history.

46
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:51,763
Right.

47
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,232
(The history of Argentina Carlini Base fills a wall.)

48
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:57,803
My gosh. This is their history. How fancy.

49
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:58,973
It's amazing.

50
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:01,643
I see. It's over there.

51
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:04,082
- Your station's commander...
- It was a present.

52
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,143
gave that to us as a present when he visited our base.

53
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:07,953
That's nice.

54
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,153
There must be a lot of interaction between two bases.

55
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:18,063
(Asado is served.)

56
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,663
(This looks amazing.)

57
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,603
(The traditional South American barbecue)

58
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:27,273
(Asado)

59
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:31,703
(Place the hot charcoals under the grill.)

60
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:37,983
(Cook the meat for over 2 hours using the gentle heat of the coals.)

61
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:43,553
(The South American barbecue coats the meat in a smoky aroma.)

62
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:46,482
(Only salt is used to season the meat.)

63
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,493
This is crazy.

64
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,323
The meat will taste different here.

65
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:53,732
(The original flavor and aroma stand out in this dish.)

66
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,093
Doesn't it have a really nice meaty smell?

67
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:59,333
(The beef asado, the main dish of their lunch)

68
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:00,833
What's this?

69
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:05,542
It's stir-fried rice...

70
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,143
- I know that word. It's rice.
- and mushrooms.

71
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,312
Meat isn't the only thing he's good at cooking.

72
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,913
(Stir-fried mushroom rice, made with care)

73
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:16,383
(And the chef makes the dough fresh every morning.)

74
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:20,223
(Warm plain bread)

75
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,222
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,393
Thank you so much for having us.

77
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,692
I'm so grateful that we have this chance to taste...

78
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,292
the traditional Argentine dish...

79
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,103
all the way in Antarctica.

80
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,663
- I'm sure we'll enjoy it.
- Right.

81
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:35,473
It's my honor to serve you our food.

82
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,172
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

83
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,273
Thank you.

84
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:46,383
I see. Everyone serves themselves like it's a family-style meal.

85
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:58,223
(The Argentine crew members enjoy asado like any other day.)

86
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,962
(The crew members of Antarctica have a bite of asado too.)

87
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,133
This looks so good.

88
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,243
(Humming in approval)

89
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:23,383
(The flavor of smoky beef coats their mouth.)

90
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:28,023
- What?
- It's good.

91
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,323
So the meat in this dish must be frozen too.

92
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,663
Yes. Everything comes in already wrapped and frozen.

93
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,572
(Like any other station and base, the Argentine Base...)

94
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,843
(also gets their ingredients once a year.)

95
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,012
(The chef enhances the authentic flavor of the meat...)

96
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,012
(without using any special seasoning other than salt.)

97
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:57,583
The flavor all comes from his grilling technique.

98
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:02,223
It doesn't taste gamey at all.

99
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:07,022
This is so good.

100
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,193
(The tender, juicy meat with a smoky aroma)

101
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,463
I'm a meat lover. And this tastes amazing.

102
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:20,372
In Argentina, we usually have it with chimichurri.

103
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,373
Chimichurri.

104
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:22,512
(A classic Argentine herb sauce paired with meat)

105
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,543
The sauce is made with minced...

106
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,313
Very nice.

107
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:29,883
Let me tell you about chimichurri.

108
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:33,683
People in South America put it on top of their asado...

109
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:37,092
and eat them together. It's a type of sauce.

110
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:38,093
(A herb sauce that goes on top of the meat)

111
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:42,032
It was usually made with green vegetables.

112
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,792
- But it's hard to get them here.
- We don't have them here.

113
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:44,803
(Fresh parsley and oregano are the main ingredients.)

114
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,872
Since I don't have fresh vegetables, I only make it with herbs.

115
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:48,903
I add olive oil too.

116
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,943
Olive oil? I see.

117
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:52,802
I see.

118
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:54,612
(A pleasantly sour and aromatic flavor...)

119
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,413
(with dried herbs, vinegar, and olive oil)

120
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:01,953
(How will the asado taste with chimichurri?)

121
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,753
I didn't know about this sauce.

122
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,193
(Munching)

123
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:12,123
(Munching)

124
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:15,533
(Dipping it generously in chimichurri)

125
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,233
(Humming)

126
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:21,003
(Relieved)

127
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,072
The meat already tastes great with salt.

128
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:25,503
But it's even better with chimichurri.

129
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:27,643
It's much tastier with it.

130
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:30,542
When I tasted the beef asado that the chef grilled himself...

131
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:32,713
and chimichurri together,

132
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:34,883
it was much tastier.

133
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,353
The beefy flavor was rich.

134
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,923
The pairing is great.

135
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:42,023
It's much tastier.

136
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,562
I think this would really appeal to the Korean palate.

137
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:48,663
(Chimichurri enhances the flavor of asado.)

138
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:52,763
It's so good, right?

139
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,333
It's great.

140
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,843
(Smiling)

141
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,673
Everything is perfect.

142
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:08,413
Sir, does the entire crew here get to eat this every weekend?

143
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,513
We have this meal every Sunday.

144
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,353
- I'm so jealous.
- I see.

145
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:18,323
At our base, we always gather for a meal.

146
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:23,463
Everyone comes to the cafeteria when it's time for a meal.

147
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:27,532
(Always having a meal with families is part of the Argentine culture.)

148
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,673
That must be why. I got this vibe when I got off.

149
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:32,472
- They look like a family.
- You guys look like a family.

150
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:34,043
- Right.
- But you're not related, right?

151
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:36,643
You guys just bonded over asado, right?

152
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:40,042
Right. We became a family...

153
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,883
while spending time together here in Antarctica.

154
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,083
We must work together to get anything done here.

155
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:52,793
So we've become a good family and colleagues to each other.

156
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,603
We're just making a new family here.

157
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,803
Right. We care about each other a lot.

158
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:09,243
(Taking care of one another even during the meal)

159
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:13,342
(In this isolated environment, )

160
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:16,113
(they rely on each other like a family does.)

161
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,053
(They naturally build a bond that goes beyond being meal buddies.)

162
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:24,823
(They're enjoying their delicious meal...)

163
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:29,193
(in this friendly atmosphere like one big happy family.)

164
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:36,403
(Chef Andres is secretly preparing something.)

165
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:43,243
(What has the chef prepared?)

166
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,312
Is he giving us mate?

167
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:49,853
- Mate.
- Mate.

168
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,153
- This is mate.
- Yes, it's mate.

169
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:56,153
This is a traditional tea from Argentina.

170
00:08:57,623 --> 00:09:03,393
(Argentine people enjoy mate anytime, anywhere.)

171
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,703
(Here!)

172
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,202
(The Argentine crew members chase away the cold with mate...)

173
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:10,973
(while working on their assignment.)

174
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:14,473
(The bitter, yet earthy mate leaves are brewed in the water.)

175
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:20,413
(Mate, a traditional Argentine beverage)

176
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:24,953
(There's also a special way to drink this tea.)

177
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:29,053
When you get the mate, you can keep talking.

178
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:35,763
But you can't touch the straw or let the straw move.

179
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:40,502
(The reason behind not touching the straw)

180
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:43,633
(This rule prevents the leaves from going into the straw.)

181
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,142
(Staring)

182
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,443
Then do we just have to keep watching you drink?

183
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,883
- No.
- No.

184
00:09:56,983 --> 00:10:00,353
(This unexpected question makes them laugh.)

185
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:02,353
No.

186
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,722
So we don't have to mind her and keep on chatting, right?

187
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:07,422
We can steal glances at her.

188
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:10,062
(You can carry on the conversation while drinking mate.)

189
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,503
Yes. It's okay.

190
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:15,673
(Tasting mate just like he was instructed)

191
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:21,372
(What does mate taste like?)

192
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,243
(Curious)

193
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,653
It's bitter.

194
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:33,453
- It's bitter.
- Yes.

195
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,693
Is it supposed to be bitter like this?

196
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,253
- Yes.
- Yes.

197
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:39,963
We enjoy the bitterness of the mate leaves.

198
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,693
But I like the aroma.

199
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,362
(The bitter, leafy aroma and subtle mellow notes...)

200
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:48,632
(blend together and give it a deep flavor.)

201
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,933
My gosh, it's so bitter.

202
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,243
Now, we all have to share it.

203
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,112
(All of us?)

204
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,913
- Are we all using this same straw?
- Yes.

205
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:00,142
(We use the same straw.)

206
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,213
- Yes.
- Yes.

207
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,652
- It goes from mouth to mouth?
- Yes.

208
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:04,683
Oh, my.

209
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:06,553
Exactly. Yes.

210
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:09,923
(Is he freaking out?)

211
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:17,902
(Sharing the tea by drinking from the same straw represents...)

212
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:21,933
(friendship, communication, equality, and respect.)

213
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,603
- That makes us a family then.
- Yes.

214
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,573
(That's right!)

215
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:29,912
I see. Okay.

216
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:32,112
(It's a unique tea culture in Argentina.)

217
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,253
After the cup goes around, do I have to drink it again?

218
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,883
After it gets passed along, I'll have to drink it again?

219
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,723
We are the world.

220
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,623
(A cup of mate creates a global bond.)

221
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:44,893
I guess he's a comedian.

222
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:48,193
- I think he's the chef.
- No.

223
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,963
- He is.
- He is.

224
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:53,463
(There's a controversy over his culinary qualifications.)

225
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,573
I guess he likes to make people laugh.

226
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,673
He's the chef.

227
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:00,273
Do you want to try it?

228
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:02,143
(The Funny Chef of Antarctica)

229
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,042
(He takes the mate Jong Won drank from.)

230
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:05,043
You can do this.

231
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,243
Do you have to root for him on this?

232
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,552
(SUHO takes a sip of mate.)

233
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:11,753
Yes.

234
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:14,922
(How is it?)

235
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:15,923
Look at him.

236
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:21,832
(He's not good with bitter drinks.)

237
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,263
- Yes.
- I feel like I'm being punished.

238
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:27,603
Is it that bitter?

239
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,273
It tastes interesting, doesn't it?

240
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,503
It tastes murky and bitter.

241
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:34,673
(Curious)

242
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:38,413
(The seasoning checker is startled.)

243
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:44,923
It tasted like a mix of super-bitter green tea and herbal tonic.

244
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:47,793
Wait. It's not bad.

245
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:52,263
For me, it tasted toasty.

246
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:53,492
Once I tasted it,

247
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:55,633
I got similar, yet different notes of green tea.

248
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,503
It had a unique and toasty flavor.

249
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:04,303
(They share a cup of mate together.)

250
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:06,502
They were kind enough to share the mate with us.

251
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:08,313
We learned the meaning behind sharing mate.

252
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,873
We had a full-course meal.

253
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:12,343
Living in Antarctica is really challenging.

254
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:16,613
If you don't mind, can I ask you what brought you here?

255
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:22,293
It was a great opportunity for me both professionally and personally.

256
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,963
I knew that this learning experience would be valuable.

257
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:28,962
So I decided to come here...

258
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:32,363
even though I knew it'd be a challenge.

259
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,703
It's like traveling.

260
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,972
Right. This is a valuable experience.

261
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,943
We get this question a lot.

262
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:43,643
If you get a chance to come back, would you come back?

263
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:45,643
- Yes.
- Yes.

264
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,183
- I see.
- Yes.

265
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:48,913
(Impressed)

266
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:50,382
(You guys are amazing.)

267
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:51,483
That's so cool.

268
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:55,022
Some of us have actually been here before.

269
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:56,192
Another base called us,

270
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,923
and some of our crew members got transferred there.

271
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,763
That's a brave decision.

272
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:02,663
Yes.

273
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:03,663
(Grateful)

274
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,533
How about the other crew members?

275
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,633
What made them come here?

276
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,943
He's a diver in the military.

277
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,303
- Diving?
- Yes.

278
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,973
- Diving. Are you divers?
- Yes.

279
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:19,082
- I really like diving.
- Do you?

280
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,983
I was like a teacher.

281
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:22,953
A swimming teacher.

282
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,322
- You were a teacher?
- Yes. A swimming teacher.

283
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,053
(Jong Hyeop used to work as a swimming instructor.)

284
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:29,623
I really like the sea.

285
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:31,562
Would you like to swim?

286
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:35,593
- But it's too cold.
- No?

287
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:38,903
(The water feels cool.)

288
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:43,003
(The warm, friendly meal is over.)

289
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:46,273
I would like to thank you sincerely...

290
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:50,273
for coming to our base on behalf of everyone here.

291
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:53,743
To show our gratitude,

292
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,713
our carpenter prepared a present for you.

293
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,053
It's a sled.

294
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,653
He made it himself.

295
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:06,163
(What's the meaning of this sled?)

296
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:09,492
There's a woodworking shop.

297
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,863
(The only woodworking shop on the island is at their base.)

298
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:13,962
- It's a sled.
- Yes.

299
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,933
(The crew members of Antarctica visited the shop before the meal.)

300
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:19,372
(The carpenter makes this sled for fellow crew members...)

301
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,902
(whose journey in Antarctica has ended.)

302
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:21,972
For his fellow crew members.

303
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:24,683
This is making me want to join Argentina Base.

304
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,883
This is fascinating.

305
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:28,683
This is lovely.

306
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,083
Thank you.

307
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,423
Gosh, only Argentine crew members get this wooden sled.

308
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,763
(The Argentine crew members prepared a surprise present.)

309
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,732
On behalf of our base,

310
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,663
I'm giving this to you from the bottom of my heart.

311
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:47,003
I'm also the oldest member at our base.

312
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:50,533
I've been here the longest in Antarctica as well.

313
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:55,213
I'm giving this to you because it may be my last time here.

314
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,943
Thank you.

315
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,752
(Manager Mario will return to his country...)

316
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,453
(after his last assignment here in Antarctica.)

317
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:09,322
This is the last time he's presenting the sled.

318
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:11,593
My gosh. Oh, my.

319
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,063
This is a meaningful present.

320
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:23,273
(To the veteran manager who's retiring soon from Antarctica)

321
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,202
I'm grateful to be here...

322
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,673
in this honored moment.

323
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,413
- Oh, no. He's crying.
- Yes.

324
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,413
- This is so sad.
- I'm getting emotional too.

325
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,083
It was touching.

326
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,593
It felt like all his years of hard work...

327
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:44,153
and his life were reflected in that moment.

328
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:49,333
Tears welled up in my eyes before I knew it.

329
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:51,903
It was touching.

330
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:56,032
This was his last year in Antarctica.

331
00:16:56,033 --> 00:17:00,003
From what I remember, he was going to retire soon.

332
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,743
So it was even more touching.

333
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:08,583
My gosh, I can't imagine all the work you've done so far.

334
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,652
Thank you.

335
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,023
- I feel how much it meant to him.
- Right.

336
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:16,692
(A precious and valuable present made with love and honor)

337
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,862
Well, this is a small gift.

338
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,163
Argentina is famous for its cattle.

339
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:23,933
Nowadays, this ringing sound represents luck.

340
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,503
We prepared this as a gift for you.

341
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,872
I hope it keeps bringing you luck...

342
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,442
whenever you hear the bell ringing.

343
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,043
(May luck continue on whenever the bell rings.)

344
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:41,553
(Genuinely wishing each other's happiness)

345
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:47,853
(The meal with the warm-hearted Argentine crew)

346
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,053
The Argentine crew was so warm-hearted.

347
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:52,793
I felt so welcomed by them.

348
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:54,393
That was so heartwarming.

349
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:02,703
(Episode 4: Temperature of Flavors)

350
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:04,673
We're going this way.

351
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:06,373
Be careful.

352
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:12,182
(Everyone is carrying a big box and heading somewhere.)

353
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,183
It's slippery.

354
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:19,683
(What are they carrying?)

355
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:22,753
There are always shortages in Antarctica.

356
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,693
One time, we went to the Argentine Base.

357
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,493
- Yes.
- When we visited last time,

358
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:31,092
- they were short on jam and fish.
- Okay.

359
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,102
On top of that, their base doesn't have a greenhouse.

360
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,402
So they didn't have vegetables.

361
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:39,303
It seemed the Argentine crew was struggling with these shortages.

362
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:41,942
(The crew members of Antarctica...)

363
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,673
(brought scarce ingredients as presents.)

364
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:46,343
- It looks like a cold storage.
- Yes.

365
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,883
(The Argentine Base has two food storage units.)

366
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:55,793
(They arrive at the cold storage.)

367
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:58,093
(Amazed)

368
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,122
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

369
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:01,533
(What surprises them at the entrance?)

370
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,762
My gosh. There's so much stuff here.

371
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:07,863
(The storage is filled with mysterious boxes.)

372
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,873
(They're neatly stacked up.)

373
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:13,903
Gosh, it's all meat.

374
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,213
Why do they have so much meat?

375
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:19,743
I went to their cold storage. It was all meat.

376
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,852
A whole pig. A whole lamb.

377
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,782
They had all kinds of meat cuts too.

378
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:26,723
(Excitement shows in his eyebrows.)

379
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:31,323
(Different cuts of meat)

380
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:37,362
My gosh. They have so much meat.

381
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:38,432
(The meat is piled high in storage.)

382
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,503
Argentine people definitely eat a lot of meat.

383
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,132
That's a whole pig.

384
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,543
Gosh, is that the tail?

385
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:47,973
(Whole suckling pigs are kept frozen.)

386
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,683
- Look at this.
- My gosh. Are they all meat?

387
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,213
It must be for asado.

388
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:55,453
This is crazy.

389
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,582
- My gosh.
- Yes, they are whole suckling pigs.

390
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,583
(The face of a suckling pig)

391
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,893
We have different cuts of pork,

392
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,523
lamb, and beef. We also have chicken.

393
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:06,893
Gosh, they have so much meat.

394
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:10,093
We get our ingredients only once a year.

395
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,072
(Due to the nature of Antarctic stations and bases, )

396
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:16,573
(Argentina Carlini Base also receive...)

397
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,373
(their supplies once a year.)

398
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,443
We had fish, but we ran out.

399
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,683
(They're already out of seafood.)

400
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:28,352
Okay.

401
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,652
(Heading to their dry storage)

402
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:33,423
(A dry storage)

403
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,423
These are all for a year too.

404
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:40,722
(Entering the storage with the apple jam...)

405
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,933
(that they brought from King Sejong Station)

406
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:46,603
(Amazed)

407
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,673
(Surprised)

408
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:51,433
(Something takes Crew Paik by surprise.)

409
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,942
It's really well-organized.

410
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:54,973
I know.

411
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:57,613
(What's the reason that shocks everyone?)

412
00:20:58,313 --> 00:20:59,313
(In the dry storage...)

413
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:05,382
Look how perfectly they are lined up and stacked with labels.

414
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,383
This is incredible.

415
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:11,352
(Placed in a single line, all facing front)

416
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,523
Did you see that everything was aligned perfectly?

417
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:17,692
Even losing a bottle of olive oil would raise a big alarm.

418
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,732
It'd be that noticeable.

419
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,503
(The ultimate way of organizing with a product sample attached)

420
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:25,343
(Attaching a sample to help easily see what it is)

421
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:30,343
It's dried onions. How interesting.

422
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:34,953
(When they're heading out, )

423
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:39,683
(they're being led up to the 2nd floor by a crew member.)

424
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:44,123
(What's on the 2nd floor?)

425
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,893
Oh, gosh. This is the best spot.

426
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:48,862
There are alcoholic beverages. It's drinks.

427
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:50,363
(A liquor storage)

428
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,232
It's drinks. Okay.

429
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,433
(Excited)

430
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,973
(Nodding)

431
00:21:57,773 --> 00:21:59,673
- What is that?
- It looks like wine.

432
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,843
(Wine filling up one side of the storage)

433
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,883
(As Argentina is famous for its wine, )

434
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:12,023
(Argentina Base has a separate storage for liquor.)

435
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:14,823
It's a tradition at our base...

436
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:19,923
to have pizza and drinks every Saturday.

437
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,363
I like wine.

438
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:28,333
That was an amazing sight I'll never see anywhere else.

439
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,073
(It's the best!)

440
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:34,403
- All right. Shall we go?
- Yes.

441
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:36,643
Is it time to start cooking?

442
00:22:36,743 --> 00:22:37,942
It's cooking time.

443
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:38,943
(It's their workplace!)

444
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:41,112
(Heading to the kitchen)

445
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:42,353
We need to check out the kitchen.

446
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,122
Is this the kitchen?

447
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:46,552
(The kitchen is right next to the dining area.)

448
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:48,023
The kitchen isn't what I expected.

449
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:50,252
(Peeking)

450
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,923
(How does the kitchen look?)

451
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,163
This kitchen is very clean and has nothing.

452
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:00,733
It was neat and small.

453
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,703
It looked pretty small.

454
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,172
(This small kitchen is the only place to cook.)

455
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:06,773
It's compact,

456
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:10,142
but it's neat and well-kept.

457
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:12,843
(A simple kitchen, unlike the one at King Sejong Station)

458
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,913
(A mixer that's not used for making Korean food)

459
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:17,413
There was nothing in the kitchen.

460
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:22,053
I saw an oven and a stove that looked barely used.

461
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:25,963
(The stove and oven)

462
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:27,592
I didn't see any extra containers,

463
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:30,893
strainers, or bowls I could use to mix ingredients together.

464
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,203
There was hardly anything there.

465
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:35,333
(An empty sink)

466
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:38,873
The kitchen is pretty bare because they mostly just grill meat.

467
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:42,173
Their main recipe is asado.

468
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:47,083
It was specialized for grilling.

469
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,012
They don't seem to do any other kind of cooking.

470
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,552
They mostly make salads and bread.

471
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:52,553
Bread is their staple.

472
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:54,722
(Meat)

473
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:57,453
(Braed)

474
00:23:57,793 --> 00:24:00,123
(That's why they mostly use...)

475
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:02,863
(a brick oven and a standard oven.)

476
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:07,563
(What will the crew members of Antarctica cook?)

477
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:10,232
Have a seat for our meeting.

478
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:11,233
Let's talk about what to cook.

479
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:12,243
(Current time: 4:30pm, menu meeting)

480
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:15,443
This is what I think. Since Argentines...

481
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,413
love meat,

482
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:20,782
how about we try cooking meat...

483
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,253
using a Korean recipe?

484
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,852
(A Korean-style meat dish?)

485
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:28,392
Since I've actually had asado...

486
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:29,653
so many times,

487
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:34,123
when I heard we were visiting the Argentina Base,

488
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,433
I felt like they'd be serving us some asado meat.

489
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:42,573
(Asado, a South American barbecue)

490
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,773
Doesn't it have a really nice meaty smell?

491
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:47,073
It doesn't taste gamey at all.

492
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:49,443
I'm a meat lover. And this tastes amazing.

493
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,812
After having the beef asado,

494
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:56,252
I wanted to surprise them with our bulgogi.

495
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,582
(Bulgogi)

496
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,652
(A signature Korean meat dish...)

497
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:04,393
(of thinly sliced, marinated beef that's cooked on a grill)

498
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:14,362
(A signature dish)

499
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:15,832
I'm curious...

500
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,602
if Argentines will like this.

501
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:18,673
(Korean barbecue)

502
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:22,172
So I'd like to cook bulgogi.

503
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:24,043
Bulgogi tastes great when it's grilled over charcoal.

504
00:25:24,643 --> 00:25:26,743
- Right.
- With that dish on my mind,

505
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:30,382
- I got soy sauce and sesame oil.
- I see.

506
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:31,653
I'm pretty sure they don't have them here.

507
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:35,253
(I had the big picture in mind.)

508
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,463
(Crew Paik planned everything ahead.)

509
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:40,623
(Grabbing soy sauce)

510
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,463
(Grabbing sesame oil)

511
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:46,032
(Taking soy sauce and sesame oil with bulgogi in mind)

512
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,232
It's a Korean grilled meat dish.

513
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:50,973
I thought they'd love it if we made it for them.

514
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:53,543
(It sounds good.)

515
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:56,373
The meat is the most important part. You've already seen it.

516
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,043
If we cut it thick,

517
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,942
we can't serve it until tomorrow evening...

518
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,413
because we need to marinate it overnight.

519
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:07,283
(The key is to slice the meat as thin as possible.)

520
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,853
(The weather changes frequently in Antarctica.)

521
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,593
- We have to be on the boat by 8pm.
- My gosh.

522
00:26:14,963 --> 00:26:17,193
It's 5pm now.

523
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:19,433
If we want to be on that boat no later than 7:30pm...

524
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:22,333
(In 2 hours and 30 minutes, )

525
00:26:22,903 --> 00:26:26,303
(they have to make bulgogi for 30 people.)

526
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:30,843
(The challenge is slicing the rock-hard frozen meat...)

527
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:36,213
(thin enough for bulgogi.)

528
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,252
(Having a headache, staring into space)

529
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,222
To make bulgogi,

530
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:42,952
we need to slice the meat very thin.

531
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:44,823
That's going to be really tough.

532
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:49,163
(Worried)

533
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:52,632
If you want to go back to the station today,

534
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:55,173
we have to slice the meat as thinly as possible.

535
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,173
It's up to you. I don't mind staying the night here.

536
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:01,042
- I'm also fine with staying.
- What?

537
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:02,112
I brought my overnight stuff...

538
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:03,142
- just in case.
- I...

539
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,672
I want to go back as soon as possible.

540
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,843
- We need to hurry because of him.
- Right.

541
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:08,553
What a relief.

542
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:10,952
(Thanks to the most passionate man, they're forced to go back.)

543
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:13,022
I almost dug myself into a hole.

544
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:15,623
The crew at King Sejong Station is waiting for us.

545
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:18,922
They'll starve tomorrow if we don't go back today.

546
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:21,023
- Exactly.
- How come you're so irresponsible?

547
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:25,133
(We'll just laugh.)

548
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,503
Are you ready?

549
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,603
- Yes.
- Yes.

550
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,833
- All right.
- Yes, chef.

551
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:35,173
Chef, I'm leaving my kitchen in your hands.

552
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:41,383
(Crew members of Antarctica are ready.)

553
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,212
- Let's gather in the kitchen.
- Yes.

554
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:44,382
It's cooking time.

555
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:45,723
(They start cooking at 5pm.)

556
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,723
(Jong Won is heading somewhere after getting changed.)

557
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:55,023
Where is it?

558
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,902
Okay. It looks good.

559
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:01,233
(The meat for today's cooking)

560
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:04,172
(Has it already defrosted?)

561
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,242
I heard they took the meat out to defrost...

562
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:09,772
for their weekend asado. I was so happy with that.

563
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,143
(Defrosted meat for the weekend meals)

564
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:15,143
(Beef ribs and sirloin)

565
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:19,853
(The defrosted meat saves them a lot of time.)

566
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:21,253
All right.

567
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:24,393
(Grunting)

568
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,023
I almost hurt my back.

569
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:30,662
Gosh, this is a lot of meat.

570
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:32,103
(While Jong Won and Jong Hyeop are bringing the meat, )

571
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:35,102
(the sous chef is walking into the food storage.)

572
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:36,103
(So is the sous chef of Antarctica.)

573
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:37,133
Is this sugar?

574
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,973
I see. Okay.

575
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:40,772
And I need onions.

576
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,143
(Quickly getting ingredients for bulgogi)

577
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:44,842
(But...)

578
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:45,843
Does it work manually?

579
00:28:45,943 --> 00:28:48,783
Yes, it does. You need to move it by hand.

580
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:53,183
(What are they doing when time is running out?)

581
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,423
- I'm happy with this.
- Right.

582
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:57,322
- We just never had access to this.
- All of them...

583
00:28:57,323 --> 00:28:58,323
We're done here.

584
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,062
You guys can go and hang out.

585
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:01,292
- Can we really go and hang out?
- Yes.

586
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:02,293
(Are they already done?)

587
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:07,133
Chef Andres said he had this machine he cherished, so I went to see it.

588
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:10,033
(A little while ago)

589
00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:12,973
(Chef Andres saw the defrosted meat.)

590
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:15,313
Oh, my gosh.

591
00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:20,143
There's a meat slicer in the back, so feel free to use it.

592
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:21,543
Can I check it out?

593
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,483
Yes! There's a meat slicer.

594
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,483
This will save us so much time.

595
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:29,823
(Chef Andres quickly noticed and offered the meat slicer.)

596
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,263
People use this to slice ham.

597
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,393
Meat slicers are typically big.

598
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:38,392
They automatically slice meat at the press of a button.

599
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:40,662
It even works on frozen meat.

600
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:44,003
Since this slicer is only for ham, we have to operate it manually.

601
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:48,042
Even so, this is much quicker than using a knife.

602
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:51,613
That's the benefit of civilization.

603
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,412
Okay.

604
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:54,843
(Thank you.)

605
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:56,782
(Humming happily)

606
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,682
Who knew he'd have a meat slicer?

607
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:00,322
Once that slicer is working properly on the meat,

608
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:03,623
you have nothing to worry about.

609
00:30:04,753 --> 00:30:09,033
(Will they be able to reduce the time it takes to cut the meat?)

610
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,602
(Trying it right away)

611
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,163
All that matters is how well it slices.

612
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,263
Please.

613
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,973
(Is it working well?)

614
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:30,082
- My gosh.
- Does it work well?

615
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,653
- It's really thin.
- Oh, my.

616
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:33,183
It works.

617
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:39,393
(Let's do it.)

618
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:44,763
(It's slicing the meat surprisingly fast.)

619
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:46,933
Next one.

620
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,473
Let me do it.

621
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:51,973
(SUHO, who's been watching, quickly prepares the meat.)

622
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:54,003
This is great.

623
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:55,543
(Another chunk of meat)

624
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:58,573
Slicing the meat thin was key,

625
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,543
and I was worried about it.

626
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:04,013
But the slicer made our preparation easy.

627
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,282
Is it not ready yet?

628
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:06,682
Yes, it's ready. Are you already done?

629
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:08,223
You guys are getting faster.

630
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,293
It was a relief...

631
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,922
we had the slicer,

632
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:16,732
but honestly, I was a little disappointed...

633
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,233
because I wanted to do it myself.

634
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,933
I wanted to use the knife to cut the meat myself.

635
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:26,643
(Ever since they arrived in Punta Arenas, )

636
00:31:27,143 --> 00:31:29,143
(he's powered through...)

637
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:32,513
(cutting countless ingredients.)

638
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,953
(The most passionate man, SUHO)

639
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:39,152
Argentines cook the meat whole, but we cook ours after slicing it.

640
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:41,423
I wanted to show them the difference.

641
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:42,893
So I was a little disappointed.

642
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:47,593
(Full of disappointment)

643
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:49,732
We need to marinate it first.

644
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,492
(No one notices his disappointment as the pot gets filled with meat.)

645
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,703
It's a lot of meat.

646
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,433
(It's time to marinate the meat.)

647
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,403
(Looking determined)

648
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,303
(While Crew Paik slices the meat, )

649
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:01,942
- Clean it up here.
- Yes.

650
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:05,843
(Soo Hyang is setting out the seasonings.)

651
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:10,283
(He grabs white sugar first.)

652
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:12,553
(Trembling)

653
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:14,283
(Pouring)

654
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,523
(Adding the whole bag)

655
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,222
(Garlic, essential for K-food)

656
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:21,623
(Shaking it out)

657
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,562
(Grabbing the next one)

658
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:26,563
Taste it and see if it's salty.

659
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:31,133
(What is Soo Hyang, the seasoning checker, tasting?)

660
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:34,073
(It's one of the seasonings Soo Hyang received a while ago.)

661
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:37,473
I have soaked onions.

662
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:40,583
I rehydrated the dried onions.

663
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:42,212
- Are they onions?
- Yes.

664
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:44,313
(Soaked onions, a substitute for scallions)

665
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:47,822
(The dried onions she saw...)

666
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:50,793
(in the dry storage before cooking)

667
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:53,462
(There are no greenhouses at the Argentina Base.)

668
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:55,362
We don't have the most important ingredient for bulgogi, scallions.

669
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:56,662
We need that scallion flavor.

670
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:58,663
Onions would do if they had onions.

671
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:02,273
It's not salty.

672
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:03,833
It's sweet.

673
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:08,102
Can you check the fridge for any leftover Sprite?

674
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,113
- Go check.
- Yes.

675
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:14,943
(Soy sauce, the essential seasoning for bulgogi)

676
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,783
(Pouring water to adjust the seasoning concentration)

677
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:20,753
(Adding honey for extra flavor)

678
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:24,293
(Tasting)

679
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:28,162
It already tastes good.

680
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:29,163
(The bulgogi marinade is ready.)

681
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:30,563
(Sighing)

682
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,902
(SUHO is cleaning the slicer.)

683
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:36,072
Chef Andres was kind enough to lend it to us,

684
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:38,773
so we wanted to make sure we gave it back clean.

685
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:40,373
(Scrubbing)

686
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:42,143
(Wiping)

687
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:46,443
We'd have been in big trouble without this slicer.

688
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:51,013
(Cleaning Freak SUHO)

689
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:54,683
(Shining)

690
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:57,052
- Should I just pour it?
- Yes.

691
00:33:57,053 --> 00:33:58,293
(Pouring the marinade over the meat)

692
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:02,263
Hand me the sesame oil.

693
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:04,033
(Adding the sesame oil)

694
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,293
Add it generously.

695
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,762
(Pouring)

696
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,332
(Adding a savory flavor)

697
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:09,333
That's good.

698
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:12,003
(Mixing)

699
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:18,843
(Rolling up his sleeve)

700
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:21,083
(Mixing it up thoroughly)

701
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,082
(The bulgogi is ready to go!)

702
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,253
Once this is grilled over the fire, it will taste awesome.

703
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:27,753
- Yes.
- Everything is great!

704
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:30,523
(While crew members of Antarctica are making bulgogi, )

705
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:35,393
(the Argentine crew is doing their research.)

706
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:42,803
(They're waiting for today's special meal.)

707
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:51,543
(Current time: 5:45pm)

708
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,413
(All that's left is grilling the bulgogi.)

709
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,123
But still. We need the fire to rise from here.

710
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:02,493
(Jong Hyeop is in charge of the brick oven.)

711
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,693
I handled the brick oven.

712
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:10,163
When would I ever have the chance to use a brick oven?

713
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:13,233
So I asked if I could learn how to use it.

714
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:17,472
Then, can I learn how to fire up the brick oven?

715
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:19,043
- Go ahead.
- Can I?

716
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:21,773
(Striding)

717
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:25,743
So I was excited. I was happy at the beginning.

718
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:29,753
(What happened to Fire Jong Hyeop?)

719
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,253
(Coming to the brick oven)

720
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,953
(Watching)

721
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,622
(Lighting the kindling)

722
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:41,262
- This is fire.
- Okay.

723
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:42,633
(Putting it where they light the charcoal)

724
00:35:43,363 --> 00:35:45,232
It's really hot. Be careful.

725
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:46,402
(Adding more firewood)

726
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:49,673
- Is that making the fire hotter?
- Yes.

727
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,072
(As the charcoal burns...)

728
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:54,873
(and gets hot, )

729
00:35:56,013 --> 00:36:00,083
(he just needs to move it over to the grilling area.)

730
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:02,042
The fire went out right away.

731
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,483
(The fire went out right away.)

732
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:07,982
(It's not going as he planned since it's his first time.)

733
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:09,492
The fire went out.

734
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:11,423
(Failing to maintain the fire)

735
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,733
(The new firewood shows up out of nowhere.)

736
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:19,433
The fire went out right away. Where's that?

737
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:24,172
(Crawling)

738
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:25,673
The fire went out.

739
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,343
(The Argentine crew member watching from the back hands it over to him.)

740
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:31,372
Put it into the grill.

741
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:32,483
- Here?
- He said to put it in there.

742
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,342
(Putting in the secret firewood he just got)

743
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:35,343
Thank you.

744
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:39,722
I was told it was okay to make the fire stronger.

745
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:41,083
(Is the fire going to hold up?)

746
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:42,323
Thank you.

747
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:44,953
And...

748
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:47,023
let's get the meat.

749
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:49,092
I'll take the meat.

750
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:50,833
I'll start grilling it.

751
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:53,963
What is it? Oh, my.

752
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,033
The fire is too big. Can I put the meat on this?

753
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:00,342
(When he goes to grab the meat, )

754
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,273
(it flares up.)

755
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,313
(Burning intensely)

756
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:10,583
This is crazy. In this case,

757
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:12,723
do you know what's going to happen?

758
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,283
The meat will burn up the second I put it on.

759
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,993
Okay. First of all...

760
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,623
(Pondering)

761
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:22,392
I thought...

762
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:26,162
using this brick oven would be similar...

763
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,063
to building a campfire.

764
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:31,703
Okay. Can I get this meat...

765
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:35,143
grilled by 6:30pm? Can I manage to do it?

766
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:36,643
Can you do it, Jong Hyeop?

767
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,442
(Asking himself calmly)

768
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,443
Like this.

769
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:42,113
When I'm not sure, let's just go for it.

770
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:44,852
Should I have grilled it sooner?

771
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:46,453
(Pulling himself together and starting to grill the meat)

772
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:49,123
(Continuing to grill the meat while enduring the heat)

773
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,423
It's hot.

774
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:55,163
I wasn't familiar with a brick oven since it was my first time using it.

775
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:56,793
It was tough to control the fire.

776
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:02,332
The fire isn't strong enough. Come on, Jong Hyeop.

777
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,333
(The flame dies down fast.)

778
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,472
(The meat isn't getting cooked.)

779
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:07,473
I'm in trouble.

780
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:09,173
(The meat isn't getting cooked.)

781
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:11,743
(He still has a lot of meat in this pot...)

782
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:15,343
(waiting to be grilled.)

783
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:17,953
See? It isn't getting cooked. The fire is too weak.

784
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:22,023
I still have that much. What time is it now?

785
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:24,823
It's 6pm.

786
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:25,823
(Current time: 6pm)

787
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:27,663
(He has 30 minutes until mealtime.)

788
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:30,333
I might not be able to serve it on time.

789
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:35,203
I was focused on getting it done in time for the crew's mealtime.

790
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,373
(No time to waste)

791
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:41,573
All right. It's not just a single task.

792
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,873
(Adding more firewood)

793
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:48,213
(Putting it in)

794
00:38:51,113 --> 00:38:52,923
(He works best when he shows off his biceps.)

795
00:38:55,323 --> 00:38:57,623
(Diligently adding more charcoal)

796
00:38:57,723 --> 00:38:59,293
Yes. This is what I'm talking about.

797
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:04,893
(The meat is picking up a smoky flavor.)

798
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:06,633
(Breathing out)

799
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:08,103
(Short of breath)

800
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:09,832
It's hot.

801
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,833
(The downside is he's also getting hot.)

802
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:11,933
It's crazy hot in here.

803
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:18,813
(While Jong Hyeop is wrestling with the fire alone...)

804
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:22,713
Jong Hyeop, what can I do to help?

805
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:24,613
- What?
- What can I do?

806
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,652
- SUHO.
- Yes, tell me.

807
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,623
- It's not that I need assistance.
- All right.

808
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:31,253
- I'm just fighting this heat.
- Okay.

809
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:32,522
And the fire keeps dying.

810
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:34,492
I'll need another pair of tongs.

811
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:36,133
(I'll get another pair of tongs.)

812
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:38,663
He's cool, isn't he?

813
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:40,503
"What can I do to help?"

814
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:43,673
He's the best.

815
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:45,803
It's everything about SUHO.

816
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:48,643
The way he talks casually...

817
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:50,143
and he carries himself...

818
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:53,043
- shows what a great person he is.
- That's done, right?

819
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,483
- Put it on here.
- That's it.

820
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:57,913
Is everything ready in the kitchen?

821
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:00,582
- Yes, we need to finish grilling.
- We just need to get the meat done.

822
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,953
- It's this one. Okay.
- Great.

823
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:06,423
(Helping Jong Hyeop the best he can)

824
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,962
I need to prepare a salad.

825
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:09,763
(Angel SUHO is walking away as if it's nothing.)

826
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:11,563
SUHO is the best.

827
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:14,563
SUHO, you're the best.

828
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:18,273
It's cold.

829
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:21,173
(Meanwhile, Crew Paik is outside all alone.)

830
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:22,913
How did you press it?

831
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,072
- Did you press it?
- I did it with my hands.

832
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:26,942
(Soo Hyang also joins them.)

833
00:40:26,943 --> 00:40:29,413
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm using the cold in Antarctica.

834
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:32,113
It's going to be delicious. I bet this will be a hit.
