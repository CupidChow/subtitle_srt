00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,539
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,950
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,780
(Episode 6. Mango and Pickled Radish)

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,950
This is our cafeteria.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,360
All crew members gather here...

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,190
to eat various meals.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,969
(The meeting place of the station)

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,800
(Very spacious)

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,340
(The history of the Uruguayan crew members)

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,079
I definitely see the history here,

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,710
since this base was founded in the 1980s.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,050
I can tell this place has history.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,890
(This is where the crew members spend leisure time.)

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,189
(New crew members recently arrived at Uruguay's station.)

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,860
(Placing the jugs down)

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,300
(All 35 crew members gather here...)

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,970
(to talk and eat.)

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,810
(Every day, )

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,850
(working hard to cook for the large 35-member crew...)

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,120
(are the fun Uruguayan chefs.)

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,859
(Moving to the rhythm)

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,430
(Executive Chef Maximiliano Gomez)

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,929
(They have an assistant chef too.)

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,770
(Assistant Chef Carmen Dassin)

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,470
(To the kitchen where the chefs are)

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,840
Hello.

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

28
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,080
(Welcome.)

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,250
They're preparing lunch.

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,120
He cooks a variety of foods every day.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,959
Out of breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,389
which is the most important, largest meal...

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,530
for Uruguayans?

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,000
(Breakfast and lunch)

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,999
We have lighter dinners.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,510
Mainly fish and salads.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,739
I thought you'd eat a bigger dinner.

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,080
It's the opposite.

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,980
Let's take a look around.

40
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,280
(Let's take a look around.)

41
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,220
Uruguayans eat lots of meat, right?

42
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,890
Of course. We eat a lot of meat.

43
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,889
This must be...

44
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,359
for lunch.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,059
Can we use this later?

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,389
Go ahead.

47
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,560
Oh, we can use this?

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,130
We can use this meat later.

49
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,800
That's great.

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,200
I'll show you this too.

51
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,999
(They have various cooking tools, like blenders and whisks!)

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,539
(Poking his head out)

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,710
They have this too.

54
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,539
That's good.

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,640
(What did Jong Hyeop see?)

56
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,280
(What is this grater?)

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,320
(The grater he used in Punta Arenas while showing off his biceps)

58
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,920
You can use that to julienne things.

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,249
(Looking around)

60
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,590
It's so clean.

61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,960
(What is this machine...)

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,230
(SUHO is looking at?)

63
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,299
(Scrubbing)

64
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,000
(Wiping)

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,530
(The slicing machine he cleaned in Argentina!)

66
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,770
(Shining)

67
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,170
(Impressed)

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,809
(Sliding over)

69
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,110
That's where you wash the dishes?

70
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,880
(Where is this place?)

71
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,079
(The area on the other side of the wall Jong Won saw)

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,249
Would you like to see it?

73
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,250
Yes.

74
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,190
(They follow the chef...)

75
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,060
(into the auxiliary kitchen.)

76
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,800
(Opening it up)

77
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,260
Oh, from here.

78
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,870
(Hello.)

79
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,969
(The window opens up to the cafeteria.)

80
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,970
Hello.

81
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,769
(The next area they'll check out...)

82
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,980
(is the refrigeration room.)

83
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,410
We keep vegetables and beverages in here.

84
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,750
(Pumpkin)

85
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,549
They have lettuce.

86
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,690
Sweet pumpkin.

87
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,889
Garlic.

88
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,329
Okay. Very nice.

89
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,390
(They did a thorough check of the refrigeration room.)

90
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,599
We need to get ready now.

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,729
- Sure.
- Sure.

92
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,470
(We need to get ready now.)

93
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,700
Chef, I give you my kitchen.

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,570
Thank you.

95
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,480
(Chef of Antarctica is ready to go.)

96
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,410
(The crew members enter the kitchen.)

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,719
(Why is he carrying those bundles?)

98
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,189
We need to put these away.

99
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,850
(Why is he carrying those bundles?)

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,889
I'll open them up.

101
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,620
(What's in these wrapping cloths?)

102
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,430
Burdock root.

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,700
Ham.

104
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,129
I'll take everything out.

105
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,330
(Rice, sesame oil, a block of ham, cilantro)

106
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,340
(Frozen pork cutlets, meatball jeon, soy sauce, pork cutlet sauce)

107
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,509
Is that everything?

108
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,340
(The counter is full with Korean ingredients.)

109
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,940
(Why did they bring so many Korean ingredients?)

110
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,979
Before we went to the Uruguay station,

111
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,280
we got some information from Secretary Kwon.

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,080
He said they were in the middle of getting a new crew...

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,220
and that they didn't have many ingredients.

114
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,160
I wanted to serve them Korean food if possible.

115
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,800
(They brought ingredients from King Sejong Station.)

116
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,599
Here it is.

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,269
(Jong Hyeop even packed the rice.)

118
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,170
Let's take this sack of rice.

119
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,539
Wait. Sesame seeds.

120
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,780
(All done gathering the ingredients)

121
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,849
Done. We got everything.

122
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,550
(What will they make with these ingredients?)

123
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,680
(Today's menu is finally revealed.)

124
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,689
Gimbap.

125
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,790
(Gimbap)

126
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,059
I wanted to serve authentic Korean food.

127
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,359
Among various Korean foods, I thought of snack foods,

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
and among snack foods, I thought of gimbap.

129
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
Gimbap is pretty well known,

130
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,460
so I thought we could make gimbap.

131
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,929
(Laver)

132
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,069
It's a dish many foreigners find interesting,

133
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,899
but also something they want to try.

134
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,939
I thought it would be nice to introduce them to gimbap.

135
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,240
(A representative Korean food, gimbap)

136
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,439
As you know,

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,480
there are so many varieties of gimbap.

138
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,949
You can utilize any ingredient...

139
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,949
while not forgetting about the basics.

140
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,790
(The final boss of Korean food)

141
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,659
I was confident.

142
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,890
Our crew members...

143
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,760
did some training in Punta Arenas.

144
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,570
(In Punta Arenas, Chile, before heading to Antarctica)

145
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,640
Let's prepare the gimbap ingredients while the rice cooks.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,910
(Slicing, mincing, stir-frying)

147
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,870
It's most important to make a thin layer.

148
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,209
Nice and thin.

149
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,679
(Spreading)

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,109
(Stacking)

151
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,679
(Rolling)

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,450
(Cutting)

153
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,620
Oh, gimbap...

154
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,950
Gimbap takes so much work.

155
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,619
Oh, I'm exhausted.

156
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,860
(From ingredient prep to rolling gimbap)

157
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,829
I put them through Spartan training.

158
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,290
(They learned and practised Spartan-style.)

159
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,559
(It's time to show off what they've learned.)

160
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,269
In Punta Arenas,

161
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,899
it was hard because the rice was not sticky.

162
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,969
But we took Korean rice to the Uruguay station,

163
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,269
so I think it might be easier.

164
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,039
We practised to prepare...

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,479
even for the worst situations.

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,540
(Practising without the gimbap mat)

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,749
(Pretty good)

168
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,410
I was very confident about making gimbap.

169
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,080
(We've trained so hard for this.)

170
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,989
There are 30 people, right?

171
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,619
How many should we make?

172
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,889
- Three?
- Three?

173
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,959
We need three...

174
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,460
to five for that colourful vibe.

175
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,599
They like meat, right?

176
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,799
If so...

177
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,669
Meat gimbap? Bulgogi gimbap?

178
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,929
They probably have meat, right?

179
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,770
They must have pork or beef.

180
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,900
Yes, let's use something they have.

181
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,210
Meat gimbap.

182
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,740
That's tasty too.

183
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,039
Pork cutlet gimbap.

184
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,879
- Gimbap with something fried.
- Totally.

185
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,309
We have something like that.

186
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,480
Write down pork cutlet gimbap.

187
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,480
(They decided on 4 types of gimbap.)

188
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,049
In a way, gimbap is something...

189
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,860
you can add any ingredient to.

190
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,559
Our main gimbap...

191
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,329
is a traditional gimbap with beef.

192
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,699
Beef gimbap.

193
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,060
(Beef gimbap)

194
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,070
Next, pork cutlet gimbap.

195
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,070
A tuna gimbap with tuna mixed in sauce.

196
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,839
Lastly, crab meat and spring cabbage gimbap.

197
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,770
(Crab meat and spring cabbage gimbap)

198
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,610
(A total of 4 types of gimbap)

199
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,620
- Oh, rice.
- Rice.

200
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,179
They probably don't have a rice cooker either.

201
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,279
An electric rice cooker.

202
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,289
(Gasping)

203
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,620
A rice cooker...

204
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,120
Oh, right.

205
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,789
If we're going to test our luck anyway,

206
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,089
we should take a rice cooker if we can.

207
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,029
The ingredients are important,

208
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,929
- but rice is the most important.
- Yes, rice.

209
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,529
We can't have the rice turn out badly.

210
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,230
I'll take the rice cooker.

211
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,199
I'll tie it to my back with a rope if I have to.

212
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,240
(I must take the rice cooker.)

213
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,070
(With his unbreakable will, )

214
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,510
(he brought the rice cooker to the Uruguay station.)

215
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,850
I'll make some rice first.

216
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,689
(This is the biggest crew they've cooked for yet.)

217
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,290
(Will he be able to make 35 servings of rice?)

218
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,760
(Boldly)

219
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,800
(He now can eyeball it.)

220
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,399
(With his two hands full)

221
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,570
Let's do this.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Here we go.

223
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,880
"The rice cooker cooks the rice,"

224
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,139
"so I should focus on rinsing the rice thoroughly."

225
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,650
I trusted the rice cooker...

226
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,550
and felt confident.

227
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,789
(Rice Jong Hyeop is done cooking the rice.)

228
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,149
Okay. Rice is done.

229
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,120
(Rice Jong Hyeop is done cooking the rice.)

230
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,919
(Meanwhile, Jong Won...)

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,130
(is prepping the beef, the main ingredient.)

232
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,800
(After cutting the beef into thin slices, )

233
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,910
(he pours in some sugar.)

234
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,140
(Add some soy sauce and water.)

235
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,140
What should I do now?

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,150
(Marinated beef, the main ingredient for the beef gimbap, is done.)

237
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,920
(Giving off appetizing sounds and savoury fried-food aromas)

238
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,589
(Pork cutlets, the main ingredient for fritter gimbap, are done.)

239
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,730
Nice.

240
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,300
(The crab meat is here.)

241
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,329
(Finely shredding the crab meat)

242
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,200
(A mountain of crab meat)

243
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,969
Mayonnaise.

244
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,710
(Lots of mayonnaise to add richness to the crab meat)

245
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,680
(Minced garlic, sugar, black pepper)

246
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,279
(The main ingredient for the crab meat and spring cabbage gimbap)

247
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,980
There we go.

248
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,219
(Beef, crab meat, tuna, pork cutlet)

249
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,420
(The main gimbap ingredients are ready to go.)

250
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,819
You're done chopping.

251
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,859
(Ingredient prep is going smoothly.)

252
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
That was fast.

253
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,429
What time is it?

254
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,460
(What time is it?)

255
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,930
It's 4:15pm.

256
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,129
If it's 4:15pm,

257
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,600
we have 2 hours and 45 minutes left.

258
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,740
(Getting some stretches in)

259
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,310
(This is the first time they don't have to rush before dinner.)

260
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,740
Our teamwork was great.

261
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,910
Crew Chae Jong Hyeop...

262
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,380
cleaned up as soon as we finished preparing the gimbap ingredients.

263
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,779
Please wash this.

264
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,880
(While the rest of the crew prepares ingredients, )

265
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,150
(Jong Hyeop is washing the dishes for them.)

266
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,290
- Should I wash it right now?
- Yes, please.

267
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,719
He washed the dishes right away.

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,889
I can't help but adore him.

269
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,990
(I can't help but adore him.)

270
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,630
(Clean)

271
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,230
Jong Hyeop is great at doing the dishes.

272
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,239
(Smiling)

273
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,840
Jong Hyeop is good at making rice too.

274
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,669
Okay. Now,

275
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,240
I need to mix the rice.

276
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,580
(Opening the rice cooker)

277
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,210
Is it done?

278
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,080
I think it's all done.

279
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,250
(Rice Jong Hyeop tastes the rice he made with care.)

280
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,760
(Glancing over)

281
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,729
Oh, no.

282
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,200
(Oh, no...)

283
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,969
(Sighing)

284
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,400
The rice was undercooked.

285
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,870
Quite a lot.

286
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,770
Rice is key to gimbap.

287
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,480
I measured out the right amount of water,

288
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,549
and I even mixed it thoroughly,

289
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,950
but it was still undercooked.

290
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,549
So,

291
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,450
I carefully...

292
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,189
Oh, this will be perfect if I let it sit a bit.

293
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,520
(Starting to put on an act)

294
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,760
I had to fix this right away.

295
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,030
I needed to add some water.

296
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,200
(What?)

297
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,210
(Startled)

298
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,839
But suddenly, the water wouldn't come out.

299
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,210
(Suddenly, the water stopped.)

300
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,710
We're out of water.

301
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,620
(Antarctica is covered in snow and ice, )

302
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,020
(but there are limits on drinking water they can use.)

303
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,860
(At stations in Antarctica, water is precious.)

304
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,900
(Water outages are common.)

305
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,229
Are we out of water?

306
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,399
They're filling up the water now.

307
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,569
(They had a short water outage during their cooking time.)

308
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,840
I guess we used it all up.

309
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,470
I was a bit startled.

310
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,110
I forgot that we were in Antarctica.

311
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,080
There's still no water.

312
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,979
I had to add water to the rice soon.

313
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,320
I was very anxious.

314
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,420
- Is the water running now?
- No.

315
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,689
Do you need water right now?

316
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,960
(Getting more and more anxious)

317
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,990
(Prepping some ingredients while waiting for the water)

318
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
(Beeping)

319
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,570
(What is that sound?)

320
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,040
(What?)

321
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,169
(What startled Jong Hyeop?)

322
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,270
What?

323
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,440
Why did this turn off?

324
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,210
The rice.

325
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,149
- There's something...
- Why did this turn off?

326
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,780
(What?)

327
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,380
Is the wattage too high?

328
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,020
This isn't good.

329
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,090
Oh, no.

330
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,220
There's not enough power.

331
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,060
I was so startled.

332
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,859
In Antarctica, electricity systems are weak,

333
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,530
so they sometimes get sudden power outages too.

334
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,470
It happened to be when I was making rice.

335
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,870
I think that's why the rice was undercooked.

336
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,470
(Eventually, he carefully picks up the rice cooker...)

337
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,909
(and moves it to another spot.)

338
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,809
Be careful.

339
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,040
(He moves the rice cooker to another spot.)

340
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,449
Let's do another cycle.

341
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,980
(He starts another cycle at a different outlet.)

342
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,320
The water is back.

343
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,390
(The water starts flowing at the perfect time.)

344
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,860
At the time, I thought,

345
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,630
"I should add the water..."

346
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,600
"before anyone notices."

347
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,200
(Verifying his target)

348
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,840
(Mission: Cook the undercooked rice.)

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,539
(Passing by without making contact)

350
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,750
(They're busy cooking.)

351
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,520
(He reached his target.)

352
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,449
(Quickly pouring the water...)

353
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,150
(and closing the lid)

354
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,890
(Calmly leaving the scene)

355
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,130
(Hasn't noticed)

356
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,830
I added a little bit of that,

357
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,700
so if I mix it,

358
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,470
it should be good.

359
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,040
(Did something happen?)

360
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,040
(Grabbing the rice paddle)

361
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,950
(Opening the rice cooker again)

362
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,220
(Mixing the rice thoroughly)

363
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,920
It turned out so well.

364
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,390
The rice was so nice and fluffy.

365
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,560
It was the perfect gimbap rice I wanted.

366
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,400
I was so relieved.

367
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,399
If I let it sit on warm mode...

368
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,630
(While the rice sits, )

369
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,269
(they finished preparing all ingredients.)

370
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,370
This is paradise.

371
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,510
Gimbap.

372
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,410
We prepared more than most gimbap restaurants.

373
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,610
Okay. Let's get started.

374
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,509
Let's make one type each.

375
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,519
- Okay.
- Okay.

376
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,950
Who wants to do the basic gimbap?

377
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,350
I'll do it.

378
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,220
- Use bulgogi for the basic gimbap.
- Okay.

379
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,419
Next, you...

380
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
make the tuna gimbap.

381
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,559
- Chilli and tuna.
- Okay.

382
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,630
Okay?

383
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,729
You... I think the crab meat will be too difficult.

384
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,729
The crab meat is difficult, so I can do it.

385
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,969
Sausage or pork cutlet?

386
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,169
I'll try the crab meat.

387
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,200
Look at you.

388
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,039
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay, do the crab meat.

389
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,069
Let's get started.

390
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,279
Someone has to do it, right?

391
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,110
(Pork cutlet gimbap)

392
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,910
You need to prove yourselves with the final result.

393
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,050
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,220
(SUHO gets started first.)

395
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,260
(Roll the rice into a ball.)

396
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,659
(Make a thin layer on the laver.)

397
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,059
This is the most important part.

398
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,589
Spreading the rice out well is the most important.

399
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,060
Spread it out quickly.

400
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,370
(Jong Hyeop and Soo Hyang also start spreading the rice.)

401
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,999
Don't worry too much about the ends sticking out.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,110
We need to let the Uruguayans here...

403
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,909
experience the charm of the gimbap ends.

404
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,209
Right? The ends...

405
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,309
of mom's gimbaps are the best.

406
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,680
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

407
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,150
The ends...

408
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,550
are the tastiest.

409
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,820
(Working hard, SUHO, in charge of the tuna gimbap)

410
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,860
(Tuna)

411
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,460
(Chilli)

412
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,430
(He stacked the ingredients more neatly than expected.)

413
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,630
I'm done stacking everything.

414
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,900
What do I do now?

415
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,300
(Taking a peek)

416
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,370
(Moving it around)

417
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,439
- Soo Hyang.
- Yes?

418
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,510
Do I have to line up the edges?

419
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,739
No, you don't have to.

420
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,950
- I don't?
- No.

421
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,950
Is this too big?

422
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,980
(What?)

423
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,520
(A tragedy)

424
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,030
(What now?)

425
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,360
I think it's going to burst.

426
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,570
- What?
- I think it's going to burst.

427
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,070
Why are you so greedy?

428
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,800
- I added too much.
- Hey.

429
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,640
This was a failure on using the appropriate amount.

430
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,740
(While these two struggle, )

431
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,380
(how is Jong Won, an experienced gimbap maker, doing?)

432
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,719
(A thin layer of rice)

433
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,690
(A neat stack of base ingredients)

434
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,420
(Making a roll in a flash)

435
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,130
(A fat sausage)

436
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,800
(Even adding some egg garnish)

437
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,600
(Making another roll in a flash)

438
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,340
(He's made 6 rolls so far.)

439
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,040
(He can make any type of gimbap.)

440
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,480
(This looks good, right?)

441
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,410
Should I put it back here with the others?

442
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,349
- Yes.
- Hold on.

443
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,680
Is that your first one?

444
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,120
Everyone is on their first one.

445
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,389
- I made all of this.
- What?

446
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,660
I made all of this.

447
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,659
What?

448
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,790
Is this an individual competition?

449
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,289
- No.
- Of course, it is!

450
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,700
Why would we do it together?

451
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,630
It was an individual competition.

452
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,230
- Really?
- Yes.

453
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,799
Hey, the person who makes the least...

454
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,910
should buy dinner in Punta Arenas.

455
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,869
(Jong Won's sudden proposal)

456
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,009
Shouldn't you give us...

457
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,809
a bit of a handicap, then?

458
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,140
Then I...

459
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,750
Minus 20 rolls.

460
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,119
That's too much. I'll do minus ten rolls.

461
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,720
That's enough, right?

462
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,520
Oh, ten rolls?

463
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,990
That seems okay.

464
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,959
Loser buys dinner?

465
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,120
Loser buys dinner.

466
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,959
Tuna gimbap needs to be in first place.

467
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,560
(Full of competitive spirit)

468
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,530
(Looking around)

469
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,199
Where should I put it?

470
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,970
I have no place to put it.

471
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,340
What was that?

472
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,699
A plate.

473
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,009
A place to put it.

474
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,440
(Soo Hyang looks around for a plate to hold the gimbap.)

475
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,810
There's nothing I can do. This is an individual competition.

476
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,680
(Bursting into laughter)

477
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,209
You're so mean.

478
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,210
(There's no sympathy in the world of competitions.)

479
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,550
(Meanwhile, Jong Hyeop)

480
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,089
Let's make a pretty roll.

481
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,589
(Let's make a pretty roll.)

482
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,060
(Pressing)

483
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,560
(He successfully rolled it without it bursting.)

484
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,130
Nice.

485
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,029
They said failure was the mother of success.

486
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,100
Excuse me.

487
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,010
(Jong Hyeop seems to have gotten the hang of it.)

488
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,910
(He already made 5 rolls.)

489
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,140
- You're fast, Hyeop-sama.
- No, I'm not.

490
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,250
No, you're fast, Hyeop-sama.

491
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,020
Jong Hyeop is quietly strong.

492
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,190
Seriously.

493
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,719
I have a long way to go.

494
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,960
(Who will get 1st place in the gimbap-making competition?)

495
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,790
(Glancing over)

496
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,029
Honestly, I assumed...

497
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,860
Crew Soo Hyang was in last place.

498
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,540
I'm losing.

499
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,240
I realised that I was in last place.

500
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,940
Where's the rice?

501
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,379
- The rice is here.
- The location of the rice...

502
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,509
Give me back one roll...

503
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,079
for mixing the rice.

504
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,779
- But the location of the rice...
- We can't.

505
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,420
Then you should mix the rice.

506
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,319
You already mixed it all.

507
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,419
I'll mix the next batch.

508
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,059
You should give me an advantage to thank me for mixing the rice.

509
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,819
I'll mix the next batch.

510
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,959
I already mixed it all.

511
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,060
(I've said everything I wanted to say.)

512
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,600
This isn't even serious,

513
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,160
but I suddenly feel so rushed.

514
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,399
You're already winning.

515
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,300
- Soo Hyang and I...
- It's between...

516
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,270
me and SUHO.

517
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,210
Not at all.

518
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,780
I'm working like crazy, but I still don't even have ten.

519
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,980
(The Uruguayan crew members finished up their days...)

520
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,890
(and are heading back for their special dinner.)

521
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,059
It's almost 7pm, so we need to set the table.

522
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,119
Go and start, then.

523
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,460
- I'll go and set things up.
- Okay.

524
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,130
Tell us how many you made.

525
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,430
I made...

526
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,470
- Fifteen?
- Right now...

527
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,399
Two, four,

528
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,899
six, seven, eight...

529
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,239
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen...

530
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,669
- I made 19.
- Nineteen?

531
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,369
- Yes.
- Jong Hyeop will win, then.

532
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,879
- I made 19.
- Nineteen?

533
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,540
- Yes.
- Jong Hyeop will win, then.

534
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,880
I'll go and set things up.

535
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,550
- How did he make 19?
- Jong Hyeop made 19.

536
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,890
How is Jong Hyeop so fast?

537
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,420
Did he make the rice thick?

538
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,189
It's because he's close to the rice.

539
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,559
We're far from the rice.

540
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,690
(We're far from the rice.)

541
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,860
All done.

542
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,699
How many did you make?

543
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,970
Exactly 30.

544
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,840
I finished with ten.

545
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,270
(She made 10.)

546
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,070
What?

547
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,540
What?

548
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,780
(SUHO is in last place.)

549
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,180
I think that's enough. We're done, guys.

550
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,880
- That's it.
- Got it.

551
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,320
(Gimbap made by SUHO)

552
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,890
See how neat the ingredients are.

553
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,629
Burdock root was cut into uniform strips,

554
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,229
and the carrots were neatly sliced too.

555
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,660
That's why it took longer.

556
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,270
Aren't my slices the prettiest?

557
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm satisfied with that.

558
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,310
(The awaited dinner service)

559
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,019
(Will the meal be served successfully...)

560
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,480
(at the Uruguay Base as well?)

561
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,320
(Let's go eat!)

562
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,790
They're entering.

563
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,889
(Scanning the menu 1)

564
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,029
(Scanning the menu 2)

565
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,399
(What's on the menu?)

566
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,630
(I'm just as curious.)

567
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,870
(We should hurry.)

568
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:59,240
(One by one, they take their seats, their hearts full of excitement.)

569
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,580
The tables are pretty.

570
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,080
Tell me about it.

571
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,220
Thank you.

572
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

573
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,789
- We can serve the food now.
- Okay.

574
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,959
(Jong Hyeop enters.)

575
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,390
(Gimbap, the main dish, is served!)

576
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,599
You can share this with each other.

577
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,159
Here you go. Thank you.

578
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,270
(They fill the table as they serve the food in harmony.)

579
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,039
(Every table is served.)

580
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,839
I think that's everything. Okay.

581
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,970
(Every table is served.)

582
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,509
I'm taking photos of the food.

583
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,910
(I'm taking photos of the food.)

584
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,920
(Everyone starts taking photos of the unique food.)

585
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,790
This looks really good.

586
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,689
I should take some photos too.

587
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,089
When will we get to experience this again?

588
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,490
Exactly.

589
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,290
(The crew members enjoy a fun moment of taking photos.)

590
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,260
Hello.

591
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,959
(Crew Paik steps out to greet everyone before they eat.)

592
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,570
Hello.

593
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,069
(He immediately grabs their attention.)

594
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,300
Hello.

595
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,200
(It's nice to meet you!)

596
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,409
We came to Antarctica...

597
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,340
to provide comfort and support...

598
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,150
to the crew members who are stationed here for research.

599
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,649
What you see in front of you right now...

600
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,859
is one of the most beloved dishes in Korea.

601
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,260
Students often eat it while they're busy studying,

602
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,599
and office workers enjoy it...

603
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,159
when they need a quick meal.

604
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,970
It's called gimbap.

605
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,869
Since we were children,

606
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,639
gimbap has been one of the dishes our moms made for picnics,

607
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,050
and it brings us a sense of comfort.

608
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,049
Here's what you might find amusing.

609
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,449
You'll see a piece that looks uneven.

610
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,520
Those are the ends of the gimbap roll,

611
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,890
and they're the ones we always fight over.

612
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,259
The highest-ranking crew member...

613
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,689
should snag that as quickly as possible.

614
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,530
(Snag that as quickly as possible.)

615
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,089
That's yours, Boss.

616
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,930
(Chuckling)

617
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,529
It goes to the highest-ranking crew member.

618
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,630
(It goes to the highest-ranking crew member.)

619
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,300
(The ends are mine.)

620
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:12,680
(The ends of the gimbap rolls lightened the mood.)

621
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,979
We have a tradition of making gimbap at home...

622
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,549
and sharing it pot luck style,

623
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,479
so they're served on one plate.

624
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,889
Try finding the joy in sharing.

625
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,790
(4 types of gimbap on one plate to make it feel like a picnic)

626
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,189
The soup we made...

627
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,389
is one of Koreans' favourite hangover soups...

628
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,729
for the day after drinking.

629
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,030
It's dried pollack soup,

630
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,200
which is made by boiling...

631
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,970
dried pollack for hours.

632
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,070
(A mouthful of it will instantly warm up your body.)

633
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,769
It's the most popular dish among drinkers.

634
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,980
(On the side: dried pollack soup)

635
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,450
(Perfect with gimbap!)

636
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,979
We made plenty of gimbap rolls,

637
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,379
and we'll keep cutting and serving them,

638
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,289
so take your time and enjoy.

639
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,590
There's much more than this.

640
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,759
I just hope...

641
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,560
the two countries can maintain their good relationship. Thank you.

642
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,259
(Hoping for a strong relationship to continue...)

643
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,600
(between Korea and Uruguay)

644
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,360
(We hope to get along as well.)

645
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,630
(Enjoy!)

646
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,439
We simply wanted them...

647
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,909
to enjoy the food we made with love.

648
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,640
(Simply wanting them to enjoy the food made with love)

649
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,610
(What does the crew think of the dish made with love?)

650
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,549
I'll try the soup first.

651
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,580
(Curious)

652
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,279
Soup first.

653
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,550
(Soup first!)

654
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,990
(What does the soup prepared by the chefs taste like?)

655
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,720
It's dried pollack soup.

656
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,659
There aren't many countries that eat dried fish,

657
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,659
let alone dried pollack.

658
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,570
(Will it please their palate?)

659
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,540
I'll try it.

660
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,640
(A truthful frown)

661
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,509
It's really good.

662
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,150
It's like the broth that comes out when cooking seafood.

663
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,820
(Please try it.)

664
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,220
(Is it that good?)

665
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,830
It's really good.

666
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,459
It's been seasoned...

667
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,690
to perfection.

668
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,159
Is this a hangover soup?

669
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,229
(That's right.)

670
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,669
I might grow to enjoy hangovers.

671
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,670
(Don't you agree?)

672
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,270
Isn't the soup amazing?

673
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,339
I don't know what gives it that flavour.

674
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,910
It's fish.

675
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,479
(The crew members are curious about what's in the tasty soup.)

676
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,710
The soup's good.

677
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,650
It tastes like octopus.

678
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:36,620
(Octopus?)

679
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,420
(Fresh, plump pollack...)

680
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,230
(is dried for a long time, then used in the soup.)

681
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,900
I taste garlic too.

682
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,400
(The secret to the dried pollack soup)

683
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,370
It helps get rid of the fishy taste...

684
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,210
and deepens the flavour of the broth.

685
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,209
You don't particularly like fish.

686
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,210
I don't care much for fish.

687
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,320
(Even the crew member who doesn't like fish...)

688
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,950
(kept eating the soup for a while...)

689
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,160
To be honest...

690
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,420
Surprising, isn't it?

691
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,360
It's not the fishy taste I expected.

692
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,429
(I told you it was good.)

693
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,030
(I learned something today.)

694
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,429
(They fall in love with dried pollack soup, )

695
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,100
(with flavours that are hard to resist.)

696
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,070
How's the soup?

697
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,070
- Was it good?
- It's good.

698
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,240
Thank you.

699
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,580
(Crew Paik, who had been watching)

700
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,879
Okay.

701
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,950
(Okay)

702
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,279
All right.

703
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,820
(Pleased, he returns to the gimbap factory.)

704
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
I'm going to try the gimbap now.

705
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,589
Since I'm the oldest,

706
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,959
I'll take the end piece.

707
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,359
(I'll take the end piece.)

708
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,829
(Grabbing the ends, the most popular pieces)

709
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,859
- That...
- I should have this.

710
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,259
(Grabbing the ends, the most popular pieces)

711
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,970
I'm the oldest, so I hope it's all right.

712
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,539
Do you want the end piece?

713
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
(I'm still on the younger side.)

714
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:04,240
Then I'll have the end piece.

715
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,739
Please enjoy.

716
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,880
(Please enjoy.)

717
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,850
I was pretty worried while making the gimbap.

718
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,190
Foreigners usually have different tastes from ours.

719
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,519
I served the food hoping they'd like it.

720
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,190
(Will the gimbap capture their taste buds?)

721
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
(Is it good?)

722
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,699
(Flavours that make you hum)

723
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,140
The rice tastes great.

724
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,440
The white rice is delicious.

725
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,240
Have you tried it?

726
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,850
(Who cooked the rice?)

727
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,619
(That would be me, Rice Jong Hyeop.)

728
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,090
You're welcome.

729
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,819
(Eyes widen.)

730
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,830
(The gimbap keeps getting signs of approval.)

731
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,830
(As if it needs any words.)

732
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,630
Aren't these different?

733
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,900
I think so.

734
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,200
This one's different. I should try this one too.

735
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,379
(Gimbap with different fillings)

736
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,180
(Observing)

737
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,980
I think there's meat in this.

738
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,619
How many different types are there?

739
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,050
(How many different types are there?)

740
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,089
(Prepared fillings: pork cutlet, )

741
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,389
(crab meat and spring cabbage, beef, tuna)

742
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,330
(Deep-fried, stir-fried, and mixed)

743
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,499
We prepared more fillings than a typical gimbap place.

744
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,100
(They prepared more fillings than a typical gimbap place.)

745
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,429
(4 types of gimbap)

746
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,369
We wanted them to enjoy the flavours of Korea...

747
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,069
and experience our culture.

748
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,009
That's why we made gimbap with those certain ingredients.

749
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,339
(4 types of gimbap)

750
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,479
Have you tried the one...

751
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,010
- with pork cutlet?
- No, not yet.

752
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,909
Try it. It's absolutely delicious.

753
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,150
It's really good.

754
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,650
(That's because I made them.)

755
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,250
I just love them all.

756
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,360
Still, tuna's my favourite.

757
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,960
(That's because I made the tuna gimbap.)

758
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,060
The tuna gimbap is the best.

759
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,170
(Her favourite is crab meat.)

760
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,970
I like what's in the gimbap.

761
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,439
The fruit.

762
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,710
There's fruit in the gimbap.

763
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,240
There's mango.

764
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,210
- There's mango in it.
- Mango.

765
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,580
(Mango in gimbap?)

766
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,580
They mistook the pickled radish for mango...

767
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,920
because they're both yellow.

768
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,519
(Since they weren't familiar with pickled radish, )

769
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,260
(they thought it was mango!)

770
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,130
(It's sweet, and I love it.)

771
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,670
(It's not mango, but pickled radish is just as sweet.)

772
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,400
Is everything okay?

773
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,140
(Crew Soo Hyang wanted to know if they were enjoying the food.)

774
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,610
It's great.

775
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,640
- It's okay?
- How is it? Is it okay?

776
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,479
- It's good.
- Is it good?

777
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,680
- It tastes really good.
- It's good.

778
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,680
Which one is your favourite?

779
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,249
(Pondering)

780
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,450
All of them.

781
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,220
I like all of them.

782
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,560
- I like all of them.
- You can't choose?

783
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,629
The soup, actually.

784
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,030
(If I must choose, it's the soup.)

785
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,370
I see.

786
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,500
Are you...

787
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,499
a drinker?

788
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,740
(A drinker?)

789
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,470
I guess so.

790
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,109
(The soup's great for hangovers.)

791
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,750
(Busted)

792
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,549
I'll have the soup first,

793
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,820
and then go drinking.

794
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,219
It's good for hangovers.

795
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,390
I know.

796
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,190
(The dried pollack soup is the favourite among drinkers.)

797
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,019
Is it okay?

798
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,130
(She checks on the other tables too.)

799
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,500
(They've already cleared their plate.)

800
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,699
I see you're finished.

801
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,970
Do you want more?

802
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,070
Do you want more? We have it.

803
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,610
Do you want more?

804
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,469
Do you want more? We have it.

805
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,569
- Yes.
- Yes, please.

806
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,349
(An explosive reaction)

807
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,550
Sure.

808
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,520
(Scrambling)

809
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,319
I don't think anyone is full yet.

810
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,489
- What?
- Really?

811
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,790
They went wild when I asked if they wanted more.

812
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,229
Really? I didn't serve a lot to begin with...

813
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,530
because I heard they ate lighter dinners.

814
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,860
Here you go. This is tuna gimbap.

815
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,970
(Please enjoy.)

816
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Enough?

817
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,640
Here's some more.

818
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,440
Thank you so much.

819
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,310
Enjoy.

820
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,549
They'd be able to eat more comfortably...

821
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,810
if we served them two plates to share.

822
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,419
(The crew keeps on eating.)

823
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,490
(The crew keeps on eating.)

824
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,390
(The second plate is also being polished off)

825
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,460
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen)

826
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,970
Is it time to serve dessert?

827
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,169
Do we have some small dessert plates ready?

828
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,940
(Dessert?)

829
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,580
(While everyone was preparing the gimbap fillings, )

830
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,739
(passionate man SUHO was focused on something else.)

831
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,080
(Why is he scooping out the inside of a pumpkin?)

832
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,390
(Lost in a pile of pumpkins)

833
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,060
(After removing the seeds, he passes them to Jong Won.)

834
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,159
I wonder if they've had enough.

835
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,799
(Why are they suddenly prepping pumpkins?)

836
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,870
What I found amusing at the Uruguay Base...

837
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,170
was the dessert.

838
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,669
It's sweet.

839
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,870
Very sweet.

840
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,609
(At the food storehouse before prepping dinner)

841
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,809
This is sugar.

842
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,040
There's a lot of sugar.

843
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,709
(He finds sugar stacked on one side of the storehouse.)

844
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,909
Is this also sugar?

845
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,609
(From here to here)

846
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,280
I didn't know Uruguayans had a sweet tooth.

847
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,450
(Here)

848
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,959
(This is all sugar.)

849
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,420
(What's in the storehouse suited Crew Paik's taste.)

850
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,459
Uruguayans must have a sweet tooth.

851
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,660
Yes, we do.

852
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,670
(He can't hide his smile.)

853
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:09,610
(Desserts in Uruguay take sweetness to an extreme level.)

854
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,080
(The Uruguayan crew also enjoys dessert after meals.)

855
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,979
That looks good.

856
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,010
(What they had as a welcome dessert)

857
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,250
(The traditional Uruguayan cake, chaja)

858
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,120
(He tries a big bite of it.)

859
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,160
- Gosh, it's sweet.
- It's incredibly sweet.

860
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,760
We have something in common.

861
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:35,300
(They have a lot of ingredients that add sweetness.)

862
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,770
As you know, I'm confident when it comes to sweet food.

863
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,300
Since they have a sweet tooth,

864
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,909
I should try making a dessert.

865
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,470
Originally, I wasn't planning to make one.

866
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,450
However, after seeing what was in the food storehouse...

867
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,779
(He stepped inside the pantry to get more ingredients.)

868
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,579
(That's when he saw them.)

869
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,189
They had pumpkins.

870
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,550
Something similar to sweet pumpkins.

871
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,960
(He took them the second he saw them.)

872
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,760
That's something I love using to make desserts,

873
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,059
so I figured I should make one.

874
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,260
(Let's make a sweet pumpkin dessert!)

875
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,530
(That's how they challenged themselves to make a dessert.)

876
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,670
- Should I take over? Okay.
- Like this.

877
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,839
That's a lot easier, right?

878
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,210
Just don't break them.

879
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,680
(Noted)

880
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,109
The pumpkin...

881
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,650
(SUHO took over prepping the pumpkin.)

882
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,779
(Focusing on peeling the sweet pumpkin...)

883
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,819
(while groaning in pain)

884
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,280
This is the fastest that I can go.

885
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,889
(Digging out the seeds)

886
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,489
(Slicing)

887
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,559
I need to get over this hump.

888
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,090
(Peeling)

889
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,589
I'm dealing with a pumpkin nightmare today.

890
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,330
(A pumpkin nightmare)

891
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,629
(Checking in on his work)

892
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,799
Should I cut these in half like so?

893
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,100
Those are too thin.

894
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,530
What? You sliced these.

895
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,310
Why are you blaming me?

896
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,339
(SUHO finds it hilarious.)

897
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,180
He looked so cute from behind.

898
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,280
(Even after that, he stayed trapped in a pumpkin nightmare.)

899
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,089
Your specialty is struggling with one long task.

900
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,490
(He's adorable.)

901
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,590
Did you call it my specialty?

902
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,060
(Laughing)

903
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,460
(He utilizes his talent to fill the pot.)

904
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,830
(Finally, the sweet pumpkin is passed along.)

905
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,930
(A pot full of sweet pumpkins)

906
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,740
Look at how much sugar I'm going to add.

907
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,310
(All eyes are on Paik.)

908
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,310
(Pouring)

909
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,249
I'll make it sweeter than the cake we had.

910
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,050
(Jaws dropping)

911
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,849
(He emptied a packet.)

912
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,090
Are you making pumpkin tanghulu?

913
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,119
You'll see later on,

914
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,090
but you won't think it's that sweet.

915
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,360
I should add some water.

916
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,000
(4 tablespoons of honey)

917
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,069
Does cinnamon powder go in it too?

918
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,500
(Two pinches of cinnamon powder)

919
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,440
(Boiling for 15 minutes)

920
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,050
(Simmering)

921
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,310
Take it outside and cool it down.

922
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,050
Make use of Antarctica's resources.

923
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,489
(SUHO heads outside to cool the sweet pumpkin.)

924
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,590
(Where would be a decent spot?)

925
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,130
(Packing snow around it)

926
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,799
(He's now used to Antarctica...)

927
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,900
(and can easily touch snow with his bare hands.)

928
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,639
It should be at an angle where it can be seen easily.

929
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
(Checking the angle)

930
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,609
It looks so good that I should take a photo.

931
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,480
(Taking a photo)

932
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,780
(A photo of candied sweet pumpkin taken by SUHO)

933
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,420
(He returns to the kitchen.)

934
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,860
Check outside.

935
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,060
The pumpkin?

936
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,160
Nice. Great job.

937
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,959
- Sorry?
- Good job.

938
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,499
(He made use of what Antarctica has to offer.)

939
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,899
Making a pumpkin dessert was the best idea.

940
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,730
(I'll be outside chilling.)

941
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,569
Do we have some small dessert plates ready?

942
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,169
You need to plate the dessert.

943
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,269
(Is that so?)

944
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,909
Okay, let's go back to the dessert.

945
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,040
Switch to dessert mode.

946
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,050
(Glistening sweet pumpkin cooled by the Antarctic wind)

947
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,850
Here.

948
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:15,580
Place one on each plate.

949
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,290
Place it in the middle.

950
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,320
(They immediately get to work!)

951
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,059
(SUHO and Jong Hyeop place...)

952
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,760
(the candied sweet pumpkin on the plate.)

953
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:35,670
(Jong Won brings the whipped cream from the fridge.)

954
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,640
(Scraping)

955
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,609
(After shaping the cream with spoons, )

956
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,779
(he sets it on top.)

957
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,380
- Isn't this pretty?
- It is.

958
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,550
This looks like an iceberg. I mean, a snowy mountain.

959
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,890
You're right.

960
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,260
(Dessert of the day, candied sweet pumpkin)

961
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,229
Would you like to try one?

962
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,329
Yes.

963
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,400
Go ahead.

964
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,869
You should, since you have to treat us to dinner.

965
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,599
(You should, since you have to treat us to dinner.)

966
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,810
(He came in last in the gimbap rolling contest.)

967
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,269
As for me...

968
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,240
(The back of a loser)

969
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,880
No, it'll be my treat.

970
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,580
But in return, I'll have something delicious.

971
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,920
(He eats the candied sweet pumpkin while feeling bitter.)

972
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,919
(My gosh)

973
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,250
- Is it a work of art?
- This is insane.

974
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,020
Are you good with buying us dinner now?

975
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,760
I should. No way.

976
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,329
This is crazy.

977
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,430
(Dinner will gladly be on me.)

978
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,629
Here comes the dessert.

979
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,430
(Dessert worth buying dinner for is almost ready.)

980
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,829
(Taking it to the window for easier service)

981
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,899
Soo Hyang?

982
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,439
- I'll serve these.
- Sure.

983
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,640
(It's time for dessert!)

984
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,709
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

985
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,870
Do you want dessert?

986
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,640
(Of course!)

987
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

988
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,690
(What does the Uruguayan crew think of the candied sweet pumpkin?)

989
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,830
Let's try the dessert now.

990
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,459
(She takes a bite first.)

991
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,929
(My gosh...)

992
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,000
Is it that good?

993
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,129
(Sugary sweet pumpkin...)

994
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,500
(with whipped cream)

995
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,070
(Yummy)

996
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,940
(This is also good.)

997
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,849
(It's really good.)

998
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,949
(I love that it's sweet.)

999
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,049
Tell me about it.

1000
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,959
The soft cream goes well with the sweet pumpkin.

1001
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,790
(The soft cream goes well with the sweet pumpkin.)

1002
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,030
Soft,

1003
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:41,060
with a little honey and cinnamon.

1004
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,099
It tastes premium.

1005
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,830
(It tastes premium.)

1006
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,269
Braised sweet pumpkin pairs well...

1007
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,670
with whipped cream.

1008
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,509
That was the highlight of the meal.

1009
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,709
They loved it.

1010
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,410
(It's really good.)

1011
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,979
I can't possibly have any more.

1012
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,720
Look at her leaning back.

1013
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,090
(Gosh, I'm so full.)

1014
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,490
Wasn't that an incredible meal?

1015
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,190
Everything was new to me, but it was all tasty.

1016
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,330
My dream is to become a Korean.

1017
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,900
(I get you.)

1018
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,899
(What's the dish we had earlier?)

1019
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,040
Gimbap.

1020
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,110
"Gimbap."

1021
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,880
It was cooked by famous people from Korea.

1022
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,080
In Antarctica, of all places.

1023
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,749
I can't believe I got to enjoy it with our crew.

1024
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,220
(I can't believe I got to enjoy it with our crew, here in Antarctica.)

1025
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,590
(After the delicious dinner)

1026
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,630
As a representative of the Uruguay Artigas Base,

1027
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:51,070
I want to say that it was an honour to be here with you today.

1028
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,839
Everything you served us tasted perfect. It was excellent.

1029
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,970
She said "Excellent."

1030
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,610
Thank you for sharing a part of your culture with us.

1031
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,209
It's a real joy to know...

1032
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,380
that you truly enjoyed the gimbap we made.

1033
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,849
Here in this faraway land called Antarctica,

1034
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,390
thank you for providing help to mankind.

1035
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,659
Stay healthy,

1036
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,360
and I hope your life is filled with laughter. Thank you.

1037
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,539
This is a whole new crew we'll be meeting...

1038
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,840
from this particular base.

1039
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,939
Our crew at King Sejong Station...

1040
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,969
hasn't had a chance to interact with them yet.

1041
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,380
(The former winter crew left.)

1042
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,350
It was a new crew at Uruguay Base we were meeting.

1043
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,520
I'd love for them to remember us,

1044
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:46,359
stay in close communication with those at King Sejong Station,

1045
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,090
and rely on each other as they work together.

1046
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,799
(They hope their warm welcome was conveyed...)

1047
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,100
(through the food they made with love.)

1048
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,770
I prepared a small gift for you on behalf of the Uruguay Base.

1049
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,210
It's in the hope that you will always remember us.

1050
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,549
I guess this is in return...

1051
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,949
for the hangover soup we made.

1052
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,249
(A gift they received thanks to the dried pollack soup)

1053
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,449
Thank you.

1054
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,749
Thank you so much.

1055
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,990
(A gift to show gratitude for the delicious food)

1056
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,359
This is a special gift for you.

1057
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,760
(Repaying them for their hospitality)

1058
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,959
Thank you so much.

1059
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,830
(Thank you so much!)

1060
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:37,510
(A meal that united everyone in Antarctica)
