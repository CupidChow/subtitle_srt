(with the scenery of Antarctica.)

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,260
(It's almost time to say goodbye to our beloved Sejong Center.)

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,150
(Crew Paik enters the kitchen as if it's his own now.)

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,290
(First, he checks the pots he'll use.)

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,760
(After, he goes...)

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,860
(to the soaked namuls?)

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,960
- Bring all of those over.
- Okay.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,870
(Are these namuls today's main ingredients?)

15
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,240
(What will they cook for their last meal in Antarctica?)

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,870
So, the crew members and I...

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,009
were having our daily morning meeting,

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,209
and we talked about preparing a meaningful meal...

19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,750
for our last meal with the crew here.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,319
Instead of just thinking about the taste,

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,260
we discussed putting some meaning into what we cook,

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,960
and we had a good idea.

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,130
The most important topic of this morning's meeting is...

24
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,159
Technically, tomorrow is our last day here...

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,600
because we're leaving the day after, right?

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,739
Since it'll be our last real meal with the crew here,

27
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,840
I want to prepare a meaningful dinner.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,409
So I thought...

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,180
we should discuss in advance what to make for dinner tomorrow.

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,510
A meaningful dinner...

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,910
If so...

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,780
- I remembered something.
- What?

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,280
Bibimbap.

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,550
- Bibimbap?
- Yes.

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,259
Bibimbap. Why?

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,560
(Why bibimbap?)

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,360
They communicate with the other countries' bases...

38
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,230
Antarctica...

39
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,900
was actually...

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,230
bibimbap.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,599
That's actually a nice...

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,269
It's silly, but it could make sense...

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,509
if we explain it well.

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,980
We can make a story around it.

45
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,449
Bibimbap should be mixed with various ingredients.

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,479
Here, various countries...

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,419
work together in harmony.

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,989
- The crew members also...
- Same for the crew members.

49
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,620
They didn't know each other before coming here.

50
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,360
They're from Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, and so on.

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,099
It's a place where people have to come together.

52
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
(A place where people have to come together)

53
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,400
(Antarctica)

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,340

58
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,570
(Regardless of nationality or ideology, they became a family.)

59

(Special moments you can only experience...)

60
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,940
(in Antarctica)

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,149
That makes sense. The people in the other bases,

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,819
as well as the people at our base here,

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,419
all came from different places.

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,289
They didn't know each other's background or line of work,

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,490
but they came together...

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,760
and became a family, like a bibimbap.

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,830
I like it!

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,460
Bibimbap is a good idea.

(Will their last meal be a success?)

00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,750
(Let's start preparing the bibimbap ingredients!)

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,090
(First, put the soaked namuls...)

75
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,549
(into boiling water.)

76
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,360

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,530

(Tips for cooking namuls)

79
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,459
(You need to boil tough namuls for over 1 hour...)

80
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,100
(to get that soft texture!)

81
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,770
(While the namuls boil, he coats the pots with perilla oil.)

82
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,040
(Zucchini)

83
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,050
(Eggplant)

84
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,250
Keep stir-frying.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,149
(Dried radish greens, sweet potato stems, zucchini, and eggplants)

86
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,720
(They start on the 4 namul dishes at the same time.)

87
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,859
Beef?

88
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,490
(SUHO brought over beef.)

89
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,200
(He quickly analyzed what had to be done next.)

90
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,699
I'll mix this.

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,970
- Do you want to do this?
- Okay.

92
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,240
You're a chopping expert.

93
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,210
- Should I do it? I will.
- No, it's okay.

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,580
- Where is the meat?
- Over there.

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,580
It's over there.

96
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,950
(Jong Won is about to prep the meat.)

97
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,320
(SUHO keeps looking over.)

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,319
I...

99
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,490
I want to use a knife.

100
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,490
What?

101
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,790
- I want to use a knife. Yes.
- You want to use a knife?

102
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,559
(Glancing over)

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,660
That's hot.

104
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,730
(Please let me use a knife.)

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll stir-fry the eggplants.

106
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,699
- How can I do it?
- Just keep stirring,

107
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,509
- so it doesn't burn.
- Okay.

108
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,140
(Jong Hyeop offers to jump in so SUHO can cut the meat.)

109
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,480
(He goes to the beef right away.)

110
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,780
Cutting board?

111
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,090
(To prepare for slicing the beef, he sets up his cutting board.)

112
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,990
Just looking at SUHO...

113
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,690
makes me laugh.

114
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,260
I'm in trouble.

115
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,960
- Right?
- Yes.

116
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,569
I find him funny too.

117
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,930
That wasn't my image of him.

118
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,839
- He's actually a bit...
- I thought he was serious.

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,869
What?

120
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,110
He seemed like a reliable older brother.

121
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,679
Someone I could depend on, but actually...

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,879
(That serious, reliable, dependable older brother is now...)

123
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,950
Where is the knife?

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,179
Do you still not know where the knives are?

125
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,480
(Who is he talking to?)

126
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,350
- He's just funny now.
- I thought so since I met him.

127
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,790
(Giggling)

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,620
You know that using knives plays...

129
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,459
very important role in the kitchen, right?

130
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,729
(His improved knife skill after pickled radish and carrot trainings)

131
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,270
Bring it to me if you need anything sliced or chopped.

132
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,900
How should I cut this?

133
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,869
- In thin slices.
- Thin slices?

134
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,000
(This time, SUHO tackles beef!)

135
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,870
Like that?

136
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,410
(Slow)

137
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,650
See you tomorrow.

138
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,750
I'll go fast.

139
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,019
(Meanwhile, Soo Hyang and Jong Hyeop...)

140
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,250
(are battling the zucchinis and eggplants.)

141
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,560
(Swishing)

142
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,789
(Stir-frying with self-produced sound effects)

143
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,200
Since yesterday, we're making dishes that require lots of prep time.

144
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
It's all about effort.

145
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,830
It's all about effort.

146
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,670
Food made with lots of effort.

147
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,740
I hope they enjoy it.

148
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,970
Seriously.

149
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,880
I'll make it tasty.

150
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,979
(After stir-frying with lots of care, )

151
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,050
- That's heavy.
- That looks good.

152
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,579
(The stir-fried eggplant and zucchini are done.)

153
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,190
Can we put it on here?

154
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,320
- Can we?
- Yes.

155
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,620
Taste the namuls you stir-fried.

156
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,630
The taste should be good to you first.

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,959
Just mixing them in bibimbap...

158
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,599
doesn't make namuls taste good.

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,699
Each of the namuls needs to taste good on their own...

160
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,239
when eaten with just rice.

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,840
That's how you make truly delicious bibimbap.

162
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,870
(Tasting)

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,780
It's so tasty!

164
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,010
Let's spread this...

165
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,309
Is it good?

166
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,050
This is the flavor I wanted!

167
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,490
It's good.

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,730
(What comes next after the zucchinis and eggplants?)

169
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,130
(Jong Hyeop grabs the carrots.)

170
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,229
- I can use all of this, right?
- Yes.

171
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,700
(You need carrots to make colorful and tasty bibimbap!)

172
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,710
(There is a guy who has a deep history with carrots.)

173
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,140
I heard SUHO saw carrots in his dreams.

174
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,149
What?

175
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,680
You saw carrots in your dreams?

176
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,120
Carrots, pickled radishes, sweet pumpkins...

177
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,160
I had a dream that I was in an ingredient nightmare.

178
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,360
(He adds the last chunk in the bowl.)

179
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm done.

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,860
(He's done with chopping the beef.)

181
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,170
Okay, SUHO. The carrots are ready.

182
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,170
Okay.

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,970
Sounds good.

184
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,040
(Jong Hyeop just finds SUHO so funny now.)

185
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,470
Should I chop some carrots?

186
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,679
(SUHO said he didn't see carrots...)

187
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,880
(in his dreams that night.)

188
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,650
(While SUHO chops carrots, Crew Paik...)

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,960
(Rapeseed greens and young cabbage leaves)

190
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,989
(After defrosting and rinsing...)

191
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,360
(the rapeseed greens and young cabbage leaves, )

192
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,630
(squeeze out the water.)

193
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,930
(They look so fresh and not previously frozen.)

194
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,040
I'll cut them to about the length of one finger segment.

195
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:41,280
(Chop into appropriate sizes.)

196
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,850
Do you want to mix it?

197
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,420
I'll mix it.

198
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,620
(A spoonful of stir-fried garlic...)

199
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,320
(with rapeseed greens)

200
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,960
(Once Soo Hyang mixes them together, )

201
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,290
(the rapeseed greens are ready to go.)

202
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,659
(To the young cabbage leaves, )

203
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,130
(she adds a spoonful of doenjang.)

204
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,840
This looks so delicious.

205
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,040
(The young cabbage leaves with doenjang make you crave rice.)

206
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,880
I think we should add some sesame oil.

207
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,920
(Finishing off with sesame oil)

208
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,289
(The crunchy rapeseed greens and young cabbage leaves...)

209
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,190
(have been transformed.)

210
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,660
(Now, time for the key ingredient.)

211
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,700
(The highlight of bibimbap, the beef topping)

212
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,600
(Using lots of garlic to remove any unwanted smells)

213
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,870
(Adding cooking wine)

214
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,710
(She's such a good assistant!)

215
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,139
(Garlic, cooking wine... What's next?)

216
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,510
(Sous Chef Soo Hyang grabs the soy sauce.)

217
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,220
(Glancing over)

218
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,750
Wow, you know the order.

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,020
After that, sesame oil.

220
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,020
(Sous Chef Soo Hyang understands the cooking order.)

221
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,960
(Thanks to Soo Hyang's assistance, the beef is becoming tasty.)

222
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,629
This sauce here really flavors the bibimbap.

223
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,829
The tasty soy sauce.

224
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,600
(The tasty soy sauce is ready.)

225
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,699
(Steaming)

226
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,770
That looks yummy.

227
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,410
(Zucchini, young cabbage leaves, eggplant, rapeseed greens, beef, )

228
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,280
(sweet potato stems, )

229
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,950
(dried radish greens, )

230
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,250
(bamboo shoots, )

231
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
(and carrots)

232
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,259
(All sorts of namuls have been added!)

233
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,290
That looks pretty good, right?

234
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,830
Isn't it awesome?

235
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,230
So pretty.

236
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,700
(Nine ingredients are ready!)

237
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,109
Put everything in and mix.

238
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,410
(We have one last kick, thistle!)

239
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,209
If you put them all on one side, they ball up. Mix it quickly.

240
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,310
(SUHO's tasks, Beef, carrots, and now, thistle!)

241
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,409
(SUHO starts to stir-fry the thistle.)

242
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,520
(He's very serious about cooking.)

243
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,120
(Super focused)

244
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Wait, why...

245
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,820
(Struggling)

246
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,759
Why is it... Oh, my gosh.

247
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,989
(Grumbling)

248
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,190
There we go.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,700
(Laughing)

250
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,509
Hey, think about it.

251
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,609
- This is big, right?
- Yes.

252
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,809
Is it easy to flip?

253
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,109
- It's not.
- How about this?

254
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,510
It's easy to flip because it's small, right?

255
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,409
Why were you going like this?

256
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,780
(Crew Paik finds it funny how much SUHO was struggling.)

257
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,280
Use this to loosen them up, and use this to mix.

258
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,750
It's so nice to see.

259
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,620
You need to mix well.

260
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,090
(He stir-fries the thistle as he was taught.)

261
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,069
(Put it on the tray, and it's done!)

262
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,100
There we go.

263
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,410
(SUHO came out to check out the 10 ingredients.)

264
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,650
(Proud)

265
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,449
(Why am I...)

266
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,820
(so happy?)

267
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,730
(Expressing "Dinner prep is done" with his whole body)

268
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,070
(A total of ten ingredients!)

269
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,200
(Their last meal in Antarctica, bibimbap)

270
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,010
(How does it taste?)

271
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,210
(Current time: 5pm)

272
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,219
(They spend 1 year in Antarctica.)

273
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,850
(The 37th crew has been here for 11 months of that year.)

274
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,189
(As their time in Antarctica is coming to an end, )

275
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,830
(they're busy packing things to send back to Korea.)

276
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,940
(Now, it's time for our last dinner together.)

277
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,540
- Let's go.
- Oh, my gosh.

278
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,010
What is this?

279
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,849
(The tables are already set.)

280
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,350
This is no joke.

281
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,190
(A meaningful bibimbap meal)

282
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,659
Just serve yourselves some rice.

283
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,790
(Today, you just need to serve yourselves some rice.)

284
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,890
What is this? Goodness.

285
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,459
It looks good.

286
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,860
(It's been a while...)

287
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,299
This looks so nice.

288
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,830
(since they've seen a bibimbap meal.)

289
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,639
This looks so nice.

290
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,740
(The crew members are very excited.)

291
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,139
You don't need to add gochujang, but if you want some,

292
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,709
you can add some when you want.

293
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,810
(Putting a good amount of rice in the bibimbap bowl)

294
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,549
It's good as is,

295
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,679
and it's also good with gochujang.

296
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,750
(Since the namuls are seasoned, gochujang is optional!)

297
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,849
(Depending on their preferences, )

298
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,620
(they can choose between two flavors of bibimbap.)

299
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,960
(And...)

300
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,430
(Crew Paik sets something up.)

301
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,369
(What is that?)

302
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,329
The makgeolli you're having now...

303
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,239
is something we made as soon as we got here.

304
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,440
(Makgeolli?)

305
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,479
When we first arrived...

306
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,980
at the base in Antarctica, I was most curious...

307
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,420
about what kind of alcohol they drink here.

308
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,960
This was done unofficially,

309
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,120
but I asked a few people about it.

310
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,530
"What kind of alcohol do you miss here?"

311
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,499
It was so funny.

312
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,900
All three of them said the same thing.

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,470
They said they didn't have makgeolli here.

314
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,469
So I thought,

315
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,439
"They must not be able to drink makgeolli here."

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
(Because of short expiry date, they can't easily have makgeolli here.)

317
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,310
I thought it was a good chance...

318
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:44,709
to try making some makgeolli.

319
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,180
So I made some as soon as we got to the base.

320
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,749
(While SUHO was in his pickled radish nightmare...)

321
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,620
(on their first night in Antarctica, )

322
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,850
Chef.

323
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,590
This tap water hasn't been treated, right?

324
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,259
- This water is from melted snow.
- What?

325
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,489
Let's use this water.

326
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,490
It's just melted snow?

327
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,599
(Behind King Sejong Station, )

328
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
(an artificial lake produces Antarctic water.)

329
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,129
The water is very tasty.

330
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,870
It tastes very luxurious.

331
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,369
You wanted to try making it with Antarctic water.

332
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,240
Right. Only in Antarctica.

333
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,209
Makgeolli you can have only in Antarctica.

334
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,210
That's right.

335
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,349
Bring me...

336
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,179
a bag of nuruk from over there.

337
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
(Jong Hyeop ended up becoming the makgeolli assistant.)

338
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,649
(Antarctica makgeolli recipe)

339
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,150
(1. Add nuruk to Antarctic water and mix it well.)

340
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,820
Gosh, this is my first time.

341
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,390
This is very important.

342
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,860
Spread it out on two trays.

343
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,760
We need to let it cool.

344
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,899
(It's his first time, but he's doing very well.)

345
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,399
That's so fascinating. How does that become makgeolli?

346
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,740
(While the makgeolli rice cools, )

347
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,170
(they strain the water with crushed nuruk with a sieve.)

348
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,639
(Antarctic makgeolli recipe)

349
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,449
(3. Mix them with the nuruk water.)

350
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,979
Oh, my. This is so cool.

351
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,820
(3. Mix them with the nuruk water.)

352
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,090
(The rice and nuruk blend becomes the makgeolli base.)

353
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,850
That spot seems warm, right?

354
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,290
This spot is warm.

355
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,120
(Moving it to a nook in the kitchen)

356
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,930
He told me to put it here...

357
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,990
because this spot is warm.

358
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,770
(A small brewery in Antarctica they made on the spot)

359
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,370
Is the makgeolli coming along well?

360
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,740
(They returned to the makgeolli nook.)

361
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,080
Isn't it interesting how this happens in just two days?

362
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,979
If you leave it as is...

363
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,709
With the layer floating on top, that's dongdongju.

364
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,750
(If we fast-forward)

365
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,749
So, technically,

366
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,949
we can drink it quite soon, right?

367
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,989
We can't drink it yet.

368
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,419
This type of alcohol...

369
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,920
is called iyangju.

370
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,460
(Iyangju)

371
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,559
I learned something new.

372
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,699
(Traditional liquor that is produced by fermenting it once...)

373
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,800
(and then once again with added grains and water.)

374
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,140
(The two stages of fermentation deepens the flavor of makgeolli.)

375
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,350
(Cool the hard-steamed rice in Antarctica's wind.)

376
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,250
With the energy of Antarctica.

377
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,820
(Add the rice to the makgeolli that has been fermented once.)

378
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,359
What I'm doing now...

379
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,990
is spreading out...

380
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,359
the balled up chunks...

381
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,230
to make sure everything ferments evenly.

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,870
(The Antarctic water makgeolli is ready for its 2nd fermentation.)

383
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,780
(They fermented the makgeolli for 10 days.)

384
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,310
(Crew Paik checked on the makgeolli at the end of each day.)

385
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,780
(Thanks to Crew Paik's care, )

386
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,550
(the Antarctic makgeolli is coming together.)

387
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,450
We can drink this tomorrow.

388
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,030
(Time to finally open the makgeolli.)

389
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,399
(This morning in Sejong Center)

390
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,800
(Jong Hyeop brought out the fermented makgeolli.)

391
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,170
(They finally open their Antarctic makgeolli.)

392
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,569
Oh, the smell of alcohol.

393
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,670
(The makgeolli has been fermenting for a total of ten days.)

394
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,710
Right now, it looks like sikhye.

395
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,849
(Antarctic makgeolli recipe)

396
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,850
(Remove the fermented bits and separate out the liquid.)

397
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,520
The smell is making me drunk.

398
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,220
I'm in trouble.

399
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,120
Squeeze and press down.

400
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,730
There you go.

401
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,700
(Let's give it a taste.)

402
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,670
(How does makgeolli made in Antarctica taste?)

403
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,930
Oh, gosh.

404
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:31,999
Is it good?

405
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,040
Goodness!

406
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,240
- This is insane.
- Is it strong?

407
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,810
This is intense.

408
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,479
Right?

409
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Looks like I'm good at brewing makgeolli too.

410
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,179
(Should I tell him or not?)

411
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,250
Actually, since I made the rice...

412
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,920
Don't try to be funny.

413
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,850
(Laughing)

414
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,190
- What's there to life?
- It's interesting.

415
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,349
(The flavors help you forget past hardships.)

416
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,359
Are you going to get drunk?

417
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,090
Nice. Do we have young radish kimchi?

418
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,989
Chi Young, join us. I added water to this.

419
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,100
(Chef An Chi Young joins them as he passes by.)

420
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,400
Did you just drink it all?

421
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,100
(Refreshing)

422
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,740
I didn't expect you to drink it all.

423
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,340
Makgeolli's rare to come by in Antarctica.

424
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,779
The makgeolli had a slight milky taste,

425
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,480
kind of like condensed milk.

426
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,120
(Rare and precious, Antarctic water makgeolli)

427
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,889
Please enjoy.

428
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,390
- Sure.
- We'll enjoy.

429
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,959
Actually, I wanted to treat them to a meal...

430
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,430
as lavish as the Last Supper.

431
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,110
I cooked the last meal I'd be serving...

432
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,480
hoping that they'd truly enjoy it.

433
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,649
(Just as Jong Hyeop hoped, )

434
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,220
(we wish for a lavish and hearty meal.)

435
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,950
I'd like to say a few things before you dig in.

436
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,219
We brainstormed for quite a while about today's meal,

437
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,260
and meat dishes were at the top of the list.

438
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,259
Still, we chose bibimbap...

439
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,659
for a specific reason,

440
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,930
so let us explain.

441
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,030
- Take it away.
- Right, well...

442
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,670
(Why did they make bibimbap today?)

443
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,640
(Say it with confidence.)

444
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,940
It's because we're all a mix.

445
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,049
(A mix?)

446
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,519
King Sejong Station alone brings together people...

447
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,449
from all around our country, regardless of their home region,

448
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,590
gender, or age.

449
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,189
We were only here for ten days,

450
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,259
but it felt like we became part of your family too.

451
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
(Though their stay was short, they became part of the crew.)

452
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,069
We felt like we became one here...

453
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,099
at the station in Antarctica,

454
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,339
just like this bibimbap.

455
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,110
To show how we've come together as a family,

456
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,609
we made bibimbap for you.

457
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,350
All we want is for you to enjoy it.

458
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,150
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

459
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,220
Guys, go ahead.

460
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,390
Let's sit down with them.

461
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,960
It wasn't only because they liked our food.

462
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,759
We were happy to see them,

463
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,730
the way you'd greet family.

464
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,900
Once you come to Antarctica, you naturally become part of the family.

465
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,269
(We hope they'd enjoy the bibimbap...)

466
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,040
(that symbolizes them becoming a family.)

467
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,570
(Sliding)

468
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
(Sliding)

469
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:35,420
(Mixing a bowl of bibimbap in Antarctica)

470
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,860
I think it's our first time having bibimbap.

471
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,990
Haven't you made bibimbap before?

472
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,589
We had rice with naumls but...

473
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,730
Rice with namuls?

474
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,670
During the winter season, I work alone in the kitchen,

475
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,800
so making bibimbap isn't easy for me to do by myself.

476
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,810
(Bibimbap is hard to prep alone since it requires a lot of work.)

477
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,609
I haven't been able to...

478
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,509
make bibimbap for the crew even though they wanted it.

479
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,710
(The crew gets a special treat for the 1st time in 11 months.)

480
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,979
It's been so long since we had rice...

481
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,119
- with fresh vegetables.
- Tell me about it.

482
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,320
Who knew we'd get to eat this in Antarctica?

483
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,289
(Since vegetables are hard to find in Antarctica, )

484
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:21,200
(the crew enjoys the bibimbap even more.)

485
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,940
Did we do a good job?

486
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,009
It's really good.

487
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,210
I love the meat in this.

488
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,470
I didn't even add any gochujang.

489
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,880
(Chi Young enjoys it without any gochujang.)

490
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
It'll be good even without the gochujang.

491
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,850
We seasoned all the vegetables separately.

492
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,690
It's seasoned perfectly.

493
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,720
I made sure it didn't need any gochujang.

494
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,490
As you know,

495
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,229
I ate everything you cooked at our station,

496
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,030
as well as what you made for the other stations.

497
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,829
- This is by far my favorite.
- Right?

498
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,070
Yes, this and the meat.

499
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,039
It seems like making bibimbap today was the right choice.

500
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
In a way,

501
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,409
it made us feel like we truly became one.

502
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,280
That made me feel proud.

503
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,920
(After enjoying the food)

504
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,150
I emptied my bowl.

505
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,959
How is it? Is it good?

506
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,420
- It's delicious.
- It's delicious.

507
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,990
They love it.

508
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,130
I'd love to stay another two weeks and cook for you, but...

509
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,830
The weather is supposed to be bad tomorrow.

510
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,400
The weather must've changed.

511
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,900
Don't go home.

512
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,310
(Even though their stay was brief, )

513
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,279
(they became like a family...)

514
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,010
(as they spent time together and shared meals.)

515
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,579
(The leader slowly rises from his seat.)

516
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,550
Are all your glasses filled?

517
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,449
All right.

518
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,459
The four crew members worked hard during their stay.

519
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,760
Even on the day before your departure,

520
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,999
you treated us to an incredible meal,

521
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,559
and we thank you again.

522
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,270
The 37th winter crew has now grown to 22 members.

523
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,939
Chef of...

524
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,270
- Antarctica.
- Antarctica.

525
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,539
Thank you.

526
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,879
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

527
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,910
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

528
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,080
Thank you for all your hard work.

529
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,850
(What does Antarctic water makgeolli taste like?)

530
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,290
- Wi-Fi.
- Wi-Fi.

531
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,000
It's good.

532
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
(Savoring)

533
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,200
- It's really good.
- It's good.

534
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,900
(Satisfied)

535
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,969
It's good.

536
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,969
Makgeolli goes bad easily,

537
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,870
and it's tough to make from scratch.

538
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,479
The winter crew has been craving it...

539
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,249
throughout their time here,

540
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,949
so I thank the Chef of Antarctica...

541
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,520
for making us a batch during his stay.

542
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,790
(Soo Hyang tries the makgeolli too.)

543
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,420
(The makgeolli is incredible.)

544
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,960
It's very sweet.

545
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,430
I like that it's sweet.

546
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,589
It's like banana milk.

547
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,260
Yes, like banana milk.

548
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,129
It's nice and sweet.

549
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,330
It's so good.

550
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,000
I was afraid the batch would be ruined,

551
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,399
but we were able to have it ready on exactly the right day.

552
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,709
It turned out delicious.

553
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,910
The crew obviously enjoyed it,

554
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,610
and that felt great.

555
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,710
(The Antarctic water makgeolli was a huge success!)

556
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,080
Is it good?

557
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,580
You emptied yours.

558
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,380
I'm annoyed that I'm full...

559
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,950
since I can't eat anymore.

560
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,420
- Really?
- Nicely put.

561
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,519
I see you emptied your bowls.

562
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,830
I had seconds.

563
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,289
You need to take it easy...

564
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,390
since you'll be driving the RIB tomorrow.

565
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,729
- Of course!
- Right.

566
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,999
You're our driver.

567
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,130
(Okay.)

568
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,500
(Glancing)

569
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,339
- I wish you'd stay one more day.
- One more day?

570
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,469
If only we had gotten here straight away...

571
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,510
I know.

572
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,740
We had to wait a few days for the weather to clear up.

573
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,910
It was just sad to say goodbye.

574
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,050
We had grown attached to the crew members.

575
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,480
When they all asked us to stay a few more days,

576
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
it felt like an official goodbye,

577
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,490
and my heart tightened at those words.

578
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,400
I felt like they had given me so much love.

579
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,130
Maybe it's because they felt like family to me,

580
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,699
I wasn't lonely at all,

581
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,499
even though I thought I would be.

582
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,110
(I wasn't lonely at all, even though I thought I would be.)

583
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,039
I can't dive into cold water.

584
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,040
(Warm laughter spreads across Sejong Center.)

585
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,580
(And a moment they thought would never come)

586
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,390
(Their last moon in Antarctica rises.)

587
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,960
(Dozing off)

588
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,130
Yes!

589
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,070
(Why is the crew suddenly cheering?)

590
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,629
Right.

591
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,240
(SUHO brings something out.)

592
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,040
(An acoustic guitar?)

593
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,110
(Looking extremely nervous)

594
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,280
I have a bit of a twang.

595
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,150
Please excuse me, and I apologize for not being in top shape.

596
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,450
After I heard I was coming to Antarctica,

597
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,790
I thought it would be nice...

598
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,220
to gift you a song since I'm a singer.

599
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,489
The lyrics were written here in Antarctica.

600
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,690
(The lyrics were written here in Antarctica.)

601
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,529
(After arriving in Antarctica, )

602
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,900
(SUHO practiced his song every day to sing to the crew.)

603
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,100
We went to Nabi Hill to check the communications equipment,

604
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,239
and on the way, our feet kept sinking into the snow.

605
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,840
Our guide gave us a tip.

606
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,210
- Step in the spots...
- Yes?

607
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,279
where others have already stepped...

608
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,380
so your feet won't sink.

609
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,380
The safest way across was to step in the footsteps of the people...

610
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,490
who walked up before you.

611
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,720
The medical crew member had to do so much work...

612
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,929
that he wanted to drop everything and rest.

613
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,029
I spoke a lot with Crew Byeong Hak,

614
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,160
and he said...

615
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,429
he felt like running away.

616
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,700
They guided us...

617
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,969
so no one would lose their way.

618
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,770
(A special song that captures the stories of the crew members)

619
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,079
(SUHO wanted to give them one last gift.)

620
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,320
(SUHO wanted to give them one last gift.)

621
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,250
Gosh, the pressure is unreal.

622
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,190
I heard this winter crew...

623
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,329
was made up entirely of men,

624
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,790
so I named the song "A Letter From Antarctica,"

625
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,160
though you can call it "The Men's Tales."

626
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,830
(That's a clever song title.)

627
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,239
("A Letter From Antarctica" by SUHO)

628
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,710
(Written and composed by SUHO)

629
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,840
I felt like we bonded and became a family.

630
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,180
And the crew members I got to know personally...

631
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,440
were so innocent,

632
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,380
pure,

633
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,280
and incredibly passionate.

634
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,120
They're much, much younger than me,

635
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,359
but aside from when they're eating and having fun,

636
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,330
you can really sense the spark...

637
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,430
in their eyes.

638
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,330
There's something professional and admirable about them.

639
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,370
There were many hardships and rough times,

640
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,009
but I know a part of me will miss them and this place.

641
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,510
I'll remember it more as a place with beautiful people and moments.

642
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,880
It'll be like that first love you can never forget.

643
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,619
It wasn't at all the place...

644
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,320
I imagined it would be.

645
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,560
I imagined it as a cold, icy place...

646
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,030
with nothing but penguins,

647
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,960
but I found that it's full of warmth...

648
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,900
and the love and affection of people.

649
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,170
(Where the warmest people in Antarctica reside)

650
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,110
(King Sejong Station in Antarctica)

651
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,550
(The Chef of Antarctica team is now leaving this place.)

652
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,920
(By the flagpole at King Sejong Station)

653
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,549
(The Chef of Antarctica team's flag is taken down after 10 days.)

654
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,960
It seems the flags have worn out in ten days.

655
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:15,770
(The crew writes their final words on the flag.)

656
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,539
Thank you.

657
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,140
It was a wonderful experience.

658
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,779
We appreciate the heartfelt words.

659
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,879
The flag will remain in...

660
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,279
King Sejong Station's history hall forever,

661
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,390
and we'll keep remembering your time here. Thank you.

662
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,820
Here, on this Korean flag...

663
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,789
that flew during your stay,

664
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,030
the 18 members of the 37th winter crew...

665
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,830
left their words of gratitude.

666
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,840
It's so that you'll remember your time here...

667
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,410
even after you go back to Korea.

668
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,070
Here you go.

669
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,109
(Thank you for an unforgettable ten days.)

670
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,709
(It was enough to make us forget the Antarctic cold.)

671
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,079
(Paik Jong Won, Im Soo Hyang, Chae Jong Hyeop, SUHO, )

672
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,479
(it was a pleasure to meet you all.)

673
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,420
(I hope we meet again someday. Thank you. We love you.)

674
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,249
Even with the limited ingredients,

675
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,459
the food you cooked for us was delicious.

676
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,089
The entire winter crew had a great time,

677
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,730
and it left us with heartwarming memories.

678
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,699
The 37th winter crew began...

679
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,629
with 18 members,

680
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,969
but on December 3, when our time here ends,

681
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,000
we'll be leaving as a team of 22.

682
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,040
We had an amazing time, so thank you.

683
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,470
Thank you for all your hard work.

684
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,080
Bye!

685
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,820
The snow is so pretty today.

686
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,490
- Tell me about it.
- It's beautiful.

687
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,660
(Summer, 2025)

688
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,630
After leaving Antarctica, we returned to our everyday lives.

689
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,970
In our own places, we begin our own new journeys.

690
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,840
The youngest member of the 37th winter crew,

691
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,369
Crew Kim Eun Su,

692
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,669
became an admirable man at sea.

693
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,140
(Yeosu Gwangyang Port Authority, Kim Eun Su)

694
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,380
Aboard a ship that guides others to ports,

695
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,720
he shares his Antarctica stories with the passengers.

696
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,620
Crew An Chi Young is deeply immersed in the world of desserts.

697
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,200
He's been working on his craft with the hope...

698
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,299
of returning to Antarctica someday as a chef...

699
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,330
to make great desserts for the crew.

700
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:42,810
(Mexico City)

701
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,750
Crew SUHO, well-known for his passion,

702
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,319
switched from knives back to his mic...

703
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,820
and returned to the stage.

704
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,260
Now back as the leader of global star EXO,

705
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,630
he's been busy traveling across the world to perform.

706
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,569
Treating people to a meal...

707
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,469
and bringing them comfort through food...

708
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,939
warmed my heart too.

709
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,339
Now I want to do performances...

710
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,609
that offer the same kind of healing.

711
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,310
Lay off the booze, will you?

712
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,149
Lay off the nagging, why don't you?

713
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,520
Sous chef Crew Im Soo Hyang...

714
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,190
returned to the theater after quite a long time.

715
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,590
Suzu!

716
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,189
You can't let me be late alone.

717
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,659
She's embracing a new challenge...

718
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,360
by channeling a new character.

719
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,900
Being in an environment that pushes you to your limits...

720
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,340
has made me...

721
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,370
more patient and understanding than before.

722
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,780
I feel as if I've become a stronger person inside.

723
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,049
Crew Lee Chang Jae...

724
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,749
returned home to his loving family...

725
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,079
after his third tour on a winter crew.

726
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,790
(Mechanical support, Lee Chang Jae)

727
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,220
Crew Jung In Cheol has been going wherever he's called...

728
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,430
and offering medical support wherever it's needed.

729
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,329
(Organism research, Yeom Chang Hun)

730
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,529
Every crew member has been spending their days meaningfully...

731
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,499
in their respective places.

732
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,100
(Electronic communication, Lee Byeong Hak)

733
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,669
(Tokyo)

734
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,110
Our days there were like a dream.

735
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,310
When I was in Antarctica,

736
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,049
our crew experienced white nights.

737
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,209
The night view, is it?

738
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,720
That was a thing of beauty.

739
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,789
Antarctica's brutal cold...

740
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,720
only made us stronger,

741
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,029
and the warm meal we shared...

742
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,260
tied us together as a family.

743
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,929
I took many photos of the crew members...

744
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,329
at King Sejong Station,

745
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,629
along with the scenery.

746
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,030
Those are what I took many photos of.

747
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,470
We may have left Antarctica,

748
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,580
but the memories we made will stay with us forever.

749
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,109
And we'll make sure...

750
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,820
to tell as many people as possible about what we experienced.

751
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,120
We support the 38th Winter Crew, who are keeping things running...

752
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,260
at King Sejong Station right now,

753
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,359
as well as everyone around the world...

754
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,730
working in the polar regions.
