(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,849
(The sun is up.)

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,879
(Chef of Antarctica)

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,420
(Day 2 in Antarctica)

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,060
(It's peaceful in Antarctica as always.)

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,629
(While some get to take it easy...)

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,930
(Yawning)

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,740
(others are spending every moment in Antarctica, busy as ever.)

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,320
(The winter crew members at the King Sejong Station)

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,060
(What will their morning look like?)

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,830
(Living quarters, Day 2 in Antarctica)

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,200
Hello.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,399
Hello.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,670
(The crew members have gathered in the Sejong Center.)

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,740
(They're starting their morning in high spirits.)

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,540
(The crew members of Antarctica are blending in naturally.)

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,510
What are we doing?

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,980
(Today's information about Antarctica is on the monitor.)

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,550
Let's begin.

21
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,449
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,450
(Every morning, the crew members are...)

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,059
All right. In a few days, from the 25th through the 27th,

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,859
the weather will get cloudier.

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,599
In the morning, everyone packs their personal belongings.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,900
Then, the whole team will participate in loading...

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,300
the outgoing shipment into the container.

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,810
(What kind of task awaits them on their 2nd day in Antarctica?)

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,640
It's the last week of November.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,579
The last week has begun.

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,810
All right. Today, we have a pressing matter to handle.

32
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,919
The wireless repeater that was installed on Nabi Hill...

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,049
is experiencing some problems.

34
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,289
There are problems with the antenna and battery.

35
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,789
So we need to get out there quickly and fix the problems today.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,800
(Nabi Hill? A repeater?)

37
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,269
(The King Sejong Station is located here...)

38
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,340
(on the Barton Peninsula.)

39
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,370
(On top of the peninsula, )

40
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,580
(big and small hills have risen up.)

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,810
(Sejong Hill)

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,280
(Sejong Hill, Baekdu Hill)

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,720
(The hills take their name from Korean words.)

44
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,890
(About 2km away from the station lies...)

45
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,290
(Nabi Hill.)

46
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,159
(It was named Nabi Hill...)

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,659
(because its contour lines resemble nabi, )

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,830
(the Korean word for butterfly.)

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,100
(Nabi Hill, standing at 129.2m, )

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,010
(has a wireless repeater...)

51
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,010
(that transmits messages to the King Sejong Station.)

52
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,150
When we try to reach the repeater with our radio,

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,619
it only transmits to the Narae Cliff.

54
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,819
But past that point,

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,179
the radio signals are blocked...

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,989
because of the mountains surrounding the repeater.

57
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,960
Most of our research happens...

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,789
in the Antarctic Specially Protected Area.

59
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,760
None of our messages can get through.

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,760
We're unable to communicate now.

61
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,540
(Antarctica lacks proper communication facilities.)

62
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,840
(Especially out in the field far away from the station, )

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,480
(walkie-talkies are vital...)

64
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,720
(to complete their tasks smoothly.)

65
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,489
Not being able to communicate...

66
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,489
while working outdoors in Antarctica...

67
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,430
could directly affect our survival in case there are accidents.

68
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,029
We must dispatch some people there immediately to repair...

69
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,000
and make sure that the repeater is working properly.

70
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,930
The communications lead, Lee Byeong Hak, will be dispatched.

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,699
Since the equipment must be fixed,

72
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,539
the mechanic lead, Kang Dong Gyeong, will also go.

73
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,640
The newly arrived members, Im Soo Hyang and SUHO,

74
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,979
will join them, although it may be a challenge.

75
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,380
I'm relying on our team to fix the repeater and get it back online.

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
Right now,

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,959
the apparent temperature is minus 17°C.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,060
(The apparent temperature is minus 17°C.)

79
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,300
(Shocked)

80
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,860
(Outside the King Sejong Station, )

81
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,500
(the weather is dreadful with the blizzard.)

82
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,370
(Fluttering hard)

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,269
As the weather is quite harsh now,

84
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,150
we'll take you off as far as possible on the snowcat.

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,410
Then you'll walk to get to the repeater.

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,349
But the snow has melted quite a lot.

87
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,049
So the snowcat might not be able to make it far.

88
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,959
That means you may have to walk up pretty far...

89
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,660
while carrying heavy bags.

90
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,130
(A specialized vehicle that can travel on the snow)

91
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,070
(A snowcat)

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,139
(Antarctica...)

93
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,510
(is covered in snow.)

94
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,709
(The vehicle safely transports the crew...)

95
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,550
(across the snowy land of Antarctica.)

96
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,980
(The means of transportation in Antarctica, snowcat)

97
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,150
(However, due to the current weather and topographical conditions, )

98
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,490
(the snowcat may not be able to take them far.)

99
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
All right. That's the biggest task of today.

100
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,359
Crew Paik. Crew Chae.

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,830
I would appreciate it if you could make boxed meals.

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,440
This task is physically demanding, so please make something tasty.

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,969
- Great meeting, everyone.
- Great meeting, everyone.

104
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,110
(They begin their assigned task.)

105
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,169
Be careful and come back safely.

106
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,740
We'll be back.

107
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,639
- Soo Hyang.
- We'll be back.

108
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,350
(Team Nabi Hill is ready to move.)

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,550
Is that it?

110
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,150
- That's right.
- I see.

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
(It's the snowcat they will take.)

112
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,380
You can get in.

113
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,120
(Looking reliable and sturdy)

114
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,690
(The member to drive this snowcat safely is...)

115
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,200
(Lee Chang Jae, who's in charge of heavy equipment.)

116
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,770
(Getting in)

117
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,340
(Everyone is in the snowcat.)

118
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,410
(I'll come back safely.)

119
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,110
(Be safe out there.)

120
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,679
(He radios in before leaving.)

121
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,009
Reporting from the snowcat.

122
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,050
The five of us will head out to Nabi Hill.

123
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,349
Please take good care of us.

124
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,850
- Please take good care of us.
- Please take good care of us.

125
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,390
Sure. Let's go.

126
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,820
Let's go!

127
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,090
Let's go.

128
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,129
(They're off to an energetic start.)

129
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,430
Let's go.

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,100
(They drive past the orange-colored buildings at the station...)

131
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,899
(and head to the white Nabi Hill.)

132
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,570
(From the King Sejong Station to Nabi Hill)

133
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,880
(The snowcat passes through dirt...)

134
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,250
(and then back onto the snowy terrain.)

135
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,150
Isn't the view different from here?

136
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,820
(This is the best view ever.)

137
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,820
I should take some pictures too.

138
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,090
(SUHO is already capturing the view on video.)

139
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,700
(The sweeping view of the vast Barton Peninsula)

140
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,899
My gosh. This is insane.

141
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,099
(A view that takes your breath away)

142
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,140
This is amazing.

143
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,610
(Capturing the view)

144
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,210
When we were driving away from the station on the snowcat,

145
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,680
the only thing I could see was the snowy field.

146
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,250
(There's nothing but snow here.)

147
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,720
It felt like we've arrived on a different planet.

148
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,760
I felt like I wasn't on Earth.

149
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,460
It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment.

150
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,670
(What do you think, my friend?)

151
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,740
(It's fascinating.)

152
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,069
I had seen Antarctica...

153
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,370
only on TV shows and in documentaries.

154
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,380
So seeing that in person...

155
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,850
felt amazing because the view was absolutely stunning.

156
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,490
Only then did it hit me that I was really in Antarctica.

157
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,860
When would I ever get to experience something like this again?

158
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,060
It was truly an extraordinary feeling.

159
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,500
(Amazed)

160
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,630
(Bumpy)

161
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,970
(Shaking)

162
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,240
From here on out, it will be a bumpy ride.

163
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,710
Okay.

164
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,580
(As the terrain becomes rockier toward the hill, )

165
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,150
(the snowcat is shaking even more.)

166
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,120
(Shaking)

167
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,090
Will it get bumpier than this?

168
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,460
A lot bumpier than this.

169
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,730
(Checking the front view)

170
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,200
It's going to get a lot bumpier than this.

171
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,200
(The path is covered with gravel.)

172
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,310
(On top of that, they are spiky.)

173
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,480
(The bumpy, rocky path continues.)

174
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,310
(Scanning the surrounding area)

175
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,520
This is as far as I can get you to on the snowcat.

176
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,690
You guys will need to walk up from here.

177
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,160
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

178
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,960
Reporting from the snowcat. We've arrived at the drop-off point.

179
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,370
(They can just make out Nabi Hill from here.)

180
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,540
(But it's very far from the hill.)

181
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,669
(To make their journey harder...)

182
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,870
Listen to the sound of the wind.

183
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,740
Gosh, this is no joke.

184
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,150
It's very windy.

185
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,450
(A powerful gust of wind is blowing at them.)

186
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,220
(Staggering)

187
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,889
This is no joke.

188
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,560
(The wind is powerful enough to shove a grown man.)

189
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,260
Gosh, this is insane.

190
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,930
Oh, my. It's incredibly windy.

191
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,070
(The strength of the wind is on another level.)

192
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,110
(Their first mission in Antarctica will be a difficult journey.)

193
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,209
Before we set out, we must make sure...

194
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,540
we have the walkie-talkie.

195
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,810
SUHO, you can take the walkie-talkie.

196
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,550
Communication office. This is SUHO.

197
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,650
We're heading over to Nabi Hill now.

198
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,489
Crew SUHO.

199
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,290
This is the King Sejong Station.

200
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,559
I couldn't catch the last part.

201
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,890
The weather conditions are getting worse...

202
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,829
since this morning.

203
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,230
The wind is blowing west at 11m per second.

204
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,940
(The wind velocity of 11m per second in Antarctica means...)

205
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,169
(they must be careful during outdoor activities.)

206
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,079
(When the wind velocity hits 14m per second, )

207
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,880
(they're not allowed to go outdoors.)

208
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,350
(Moreover, around Nabi Hill where the repeater is, )

209
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,780
(it is much windier.)

210
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,250
(The flurry of snow makes it challenging to see ahead.)

211
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,229
(Can they safely make it...)

212
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,560
(to Nabi Hill, where the repeater is?)

213
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,159
- Let's go.
- Okay.

214
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,170
Okay.

215
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,070
Be careful.

216
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,540
We'll be back!

217
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,770
- See you later!
- See you!

218
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,780
(Good luck!)

219
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,810
- There are a lot of rocks here.
- It's a rocky mountain.

220
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,379
Gosh, it's been a while since I last hiked.

221
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,480
(The crew members make their way to Nabi Hill.)

222
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,950
Do you see that thing all the way over there?

223
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
(Nabi Hill stands tall in the far distance.)

224
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:27,590
- Yes.
- We have to walk all the way there.

225
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,459
- Is that it?
- Yes, the one up there.

226
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,329
- It's the tallest hill here.
- Okay.

227
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,630
(They're about 1.5km away from the repeater.)

228
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,730
My gosh.

229
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh, dear.

230
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,339
My feet are sinking pretty deep.

231
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,540
(The long hike ahead of them makes them sigh.)

232
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,109
(Trudging through the snow is tough.)

233
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,780
- My feet are sinking in the snow.
- Right.

234
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,349
If we take a wrong step, we might be stepping on a rock.

235
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,409
Right.

236
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,350
Let me know when you get tired. We can take a break.

237
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,790
(Losing his balance)

238
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,420
(Slightly embarrassed)

239
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,960
This is no joke.

240
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,800
Oh, my. This place...

241
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,000
(Oh, my...)

242
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,470
Isn't this place stunning?

243
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
This is crazy.

244
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,670
I love it here.

245
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,980
It's unrealistic.

246
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,119
Gosh, it's indeed beautiful.

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,419
(Facing the snowy field on the Barton Peninsula)

248
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,350
Being here is making me feel...

249
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,089
peaceful.

250
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,360
(The scenery of Antarctica looks marvelous every moment.)

251
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,090
I can't believe I get to do this.

252
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,600
What a great memory.

253
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,430
If I get lost in a place like this,

254
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,070
I wouldn't be able to make it home since I'm bad with directions.

255
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,540
I should make a trail.

256
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,710
Just follow your own trail.

257
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,450
My feet are sinking in.

258
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,590
(Soo Hyang stops.)

259
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,390
We're almost there.

260
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,490
(Once they climb over this hill...)

261
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,460
We're almost there.

262
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,260
(A blizzard rolls in.)

263
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,640
(The wind is so strong that even the camera is shaking.)

264
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,470
Gosh, it's incredibly windy here.

265
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,340
My gosh, the wind...

266
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,410
It's getting stronger.

267
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,210
The wind actually stings.

268
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,879
My gosh. The hill...

269
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,150
(Heading over to the top where the wireless repeater is)

270
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,950
(Sniffling)

271
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,149
(Panting)

272
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,089
(Gasping for breath)

273
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,920
It could be quite dangerous here.

274
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
It's so dangerous.

275
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,690
It's really dangerous.

276
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,390
Oh, my.

277
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,990
(Struggling)

278
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,059
My goodness.

279
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,200
(Staggering)

280
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,770
(Staggering again)

281
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,709
Be careful. It's a cliff.

282
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,310
(Soo Hyang staggers.)

283
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,650
We were hiking toward a cliff.

284
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,550
It was just way too windy.

285
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,250
(Plopping down)

286
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,420
Gosh, this is no joke.

287
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,920
I thought one wrong step could send me rolling down the hill.

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,260
It was terrifying.

289
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,630
Gosh, I can't see anything.

290
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,500
The blizzard was so strong that I couldn't see ahead.

291
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,000
It was really challenging.

292
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
(Sniffling)

293
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,340
My nose hadn't been that runny in my entire life.

294
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,550
I think I could fill a bucket with the snot from that day.

295
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,519
(SUHO's walking on all fours with a runny nose.)

296
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,319
(Crew Soo Hyang, Crew SUHO)

297
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,760
(The crew members are gradually getting tired.)

298
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,560
We're almost there. We can do this.

299
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,600
(Amazed)

300
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:00,970
(After 1.5km of rough terrain, they finally face...)

301
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,410
My gosh.

302
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,339
(the repeater on Nabi Hill.)

303
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,750
No way!

304
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,479
(They arrived at Nabi Hill.)

305
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,750
This is great.

306
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,960
It's like climbing Mount Everest.

307
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,490
The journey there was way too tough.

308
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,200
Even standing on Nabi Hill was a challenge.

309
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,430
It was physically demanding.

310
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,870
But I was able to overcome it...

311
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,739
because it felt like I was gaining...

312
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,940
an experience far more valuable in Antarctica.

313
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,380
Let's put down our bags.

314
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,109
I'll start repairing it now.

315
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

316
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,120
(The repair on the repeater begins in earnest.)

317
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,790
(Today's tasks)

318
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,120
(1. Reinstall the repeater.)

319
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,490
(2. Replace the antenna.)

320
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,900
(3. Check on the battery condition.)

321
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,170
(The strong wind continues to sweep in.)

322
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,699
(They begin the repair work amid the extreme conditions.)

323
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
It's super windy here.

324
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,040
(Today's task: Replace the antenna.)

325
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,009
(Crew Kang Dong Gyeong, Crew SUHO)

326
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,150
We must replace it with a new antenna.

327
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,380
(They begin by disassembling the attached antenna.)

328
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,060
(They work together to pick up the speed.)

329
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Nice.

330
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:29,530
(Separating it from the support fixture)

331
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,500
(Next up, they disassemble the screws.)

332
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,440
(Pulling out his soft hands)

333
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,810
SUHO, put your gloves on. Your fingers will freeze up.

334
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,540
I'm okay.

335
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,980
(The most passionate man works diligently with his bare hands.)

336
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,250
(Grunting)

337
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,550
Okay.

338
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,220
What? It's not working.

339
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,850
I can force it then.

340
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,620
Come on.

341
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Come on.

342
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
My goodness.

343
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,500
(While the most passionate man is unscrewing...)

344
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,530
(What are Soo Hyang and Crew Byeong Hak doing?)

345
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,369
SUHO, you can find a repeater...

346
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,700
in your bag.

347
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,669
It's an analog repeater.

348
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,410
(Putting in a new repeater first)

349
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,140
Soo Hyang, could you tighten that up?

350
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,310
Okay.

351
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,950
(I got it.)

352
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,080
- Where is the nail?
- Here.

353
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,479
(Taking off her gloves)

354
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,819
Aren't your hands freezing?

355
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,920
- I'm fine.
- Oh, my.

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,930
(Holding the drill)

357
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,630
(Soo Hyang tightens it without any trouble.)

358
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,170
(Working bare-handed in minus 17°C)

359
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,640
Soo Hyang, you're incredible.

360
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,640
You're really good at this.

361
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,050
The wind is so strong.

362
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,580
It's nothing.

363
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,380
You should tough it out.

364
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,649
We can get through this.

365
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,290
(Even strong winds can't stop this rookie honorary crew member.)

366
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,160
Is it done?

367
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,630
Yes, you can close it.

368
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,100
(The new repeater installation is complete.)

369
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,359
- Once you open it, - Yes.

370
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,229
- press the button inside.
- Okay.

371
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,799
- You'll see the remaining battery.
- Yes.

372
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,640
Please check if it's fully charged.

373
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,510
(Opening the battery box)

374
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,880
(The battery is at 100 percent.)

375
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,649
- Is it at 100 percent?
- Yes.

376
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,089
- Okay.
- Okay.

377
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,250
It's going well.

378
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,690
We're doing great.

379
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,219
(Soo Hyang is totally on top of it.)

380
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,589
Your hands must be frozen, but you're doing great.

381
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,490
(Soo Hyang is totally on top of it.)

382
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,630
This must go here.

383
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,530
This one goes here.

384
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,300
I'm sure it goes like this.

385
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Could you hook them up?

386
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,470
You're so good at this.

387
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,210
I should hand my role off to you.

388
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,650
(A promising communications member, well-regarded by the 37th crew)

389
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,979
(The only remaining task is the antenna replacement.)

390
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,779
You're really doing it well.

391
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,850
(It's just about finished.)

392
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,190
Look!

393
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,760
(They both turn around.)

394
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
Look!

395
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
(The toolbox is blowing away.)

396
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,899
What's happened?

397
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,740
(It happened in the blink of an eye.)

398
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,269
(Astonished)

399
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,440
Did you not hear that?

400
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,070
Something blew away.

401
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
Is it okay to let it blow away?

402
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,010
We should go pick that up.

403
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,109
We'll find it after we finish this. Don't go. It's dangerous.

404
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,550
- Okay.
- It's dangerous.

405
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,479
I can't even see it. The wind carried it down there.

406
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,520
(The toolbox location is unclear.)

407
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,950
I can't believe it blew away.

408
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,490
This is no joke.

409
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,060
The toolbox was pretty heavy.

410
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,760
But the wind was strong enough to just snatch it away.

411
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,430
I can't see anything.

412
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,509
(A sudden gust of wind frightens everyone.)

413
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,540
What? What did you say we should do?

414
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,280
I thought we could be in big trouble...

415
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,820
if the weather kept up like this.

416
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,180
(The crew gets hit...)

417
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,449
We're on hold because the wind is too heavy.

418
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,489
(by a strong blast of wind.)

419
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,820
It's too windy to do anything.

420
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:26,830
(The weather turns harsh instantly.)

421
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,900
(Heavy snow is causing near-zero visibility.)

422
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,169
I'll close it now so the snow doesn't get in.

423
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,170
Okay.

424
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,580
That was the strongest wind I had ever felt in my life.

425
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,850
Oh, my.

426
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,120
The blizzard was awful.

427
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,219
I couldn't even stand up.

428
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,590
I honestly thought we were in serious danger.

429
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,760
- Wait. I need a minute.
- Okay.

430
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,200
I couldn't stop thinking that we could all end up stranded.

431
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,100
Be careful, everyone.

432
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,069
(They can barely walk...)

433
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,110
(because of the strong wind.)

434
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,910
(Holding a heavy 10kg tripod)

435
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,480
(The snow piles up in seconds.)

436
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,180
Soo Hyang, it's dangerous. That side is dangerous.

437
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,490
Come here.

438
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,520
I was terrified.

439
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,959
(Work can't be delayed any longer.)

440
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Get that for me.

441
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,760
(Getting the equipment secured safely first)

442
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,629
- We should put it in like this?
- Yes.

443
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,569
(The crew members are picking up speed.)

444
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,699
- Here's what we can do.
- Are you sure...

445
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
you're okay without gloves?

446
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Yes.

447
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:40,969
(Tightening the antenna screws)

448
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,970
It's done.

449
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,139
Could you hold the top? It's swaying like crazy.

450
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,480
(Finally, they're almost finished.)

451
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,150
It's done.

452
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,790
We did it.

453
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,289
- Yes.
- It's done.

454
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,720
Let's go down now.

455
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,889
Nice.

456
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,490
When you see the light on, please run a communication check.

457
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,260
Yes.

458
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,100
Hello, communication room. This is Nabi Hill.

459
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,970
(Will the radio work?)

460
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,440
(There's no response from the walkie-talkie.)

461
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,120
(They only hear the wind howling.)

462
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,389
Hello, communication room. This is Nabi Hill.

463
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,160
(Trying it again)

464
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,460
(The wind is just howling louder.)

465
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,670
(They get a response.)

466
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,200
Hi, Crew Im Soo Hyang. This is King Sejong Station.

467
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,910
We just connected the power.

468
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,250
Please check the reception.

469
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,750
(Come on...)

470
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,759
We've got a great reception.

471
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,759
I can hear you loud and clear.

472
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,160
(They can hear me loud and clear.)

473
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,099
Communication room. This is Im Soo Hyang.

474
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,129
We've got a great signal and reception.

475
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,429
(The repeater replacement is complete.)

476
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,400
I felt like I had become...

477
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,640
a real crew member at the King Sejong Station.

478
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,280
We came here as the honorary crew.

479
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,340
As a crew member,

480
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,110
I was proud...

481
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,450
we could help.

482
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,290
I felt like we were becoming one.

483
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,759
Like part of the family,

484
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,729
I wanted to contribute in any way possible...

485
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,199
to lighten the winter crew's load.

486
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,030
I was glad I decided to come.

487
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,270
I could really feel all the effort they put into this.

488
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
All the tools are here.

489
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,570
Are they all there?

490
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,239
Let's grab them first.

491
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,810
(They recover the toolbox and complete the mission.)

492
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,640
(Recognizing the hard work of the winter crew, yet again)

493
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,149
Great work.

494
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,209
(Their work at Nabi Hill is finished.)

495
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,309
Aren't you hungry?

496
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,249
I can't wait to have lunch.

497
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,280
I can't wait either.

498
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,789
Since the weather keeps on getting worse,

499
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,619
let's head to the emergency shelter.

500
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,890
- Okay.
- We'll have lunch there.

501
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,189
(Now that their work is finished, they're enjoying some sledding.)

502
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,530
This is cool. What do you think?

503
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,760
Yes.

504
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,460
My gosh, you're really good at it.

505
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,370
(The excitement has the crew members feeling like kids again.)

506
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,410
I'm hungry.

507
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm starving.

508
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,280
(The starving crew members reach the emergency shelter.)

509
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,620
(About 10 emergency shelters near the King Sejong Station)

510
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,989
(Korea manages 3 of them.)

511
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,790
(King Sejong Station, Nabi Hill, Penguin Village)

512
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,830
(The crew members arrive...)

513
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,870
(near the penguin colony, home to all those cute penguins.)

514
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,510
(Penguin Village Emergency Shelter)

515
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,120
(The 37th winter crew built this shelter.)

516
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,390
(Emergency shelters are open to anyone at any time.)

517
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,060
(Also, all emergency shelters in Antarctica...)

518
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:27,830
(are accessible to anyone in a crisis, )

519
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,440
(regardless of their nationality.)

520
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,810
(Stocked with essential supplies for unavoidable emergencies)

521
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,780
(The emergency shelters are critical to the crew's survival.)

522
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,950
Here we are.

523
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,390
I'm starving.

524
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,559
Great job.

525
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,719
(It's like an oasis in Antarctica for the wind-weary crew members.)

526
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,790
Good work.

527
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,960
(We can finally relax.)

528
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,059
- Byeong Hak.
- Yes.

529
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,929
Get set up for lunch fast since we're off-base.

530
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,430
- I...
- It's in Soo Hyang's bag.

531
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,400
- I have them.
- It's in her bag.

532
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,609
Crew Paik Jong Won and Chae Jong Hyeop prepared...

533
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,909
our boxed meal.

534
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,210
Our boxed meal.

535
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,910
(What's in the boxed meal?)

536
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,579
(Amazed)

537
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,980
- It's amazing.
- It's really nice.

538
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,590
(The boxed meal for the hardworking crew members)

539
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,020
What I have in mind is...

540
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,189
something quick to eat for lunch.

541
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,489
Rice balls would be good.

542
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,659
We can make some side dishes that go well with the rice balls.

543
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,659
We can also make some hot soup...

544
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,199
and put it in an insulated bottle.

545
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,969
We'll use the leftovers from breakfast for the rice balls.

546
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,739
We could either chop them up and mix them into the rice...

547
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,469
or use them as filling.

548
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,339
I made sure the dishes packed a lot of calories.

549
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,810
For the side dishes, I made Buffalo wings,

550
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,109
fried sausages,

551
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,119
and sweet potato croquettes.

552
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,719
They are all fried.

553
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,620
So I'm sure they're getting plenty of calories.

554
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,820
People usually put encouraging messages in boxed meals.

555
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,890
They must be freezing up there on the mountain.

556
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,660
So I made the boxed meal as my encouraging message.

557
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,300
I hope it gives them a little boost.

558
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,200
Cut it in half.

559
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,169
- Cut it like this.
- Okay.

560
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,969
And then do it like this.

561
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,499
(Cutting the sausages in half and scoring cross-cuts)

562
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,610
You can do it, right?

563
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,570
Let's put our heart into it.

564
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,940
(Okay!)

565
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,780
(Taking great care to make it as beautiful as possible)

566
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,019
I used the leftovers from breakfast this morning...

567
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,789
as well as the leftovers from dinner last night.

568
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,060
I only chopped the meat patties, leaving out the garlic scapes.

569
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,290
(Chopping them)

570
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,370
(Getting pickled radish)

571
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,139
Actually, sesame oil and mayonnaise go well together.

572
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,470
(Adding the mayonnaise generously)

573
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,640
(Mixing the pickled radishes and mayonnaise)

574
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,040
Fry them all. You're the fritter master.

575
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,450
(Frying them)

576
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,750
(Taking out the fried sausages)

577
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,589
(Croquettes, frozen breaded shrimp)

578
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,160
(Frying the rest of the ingredients)

579
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,930
(Exuding the vibe of the fritter master)

580
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,600
Get over here. This is our most important job.

581
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,429
(Chopped meat patties, fried shrimp, pickled radish with mayonnaise)

582
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,570
Here we go.

583
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,100
Let's make rice balls.

584
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,470
Make it baseball-sized.

585
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:23,040
(All three ingredients are for the rice balls.)

586
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,239
(Putting in the chopped meat patties first)

587
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,340
Just put in a little bit.

588
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,980
(Adding the pickled radish with mayonnaise)

589
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,279
(Adding fried shrimp for the extra crunch)

590
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,420
Put 2 or 3 pieces in.

591
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,050
(Lastly, shaping it into a ball.)

592
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,850
One fried shrimp. And wrap it.

593
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,989
This looks good.

594
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,059
(Finished with laver flakes)

595
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,660
Doesn't it look tasty and refreshing?

596
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,359
Here are the lettuces that only our station has.

597
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,400
(And one more thing)

598
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,129
It'll look much better. Just wait and see.

599
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,570
(The lettuce to make the boxed meal look better)

600
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,399
I see. We're putting in some greens.

601
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,069
- It looks much better, doesn't it?
- Yes.

602
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,540
(Plating it to look colorful and appetizing)

603
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,580
(Packing beef bone soup that simmered with dried pollack)

604
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,449
(Simple but hearty rice balls)

605
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,290
(Buffalo wings, fried sausages, croquettes, and lettuce)

606
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,389
It smells so good.

607
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,519
(Jong Won and Jong Hyeop's hearty boxed meals)

608
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,860
I smell something savory.

609
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,660
It looks so delicious.

610
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,930
(Enjoy your meal.)

611
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,099
Let's eat.

612
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,299
(It's time to fill their hungry belly.)

613
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,330
- Is it good?
- My gosh.

614
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,469
I'm sure it'll taste amazing.

615
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,969
(Trying the rice ball first)

616
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,100
It's going down so well.

617
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,740
I'm starving.

618
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,709
(Soo Hyang is also having a big bite.)

619
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,910
I was so hungry.

620
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,480
This rice ball is making me emotional.

621
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,489
I could really feel the care and heart they put into it.

622
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,490
So I really enjoyed the meal.

623
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:49,090
I haven't had a boxed meal made by someone in ages.

624
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,590
So it was very touching.

625
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,430
Look at this sausage.

626
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,900
- It looks like an octopus.
- Yes.

627
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,670
They put so much heart and effort into this.

628
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,910
(Delicious-looking sausages made with love)

629
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,880
(Slurping)

630
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,580
(Warming up with the hot soup)

631
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,090
- Is it hot?
- Yes.

632
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,050
You have to try this.

633
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,260
(Let me try it then.)

634
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,090
(Sighing in awe)

635
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,070
(The hot soup is impossible to put down.)

636
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,470
(Amazed)

637
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,739
It really warms me up.

638
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,339
- It's running through me.
- Yes. Totally.

639
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,740
(Thanks to that hot soup, they're warming up.)

640
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,379
(Without saying a word, )

641
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,610
(SUHO is busy eating.)

642
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,620
I couldn't even talk because I was starving.

643
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,890
(A rice ball in one hand and a Buffalo wing in the other)

644
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,260
(Munching)

645
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,930
(Laughing)

646
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,499
SUHO is really enjoying his food.

647
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,530
(Even savoring the lettuce)

648
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,039
He was starving.

649
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,440
(I'm so hungry.)

650
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,339
You look like a runaway prince.

651
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,940
(Looking like a prince who just ran away from home)

652
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,140
You're totally right.

653
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:21,280
Do you usually work in this kind of weather?

654
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,890
We usually avoid this for safety reasons,

655
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,890
but today was the only time we had.

656
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,190
We were actually forced to do it.

657
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,129
I doubt everyone here was a researcher first.

658
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,760
How did you...

659
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,400
Were you transferred here while working at a company? Or what?

660
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,570
It varies from person to person.

661
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,209
Crew Kwon Oh Seok and Crew Kim Gi Hyeon...

662
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,479
have been assigned here.

663
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
(Some have been assigned here from other organizations.)

664
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,880
Other crew members...

665
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,049
- Did they apply for it?
- applied for the position.

666
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,820
They came after they were selected.

667
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,120
Yes.

668
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,120
Where can I find the job listing for Antarctica?

669
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,720
I think you can only come across it when you're interested in it. Or...

670
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,059
- What about you?
- I wasn't interested in it at all.

671
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,360
Where did you find the recruitment?

672
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,329
While I was scrolling through social media in my room,

673
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,540
I saw the post someone had uploaded.

674
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,239
I found it in an open group chat.

675
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,339
Who... Wait, an open group chat?

676
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,979
- What kind of group chat is that?
- It's a group chat...

677
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,309
for people in the IT field.

678
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,110
There must be hundreds of people in the group chat.

679
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,209
Someone wrote,

680
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,450
"The job listings for Antarctica are up. Anyone interested?"

681
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,950
I'm sure that person didn't even apply.

682
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,190
I don't think so.

683
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,860
Others might have also applied,

684
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,990
but you're the one who was selected.

685
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,060
Yes. How lucky.

686
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,700
You might've been meant to come to Antarctica.

687
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,040
I think only the chosen ones get to come here.

688
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,340
Do you guys feel like you were meant to be here too?

689
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,780
Of course.

690
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,710
We're in the same boat. Out of all those celebrities,

691
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,349
- Right.
- we were the ones chosen,

692
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,779
almost like it was meant to be.

693
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,350
(It was destiny that we were picked over all those other celebrities.)

694
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,390
(Four crew members bound by destiny meet today.)

695
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,060
(Looking forward to their journey that feels like destiny)

696
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,399
Let's go.

697
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,700
(Heading back to the King Sejong Station now)

698
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,869
(This time, the crew is heading...)

699
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,270
(to the Penguin Village.)

700
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,970
(Thousands of penguins before their eyes)

701
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,470
(Waddling)

702
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,840
(They're cute.)

703
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,610
(They just thought penguins were cute.)

704
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,579
(They bite.)

705
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,150
(The truth about the penguins comes out.)

706
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,250
(They pooped.)

707
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,280
(It feels so good.)

708
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,850
(Argentina Carlini Base)

709
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,249
(Welcome)

710
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,490
(My name is Paik!)

711
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,960
(Chef of Antarctica's first off-station cooking)

712
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,959
We need to slice the meat as thin as we can.

713
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,190
(Pushing)

714
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,800
(Making a meal for the Argentine crew)

715
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,430
(It's tasty.)

716
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,770
(How come you're so irresponsible?)

717
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,295
(A different kitchen from the King Sejong Station)

718
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,240
(Things don't go as planned.)

719
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,499
