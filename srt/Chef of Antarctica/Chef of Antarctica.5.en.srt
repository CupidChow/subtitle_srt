(Why is the crew gathered in the cafeteria?)

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,464
Why did the secretary gather us here?

6
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:28,394
Did we do something wrong?

7
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,403
- There's word that...
- Were we too loud?

8
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:33,604
- You've been snacking too much.
- We've been snacking too much.

9
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,504
- We had too much of their coffee.
- Not me.

10
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:40,204
(He's joking.)

11
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:42,813
- Hey.
- Here he is.

12
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:44,943
- I'm sorry for asking you here.
- We weren't busy.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,813
Why did you have us over on your break...

14
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,113
- and not when you needed a hand?
- I had a request...

15
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,324
and thought I'd bring it up during your break.

16
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:53,424
A radio call just came in.

17
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:59,023
You know the three from the Penguin Research Team.

18
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,293
- The Penguin Research Team? Sure.
- Anyway,

19
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,763
after being stuck inside for days,

20
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:04,763
they're finally out at work...

21
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:05,803
and completely swamped.

22
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:08,274
- Due to bad weather, right?
- I'm afraid so.

23
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,143
We were told that they couldn't make it to dinner today.

24
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:13,144
- They can't make it back?
- That's right.

25
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,944
That's why they requested a boxed meal.

26
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:18,743
(A moment ago, the communication room)

27
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,043
Communications,

28
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:21,354
this is Kim Jee Hui from Summer Research Team.

29
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,784
Our work out here has been extended,

30
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:27,824
so we're requesting a boxed meal for dinner.

31
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:31,694
Sure. We'll contact you after sorting out the details.

32
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,663
Thank you.

33
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,233
(The team is busy catching up on work...)

34
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:37,803
(and has requested a boxed meal.)

35
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,373
Since you're good at everything,

36
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:43,673
I wanted to ask if that was possible.

37
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:45,273
The Penguin Village...

38
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:46,874
- must be far away.
- It is.

39
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,113
- It's an hour away.
- Really?

40
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:51,613
- An hour just to get there?
- At least 40 minutes.

41
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:53,813
It takes two hours to get there and back.

42
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,754
- Around an hour and a half.
- So for three meals... No way.

43
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:59,124
Sometimes they have to work without eating anything.

44
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,424
I've noticed them missing from the cafeteria.

54
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:04,554
(But if the weather's bad or they're busy working, )

55
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:10,564
(they have boxed meals or occasionally skip eating.)

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,293
How can we deliver the food to them?

57
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:13,463
We need someone to guide us.

58
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,233
Some members of my team...

59
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:18,133
had work to do at Penguin Village but couldn't...

60
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:20,934
- because of bad weather.
- How many are there?

61
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,533
Two from my team.

62
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,703
One researcher in biology and one in atmospheric science.

63
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,544
Since they're going out there to continue their work,

64
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:29,713
maybe you could make meals for them too.

65
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:33,083
- They could take us there.
- Right.

66
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:35,353
That's 3 for the penguin team, 2 for your team,

67
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:37,953
and 4 for us, which is 9 in total.

68
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:39,023
That's right.

69
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,453
Chef An will have to cook...

70
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,963
- for the others today.
- I guess so.

71
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:47,094
The crew won't like it if we're not around.

72
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,293
A boxed meal?

73
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,633
- We'll discuss what we can cook.
- Sure.

74
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,433
- Please give them a good meal.
- As if you need to ask.

75
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:53,603
Thank you so much.

76
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:54,904
We should work hard until our last day here.

77
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:59,473
(Episode 3: Penguin Village, Antarctica City)

78
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:00,873
What I heard...

79
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,943
is that the penguin research team hates fish the most.

80
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,983
- Any kind of fish.
- They don't want that at all.

81
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:09,513
It smells strongly of fish where they work.

82
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:12,253
Whatever we prepare shouldn't have any fishy smell.

83
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,094
They really hate it.

84
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:17,323
It should also taste good when cold.

85
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,194
(Requirement for boxed meals 2: Must taste good when cold)

86
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,634
How about a soup?

87
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:24,733
- Maybe soup and rice.
- Will it go cold...

88
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,303
if we prepare soup with rice?

89
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,003
Wouldn't porridge be a better option?

90
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,603
- Porridge?
- That's what I think.

91
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,774
Porridge? I guess you have a point.

92
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,473
Let's make a porridge with healthy ingredients then.

93
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,913
- Like an energy booster.
- Sounds good.

94
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:38,513
- I'd like that.
- Porridge is a nice idea.

95
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,484
- I mean, it's cold outside.
- Right.

96
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:41,683
From what I've heard,

97
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:43,853
they usually pack cold rice balls...

98
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,623
and eat them with ramyeon.

99
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:47,084
That didn't sound right,

100
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,024
especially since we're here...

101
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:50,724
to cook for them.

102
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:55,763
(All they want is for the Penguin Research Team...)

103
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:59,234
(working out in the cold to have a hearty meal.)

104
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,733
I'm fond of boxed meals myself,

105
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,774
and I enjoy them.

106
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:07,074
Being served a thoughtful boxed meal really boosts your energy.

107
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,244
We should make porridge with meat.

108
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:10,684
Porridge with meat.

109
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,954
I also saw ugeoji and mallow in the pantry.

110
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:17,624
I got it. Let's make mallow beef doenjang porridge.

111
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:19,854
Doenjang porridge sounds amazing.

112
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,793
That'd be delicious.

113
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,194
Doenjang porridge sounds good.

114
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,794
Nice.

115
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:35,474
(Final decision: Mallow beef doenjang porridge)

116
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:44,114
(Hang tight. We'll be right there with your tasty meal.)

117
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:48,854
(They begin their kitchen prep after changing clothes.)

118
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,384
Mallow.

119
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:54,293
Just mallow won't give it enough texture.

120
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:57,124
- Dried radish greens?
- Let's add dried radish greens too.

121
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,664
(For a more interesting texture, )

122
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,934
(they'll add dried radish greens to the mallow.)

123
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,004
Frozen carrots.

124
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,303
Frozen carrots?

125
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:08,573
- Is one packet enough?
- Yes.

126
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:10,133
Frozen carrots are over there.

127
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:11,274
Onions.

128
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,144
I only need a packet of onions.

129
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:19,214
(Defrosting all the ingredients they need)

130
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,684

(A thick cut of beef tenderloin)

133
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,774
(It's cut into bite-sized cubes.)

134
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,613
Oh, gosh. They don't have decent meat here,

135
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,614
so I'm cooking porridge with beef tenderloin.

136
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,143
(Normally, porridge is made with rump steak or chuck.)

137
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,283
Does it smell?

138
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,113
No, it's just that we usually cook steaks with tenderloin.

139
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,623
I'm worried this might give off a gamey smell.

140
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:00,454
(Today, they're making porridge with premium tenderloin.)

141
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,254
What should we do if we're worried about the smell?

142
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,693
Rinse and boil...

143
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,463
the meat.

144
00:07:07,464 --> 00:07:09,163
- What about the red juice?
- You should rinse that out.

145
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:10,904
Exactly, and that's most of the work.

146
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,304
I'll cut the meat for you, so rinse it in water.

147
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:14,634
Sure.

148
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:17,744
- I'll rinse the rice in the pot.
- Sure.

149
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:22,044
(Jong Hyeop's on rice duty.)

150
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:29,414

Amazing.

No, not that much.

168
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:49,563
Awesome.

169
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,634
Adding too much doenjang...

170
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,104
can be off-putting for people who don't like it.

171
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,874
Don't all Koreans like doenjang?

172

00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,264
(Nice)

179
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:30,133
It's like a risotto.

180
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,243
(Adding rice to the thickened sauce)

181
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:32,644
- Is it doenjang risotto?
- Yes, doenjang risotto.

182
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:40,014
(Stirring well so that it doesn't stick)

183
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:46,084
(Adjusting consistency with water)

184
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:54,394
(Keep stirring until the rice is cooked!)

185
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:58,104
(Shall we begin?)

186
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,973
The key to good porridge is love...

187
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:03,933
and steady effort.

188
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,644
(Stirring for 15 minutes)

189
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:10,844
(Sighing...)

190
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,814
(After the pickled radish nightmare, )

191
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:19,384
(he's now in a porridge nightmare.)

192
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:21,253
I bet you're tired. Should I take over?

193
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,294
(No, I'm good.)

194
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:24,494
You...

195
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,264
You remind me of Cinderella.

196
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:28,994
Remy from "Ratatouille?"

197
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,134
No, Cinderella.

198
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,863
(SUHO-ella)

199
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:36,034
You're like Cinderella, who had to do all the work.

200
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,044
- Should I keep stirring?
- Yes.

201
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:42,444
It would stick to the pan if I paused even for a moment,

202
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:44,814
so I kept stirring.

203
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:48,853
This is exhausting.

204
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:52,684
(SUHO-ella stirred for 15 minutes more...)

205
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,253
- Is it done?
- It is.

206
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,293
Then, turn it on.

207
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,494
(It's now time for the final step.)

208
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:57,963
(Mallow and dried radish greens)

209
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,094
In they go.

210
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:01,064
Add them all.

211
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,194
This looks delicious.

212
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,164
Look at that.

213
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,859
Goodness.

214
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,434
(Pouring it all in)

215
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,344
Let me give you a reason to stay motivated.

216
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:17,884
Oh, my.

217
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:19,344
Delicious, right?

218
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:21,913
The mushrooms smell great.

219
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:26,954
(The aroma of mushrooms fills the mouth.)

220
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,154
- Are you motivated?
- I am.

221
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:33,294
(I just need to stir a bit more, and it'll be done!)

222
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:36,734
(Looking around)

223
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:39,733
Should we just season some salt-pickled radish?

224
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:40,974
Do we need more side dishes?

225
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,434
- Side dishes?
- Yes.

226
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:47,044
We have some salt-pickled radish left over from a previous serving.

227
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,273
Let's pack this as a side dish.

228
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,044
(Let's pack this too.)

229
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:53,844
(How does it taste?)

230
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:57,924
(The first bite goes to the hard-working Cinderella.)

231
00:11:58,624 --> 00:11:59,724
How is it?

232
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,254
- Wait.
- I gave you one slice.

233
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,794
Hold on.

234
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,294
To be honest, this is really salty.

235
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,993
What was that?

236
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,364
(What?)

237
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:09,863
Can you taste this for me?

238
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:10,933
(What does the seasoning checker think?)

239
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:12,034
How is it?

240
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,003
- It's salty.
- Is it?

241
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:17,333
(It's salty.)

242
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,574
It's close to just pickled radish.

243
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,243
- What?
- It's close to just pickled radish.

244
00:12:20,244 --> 00:12:21,414
She's right.

245
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:23,743
Really?

246
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,344
(Then, I have a way!)

247
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,843
(It's time to present Paik Jong Won's magic.)

248
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,053
Sugar.

249
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,714
(It's time to present Paik Jong Won's magic.)

250
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,324
(Sesame seeds)

251
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,124
(Sugar)

252
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,764
(Sesame oil to enhance the nutty flavor)

253
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:40,894
(Adding spice with chili powder)

254
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:43,064
Nice.

255
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:47,004
I think this will go well with doenjang porridge.

256
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,733
This looks delicious.

257
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,874
(Did it revive the salt-pickled radish?)

258
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:53,804
Is the seasoning right?

259
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,714
(The new flavors make her break out into a dance.)

260
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:03,153
(Cinderella tries some too.)

261
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,284
It's good.

262
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,524
(Surprised)

263
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:09,524
It's been brought back to life.

264
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:13,464
(As if that's surprising.)

265
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:16,793
(Thanks to Crew Paik, )

266
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:21,034
(it became a spicy and sweet salt-pickled radish side dish.)

267
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:23,004
Get the thermos jar ready.

268
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:24,134
Got it.

269
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,703
(The mallow beef doenjang porridge is finally ready.)

270
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:29,443
- Pour hot water into them.
- Sure.

271
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:31,584
Warm them up with hot water.

272
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,013
It's better to heat them up before pouring in the food.

273
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,253
(Crew Paik's Cooking Tip: Heat the thermos before use.)

274
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:39,384
Warming them up first? Now that's attention to detail.

275
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:41,593
(A lid is placed over the pot to keep the porridge warm.)

276
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:42,794
Nicely done.

277
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:44,924
Good.

278
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:46,964
- Now, go and get changed.
- Sure.

279
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,133
Shall we get changed?

280
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:50,394
- Did you pour hot water in them?
- Yes.

281
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:56,534
(Crew Paik wants to serve the food as warm as possible.)

282
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,074
A boxed meal...

283
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:01,944
can represent a lot of things.

284
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:04,783
It's how you show support...

285
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:07,444
for your children who are studying.

286
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,953
It's also a way to support the one...

287
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,554
who provides for the family.

288
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,424
Since boxed meals often carry a message of support,

289
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:17,554
I made sure ours did as well.

290
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:19,123
I hope that feeling is conveyed.

291
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,124
(A message of support delivered through a boxed meal)

292
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,563
- Shall we head out?
- Sure.

293
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,904
(Hoping the Penguin Research Team will enjoy it...)

294
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:26,133
See you later.

295
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:27,304
We'll get going.

296
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,734
Enjoy your dinner.

297
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:33,674
Twelve people are leaving the base.

298
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:37,574
(Heading out with crew members who will guide them to Penguin Village)

299
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,684
You must've seen a lot of penguins by now.

300
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,613
We saw some on our first day,

301
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,553
and later we saw them swimming.

302
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:45,353
We haven't seen any since then.

303
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,123
Since this is their habitat,

304
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:48,624
- you'll see plenty of them.
- Right.

305
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,593
- You'll see their true selves.
- Really?

306
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:52,724
(You'll see their true selves.)

307
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:56,733
(What kind of place is Penguin Village?)

308
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:59,933
(King Sejong Station, Current location)

309
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,704
(Penguin Village, about an hour on foot)

310
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:05,044
(Walking along the coast)

311
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,314
What's that?

312
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:11,743
(What Jong Won spotted)

313
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,943
That piece of wood over there.

314
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:15,153
That's not wood, it's whale bone.

315
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:16,954
(Whale bone)

316
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,053
- Is that a whale bone?
- Yes.

317
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:21,553
You can sometimes find dead whales...

318
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,024
- or their bones along the coast.
- Guys, that's a whale bone.

319
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,463
I thought it was a log.

320
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:26,494
(Who knew we'd get to see a whale bone up close?)

321
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,063
It really is a whale bone.

322
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:32,134
- I can tell it's a bone up close.
- That's right.

323
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,473
- There aren't any trees here.
- Exactly.

324
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:36,574
I knew it seemed off.

325
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:43,344
- That must be a whale bone too.
- Yes, it's a whale bone.

326
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,413
That's not a rock but a whale bone.

327
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:48,013
- It's a whale's backbone.
- That's right.

328
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,083
- The spine.
- Yes, it's from the spine.

329
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,223
This is fascinating.

330
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:52,224
(The spine looks like a rock.)

331

(Whales that swim in the Antarctic Sea)

332
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:06,603
(Sometimes, traces of those whales...)

333
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:08,404
- Those are all whale bones.
- That's right.

334
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,334
- You can recognize now.
- Yes.

335
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,103
There are bones everywhere.

336
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:17,074
(A unique coastal view seen only in Antarctica)

337
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:21,043
I'm getting hot.

338
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,713
I know. It's hot, isn't it?

339
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,584
(After a walk that worked up a sweat)

340
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,523
We're now entering...

341
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:30,093
- the ASPA.
- What's its number?

342
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,293
It's ASPA No. 171.

343
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:32,323
- Is it 171?
- What?

344
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,693
- There's a number missing.
- One of the numbers...

345
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,793
has worn off, which is why you can't see it.

346
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,263
ASPA stands for Antarctic Specially Protected Area.

347
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,663
That's right.

What do we do?

353
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:59,554
- We must wear protective suits.
- Protective suits?

354
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,153
You can wear them over your clothes.

355
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,123
All kinds of dirty stuff can get on your clothes,

356
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,323
so you'll throw this away later.

357
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:08,394
(Struggling)

358
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,834
(SUHO's unfamiliar with the protective suit.)

359
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,033
It's the same as the hazmat suits worn...

360
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,773
during foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.

361
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:17,838
(Meanwhile, Paik puts it on with ease, sitting on a rock.)

362
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:19,365
I've been to...

363
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:23,043
so many pig, cow,

364
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,084
and poultry farms.

365
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,413
Don't I look like a pro?

366
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,153
(Don't I look like a pro?)

367
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:29,753
- You must have worn this a lot.
- What was that?

368
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:31,553
- You're not new at this.
- I'm not.

369
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:32,554
(Veteran Crew Paik puts on the suit as easily as he cooks.)

370
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,193
(Groaning)

371
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:36,454
Thanks.

372
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,723
Shall we?

373
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,464
- We'll follow your lead.
- Got it.

374
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:43,494
Communications, come in.

375
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:46,103
We're entering Penguin Village.

376
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:49,804
(Entering the area carrying warm boxed meals and excitement)

377
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,273
When will I ever get another chance to be in a village filled...

378
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:54,973
with thousands of penguins?

379
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,444
I felt excited and nervous at the same time.

380
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:01,453
Wait a second.

381
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:04,654
Before we continue, there's something you should know.

382
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,853
If you look up at the sky,

383
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,894
you'll see a variety of bird species.

384
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:12,863
(Home to 14 species of birds, )

385
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,364
(including gentoo penguins and chinstrap penguins)

386
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,264
(Greater sheathbill, the cleaner of Antarctica)

387
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:23,104
(South Polar Skua, the pirate of Antarctica)

388
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:29,274
(Brown Skua, an opportunistic predator)

389
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,743
(Always after penguin nests, )

390
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,814
(these birds are the archrivals of penguins.)

391
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:40,154
Do you see that caved in part of the rock?

392
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,053
When we pass that area,

393
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,393
you'll see birds called giant petrels,

394
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:47,294
which are one of the biggest birds in Antarctica.

395
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:49,193
Giant petrel?

396
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,334
Yes, they're called giant petrels.

397
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:52,763
They're in the swallow family.

398
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:53,803
(They're giant as their name suggests.)

399
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:55,173
They're in the swallow family,

400
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:57,204
but they don't look like swallows at all.

401
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,244
That's their habitat.

402
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,114
They have babies and lay eggs during this time of year.

403
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:05,683
(They look scary, )

404
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:07,344
(but they're actually just taking care of their babies.)

405
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:12,824
(They're sensitive because it's breeding season.)

406
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:15,253
It'll be best to pass by quietly...

407
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,853
looking straight ahead...

408
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,763
instead of paying attention to them.

409
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:19,823
- Act uninterested?
- Yes.

410
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,123
Just a sideways glance if we want to look?

411
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:23,963
I don't think they'll notice a sideways glance.

412
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,034
(They can act uninterested but look with a sideways glance.)

413
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:31,674
(Antarctic Tern)

414
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,843
(Very nervous)

415
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:34,974
It's that way.

416
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,583
I see giant petrels.

417
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:41,854
(Giant petrels!)

418
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:45,734
Oh, my.

419
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:50,813
The sound of the wings flapping.

420
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,270
There are so many giant petrels here.

421
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,364
- They're big.
- They're very big.

422
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,034
We were passing the Penguin Village.

423
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,443
I was so scared.

424
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:09,644
They were being defensive and making sounds at us.

425
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:11,714
I was scared. Yes.

426
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:17,214
(Guards up)

427
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:20,023
I didn't make eye contact.

428
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:21,424
(I didn't make eye contact...)

429
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,054
(Glancing over)

430
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,194
Oh, this is scary.

431
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:31,064
We're here.

432
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,334
Do you see that there?

433
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,034
Penguin Village.

434
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,704
- You're right.
- There are so many penguins.

435
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,674
This feels like walking up a sled slope.

436
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,574
This is amazing.

437
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,674
This feels like walking up a sled slope.

438
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:45,914
- Right?
- Yes.

439
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:50,883
- Penguins.
- They're so cute.

440
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,254
Look at them climb up.

441
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,453
This is so cool.

442
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,694
(The penguins are climbing the hill.)

443
00:20:58,194 --> 00:20:59,294
This is so cool.

444
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,863
- They're so cute.
- So cute.

445
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:01,994
(Penguins breed on high hills.)

446
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:09,974
This is amazing.

447
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:14,274
Do they climb up there and slide back down?

448
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:16,874
Are they climbing back up after sliding down?

449
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,613
They're so cute. Oh, my goodness.

450
00:21:19,614 --> 00:21:21,814
(You have to climb up the hill to get to Penguin Village.)

451
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:24,414
(Oh, my gosh.)

452
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,953
The way they walk is very cute.

453
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,723
(Waddling)

454
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:30,794
So cute.

455
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:33,864
They're so cute.

456
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:38,934
(Where are you guys going?)

457
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,233
(The penguins coming down)

458
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,403
They're so pretty.

459
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:45,743
That must hurt.

460
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:46,774
Seriously.

461
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:52,614
(We're so busy!)

462
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:02,594
(They're headed out to sea to hunt.)

463
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,464
(What is this?)

464
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:07,863
Why is it red here?

465
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:09,334
(Why is it red here?)

466
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,964
(Penguin Village is full of mysterious red marks.)

467
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,003
(The red marks are...)

468
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:16,274
It's their poop.

469
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:18,503
- Why is it so red?
- So they...

470
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,243
eat lots of krill.

471
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,973
- Krill have a reddish color.
- I see.

472
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:26,014
Like the color of cooked shrimp.

473
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,143
(The color of the krill come right back out...)

474
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:30,114
- It's because of the krill...
- The color of the krill.

475
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:31,924
So this is all...

476
00:22:32,554 --> 00:22:33,953
penguin and bird poop.

477
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,254
(The road is dyed with dirt and poop.)

478
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,393
You know you're stepping on poop, right?

479
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:39,694
- It's penguin poop, right?
- Yes.

480
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:41,523
- Isn't this too much?
- There's nothing we can do.

481
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:43,233
Think of it as a chicken coop.

482
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:44,394
(Think of it as a chicken coop.)

483
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:47,033
(What does Penguin Village look like?)

484
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,233
Let's get up there.

485
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,804
(What does Penguin Village look like?)

486
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,914
(The hill is quite high.)

487
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,643
- Penguins.
- They're so cute.

488
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,914
Look at them climb up.

489
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,214
They're so cute.

490
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:05,254
(Slipping)

491
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:09,624
(Wait for me!)

492
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,824
(Breathing heavily)

493
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,434
The research team comes here every day.

494
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:26,144
It must be very tiring.

495
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:31,213
(It's so tough, even for people.)

496
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:32,414
This is insane.

497
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:33,813
This must be so tough for the penguins.

498
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,614
(You guys are so impressive.)

499
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:38,254
(I'm out of breath.)

500
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,924
It smells like shrimp crackers.

501
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:41,893
(Smelling the intense smell)

502
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,054
The smell.

503
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,424
Oh, the smell.

504
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,293
Look over there.

505
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,794
(They get to the top of the hill.)

506
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:50,134
Oh, the smell.

507
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,634
(Oh, my!)

508
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,674
They're all brooding.

509
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:01,944
Isn't this so fascinating?

510
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:04,374
They kind of mark their territory.

511
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:05,483
You're right.

512
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:08,713
They move around in a circle.

513
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:12,024
(Every November, thousands of penguins...)

514
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:16,924
(visit Penguin Village to lay eggs.)

515
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:20,024
They're all...

516
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,134
brooding right now.

517
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:27,534
(Right now, Penguin Village is in its breeding season.)

518
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:31,982
I guess they make those nest-like things.

519
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,573
With things around them.

520
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,374
- They use rocks and such.
- Right.

521
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:38,983
I guess it's a place for brooding.

522
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:40,213
Like a bed.

523
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,313
That's so cool.

524
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,954
(They build sturdy nests with little rocks.)

525
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:50,054
It's a chinstrap.

526
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:52,964
These look different. On the chin, this one...

527
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,093
- Right?
- Yes, that's a chinstrap penguin.

528
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,163
Chinstrap. This one is different, right?

529
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,433
The one to the left is a gentoo penguin.

530
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,033
The ones with eyebrows.

531
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,003
How are different species working together?

532
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:03,573
Those two are the most common in Penguin Village.

533
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:04,874
Are they close?

534
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:08,613
They're like Americans and Koreans.

535
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:10,574
(They're like people from different countries.)

536
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:14,744
I'm looking at all of the species I saw in documentaries.

537
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:16,983
This is so fascinating.

538
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,054
(This is so fascinating.)

539
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:22,024
(In this fascinating place, )

540
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:26,264
(penguins make nests right on the ground.)

541
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:30,094
(Gentoo penguins nest on the flat part at the top.)

542
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:35,504
(Chinstrap penguins nest on the slope near the beach.)

543
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:45,144
(Approximately 10,000 penguins gather here to breed.)

544
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:50,354
(There are also 14 bird species and 88 plant species here.)

545
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:56,254
(It's seen as an ecologically and scientifically valuable area.)

546
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:03,363
(Antarctic Specially Protected Area)

547
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:07,664
(Antarctic Specially Protected Area)

548
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,773
While a penguin broods,

549
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:13,374
another penguin keeps bringing rocks...

550
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,613
to make a nest.

551
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:18,544
It's so fascinating.

552
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,014
They're so cute.

553
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:23,084
They're even cuter than I imagined.

554
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:28,054
It was my first time seeing penguins up close.

555
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:30,293
The smell of their excrement was very strong.

556
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:31,354
So...

557
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:34,263
from far away, it looks beautiful.

558
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:36,094
Up close, it was a tragedy.

559
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,564
(Oh, gosh.)

560
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,464
The research team must be getting hungry.

561
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,672
Let's go.

562
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:44,834
- They're over there.
- Yes.

563
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:46,644
They're over there.

564
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,144
They're working so hard.

565
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:57,354
Your boxed meals are here.

566
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,494
Your boxed meals are here.

567
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:04,194
It's food!

568
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,564
Oh, my. Look at those clothes.

569
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,763
They must be so tired.

570
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:10,634
(Smudges all over their clothes)

571
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:12,964
Hello.

572
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:14,564
Hello.

573
00:27:15,064 --> 00:27:17,134
I didn't know you worked so hard, but now that we're here, I know.

574
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:21,503
(Their protective suits are dirtied with penguin poop.)

575
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:22,744
This is no joke.

576
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:24,973
- So cool.
- Coming here is no joke.

577
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:26,784
You go back and forth 2 or 3 times a day?

578
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:27,814
Once a day.

579
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:28,983
Twice is too tough.

580
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,413
This is no joke.

581
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:31,483
Are you hungry?

582
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,783
- Yes, we were hungry.
- We're hungry too.

583
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,023
- We're cold and hungry.
- Where do you usually eat?

584
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:37,023
- This is the easiest way.
- Over the hill here.

585
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:38,193
- Up there?
- Yes.

586
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:39,893
Let's go. Lead the way.

587
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:42,033
(They move to a place away from the penguins.)

588
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:43,463
(Will they be able to deliver warmth to the research team?)

589
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:44,533
This looks okay, right?

590
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:45,904
I think we can sit like this.

591
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:48,234
- Bring the food, please.
- Okay.

592
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,174
Please sit.

593
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,643
- We thought about it a lot.
- Okay.

594
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:55,413
- We heard warm food was better.
- Yes.

595
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:57,273
We didn't want it to be cold,

596
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:58,843
so we made beef doenjang porridge.

597
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,314
A nutritional doenjang porridge.

598
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:02,153
(Excited)

599
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:03,413
For side dishes...

600
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:05,014
Ta-da. You can get excited.

601
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,024
Ta-da.

602
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:09,854
- What is this?
- Salt-pickled radish.

603
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,424
- Salt-pickled radish.
- This is great.

604
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,964
I smell sesame oil.

605
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:16,134
Yes. I already smell the nuttiness.

606
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:22,203
(Grab a generous amount of warm porridge.)

607
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:23,503
(Top it with savory salt-pickled radish.)

608
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:25,173
Here. Have it with salt-pickled radish.

609
00:28:25,174 --> 00:28:26,543
Thank you.

610
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:29,274
We made a nutritious porridge with tenderloin.

611
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:31,473
You can eat the salt-pickled radish like a side dish.

612
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:32,514
(A nutritious porridge meal to warm up the researchers)

613
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,113
Please go ahead and eat.

614
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,383
Thank you for the food.

615
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,354
Eat while it's still hot.

616
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,523
- It's warm.
- It is, right?

617
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:43,594
Yes.

618
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:45,493
We thought warm food would be better...

619
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:46,823
- than pretty, cold food.
- Yes.

620
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:47,964
We have lots of porridge.

621
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:49,933
You don't have to worry. We brought it all.

622
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,533
(The warm porridge melts their bodies.)

623
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:52,703
How does the porridge taste?

624
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:53,833
- It's good.
- It's good.

625
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,064
It's warm.

626
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,974
The salt-pickled radish is tasty too.

627
00:28:59,044 --> 00:29:00,444
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

628
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:04,944
What is this green thing, not the carrot?

629
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,944
- Mallow.
- Mallow.

630
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:09,553
Mallow and doenjang go well together.

631
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:11,953
(The comfortable aroma of mallow fills their mouths.)

632
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,454
Mallow, king oyster mushroom, carrot,

633
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,454
and tenderloin.

634
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:18,124
It's nice and tender.

635
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:19,664
Isn't that funny?

636
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:21,494
Isn't that funny?

637
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:23,864
(Forced laughing)

638
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,804
I didn't laugh on time.

639
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,004
(Forced laughing)

640
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:31,704
Why is my humor not working?

641
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,403
It was funny for me.

642
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,844
(It only made Soo Hyang laugh.)

643
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:37,243
The mallow! So tasty.

644
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:39,544
(Oh, mallow! So tasty!)

645
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:42,113
It tastes extra good eating it here.

646
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,384
- Doesn't it?
- It's so tasty.

647
00:29:44,254 --> 00:29:46,084
(Eating a spoonful)

648
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,323
Oh, this is hot.

649
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:50,524
(Oh, this is hot!)

650
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:52,363
- We were right to bring warm food.
- I know.

651
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:53,623
(Hot food is the best when it's cold.)

652
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:54,963
No matter how well it's presented,

653
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,394
cold food won't be enjoyable here.

654
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,434
Crew Soo Hyang really did her part.

655
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:02,374
It was her idea. Soo Hyang's.

656
00:30:02,474 --> 00:30:03,803
She said the food needed to be warm.

657
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,444
(You're the best, Soo Hyang.)

658
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:08,773
Porridge was such a great idea.

659
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,614
(They prepared a warm and thoughtful meal for the crew.)

660
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,084
(Emptying their bowls)

661
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:17,353
- Do you want more?
- Yes.

662
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:18,484
There's another container.

663
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,557
- Please have some.
- I'm eating like crazy.

664
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:26,084
Crew Paik warmed up the thermoses ahead of time.

665
00:30:26,364 --> 00:30:27,524
Before we put the porridge inside.

666
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,033
(Everyone wants seconds.)

667
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:32,404
- Do you want a lot?
- Yes. Thank you.

668
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,133
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

669
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,334
It's warm.

670
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,133
Thank you.

671
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:39,443
You can eat five times what you had just now.

672
00:30:39,444 --> 00:30:40,674
We brought a lot.

673
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,943
What kind of data do you collect here?

674
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,983
Besides the sizes of the eggs, what else?

675
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:50,454
What kind of research are you currently doing?

676
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,053
Today,

677
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:53,983
we measured the sizes of eggs.

678
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:54,755
The eggs...

679
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,623
don't change in size from when they're first laid,

680
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,063
but the weight decreases...

681
00:30:59,064 --> 00:31:01,563
the closer it gets to hatching time.

682
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:03,034
- The weight decreases?
- Yes.

683
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:04,294
It's because...

684
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:06,033
it's losing water.

685
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:08,464
(The moisture evaporates, and the embryo consumes energy.)

686
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,343
It's 107.

687
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:15,243
The weight is 107.

688
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:17,014
(Weighing eggs to predict hatching and study breeding success)

689
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,613
We attach location trackers on them...

690
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,714
to see where they go.

691
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:24,913
We also research their food source,

692
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,083
so we look at what they eat.

693
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,123
(With collected data, they monitor...)

694
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:28,124
(hunting frequency, duration, and routes.)

695
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:31,194
Don't take this the wrong way.

696
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:34,063
What do the sizes of penguin eggs...

697
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:35,493
and the way they hunt...

698
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,264
have anything to do with us?

699
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,734
Right?

700
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:41,134
That is true in a sense.

701
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:45,503
They say penguins are ecological indicator species.

702
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:46,774
What does that mean?

703
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:48,603
(Penguins...)

704
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:51,344
(are the indicator species of Antarctica's ecosystem.)

705
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:53,413
- You know the food chain, right?
- Yes.

706
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:56,614
They're considered higher-level predators.

707
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,853
- Really?
- Yes.

708
00:31:57,854 --> 00:31:59,853
From an ecological standpoint,

709
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:02,753
they can indirectly tell us...

710
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,754
how the environment is changing.

711
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:10,464
(They play an important role...)

712
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:14,504
(in showing us how healthy Antarctica's ecosystem is.)

713
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:18,734
(So the crew isn't just simply observing penguins.)

714
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:22,613
(They collect data over long periods and protect Antarctica's ecosystem.)

715
00:32:22,614 --> 00:32:25,344
Through long-term research,

716
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:27,313
we can see these changes...

717
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:30,114
and predict changes in the environment as well.

718
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:32,423
Climate change is happening...

719
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,123
- all over the globe, right?
- Right.

720
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:37,994
It's happening the fastest in Antarctica.

721
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,993
We could do this research somewhere else as well,

722
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:44,233
- but this is the area...
- Right.

723
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:46,904
least affected by people.

724
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,798
For people who do wildlife research,

725
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,273
it's a great, controlled environment...

726
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:56,844
where we can directly observe climate change.

727
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,583
You're collecting data on how penguins deal...

728
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:03,124
with the changing climate...

729
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,214
- and on the new lives they lead.
- That's right.

730
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,527
That makes sense to me now.

731
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:09,124
(His question has been answered.)

732
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:10,323
It's so important.

733
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:11,690
It was so interesting.

734
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:15,933
I never knew that research on penguins...

735
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:19,904
was important to learn about climate change and ecosystems.

736
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,373
So the data really shows...

737
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:25,033
that Antarctica is being affected by global warming, right?

738
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:27,404
Are the ways that penguins live changing because of that?

739
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,313
The way they live?

740
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:31,443
They still lay eggs...

741
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:34,313
and have babies, but...

742
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:35,383
- The timing changes, right?
- Yes.

743
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:37,553
They lay eggs at different times. Sometimes, they hatch earlier.

744
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:40,053
They hatch earlier because the weather is warmer.

745
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:41,123
Yes.

746
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:46,864
(The eggs hatch earlier because of the warmer weather.)

747
00:33:47,364 --> 00:33:51,433
Their numbers decrease and increase.

748
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:52,534
(More penguins give up on breeding due to the worsened conditions.)

749
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:58,134
(They expect Penguin Village will change a lot as well.)

750
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:02,004
(The research team also came earlier compared to last year.)

751
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:07,043
(They're putting even more effort into their research.)

752
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,213
Other than the commute,

753
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,884
what are the toughest parts of doing this research?

754
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,824
Not being able to go to the bathroom here.

755
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,084
So we try not to drink much water.

756
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:16,923
- Right.
- I see.

757
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,493
You can't just pee anywhere here...

758
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:20,463
- as it's a protected area, right?
- Yes.

759
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:21,523
What else?

760
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:22,864
It's dirty and loud.

761
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,593
I agree that it's dirty.

762
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:27,304
Oh, goodness. Penguins poop a lot.

763
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:30,674
(The white things around their nests...)

764
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:34,074
(are actually penguin poop.)

765
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:38,174
(They poop where they are to protect their nests.)

766
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:41,543
(So it stinks even more than you can imagine.)

767
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:43,154
You got poop on your face.

768
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,313
(You got poop on your face.)

769
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:45,554
Please don't film this.

770
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:51,294
(They sometimes get poop on them while doing their research.)

771
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:54,423
On our way here,

772
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:55,523
I saw...

773
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,364
that penguins were pecking at you.

774
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,275
Yes.

775
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,404
Why do they peck at you?

776
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:01,964
Because you entered their territory?

777
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,533
- They're brooding, - Does it hurt?

778
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,873
- and we're disturbing that.
- It really hurts.

779
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:06,473
- It hurts?
- It hurts, but it's good...

780
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:08,373
- that we have warm clothes.
- We get many bruises.

781
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:09,844
- You got bit on the face?
- She has a scar now.

782
00:35:10,814 --> 00:35:12,244
- You got bit on the face?
- She has a scar now.

783
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,283
I got bitten last year, and it's still not...

784
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:15,954
- Did it scar?
- Yes, there's a scar here.

785
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:19,123
(Video from when she was being treated)

786
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:21,754
(She got a deep wound.)

787
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,724
- Do they often bite?
- Yes.

788
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:24,823
They're dangerous.

789
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:26,893
(A threatening beak)

790
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:28,463
(They always have to watch out during breeding season...)

791
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:29,994
(as the penguins are sensitive.)

792
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:33,364
(Don't come close while we're brooding.)

793
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:37,404
(They enjoyed listening to the research team's stories.)

794
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,674
(Emptying their bowls)

795
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,543
It was warm until the very last spoonful.

796
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,673
It was nice, right?

797
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:46,543
We've brought fried rice before,

798
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,913
but it got cold very quickly.

799
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:49,313
It's tasty.

800
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,514
- It's nice and warm.
- Seriously.

801
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,424
We usually eat quickly and go back to work.

802
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:55,653
It was fun to chat while eating.

803
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,494
- It's easy on the stomach too.
- Exactly.

804
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,358
(They prepared a thoughtful meal full of care.)

805
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,565
Thank you.

806
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:04,634
(This meal warmed up their bodies and hearts.)

807
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:07,964
Since we're here, we want to help if we can.

808
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,303
- If we can help...
- Let us know...

809
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:11,403
if we can do anything to help.

810
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:13,444
When we attach the location trackers,

811
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:15,773
- Next to you.
- could you write down the data?

812
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,473
- In English?
- And like in an operation room,

813
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:19,383
when we say, "Scissors," you can hand us the scissors.

814
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:20,813
Like an assistant?

815
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:23,484
Just writing down the data would be very helpful.

816
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:24,823
We can do that.

817
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:26,424
- Okay.
- Thank you.

818
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:28,623
- Shall we get going?
- Let's go.

819
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:30,554
- Thank you for the meal.
- No problem.
