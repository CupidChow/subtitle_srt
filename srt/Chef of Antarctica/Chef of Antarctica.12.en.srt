1
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:06,037
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism)

2
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:14,109
(In the harsh ecosystem of Antarctica)

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,708
(Even today, new lives are quietly born.)

4
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:21,379
(Today is my birthday.)

5
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,378
(Just like new lives in Antarctica...)

6
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:31,259
(grow up in their family's embrace)

7
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:44,698
(This place where protectors of Antarctica...)

8
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,309
(rely on each other like family)

9
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,438
(The Chef Team has finished preparing dinner.)

10
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,209
We can do it.

11
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,078
Okay.

12
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,948
(Why do they look so much more excited today?)

13
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,049
All done.

14
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,089
Great work.

15
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:03,859
You too.

16
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,518
- Here they come.
- Welcome.

17
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,459
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

18
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:12,159
(The crew members gather at the Sejong Center.)

19
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,429
- What is it?
- What?

20
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,539
Unbelievable.

21
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:22,569
(Happy birthday?)

22
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:29,379
(Sejong Center is filled with birthday party spirit.)

23
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,949
It's like a totally different place. Even the tables are...

24
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:37,089
(What is going on?)

25
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,158
(8 hours ago)

27
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,189
Take a seat.

28
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,859
We have a birthday party today.

29
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:46,328
A party?

30
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,429
(A birthday party?)

31
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,269
So it's not about having birthday seaweed soup and such?

32
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,539
We hold a collective birthday party once a month for those...

33
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:57,979
whose birthday falls in that month.

34
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,338
We wish them a happy birthday.

35
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,819
(Starting with a birthday celebration)

36
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,018
We enjoy a delicious meal together.

37
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,819
(A birthday meal prepared by culinary crew member An Chi Young)

38
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,388
And we have some drinks.

39
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:15,989
(A light drink that won't hinder their duties)

40
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:19,528
(It's more than a simple birthday party.)

41
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:23,998
It helps with the crew members' mental health.

42
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,869
(A party to restore the crew members' morale)

43
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,538
(To think there was such a deep meaning)

44
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,708
- It's a collective one?
- A birthday party.

45
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,379
Antarctica is a very isolated place.

46
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,908
The members are apart from their families,

47
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,379
and phone calls are unstable.

48
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,118
I wanted to make it feel like a family had prepared...

49
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:41,689
the special event, such as a birthday, in such a situation.

50
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,558
It would be great if you four could decorate the cafeteria...

51
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,688
so that it gives off...

52
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,789
- a birthday vibe.
- A party?

53
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,198
You only get to celebrate your birthday once in Antarctica.

54
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,869
That's why I wanted to make the day more special and more memorable.

55
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:01,209
How many birthdays this month?

56
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,209
In November,

57
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,108
- we have Secretary Kwon Young Hoon, - Secretary Kwon?

58
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,508
Yes, Secretary Kwon.

59
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:07,979
(Secretary Kwon Young Hoon)

60
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:09,878
Maritime crew member Wi Dae Hwan.

61
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,519
(Maritime research crew member Wi Dae Hwan)

62
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,418
And geology crew member Min Jun Hong.

63
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,989
(Geology and geophysical research crew member Min Jun Hong)

64
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,158
Those are the three birthday celebrants.

65
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,529
(A birthday party for a total of 3 members)

66
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,328
This birthday must mean a lot.

67
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,598
After this party, everyone will return to Korea, right?

68
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,728
Exactly, it's our winter crew's last birthday party.

69
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,269
(The 37th winter crew's last birthday party)

70
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,469
I want the birthday party to be truly memorable.

71
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:37,979
What do you normally eat on birthdays? Seaweed soup, right?

72
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,978
LA galbi or braised ribs.

73
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,409
- You're right.
- Braised ribs sound good.

74
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,219
But we don't have ribs.

75
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:47,589
Wait.

76
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,349
The asado that we received.

77
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,988
The gift from Argentina.

78
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,559
(Made with beef gifted from Argentina...)

79
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,129
(and a sweet sauce)

80
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,469
(Braised ribs)

81
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,869
(What else can we make?)

82
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,709
Actually...

83
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,938
We've already asked what the birthday celebrants...

84
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,278
would like to eat.

85
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,049
(What they would like to eat?)

86
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,549
(What do the birthday members want to eat?)

87
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,019
- Rose tteokbokki.
- Rose tteokbokki?

88
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:27,328
That's what they want?

89
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,058
To make rose tteokbokki, the main ingredients,

90
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,158
milk and fresh cream, are needed.

91
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,999
But those two are non-existent in Antarctica.

92
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,538
That's why we couldn't make it.

93
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:41,639
(Rose tteokbokki they haven't had in months)

94
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:44,839
What next? Rose tteokbokki and what else?

95
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,538
Jjolmyeon.

96
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:47,609
Jjolmyeon?

97
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,148
(Jjolmyeon is easily enjoyed in Korea.)

98
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,819
All jjolmyeon needs is the sweet and sour chojang.

99
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,489
Cabbage, carrots, and cucumbers.

100
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,628
The sweet and sour jjolmyeon with the vegetables' crunchiness...

101
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,288
is very common.

102
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,699
(Secretary Kwon Young Hoon's pick: Crunchy, sweet and sour jjolmyeon)

103
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,028
Half the ingredients of jjolmyeon are cabbage,

104
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,369
but we have none.

105
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,898
Do we have nothing to replace...

106
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,499
- cabbage?
- No, none.

107
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,708
Or, since Crew Paik is a very skilled chef,

108
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,609
make it with the ingredients we don't have.

109
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,049
I can only show off my skills with the ingredients.

110
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,419
There aren't carrots for the colour. We've got no scallions.

111
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:32,119
(There are no ingredients. None at all.)

112
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,429
You barely have any ingredients.

113
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,699
(It's a funny yet sad reality.)

114
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,559
We used to have them.

115
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:42,399
(A crunchy texture)

116
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,668
- We can cut up spring cabbage.
- Okay.

117
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,138
Besides the crunchiness,

118
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,639
cabbage has that sweetness when you eat it.

119
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,339
We'll make it taste similar to that.

120
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,449
It'd be an easy-peasy job if we were in a normal situation.

121
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:58,879
But we barely had any ingredients.

122
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,349
Nonetheless, we had to do it.

123
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,119
We had to make it somehow.

124
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:07,259
As it's a communal setting in Antarctica,

125
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:10,459
you can't have everything you're craving.

126
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,698
There weren't that many ingredients,

127
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,498
but it was their one-and-only birthday.

128
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,298
We wanted to make it for them.

129
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:19,999
We've done well until now despite the lack of ingredients, haven't we?

130
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,168
If we don't have scallions...

131
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,679
(Can they make the menu with the insufficient ingredients?)

132
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,278
Let's get the ingredients.

133
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,509
- Okay.
- Got it.

134
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,649
Mushrooms.

135
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,178
Here it is.

136
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,149
(Soo Hyang gets the ingredients from the storage.)

137
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,618
(SUHO comes to pick spring cabbages in the greenhouse.)

138
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,889
(Plentiful)

139
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,729
(Moving around busily as there are more dishes to make than usual)

140
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,729
(Meanwhile, what's Jong Hyeop doing?)

141
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,439
Is it snowing?

142
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:57,409
(While getting snowed on, )

143
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,538
(he's off with two crew members.)

144
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,979
(Song Seok Rok, Yeom Chang Hun)

145
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:05,449
(Where are they going with a bucket?)

146
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,619
(The three head to the seashore.)

147
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,619
(Amazed)

148
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,589
The drift ice...

149
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,759
(Drift ice?)

150
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:23,569
(Along the shoreline of King Sejong Station...)

151
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,639
(lie rows of lumps of ice.)

152
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,879
(Drift ice)

153
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,179
(Broken off from glaciers, )

154
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:45,889
(the drift ice comes in various sizes and shapes.)

155
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,359
(After wandering on the waters of Antarctica, )

156
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:59,499
(the drift ice pieces are pushed by waves...)

157
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:04,109
(to the shoreline.)

158
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:10,109
(Making drift ice alcoholic beverages on special days...)

159
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:13,149
(is a long tradition at King Sejong Station.)

160
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,019
(Jong Hyeop has come to pick drift ice for the birthday party.)

161
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,658
It was my very first time seeing drift ice that close up.

162
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,858
As I was going to pick them for the birthday party,

163
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,229
it got me excited.

164
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,299
Can you see the bubbles inside?

165
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:30,268
(There are bubbles filling the inside of drift ice?)

166
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,269
Yes.

167
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,868
I heard the bubbles are air from 1,000 years ago.

168
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:37,108
Correct. As snow keeps collecting...

169
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:41,049
(In the process of snow collecting for a long time)

170
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,978
As air gets trapped,

171
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,448
it turns into bubbles inside the drift ice.

172
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:49,649
(Drift ice that carries air from thousands of years ago)

173
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,899
I'll give it a shot.

174
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,628
(They start gathering drift ice.)

175
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:01,929
Put it right here.

176
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,169
(After getting into position with the tools...)

177
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,809
(and taking a deep breath, )

178
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:12,139
(shall I begin?)

179
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:13,839
(Slipping)

180
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,249
You're too full of energy.

181
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,319
(This wasn't what I had in mind.)

182
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:25,459
(Trying again after pulling himself together)

183
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,729
(Hitting)

184
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,699
(Clattering down)

185
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,828
I'll get a little more.

186
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,299
(Trying again with more confidence now)

187
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,239
(He succeeds without a hitch!)

188
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,409
(Shall I try the other edge?)

189
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,179
(Focusing hard on gathering drift ice, )

190
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,249
(he ends up filling the bucket.)

191
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,629
Collecting drift ice was fun,

192
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,828
but thinking about preparing a birthday gift...

193
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,059
on behalf of the crew members' families...

194
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:09,698
made me gather it and make drift ice alcoholic beverages...

195
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,969
with a sense of responsibility rather than just enjoyment.

196
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,669
Is this enough?

197
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,939
Yes, that's a good amount.

198
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:18,809
Let's go.

199
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,109
(Let's go!)

200
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:23,549
(A bucketful of drift ice)

201
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:25,848
We'll serve you a delicious dinner soon.

202
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,048
The menu isn't decided yet, right?

203
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:28,989
I actually know what it is.

204
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,449
But it's a secret.

205
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,318
I'm sure it'll be good.

206
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,959
(Returning to the station, excited for dinner)

207
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,458
- Cut it like cabbage.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,429
- For jjolmyeon, right?
- Yes, for jjolmyeon.

209
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,599
(Focused)

210
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:49,569
(Soo Hyang cuts the spring cabbage for the jjolmyeon topping.)

211
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,839
That's right, make the chojang.

212
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,408
Add gochujang to it.

213
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,409
(SUHO makes the jjolmyeon sauce.)

214
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,819
(Scooping a moderate amount of gochujang)

215
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,589
(After tidying up, )

216
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,489
(he's off somewhere.)

217
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:09,988
Sprite.

218
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,529
(Adding Sprite to gochujang?)

219
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:16,099
I wanted a bit of sweetness in the sauce, so I figured...

220
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,599
I'd try adding Sprite.

221
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,039
(Tangy vinegar)

222
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,569
(Spicy chilli powder)

223
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:28,179
(Soy sauce, starch syrup, and brown sugar)

224
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,449
(After mixing them well, the jjolmyeon sauce is complete.)

225
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:36,449
(Did it turn out well?)

226
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,589
(Jong Won tastes the jjolmyeon sauce.)

227
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:42,829
(Curious)

228
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,068
There's a natural sweetness you get from vegetables.

229
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:52,369
I wasn't sure how to get that flavour without them, so I thought hard.

230
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,269
Check if we have apple juice.

231
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,739
- You mean the apple juice we drink?
- Yes.

232
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,639
Apple is normally grated in, but apples are rare here.

233
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,678
Fortunately, there was apple juice at the station.

234
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,019
We have apple juice.

235
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,618
- Add about a 3rd.
- A 3rd?

236
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,719
(Adding apple juice to the jjolmyeon sauce)

237
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,618
It's all in.

238
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,288
(Crew Paik's Jjolmyeon Sauce Tip)

239
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:16,989
(Apple juice instead of vegetables for the umami)

240
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,399
(The mouthwatering jjolmyeon sauce is complete.)

241
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,068
- Jjolmyeon.
- Jjolmyeon?

242
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:24,169
(It's now time to boil the jjolmyeon!)

243
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,839
Was this the only jjolmyeon?

244
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:30,039
(There's only one pack of jjolmyeon.)

245
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,038
One pack of jjolmyeon is...

246
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,739
(It's not enough for 20 servings.)

247
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,549
This is bad. What do we do?

248
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,049
What took me by surprise at the end was the lack of noodles.

249
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:46,059
Only one pack of jjolmyeon. I wasn't sure what to do.

250
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,589
We were in a huge pinch.

251
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,928
The secretary was craving the menu,

252
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,399
but we had no idea what to do.

253
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,999
(Rushing)

254
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,639
I went over to the non-staple food storage without a plan.

255
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,409
(Looking around)

256
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,378
(Kalguksu noodles...)

257
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,749
(don't seem right.)

258
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,149
(Scanning thoroughly)

259
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:12,849
(That's it!)

260
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,278
Buckwheat noodles.

261
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,889
(Buckwheat noodles?)

262
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,489
Luckily, Crew Soo Hyang found us some noodles,

263
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:22,229
even if they were buckwheat noodles.

264
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:24,629
It felt like I had gained a reliable ally.

265
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:28,099
(Soo Hyang takes a generous amount of buckwheat noodles.)

266
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,369
Our work together until now had all been worth it.

267
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,339
Everyone knew what to do.

268
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,009
(We've improved greatly, haven't we?)

269
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,108
(Thanks to Soo Hyang's wit for the birthday members)

270
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:42,478
The birthday celebrants get jjolmyeon,

271
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,618
while the others get makguksu,

272
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,479
since it's similar to jjolmyeon.

273
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,749
(Starting to cook the second birthday menu, rose tteokbokki)

274
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,189
(Dissolving gochujang in water)

275
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,089
(Adding chilli powder)

276
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,199
(Onions)

277
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:00,528
(Brown sugar)

278
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:01,998
(Starch syrup)

279
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:03,729
(Soy sauce)

280
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,869
(Mix well, and the tteokbokki sauce is done.)

281
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:12,079
(Fish cakes)

282
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,749
(Pre-soaked rice cakes)

283
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,189
(Until this point, it's the red tteokbokki we know.)

284
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,759
(All that's left is to make the cream sauce and mix it in.)

285
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,089
(Coating the frying pan with oil first)

286
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,159
(By adding flour to the heated frying pan, )

287
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,269
(the roux, the base of the sauce, is complete.)

288
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,399
- Plain milk.
- We have no plain milk.

289
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,369
- Forget it then.
- I guess we drank it all.

290
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:43,769
I never thought we had any.

291
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,408
As you know, rose tteokbokki is a mix...

292
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,648
of gochujang sauce and Western cream sauce,

293
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,179
which gives it that rose colour.

294
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:54,849
(But as you know, this place is...)

295
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,619
(the cold and hungry land, Antarctica.)

296
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,028
(It's only natural that there's no milk...)

297
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,499
(with such a short expiration date.)

298
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:06,699
We didn't have that basic ingredient.

299
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,729
It put me in a tough spot.

300
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:16,308
Normally, I'd need to add milk to the stir-fried roux.

301
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:19,839
Only then would it be the perfect cream sauce, but we had no milk.

302
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,779
(An idea he had, since there's no milk)

303
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:25,748
Part of the ingredients in cream soup is milk.

304
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,648
Fortunately, I had that option to add it in.

305
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:30,088
And I didn't hold back on the cheese either.

306
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,619
(Adding cheese for a rich flavour)

307
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:34,458
Good. All done.

308
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,299
(Milkless yet rich cream sauce is complete.)

309
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,629
Good. All done.

310
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,699
(The rose tteokbokki is done?)

311
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,769
(Without mixing the gochujang sauce and cream sauce, )

312
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,279
(it's done as is?)

313
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,649
Should I say it's a trick?

314
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:58,748
In this situation, where fresh ingredients...

315
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,348
can't be delivered to Antarctica,

316
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:04,489
and we had to cook with several missing ingredients,

317
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,218
the best way to make the food delicious...

318
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,589
is through external factors.

319
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,128
The visuals and the feelings triggered in the brain.

320
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,168
Even if some ingredients are missing, make the most of those two,

321
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,869
and it will really satisfy those who eat the food.

322
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,839
(What is the trick behind the rose tteokbokki?)

323
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,879
(While Jong Won is making a new type of rose tteokbokki, )

324
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,078
(Jong Hyeop is turning the cafeteria into a birthday party hall.)

325
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,509
"Happy birthday."

326
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,949
"Happy..."

327
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,749
(Hissing)

328
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,048
(Pumping up the balloons)

329
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:41,159
Preparing a birthday party myself...

330
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,089
felt really special.

331
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,069
I'll put my trust in your aesthetic sense.

332
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,438
(Preparing diligently while humming)

333
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,008
For the crew members,

334
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,109
we decorated the center and more.

335
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,819
(It turned into a colourful birthday party hall.)

336
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,318
(Holding the crew members' birthday party)

337
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,619
It's like a totally different place.

338
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,548
It's like a different world.

339
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,758
Please take a seat...

340
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,188
with a pair of chopsticks and a plate.

341
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,399
We'll be serving the food at your table today.

342
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,129
(Excited)

343
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,799
What great service.

344
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,199
(Please look forward to it.)

345
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:29,969
Please go take a seat with one of the small plates.

346
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,239
(Min Jun Hong)

347
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,579
(He's already excited.)

348
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,009
Take a seat. Is this everyone?

349
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:39,319
(Today's stars have taken a seat in the birthday celebrant zone.)

350
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,278
A birthday party...

351
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,719
(Feeling shy)

352
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,659
- Are they even serving the food?
- Yes.

353
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,288
- Nice.
- It's like VIP treatment.

354
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,789
(Touched)

355
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,689
If only it were my birthday too.

356
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,299
You might need forks, knives, spoons, and chopsticks.

357
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:55,929
For today's menu,

358
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,528
we asked the people celebrating their birthdays today...

359
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:58,968
what they wanted to eat.

360
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:01,768
One of them requested rose tteokbokki,

361
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,968
so we made it.

362
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:05,939
But it wouldn't be fun just as it is.

363
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,979
(Curious)

364
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:11,478
So we're going to spread the white sauce on the plate first,

365
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,178
then pour the tteokbokki over it.

366
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,289
It's not because we couldn't make rose sauce. We want to make it fun.

367
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:20,119
(Crew Paik's "trick" for rose tteokbokki)

368
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,289
Okay. Here we go.

369
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,369
(Birthday celebrants' food requests: Rose tteokbokki)

370
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,669
(First, Crew Paik pours the cream sauce he made.)

371
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:38,509
(And he puts tteokbokki over it.)

372
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,739
We can serve it like this.

373
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,609
This is rose tteokbokki.

374
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,109
Oh, my.

375
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,679
The rose tteokbokki I wanted.

376
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,989
It looked quite unique.

377
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,289
I'd never seen tteokbokki look like that before.

378
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,928
Mix it well, and it'll become rose tteokbokki.

379
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,959
(It becomes rose tteokbokki when mixed well.)

380
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,698
If you just eat the tteokbokki on top,

381
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:00,859
it'll taste just like regular tteokbokki.

382
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:02,699
That's fun.

383
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:04,768
He's a showman indeed.

384
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,168
Bon appetit.

385
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:07,899
(What does it taste like when you can eat it in different ways?)

386
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,469
Enjoy.

387
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,779
Thank you.

388
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,548
Let's dig in before it gets cold.

389
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:19,578
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

390
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:20,879
Thank you for the meal.

391
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:23,548
Let me just mix it here.

392
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,919
- It's gochujang-based.
- It's cream-based.

393
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,189
How did they make it taste like the rose tteokbokki I know?

394
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,058
I was curious.

395
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,899
(How does the rose tteokbokki he couldn't have in Antarctica taste?)

396
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,569
(savouring)

397
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:39,939
(How is it?)

398
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,539
It doesn't taste like the rose tteokbokki I know,

399
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,009
but I like it very much.

400
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,739
It's delicious. What kind of cheese is this?

401
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,909
Isn't it...

402
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,178
- soup?
- Soup?

403
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,289
- It does taste like it.
- The tteokbokki is good.

404
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:59,689
(The birthday celebrant loves it.)

405
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,788
How does it taste? Is it good?

406
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:04,928
It's good.

407
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,129
(His wish has been granted.)

408
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,698
Since I like spicy food,

409
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:12,169
I'm just going to eat tteokbokki as it is.

410
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,409
(He prefers red tteokbokki.)

411
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:19,439
(Teary-eyed)

412
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:21,508
(Oh, it's so spicy.)

413
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:22,879
- Eat a lot.
- Yes.

414
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,849
- It's spicy, but delicious.
- I'm sweating, though.

415
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,889
Sweat messes up my bangs.

416
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:31,658
No.

417
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,159
(Precious bangs Soo Hyang cut for me)

418
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,128
It didn't seem spicy, but it's actually pretty spicy.

419
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:38,089
(The spicy red tteokbokki makes him sweat.)

420
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:42,499
(But he keeps reaching for it.)

421
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,238
It tastes like the tteokbokki I used to have after school.

422
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,869
Right? It tastes like old-fashioned tteokbokki.

423
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:51,209
(They're enjoying tteokbokki in their own preferred ways.)

424
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,349
It was a little trick I used.

425
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,448
And the trick was successful.

426
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,149
(Crew Paik's DIY rose tteokbokki was a big success.)

427
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,018
For this month,

428
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,688
we have a special drink...

429
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:09,189
with drift ice that Jong Hyeop brought from the sea.

430
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,489
With drift ice?

431
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,529
(Jong Hyeop worked hard to collect ice in the cold wind.)

432
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:17,369
(He rinsed it thoroughly.)

433
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,868
Air that has been trapped in the ice for tens of thousands of years...

434
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,779
- It's bubbling up.
- That's right.

435
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,578
Jong Hyeop went out this morning...

436
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,479
and brought the ice with the most air bubbles.

437
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,479
This is just for the three people celebrating their birthdays.

438
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:34,719
Just the birthday celebrants.

439
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,919
(They clink their glasses, celebrating each other's birthdays.)

440
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,358
(The birthday party is even more special...)

441
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,728
(with Jong Hyeop's drift ice alcoholic beverages.)

442
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,229
Thank you.

443
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:48,369
(Their reactions make Jong Hyeop happy.)

444
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,628
Next is jjolmyeon, right?

445
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,338
Jjolmyeon for the birthday celebrant.

446
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:53,339
(Jjolmyeon is served after the drift ice alcoholic beverages.)

447
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,839
(Perfect jjolmyeon is ready for the birthday celebrant.)

448
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:07,049
(Passing 1, Passing 2, Sauce, Sesame seeds)

449
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,519
(Sprinkling meticulously)

450
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:14,759
(Jjolmyeon alone wouldn't suffice, so they made braised ribs as well.)

451
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,159
We prepared a lot of food.

452
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,559
Okay. Here we go.

453
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,629
(Impressed)

454
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,599
(Exclaiming)

455
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,538
(Plentiful)

456
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,908
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

457
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,479
Oh, my. It's braised ribs.

458
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:36,749
Happy birthday.

459
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:38,379
Thank you.

460
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:42,919
- Jjolmyeon.
- Happy birthday.

461
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:44,449
- Give it a taste.
- Okay.

462
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,589
Since we don't have white cabbage and bean sprouts,

463
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,088
we added thick slices of spring cabbage,

464
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,659
which is similar to white cabbage.

465
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:54,499
(Apple juice was used to add more flavours...)

466
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,699
(and make a tangy, sweet, and spicy sauce.)

467
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:02,109
It'd be better than most jjolmyeon you'd get at a restaurant.

468
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,579
(What does the jjolmyeon he's proud of taste like?)

469
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,309
(Nodding)

470
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:08,749
(Agreeing)

471
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:11,609
- It's good.
- Yes.

472
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:13,179
I thought it wasn't spicy,

473
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,549
- but it's spicy at the end.
- It's really spicy.

474
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:17,389
I feel good.

475
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,329
Eating spicy food really relieved my stress.

476
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:26,899
I loved being able to taste the flavours I had in Korea.

477
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:31,169
It's good.

478
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,069
(You can't stop eating it, can you?)

479
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:38,109
There's more makguksu, so don't worry and help yourself.

480
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:39,639
It's really good.

481
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:42,679
I can taste a hint of fruit.

482
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,578
It tastes like apples.

483
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:46,079
(The irresistible sauce goes well with makguksu as well.)

484
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,988
How is it? Do you like it?

485
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:51,019
- What a relief.
- It's good.

486
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,659
I'm glad to hear that.

487
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,099
They enjoyed it a lot, which made me happy.

488
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,298
- Thank you. I'll enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

489
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,529
(How does the braised ribs taste?)

490
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,438
I think it's the meat they got...

491
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:11,069
- Yes.
- from Argentina.

492
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,709
It's so tender.

493
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:16,049
We've never had braised ribs...

494
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,178
- in Antarctica, right?
- Right.

495
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,249
It's our first time.

496
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,918
- It's good.
- It tastes rich.

497
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,889
(The first braised ribs they've had in a year)

498
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:24,589
This is real braised ribs.

499
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,589
I want to mix rice with it.

500
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,068
- It's even better with rice.
- Is it?

501
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,269
(Touched)

502
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:45,979
You should eat makguksu with meat.

503
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,179
Cut the meat.

504
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:49,578
Okay.

505
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,309
(Following the gourmet)

506
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,518
Eat it like this.

507
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,249
(Putting a piece of braised rib)

508
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:59,619
(Stuffing his mouth with noodles and slurping)

509
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:03,088
(This...)

510
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:06,129
(is what I'm talking about!)

511
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:09,769
(They're mixing flavours they like...)

512
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,838
(and eating...)

513
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,339
(with gusto.)

514
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:19,639
(They've almost finished their food.)

515
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,479
(Checking one more time)

516
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:22,909
Should I give them one each?

517
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:27,118
Go give each of them one. That's the fun of it.

518
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,279
(What did SUHO prepare?)

519
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:30,849
(This morning)

520
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:37,629
(They were informed of the dishes the crew members requested.)

521
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:38,959
Bungeoppang.

522
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:40,999
(Bungeoppang?)

523
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:45,029
(The food requested by the birthday celebrants at King Sejong Station)

524
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,579
Having worked in the cold, I found myself craving bungeoppang.

525
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:00,419
So today, I specially requested it.

526
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,518
Didn't you say you brought a bungeoppang pan?

527
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,619
- Yes, someone...
- I brought it.

528
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,529
(Bungeoppang was one of the dishes...)

529
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,229
(mentioned by the crew members in the pre-shoot interview.)

530
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,858
Since we have a pan, we can make it...

531
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,629
because we have red beans for patbingsu...

532
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:19,869
and red bean paste.

533
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,069
The batter is simple. You just need to mix it with water.

534
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:27,338
It'll taste good with the sweet red bean paste.

535
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,949
(They can make bungeoppang requested by Wi Dae Hwan!)

536
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,049
Who's going to make bungeoppang?

537
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,819
(I'll do it.)

538
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,689
One of the birthday celebrants wanted bungeoppang.

539
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,089
So I really wanted to make it for him.

540
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,659
Making bungeoppang isn't easy.

541
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:48,829
I want to make bungeoppang properly.

542
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:52,999
(Serious)

543
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,609
(Filling the mold with batter)

544
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,569
(Gently adding red bean paste)

545
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,339
(Covering it with batter)

546
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,748
How long should we cook it?

547
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,878
It takes around two minutes.

548
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,349
- Two minutes?
- On each side.

549
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,619
(He checks if it's cooked.)

550
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,629
(Tilting his head)

551
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,059
It's driving me nuts.

552
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:26,239
(How did it turn out?)

553
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:30,239
These ones got burned. It's a disaster.

554
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,338
It's not easy.

555
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:34,409
(The bungeoppang got slightly burned.)

556
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:37,179
- Things are not going well.
- Is it bad?

557
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:39,279
Yes. I think I went overboard.

558
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,149
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

559
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:46,519
I was a bit flustered when the first batch of bungeoppang got burned.

560
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,589
(Glancing)

561
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,459
- It's too high.
- The heat? I think so too.

562
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,469
The stove has a strong heat by default,

563
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,439
so it wasn't easy to cook evenly.

564
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,199
You can do it.

565
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:05,168
Crew Paik pointed out that the heat was too high,

566
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,639
so I turned it down.

567
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,349
I carefully and slowly cooked it on medium-low heat.

568
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:18,089
(Checking the second batch of bungeoppang)

569
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,159
(Smiling)

570
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:25,358
It looks nice. It's hot.

571
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,629
(It came out just like the bungeoppang from a street stall!)

572
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,469
(Soo Hyang, the food inspector, tastes it.)

573
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,569
How is it? Is it good?

574
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,669
I'll keep going.

575
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,539
SUHO, it's delicious.

576
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:42,179
(He confidently starts cooking another batch of bungeoppang.)

577
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,478
(Pouring)

578
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,449
(Flipping)

579
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,388
(Checking the time)

580
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:51,319
(He's diligent.)

581
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,618
Everyone's support...

582
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,959
has ignited my passion.

583
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,728
(Passionate SUHO cooked over 40 bungeoppang by himself.)

584
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:01,899
I made a lot. I made 40.

585
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:04,969
It turned out great.

586
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,839
SUHO is doing great.

587
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:10,208
(Impressed)

588
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:11,439
Well done.

589
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,778
Since I worked hard on it,

590
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:16,679
I hope Dae Hwan enjoys it.

591
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:19,978
(Golden brown bungeoppang for Wi Dae Hwan, the birthday celebrant)

592
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:21,448
- Put it on the plate.
- I'll put it on the plate.

593
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:23,649
(Here's bungeoppang.)

594
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:26,518
Please take a piece of bungeoppang.

595
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,589
Bungeoppang?

596
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,088
What's inside?

597
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:30,358
It's just...

598
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,658
- Red beans?
- red bean paste. It's good.

599
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:35,698
They served bungeoppang for dessert, which I was hoping for.

600
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:37,028
It was a pleasant surprise.

601
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:38,199
Please give it a try.

602
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:41,599
How is it? Try it.

603
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:44,839
It was smaller than the ones I had in Korea,

604
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,379
but it was twice as delicious as those.

605
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:52,819
(It's a relief.)

606
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,789
This is a nice treat after eating spicy food.

607
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:57,248
It's perfect.

608
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:58,858
It's nice and chewy.

609
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:01,319
(Crispy on the outside and sweet and chewy on the inside)

610
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:03,659
- It's good.
- It's delicious.

611
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,099
It's good with red beans.

612
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,999
It took a long time to make,

613
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,939
but fortunately, they enjoyed it.

614
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,708
I was worried a lot because I've never made it before.

615
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:22,408
But fortunately, they liked it, and I was really grateful.

616
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,709
(Going back to the kitchen)

617
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:26,849
I guess the bungeoppang wasn't bad.

618
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,089
(All the dishes for the birthday celebrants were successful.)

619
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:33,159
It's no joke.

620
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,489
It tastes even better.

621
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:36,729
It's delicious.

622
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:42,669
(By the end of the birthday party, the plates were cleared.)

623
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,939
- Oh, my gosh. What's going on?
- What is it?

624
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:50,969
- Oh, my gosh. What's going on?
- What is it?

625
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:56,449
(Happy birthday)

626
00:30:56,979 --> 00:31:00,179
(They prepared a surprise handmade cake and a song.)

627
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:02,188
(Happy birthday, crew members of Antarctica)

628
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:04,489
(Oh, my goodness.)

629
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:07,659
(All the chefs in the kitchen came out.)

630
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:10,329
Blow out the candles.

631
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,199
- In 1, 2, 3.
- He's crying.

632
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:14,659
Don't cry.

633
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,198
(Happy birthday.)

634
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,769
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

635
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:23,409
We tried expressing our feelings with a heart.

636
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,379
Many people celebrated my birthday,

637
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:31,109
and I received positive energy from them.

638
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:35,718
It always felt like a healing moment...

639
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,249
in the midst of a busy life.

640
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,688
That's why I worked hard to prepare the cake this time,

641
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:44,859
hoping the crew members...

642
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:48,529
would feel the same way.

643
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,098
- Lucky you.
- Happy birthday.

644
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,368
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

645
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,369
(Touched)

646
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,969
Okay, everyone.

647
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,909
I'd like to express my gratitude.

648
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,648
Mr. Paik explained the dishes...

649
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:06,049
as if they were a full-course meal,

650
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,589
making it a truly special birthday party. I'm honoured.

651
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,919
I'd like to thank all the crew members of Chef of Antarctica.

652
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:16,488
This is the most special day of my life,

653
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:18,559
and I don't think I'll ever forget it.

654
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,898
With less than 20 days left before leaving Antarctica,

655
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,228
everyone was feeling tense...

656
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:26,998
and worried about returning.

657
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,938
Having you come...

658
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:32,169
and throw us a birthday party like this...

659
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,938
lifted our spirits...

660
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:36,778
and energized us.

661
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,679
We made many memories over the past year,

662
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:41,918
but this will...

663
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,188
be the most memorable one of our lives.

664
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:48,418
I truly want to say thank you.

665
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,459
Thank you.

666
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,559
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

667
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:00,439
I've never prepared a birthday party for anyone.

668
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,669
And it was my first time decorating a space like that.

669
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:07,939
It warmed my heart.

670
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:11,649
Happy birthday.

671
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:18,119
Let's cut the cake.

672
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:22,758
- Did you make a wish?
- Yes.

673
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,759
Here.

674
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,859
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

675
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:29,928
(The birthday party in Antarctica was special to everyone.)

676
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:31,199
Happy birthday.

677
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,009
You're good!

678
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:37,838
Thank you.

679
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,008
(Happy birthday.)

680
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:40,209
This is amazing.

681
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:43,349
(Tomorrow is our last day in Antarctica.)

682
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:45,249
(Let's make it a meaningful dinner!)

683
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:46,879
(Impressed)

684
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,979
(Exclaiming)

685
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:50,249
(The final dinner that leaves everyone in awe)

686
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:52,249
(Is it good?)

687
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,319
(It's good.)

688
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:54,788
(Secretary Kwon Young Hoon accompanied them...)

689
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:55,859
(when they visited the neighbouring stations.)

690
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:58,259
(He thinks today's dinner is the best.)

691
00:33:58,729 --> 00:33:59,858
(The water tastes amazing.)

692
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,899
(It has a refined taste.)

693
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,399
(You wanted to use Antarctic water.)

694
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:06,269
(What we can have in Antarctica.)

695
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,039
(What we can have only in Antarctica.)

696
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:10,139
(Makgeolli made with Antarctic water)

697
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,438
(It tastes like condensed milk.)

698
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,479
(Glaring)

699
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:14,939
(Jong Hyeop, let's keep this just for ourselves.)

700
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:16,679
(Refreshing)

701
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,119
(Exclaiming)

702
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,379
(Refreshing)

703
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,279
(It's good!)

704
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:24,849
(And...)

705
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,399
(The final evening in Antarctica has come.)

706
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:40,799
(It's time to say goodbye to King Sejong Station.)

707
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,579
(They lower the Chef of Antarctica flag after 10 days...)

708
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:55,279
(and leave traces of their bittersweet feelings on it.)

709
00:34:58,289 --> 00:34:59,789
Thank you for your kind message.

710
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:03,959
(The 37th winter crew prepared a meaningful present.)

711
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:05,359
