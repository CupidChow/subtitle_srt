(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,950
(King George Island, Antarctica, 2024)

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,720
Yes, keep moving.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,829
- Confirm it. We'll hang the flag.
- Okay. I confirmed it.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,530
(King Sejong Station)

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,139
(Every December, the Korea Polar Research Institute...)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,080
(dispatches the winter crew to stay in Antarctica for a year.)

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,879
(The winter crew in Antarctica must guard the base...)

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
(with limited electricity and food supply.)

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,320
(The only luxury allowed for them in this isolated environment...)

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,930
(is a warm meal.)

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,359
(Chef of Antarctica)

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,770
I've been cooking for the crew all by myself for a year.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,470
There isn't much to enjoy here in Antarctica.

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,180
Having three meals a day is the biggest joy of their lives.

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,180
As they must live in an isolated environment for a year,

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,850
I'd love to give them the feeling of dining out.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,780
But the ingredients are limited.

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,950
Everyone in the crew always says this.

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,920
"Your food tastes great."

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,629
"But I wish there was another dish cooked by someone else."

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,760
(The crew wants to taste a new dish prepared by someone else.)

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,899
(And...)

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,930
To me, going to Antarctica...

26
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,240
might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
(Sejong Center, 2024)

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,269
I ought to utilize all of my skills,

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,839
so I can give them what they want.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,779
(And...)

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,349
I'll try my best to give them tastier meals...

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,420
and great memories.

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,349
I want to serve them food they've never tasted before.

34
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,420
(SUHO, the most passionate man)

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,489
I hope they can feel the warmth of hot meals.

36
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,530
(Chae Jong Hyeop, the youngest in Antarctica)

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,300
(Seoul, 2024)

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,300
(Why does Paik Jong Won want to go to Antarctica?)

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,240
Here's why.

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,079
It's about the climate.

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,140
I was really surprised by how this summer turned out.

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,009
The price of napa cabbage this year was out of control.

43
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,480
Antarctica is the first place that witnesses climate change.

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,649
They're in Antarctica to study exactly that.

45
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,359
And I think they're doing...

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,020
a wonderful job of the harsh environment there.

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,889
So I wondered if there was anything I could do for them.

48
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,830
If I can contribute, I ought to.

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm also doing this with a sense of duty.

50
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,730
You'll be a part of the crew.

51
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,469
So you'll get to visit...

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,770
the Penguin Village and King Sejong Station.

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,839
To enter these places, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,869
or the Ministry of Climate, Energy and the Environment must allow it.

55
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,739
I see. This is getting serious.

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,809
(Getting serious for some reason)

57
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,750
It's not pressure-free then. There's some pressure.

58
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,680
(Where are his fellow members who will join him?)

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,850
(September 2024)

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,990
(Japan)

61
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,620
(Working diligently here in Japan...)

62
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,630
(is the second crew member.)

63
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,500
(Actor Chae Jong Hyeop)

64
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,309
(In the SBS drama, "Stove League," he left an impression...)

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,180
(as the rookie baseball player who never gives up.)

66
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,879
(In "Eye Love You," he captured women's hearts...)

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,580
(as the bold, younger guy.)

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,380
(Chae Jong Hyeop, a big star in Japan)

69
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,349
Okay. My name is...

70
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,590
(Shy)

71
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,460
My name is Chae Jong Hyeop.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,860
Okay. I'm an actor.

73
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,960
(Why does he want to go to Antarctica?)

74
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,960
There was a sense of warmth to the show's agenda.

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,200
I don't think it's a regular variety show.

76
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,700
There's a stronger sense of sincerity.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Antarctica?

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,380
It's a place I've never been to.

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,210
A place that's difficult to visit.

80
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,680
It seems there are many challenges of staying there.

81
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,380
The environment seems to change...

82
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,719
every year I check the scenery of Antarctica.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,190
And seeing these changes...

84
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,260
makes me think that it will continue to get hotter.

85
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,930
It also pushes me...

86
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,999
to have a deeper sense of awareness about climate changes.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,570
In a way, it gave me a chance to think about that.

88
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,310
(Do you have any cooking experience?)

89
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,580
I chose a cooking class and learned a few things there.

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,410
I guess I'm not a complete newbie.

91
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,750
(He's still shy in Antarctica.)

92
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,320
(But once he starts cooking...)

93
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,589
(It's all about confidence.)

94
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,090
(He activates his biceps to grate carrots.)

95
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,020
(He uses his biceps to grill meat.)

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,760
(A hidden culinary talent)

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,260
(Jong Hyeop improved so much.)

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,829
(He's doing his part.)

99
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,530
(Doting on him)

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,070
(He keeps washing dishes without taking a break.)

101
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,400
(Here it is.)

102
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,040
(The straightforward youngest takes initiative.)

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,040
(But he keeps on disappearing.)

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,339
Watch carefully.

105
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,040
(Where are you going?)

106
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,679
(Jong Hyeop)

107
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Jong Hyeop.

108
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:09,680
(He quietly leaves the camera frame.)

109
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,780
(Removing the teeth perfectly)

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,820
(Perfect)

111
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,519
(Once the fire starts to burn them, )

112
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,390
(I can keep on adding more.)

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,490
On the bottom...

114
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,090
(Gesturing)

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,560
(He works hard while talking to himself.)

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,300
(Jong Hyeop joins as a crew member.)

117
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,500
(60 days before departure)

118
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,010
(Gangnam)

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,910
(Sliding)

120
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,550
(Someone walks in slowly.)

121
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,519
(It's the third crew member.)

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,579
- Hello.
- Hello.

123
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,019
I didn't know there would be cameras here.

124
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,250
(Actor Im Soo Hyang)

125
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,989
(She demonstrates perfect acting...)

126
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,830
(across all genres.)

127
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,400
(An irreplaceable actor, Im Soo Hyang)

128
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,770
(Why does she want to go to Antarctica?)

129
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,999
Having a chance to serve food to the winter crew...

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,309
in King Sejong Station is quite meaningful.

131
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,810
Of course, the environment also factors in.

132
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,209
This experience could influence my life in many ways.

133
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,049
So it's not just a TV show.

134
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,650
This may be a valuable life experience for me.

135
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,160
That crossed my mind.

136
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,130
(And Soo Hyang will update us on the situation in Antarctica.)

137
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,199
(It was terrifying.)

138
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,430
(I thought I might die.)

139
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,440
(A real situation she experienced in a remote part of Antarctica)

140
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,200
(No. It's dangerous.)

141
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,069
- We have to check...
- What about the tape? We have it.

142
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,910
(She had a firsthand encounter with the terror of nature.)

143
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,220
(Manila)

144
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,050
(He's on a world tour before departing.)

145
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,990
(The last crew member of Chef of Antarctica)

146
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,560
(The forever leader of the idol group, EXO)

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,769
(The leader of EXO, SUHO)

148
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,540
(Why does he want to go to Antarctica?)

149
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,610
I went to Southeast Asia to perform at concerts...

150
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,810
in the early years of my career.

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,279
It rained all of a sudden, and then the weather cleared up.

152
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,349
That was quite common.

153
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,979
I was really fascinated by the climate there.

154
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,150
I thought it was interesting.

155
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,820
But at 1 point in my late 20s,

156
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,359
I noticed a similar climate in Seoul.

157
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,760
It would pour down all of a sudden.

158
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,430
Then it would get sunny.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,629
At first, I was just puzzled.

160
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,930
Then I realised that it was due to global warming.

161
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,900
I should have a sense of responsibility...

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,040
and pressure just by going to Antarctica.

163
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,280
I'll do my part as the assistant in the kitchen.

164
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,480
I want to go and observe the situation in Antarctica.

165
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,020
(Are you good at cooking?)

166
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,379
(Feeling embarrassed)

167
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,420
Me?

168
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,220
I can follow instructions.

169
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,760
I'll do my best. For instance, let's say I have to cut radishes.

170
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,560
I can cut 100 radishes then.

171
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,660
That's how I roll.

172
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,660
(His passion was real.)

173
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,629
(Pickled radishes)

174
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,729
(Carrots)

175
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,469
(Once he was on a carrot duty, he'd keep cutting them.)

176
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,209
(This time, it's sweet pumpkins.)

177
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,569
(Your specialty is handling one ingredient.)

178
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,910
(Today, you're hooked on sweet pumpkins.)

179
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,180
(Carrots, pickled radishes, and sweet pumpkins)

180
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,380
(He stubbornly takes on a heavy load of responsibilities.)

181
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,389
(Shiny)

182
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,650
(Gosh, SUHO is great.)

183
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,660
(You're such a hard worker.)

184
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,930
(He's working so hard to the point that he brings out pity in people.)

185
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,690
(The last crew member, SUHO, joins.)

186
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,030
(Korea Polar Research Institute, Chef of Antarctica)

187
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,200
(The 4 crew members have assembled at last.)

188
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,570
(Paik Jong Won, the executive chef)

189
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,710

(SUHO, the most passionate man)

191
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,010
(Chae Jong Hyeop, the youngest, talented worker)

192
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,290
(30 days before departure)

193
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,719
(Korea Institute of Maritime and Fisheries Technology)

194
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,460
(October 22, 2024)

195
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,090
(Survival swimming training)

196
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,630
(The crew members have gathered for training.)

197
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:19,800
I'm looking forward to our time in Antarctica.

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,900
The reality of our trip is finally setting in.

199
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,470
I feel somewhat responsible for my fellow crew members.

200
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,439
I'm finding myself relying on them.

201
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,910
It's like comradeship.

202
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,810
It feels like we've become a family.

203
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,009
(Before heading to Antarctica, )

204
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,149
(they must complete every survival training course.)

205
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,949
When I vaguely thought about going to Antarctica,

206
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,320
I couldn't wait to get there.

207
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,460
But after going through the survival training,

208
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,189
I'm a bit scared now.

209
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,799
Before going to Antarctica,

210
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,359
I've completed the marine safety training,

211
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,429
fire safety training,

212
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,829
and on-land safety training.

213
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,439
Honestly, I didn't know going to Antarctica...

214
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
would be this complicated.

215
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,039
Actually, I thought...

216
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,810
all this training was a bit excessive.

217
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,009
But after going through the courses,

218
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,080
I realised that they were absolutely necessary.

219
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,820
Let me tell you why this is dangerous.

220
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,780
You could drown.

221
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,490
After going through training about our survival,

222
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,960
I learned just how dangerous Antarctica could be.

223
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,629
We weren't the only ones who got the training.

224
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,140
Everyone at the station must have gone through it too.

225
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,700
It's not a place you can go without some sense of determination.

226
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,579
Imagine how much pressure they must have also felt.

227
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,740
They must've felt a sense of responsibility too.

228
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,680
(This is a part of the rescue training.)

229
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,750
(The training is over.)

230
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,120
- You know what? So I hear...
- Yes.

231
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,289
the 37th winter crew is at the station now.

232
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,290
- Really? I didn't know about that.
- Yes.

233
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,860
So we're joining them as the 37th crew, right?

234
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,299
- We'd be like the 37.8th crew.
- We're...

235
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,669
Right. We'd be in the 37.5th to 37.8th range.

236
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,839
We'll be there in November.

237
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,810
About 80 percent of the year is over.

238
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,469
We're the 37.8th crew.

239
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,480
(The 37.8th crew members)

240
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,010
Here's the problem.

241
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,909
Vegetables are hard to come by there.

242
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,410
- Right.
- Yes.

243
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,850
I heard most of their ingredients were frozen.

244
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,289
(I see.)

245
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,050
(Are they frozen?)

246
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,590
(Frozen)

247
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,920
(Scarce)

248
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,260
Our food supply is quite limited.

249
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
I see. That's the product.

250
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,330
(Most of the ingredients are frozen.)

251
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,900
(Do we have cabbage?)

252
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,139
(We don't.)

253
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,600
(We have frozen onions.)

254
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,939
(Carrots are...)

255
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,410
(frozen too.)

256
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,509
(Whatever ingredient they have is frozen too.)

257
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,809
- Don't we have regular carrots?
- No.

258
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,980
(Glum)

259
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,590
(Even his favourite ingredient isn't available either.)

260
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,030
(Will they be able to serve a warm meal?)

261
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,469
So, we can't bring any kind of seasoning with us, right?

262
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,969
- Well, - What if we want to cook...

263
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,040
he can make everything himself.

264
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,199
- No. I can't. How...
- So...

265
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,070
- He...
- How can I make flavoured seasoning?

266
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,910
What's your best dish? The dish you're most confident to cook.

267
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,780
Actually, I'm the best when it comes to...

268
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,610
cooking soup because I have a sensitive palate.

269
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,950
I have a sensitive palate...

270
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,390
because I rarely consume salt and sugar in general.

271
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,190
My meals are usually salt and sugar-free.

272
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,230
Why?

273
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,630
Same here. I usually eat bland food.

274
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,700
(What on earth do you mean?)

275
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,530
That doesn't really match his cooking style.

276
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,300
Do you want to join me when I go to the Arctic?

277
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,399
(The guys with a bland palate are kicked out before departure.)

278
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,769
Maybe, you shouldn't join me in Antarctica.

279
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,910
(The guys with a bland palate are kicked out before departure.)

280
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,710
(Uneasy)

281
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,040
My seasoning is spot on.

282
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,850
My parents used to run a buffet.

283
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,279
- Did they use to run a buffet?
- Yes.

284
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,979
They ran a buffet when I was a kid.

285
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,719
- Do they still run it?
- Not anymore.

286
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,020
- Really?
- I was a kid then.

287
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,419
They ran it ever since I was a baby.

288
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,520
- That's unexpected.
- Right. So...

289
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,389
You must have often tasted their food.

290
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,630
I have.

291
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,059
In my opinion, you received...

292
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,460
the most elite culinary training.

293
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,100
(Check the seasoning, Soo Hyang.)

294
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,070
(I can't resist checking the seasoning.)

295
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,170
(More importantly, Soo Hyang's parents...)

296
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,470
(The daughter of a buffet restaurant in Busan)

297
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,540
(She possesses incredible data about flavour profiles.)

298
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,110
(She has become the sous chef solely with her palate.)

299
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,050
(The seasoning checker of the kitchen)

300
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,989
I think I used to tell my parents something tasted good.

301
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,120
(Leave the seasoning to me.)

302
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,959
With him as the executive chef,

303
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,930
we'll cook rice, soup, and side dishes.

304
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,059
We'll follow your lead and be good assistants.

305
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
Okay.

306
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,400
- Let's do this, Team.
- Okay.

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,970
(It's possible only in Antarctica.)

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,640
(A new kind of unexpected journey)

309
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,380
(A new world they've never experienced anywhere)

310
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,649
(Let's make use of Antarctica.)

311
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,380
(An unusual cooking method in Antarctica)

312
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,550
(Antarctic dalgona)

313
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,420
(Gosh, it's freezing.)

314
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,990
(Antarctic water makgeolli)

315
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,260
- I don't want to see it.
- It's here.

316
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,790
(Amazed)

317
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,889
(Made from drift ice...)

318
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,660
(they chipped themselves)

319
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,170
(Antarctic glacial water)

320
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,570
(Antarctica is an ideal form of untouched nature.)

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,070
(Amazed)

322
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,940
(Is this a spine?)

323
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,140
(Our world might have looked like this at the dawn of time.)

324
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,480
(I love it.)

325
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,510
(Just the sight of it makes them salivate.)

326
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,849
(Antarctic asado)

327
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,079
(It's impossible not to taste it.)

328
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,650
(Munching)

329
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,090
(Since we tasted a sample, let's serve this up.)

330
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,960
(Lifting)

331
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,400
(I almost hurt my back.)

332
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,430
(Chef of Antarctica will visit the neighbouring stations.)

333
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,199
(China)

334
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,639
(Uruguay)

335
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,870
(Argentina)

336
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,910
(The food storehouse is filled with various cultures.)

337
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,909
(Is that the tail?)

338
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,610
(Whole piglets are frozen!)

339
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,050
(This is a "niúwā.")

340
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,780
(Bullfrog)

341
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,290
(This is crazy.)

342
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,990
(It's full of rare ingredients, but lacks common ingredients.)

343
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,060
(In Antarctica, you work with what you have.)

344
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,260
(He's brimming with confidence for a reason.)

345
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,630
(Are you ready?)

346
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,730
(Yes, chef!)

347
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,730
(They'll serve a special dish to their neighbouring station.)

348
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,440
(We cooked it with love.)

349
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,610
(Gosh, she said "love.")

350
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,180
(The cultures in Antarctica become one with food.)

351
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,150
(Which one is your favourite?)

352
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,989
(A happy moment brought by food)

353
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,460
(And something happened in the Antarctic sea.)

354
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,190
Can you hear me?

355
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,930
(Honestly, it was quite dangerous then.)

356
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,600
(Rising waves and the darkening sky)

357
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,800
(They can't return to the station.)

358
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,310
(They stop filming in a state of emergency.)

359
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,709
(This is going to be bad if the weather condition worsens.)

360
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,950
(I'm terrified and quite concerned.)

361
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,349
(The crew members are flustered by the unexpected event.)

362
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,349
(At first, I thought the TV crew was pulling my leg.)

363
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,520
(The staff members assembled to handle the emergency.)

364
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,890
(The wind is very strong.)

365
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,160
(The sea conditions are bad.)

366
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,860
(I'd suggest not sailing.)

367
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,860
(It's not safe at all.)

368
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,630
(I didn't bring anything.)

369
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,300
(So I'm in big trouble.)

370
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,000
(Can you ask if they have the lens solution and container?)

371
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,140
(What will happen in Antarctica?)

372
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,379
(24 days before departure)

373
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,479
(23 days before departure)

374
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,509
(22 days before departure)

375
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,579
(21 days before departure)

376
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,789
(20 days before departure)

377
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,919
(19 days before departure)

378
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,330
(Individually getting ready to depart for Antarctica)

379
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,959
I thought I should learn how to cook.

380
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,000
I knew it'd be tough teaching myself how to cook.

381
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,799
So I invited a guest today.

382
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,470
He's a busy guy. Here he is.

383
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,499
(It's Homecook Master Kyu, Kyu Hyun.)

384
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,140
- I'm no expert.
- What?

385
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,709
You're Homecook Master Kyu.

386
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,369
Just like this? Am I doing this right?

387
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,040
Yes. Cut it. So...

388
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,009
I'm not scared of using a knife for now.

389
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,180
- Really?
- Yes.

390
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,050
You should be scared.

391
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,380
Gosh, great.

392
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,949
(1 day before departure)

393
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,950
The neck pillow.

394
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,990
I'll check in again tomorrow.

395
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,440
(The crew members assemble having prepared in their own way.)

396
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,540
(Leaving Korea)

397
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,050
(Passing through Madrid, Spain, their 1st transfer point)

398
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,350
(Santiago, Chile)

399
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,919
Aren't you exhausted?

400
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,120
(Santiago Airport in Chile)

401
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,950
How many hours did it take?

402
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,560
It took 14 hours and 4 hours in transit.

403
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,330
Then add 13 hours to that. That's 31 hours in total.

404
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,960
The next flight will take 2.5 hours.

405
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,000
- But we won't be in Antarctica.
- We won't still be in Antarctica.

406
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,669
- Yes, right.
- Even after...

407
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,100
- Even after all these hours...
- To Punta Arenas.

408
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,410
(Frying for a 2-hour-and-30-minute domestic flight from Santiago.)

409
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,019
(Punta Arenas Airport)

410
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,280
(Current time: 9pm, current temperature: 7°C)

411
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,719
My feet feel heavy.

412
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,389
- That's natural.
- Right.

413
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,960
(Tired and worn out, they're walking out of the airport.)

414
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,460
(A stranger is waiting for them!)

415
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,459
Hello.

416
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,700
(Who is this person holding the sign to welcome them?)

417
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,200
(He acts as a liaison between the Chilean authorities...)

418
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,040
(and the Korean research team to ensure smooth access to Antarctica.)

419
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,779
Hello, I'm Yang Jeong Hyeon.

420
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,810
(The head of the Korea-Chile Antarctic Cooperation Center)

421
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,450
(They follow his lead and move outside.)

422
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,980
Oh, it's cold.

423
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,020
- Oh, my.
- It's cold.

424
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,220
- The wind is different here.
- My gosh.

425
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,959
The wind here is cold.

426
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,589
(The cold wind welcomes them here.)

427
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,030
It is cold indeed.

428
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,029
The wind is strong.

429
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,100
(After about 40 hours of travel from Korea, )

430
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,059
(they reach the final stop before heading to Antarctica.)

431
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,229
(Punta Arenas)

432
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,130
"Punta Arenas."

433
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,199
(This region is close to Antarctica.)

434
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
(King George Island is 2 hours away from Punta Arenas.)

435
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,139
It's 9pm, but the sun hasn't set yet.

436
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,279
Right. The sun sets around 10pm.

437
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,410
(In this city, the sun stays up even until 11pm.)

438
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,549
(Researchers, explorers, and tourists...)

439
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,350
(heading to Antarctica gather here.)

440
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,989
(The final gateway to Antarctica)

441
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,960
We're at the end of the world.

442
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,289
This place is beautiful.

443
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:53,160
(The final gateway to Antarctica, Punta Arenas)

444
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,030
It's so cold.

445
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,470
Gosh, it's cold.

446
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,040
(To escape the biting wind and cold, )

447
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,440
(everyone, including Jong Hyeop, get into the van.)

448
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,710
Where are we going?

449
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,809
- To our accommodation.
- To our accommodation?

450
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,909
Yes. To our accommodation.

451
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,910
(They head to their accommodation at 9:30pm.)

452
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Oh, my.

453
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,120
The sky is pink.

454
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,019
Every photo taken here looks like a painting.

455
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,490
I love the sky.

456
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,330
(They're on their way to their accommodation...)

457
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,999
It's peaceful here.

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,140
(taking in the picturesque scenery and the beautiful sunset.)

459
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,510
Will it be possible to take a flight out early in the morning...

460
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,450
the day after tomorrow? Don't you know yet?

461
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,320
Usually, we're informed...

462
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,619
between 8pm and 12am...

463
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,259
on the day before departure...

464
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,160
whether the flight to Antarctica will take off.

465
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,700
(In Punta Arenas, travellers are informed...)

466
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,700
(after 8pm whether or not...)

467
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,470
(they'll be able to fly to Antarctica the following day.)

468
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,910
(If the flight is confirmed, they'll pack their bags and depart.)

469
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,610
(If it's cancelled, they will wait another day.)

470
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,080
- I see.
- Yes.

471
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,810
We should wait until tomorrow.

472
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,979
Has the weather been okay these days?

473
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,079
Will it be okay tomorrow?

474
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,989
Can we enter Antarctica in this weather?

475
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,660
Yes. We can go in this weather.

476
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,290
I hope we can.

477
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,960
I think we will.

478
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,830
Today, it feels...

479
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,930
(They hope tomorrow's weather is as nice as today's.)

480
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,439
The buildings have a unique charm.

481
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,969
Yes. Aren't they charming?

482
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,270
(They enter the center of Punta Arenas.)

483
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
We're here.

484
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,079
(They arrived at their accommodation in downtown Punta Arenas.)

485
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,150
My gosh.

486
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,810
- Let's go.
- Oh, my.

487
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,750
(They go up the narrow stairs.)

488
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Is this the switch?

489
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,789
(It's a cosy lounge decorated for relaxation.)

490
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,030
It feels warm and cosy.

491
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,359
I really like this place.

492
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,730
This is the living room.

493
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,630
There are two beds.

494
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,269
This is our room.

495
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,699
You and me?

496
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,740
I have a feeling.

497
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,639
(While the other crew members are looking around the place, )

498
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,669
(Crew Paik...)

499
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,570
Where's the kitchen? That's the most important space.

500
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,809
I think it's here.

501
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,109
Keep going in. And you'll see it.

502
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,880
(He's instinctively looking for the kitchen.)

503
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,310
Oh, yes.

504
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,880
My gosh.

505
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,990
It's so pretty. Look at this. What a beautiful kitchen.

506
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,220
This is nice.

507
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,890
I like the kitchen.

508
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,300
Oh, gosh.

509
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,930
It feels romantic here.

510
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,400
It's so pretty.

511
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,499
This place has a nice vibe.

512
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,699
(A romantic kitchen where any dish would taste good)

513
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,800
I'm excited.

514
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,039
(Romantic or not, let's check the stove first.)

515
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,140
Okay.

516
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,809
Oh, my gosh. You're checking the stove...

517
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,179
- as soon as you get here?
- This is the most important for us.

518
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,020
- To see how strong it is.
- We need to cook to survive.

519
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,689
It's all good.

520
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,649
- We have a stove and pots.
- I see. These are...

521
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,119
- separated.
- It even has a cover.

522
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,159
The gas stove...

523
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,860
Look at the pots. There's an oven as well.

524
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,759
(The cover works fine.)

525
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,800
Nice.

526
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,330
Oh, gosh.

527
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,600
(Crew Paik is back to his room after checking the kitchen.)

528
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,369
I've been almost everywhere in the world,

529
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,969
but getting here was probably...

530
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,469
the longest journey of them all.

531
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,980
What's important is that we're not in Antarctica yet.

532
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,980
We haven't reached Antarctica yet,

533
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,519
but it feels like I'm at the end of the world.

534
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,549
Of course, it's been a long and exhausting journey,

535
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,959
but now I feel excited...

536
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,590
and peaceful.

537
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,899
- You've come a long way.
- Well done.

538
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,200
See you tomorrow.

539
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,700
See you tomorrow morning.

540
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,500
(Episode 1: A Doubtful Beginning)

541
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,909
Oh, my.

542
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,740
(Day 2 in Punta Arenas)

543
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,740
(5 hours before the entry announcement for Antarctica)

544
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,979
(The crew members are going somewhere on a sunny day.)

545
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,250
It's so pretty.

546
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,350
(Jong Won is watching something.)

547
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,150
(He's super focused with his glasses on.)

548
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,560
(What is he watching?)

549
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,360
Dad, have a safe trip to Antarctica.

550
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Dad, have a safe trip to Antarctica.

551
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,630
She's cute.

552
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,370
(Smiling like a proud dad)

553
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,770
- How old is she?
- She's ten.

554
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,640
(She's cute.)

555
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,210
(He was doing physical training before departure.)

556
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,479
Hello.

557
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Hold my hand.

558
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,550
(Her cheering for her dad melted the crew members' hearts.)

559
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,089
(Paik Seo Hyeon, 10 years old, Jong Won's 2nd daughter)

560
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,290
Go study for a bit.

561
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,359
I'm here too.

562
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,589
- I'm exercising.
- I want to exercise too.

563
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,200
(Paik Se Eun, 7 years old, Jong Won's youngest daughter)

564
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,199
You should start doing your homework at 8pm.

565
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,930
That's why. I want to exercise before studying.

566
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,269
(Se Eun, the youngest one, is glued to Crew Paik.)

567
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,340
Dad.

568
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,570
(He listens to the messages from his two daughters in Korea.)

569
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,339
This place is straight out of a fairy tale.

570
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,480
It's cute.

571
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,979
"Punta Arenas."

572
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,050
(The crew members arrive at the beach.)

573
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,880
Isn't that the cruise to Antarctica?

574
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,390
I guess that's the cruise.

575
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,049
On other shows, when they go to Antarctica,

576
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,989
- they take a cruise like that...
- They take a cruise.

577
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,490
and make a short stop on the continent.

578
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,429
The Antarctica they're visiting is different from the one...

579
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,929
- It's different.
- we're going to.

580
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,230
When I told other people that I was going to Antarctica,

581
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,799
- Right.
- they said many people went there,

582
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,030
which was surprising.

583
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,299
The cruise leaves from here.

584
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,439
Right?

585
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,470
(The cruise to Antarctica departs from Punta Arenas.)

586
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,169
It looks magnificent.

587
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,580
(They'll explore Antarctica leisurely on a cruise.)

588
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,420
(They'll land on the continent and stay for over 10 days.)

589
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,580
Cheese.

590
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,460
(A luxury trip to Antarctica...)

591
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,790
(with various activities)

592
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,900
(However, )

593
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,529
(we are...)

594
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,469
(Chef of Antarctica.)

595
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,440
(In preparation for their polar mission, )

596
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,680
(they underwent on-land safety training...)

597
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,980
- One!
- One!

598
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,820
(marine safety training, )

599
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,790
(and fire safety training.)

600
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,260
(They're qualified overwintering crew members.)

601
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,630
(So instead of a tourist cruise, )

602
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,630
(they're taking a polar-specialised flight.)

603
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,040
(Will they be able to fly tomorrow?)

604
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,739
We may not be able to enter Antarctica because of the weather.

605
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,009
Or we may have to stay longer.

606
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,150
- The weather has a huge impact.
- I see.

607
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,550
Delays of three days or even a week...

608
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,249
are common.

609
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,650
- It's all up to the weather.
- Yes.

610
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,890
(Entry announcement for Antarctica at 8pm)

611
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,529
(The crew members are waiting for a call...)

612
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,000
(from the Korea Polar Research Institute.)

613
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,629
They said they would call at 8pm.

614
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,200
Is there a problem?

615
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,539
They said sometime after 8pm.

616
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,470
Did they say they'd call us after 8pm?

617
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,710
It's 8:14pm.

618
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,939
If they call us at 8:15pm...

619
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,410
Oh, my. It startled me.

620
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,250
(As he put down the phone, the screen turned on.)

621
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,280
(He thought he got a call.)

622
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,789
I was startled when the screen turned on.

623
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,450
I pressed it.

624
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,789
You said we would get there tomorrow.

625
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,560
You said you weren't worried at all.

626
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,359
But now, it feels...

627
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,630
It feels different?

628
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,800
Have you ever waited for a call so desperately like this?

629
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,899
We got a call.

630
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,200
(They finally get a call.)

631
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,410
Hello?

632
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,209
- Mr. Yang, hello.
- Hello.

633
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,139
This is the head of the Korea-Chile Antarctic Cooperation Center.

634
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,539
This is Yang Jeong Hyeon.

635
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,410
Hello, Mr. Yang. This is Paik Jong Won.

636
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Yes.

637
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,319
We just received a call from the Korea Polar Research Institute.

638
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,450
What did they say?

639
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,390
- It turns out...
- Yes.

640
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,030
that the flight bound for Antarctica departing tomorrow morning...

641
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,999
has been cancelled because of bad weather.

642
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,600
- Is that so?
- Yes.

643
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,870
What will happen now?

644
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,340
- It's been cancelled?
- Yes.

645
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,709
Looking at the weather forecast for King George Island,

646
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,350
there were no issues...

647
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,610
- until this morning.
- Okay.

648
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,919
But after it started to fog up, there was even a blizzard.

649
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,219
- I see.
- The weather...

650
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,860
(The blizzard is making it impossible to see ahead.)

651
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,330
Goodness, so we really can't go.

652
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
Does that mean we have to keep waiting?

653
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,569
I'll check the weather forecast around this time tomorrow.

654
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,940
- Around this time tomorrow?
- Yes.

655
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,440
Got it. Thank you.

656
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,610
(Unable to depart for Antarctica due to bad weather)

657
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,810
Good grief, it's not easy at all.

658
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,150
Oh, my.

659
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,080
Since it was just a two-hour flight,

660
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,750
I thought the weather wouldn't be a problem, but I was wrong.

661
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,120
It was shocking.

662
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,930
But in a way, I was relieved...

663
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,560
as it gave us more time...

664
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,199
to practice, get used to the jet lag,

665
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,730
and adjust to the environment.

666
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,000
That briefly crossed my mind.

667
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,270
I guess we'll just train more.

668
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,980
- Yes, let's make some food.
- Let's make gimbap.

669
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,880
(Day 3 of waiting to go to Antarctica)

670
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,889
(In contrast to Antarctica, )

671
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,220
(Punta Arenas is sunny this morning.)

672
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,590
(Jong Hyeop and SUHO warm up for a jog.)

673
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,360
This is basic fitness training...

674
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,260
in preparation for Antarctica.

675
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,100
(The fitness training begins.)

676
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,780
Since coming here, I've been jogging with SUHO.

677
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,909
We've grown closer than I expected.

678
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,850
It's the so-called inner closeness.

679
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,689
(Entering Antarctica was delayed by one day, )

680
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,360
(but the crew members have gotten closer.)

681
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,290
(Meanwhile, at the house, )

682
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
(Jong Won wakes up.)

683
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,069
(Whistling)

684
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,770
(Jong Won starts preparing breakfast as soon as he gets up.)

685
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,250
(Boiled chicken)

686
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,920
(The boiled chickens from the pot...)

687
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,250
(are pulled apart with forks.)

688
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,060
(Today's breakfast, made by Crew Paik)

689
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,930
(After being told last night that they couldn't enter Antarctica...)

690
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,730
Guess what I'm cooking.

691
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,870
I know. It's pho.

692
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,870
- Whole chicken soup - Chicken porridge?

693
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,070
Chicken porridge? Yes.

694
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,279
We won't be seeing any greens for a while.

695
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,440
I wanted to add some vegetables.

696
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,380
Let's go to bed after some light training tonight.

697
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,050
Training for tomorrow's meals.

698
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Yes, sir.

699
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,520
It's practice time.

700
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,950
(Warming up by peeling garlic)

701
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,790
(Carrots)

702
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,190
(Button mushrooms)

703
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,530
(Spinach)

704
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,059
(Rice)

705
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,900
(Jong Hyeop)

706
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,839
I wish I had that skill.

707
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,670
(Everyone joined in the ingredient prep training.)

708
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,969
- Hi.
- Good morning.

709
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,539
Did you work out?

710
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,910
- Yes, we went jogging.
- How diligent.

711
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,180
- Did you pull it apart?
- Yes.

712
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,220
Add the chicken in.

713
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,720
Is it boiling?

714
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,990
(Adding vegetables into the boiling porridge)

715
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,290
I'm adding everything.

716
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,360
(Chicken)

717
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,459
Finish it off with spinach.

718
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,070
(Spinach)

719
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,799
Careful not to let it burn.

720
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,370
(Stirring so the rice doesn't get scorched)

721
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,809
(Savoury and tasty spinach chicken porridge...)

722
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,780
(made with Chilean ingredients is done.)

723
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,080
(Shall we dig in?)

724
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,950
(A spoonful of chicken porridge)

725
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,190
Good, isn't it?

726
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,790
It really hits the spot.

727
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,490
(Impressed)

728
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Porridge is definitely easy to eat for breakfast.

729
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,970
- Right?
- Yes.

730
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,600
Porridge for the win, right?

731
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
Right.

732
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,170
- Once we get to the station, - Yes?

733
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,570
I'll make porridge for breakfast.

734
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,380
- Not bad, right?
- No.

735
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,650
(Based on the training in Punta Arenas, )

736
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,880
(they cook for the crew members in King Sejong Station.)

737
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,220
(Warm porridge)

738
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,490
(We brought your boxed meal.)

739
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,960
(An express delivery for the crew working in the cold)

740
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,739
(Thanks to the training, )

741
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,800
(their warmth and sincerity could come through.)

742
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,610
(Will they have a chance to do that tomorrow?)

743
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,580
Did you all pray?

744
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,910
Yes.

745
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,780
I have a good feeling today.

746
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,820
(Laughing)

747
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,419
That feeling was never wrong, right?

748
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,690
I have great luck, you know?

749
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,030
- Is that so?
- I had a bad feeling yesterday,

750
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,730
but not today.

751
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,869
(At that moment, the phone rings.)

752
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,100
- It's ringing.
- We're getting the call.

753
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,370
(We're getting the call!)

754
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,339
- Hold on.
- I know, right?

755
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,410
- Quiet.
- Sorry.

756
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,170
My heart is pounding.

757
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,440
Yes?

758
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,510
Really?

759
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,180
Yes.

760
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,580
Go ahead.

761
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,160
(The production crew is on the phone.)

762
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,390
Is there anything else?

763
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,500
I think we can go.

764
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,230
- What? Did they say that?
- Can we go?

765
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,740
(What kind of news will they get?)

766
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,009
All right. With that, we'll get ready.

767
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,080
- Really?
- Yes.

768
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,780
According to the airline, due to...

769
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,020
the current weather conditions on King George Island,

770
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,689
flying out tomorrow is impossible.

771
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,520
(Flying out tomorrow is impossible.)

772
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,020
- Flying out tomorrow is impossible.
- Oh, dear.

773
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,330
Oh, dear.

774
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,560
- For real?
- Yes.

775
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,239
The thin ice on the runway...

776
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,900
- The runway?
- Yes. It's making it hard to land.

777
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,910
With the current conditions, landing is impossible.

778
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,180
(The runway on King George Island in Antarctica...)

779
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,090
(is made of soil, not blacktop.)

780
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,160
(It's vulnerable to meteorological changes.)

781
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,500
(Because of the thin ice, landing is impossible.)

782
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,100
For real?

783
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,800
Good grief.

784
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,470
I thought it was a hidden camera prank.

785
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,950
My mind became a mess.

786
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,950
Going to Antarctica is not easy at all.

787
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,250
It's really tough.

788
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,660
(Unexpectedly, the second attempt to enter Antarctica has failed.)

789
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,840
(The land is not accessible to just anyone.)

790
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,599
(It's a 2-hour flight, )

791
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,409
(but the weather in Antarctica is what matters.)

792
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,540
(2 hours from Punta Arenas to King George Island)

793
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,780
(The weather conditions must be watched closely.)

794
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,990
(A snowstorm together with strong winds)

795
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,390
(Blizzard)

796
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,720
(The strong wind obstructs the field of vision.)

797
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,390
(The snow covers everything in minutes.)

798
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,930
(Neither flying nor landing is possible.)

799
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:40,570
(The condition of the runway changes in just hours.)

800
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,140
(Even if flying is possible, )

801
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,810
(reaching King Sejong Station is uncertain.)

802
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,790
(An RIB must be taken to go to King Sejong Station.)

803
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,520
(However, )

804
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,160
(drift ice, increased by global warming, )

805
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,930
(makes the boat hard to move and anchor.)

806
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,470
(The drift ice that has gathered at the King Sejong Station dock)

807
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,639
(Antarctica is reachable only when conditions...)

808
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,340
(both in the sky and at sea align.)

809
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:26,620
(A place that's accessible only when nature allows it)

810
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:39,160
(When will we be able to reach Antarctica?)
