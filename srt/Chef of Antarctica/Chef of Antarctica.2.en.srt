1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,980
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism...)

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,980
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,910
(Day 4 of waiting to go to Antarctica)

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,820
- No need to make it look nice.
- Got it.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,879
- Understood?
- Sure.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,889
With a knife...

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,219
Okay, like this.

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,590
Just make sure they're the same width.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,360
Don't worry about the length. Got it?

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,329
(Peeling garlic with his biceps)

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,230
(Grating carrots with his biceps)

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,070
(Slicing, crushing, and stir-frying)

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,100
(Coming together as a team)

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,970
I'm sorry, but...

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
(The staff suddenly calls the crew.)

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,979
We...

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,119
received a text about our flight schedule for tomorrow.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,149
- Via text?
- Via text?

19
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,320
- Yes.
- What does it say?

20
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,050
(Unlike before, they get an update via text.)

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,290
(Don't tell me...)

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,930
The flight on the 21st...

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,159
has been cancelled as well.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,499
(Once again, they cannot enter Antarctica.)

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
You've got to be kidding me.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,610
Oh, no.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,809
It seems like there is...

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,980
still a problem with the runway at the airfield.

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,550
This is bad.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,360
This is insane. Come on.

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:34,300
(Nov. 16: Departure from Korea, Nov. 17: Arrival in Punta Arenas)

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,470
What on earth? This has to be a joke.

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,940
I'm almost about to laugh.

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,980
I had no idea.

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,320
I didn't realise flying there would be this hard.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,090
Can we even make it there at this point?

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,889
I began to worry...

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,160
that maybe we wouldn't be able to reach Antarctica.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,260
It felt like despair was slowly building inside us.

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,099
It's not as if we can stay there longer...

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,629
to make up for the time we lost.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,230
(We couldn't exactly stay longer to make up for the time we lost.)

43
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,570
When our flight got cancelled the first day,

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,039
I figured it was possible.

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,110
It started to get frustrating when it was cancelled on the second day.

46
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,980
But the flight getting cancelled on the third day?

47
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,379
That's when I realised this was no joke.

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,080
Only the chosen...

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
can get to Antarctica.

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,989
What if we can't get there?

51
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,320
(What if we can't get there?)

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,060
(Despair washes over the crew as the flight keeps getting cancelled.)

53
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,699
(Day 5 of waiting to go to Antarctica)

54
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,940
(Current time: 7:50pm)

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,340
(The crew waits for the call in silence.)

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,010
(Nervous moments)

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,809
I'm getting a call. This is it.

58
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,280
(A call from Mr. Yang)

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,790
(Pricking up her ears)

60
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,990
I see.

61
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,019
Sure. Thank you.

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,490
(It can't be cancelled yet again.)

63
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,060
I just got a call.

64
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,169
- They called before 8pm today.
- Exactly.

65
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,270
- It's currently 7:56pm.
- Right.

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,910
Judging by the weather today, tomorrow...

67
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,609
(Will they...)

68
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,409
(be allowed...)

69
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,280
(to enter Antarctica?)

70
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,819
Judging by the weather today,

71
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,959
you will fly to Antarctica tomorrow...

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,260
at 7am.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,690
(Relieved)

74
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,430
(Beaming)

75
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,060
(Cheering)

76
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,860
(Applauding)

77
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,729
I think it's the 7am flight.

78
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,969
- Is that the first flight in?
- Yes.

79
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,039
(Cheering)

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,370
Look at the staff applauding.

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,439
(The staff, exhausted from the long wait, )

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,040
(are just as happy.)

83
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,450
Is there a chance things might change overnight?

84
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,780
Why would you say that?

85
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,119
The weather has been that unpredictable.

86
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,260
(You know what I mean.)

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,330
He says the chances of flying in are about 80 to 90 percent.

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,930
I doubt the flight will be cancelled.

89
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,800
Yes, it's finally happening.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,530
(The crew is finally smiling.)

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,739
I should get packing.

92
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,570
- Let's pack, everyone.
- Sure.

93
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,839
(Day 1, Day 2, Day 3)

94
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,839
(Day 4, Day 5, Day 6)

95
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,939
This is great.

96
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,309
(After waiting 6 days since leaving Korea, )

97
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,650
(we're finally headed to Antarctica.)

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,990
(The next day, 3am)

99
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,349
(Bouncing)

100
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,790
(Dancing at the thought of going to Antarctica)

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,220
We waited 5 days and 12 hours.

102
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,160
Let's go.

103
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,830
Bye.

104
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,160
Heading to the airport,

105
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,930
I was overwhelmed with excitement.

106
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,940
Here it is. Have a good day.

107
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,410
(After days of cancelled flights, )

108
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,569
(the airport is packed with crew members...)

109
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,510
(from nearby stations in the early morning.)

110
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,810
(The members of the 37.8th crew, who arrived with excitement, )

111
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,610
(are also checking in for their flight to Antarctica.)

112
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,980
We're going to Antarctica.

113
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,049
- Here you go. Thank you, and enjoy.
- Thank you.

114
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,590
(They receive their tickets.)

115
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,789
Places in our imaginations aren't always so far away.

116
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,090
I'm glad we're finally going there.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,230
Tell me about it.

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,430
(Excited)

119
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,430
(Their bags are heavy, but their hearts are light.)

120
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought it would be the plane with a penguin on it.

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,310
Wait, it's a small plane.

122
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,439
It's really small.

123
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,110
(It only flies to and from Antarctica!)

124
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,880
- Isn't this cool?
- It is.

125
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,879
I was extremely excited about going there.

126
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,419
I might start crying once I arrive.

127
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,490
(All members of the 37.8th crew board the plane.)

128
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,530
(The plane for Antarctica takes off.)

129
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,300
(Flying over South America)

130
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,069
(To Antarctica, where it is even whiter than clouds!)

131
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,370
I can't see a thing.

132
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,909
(Punta Arenas, King George Island in Antarctica)

133
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,950
(A 2-hour flight from Punta Arenas to King George Island)

134
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,979
(Looking out the window for the entire flight...)

135
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,880
(instead of sleeping)

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,820
(Nose pressed to the window)

137
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,190
(Past the foggy clouds, )

138
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,170
(Antarctica finally shows itself.)

139
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,000
No way!

140
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,170
(They see an impressive sight after 6 days of waiting.)

141
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,740
This is on a whole other level.

142
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,780
The snow is on a whole new level.

143
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,549
People would think...

144
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,519
- these are clouds.
- I know.

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,620
(Snow-covered mountains like you have never seen before)

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,789
(An unbelievable and incomprehensible sight)

147
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,919
I can't believe it.

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,320
(An unbelievable and incomprehensible sight)

149
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,730
(The landscape of Antarctica)

150
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,320
Normally, when a plane is about to land,

151
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,460
- we see buildings nearby.
- That's right.

152
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,189
All we can see here is snow.

153
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,730
- That's all we can see.
- We can't see anything else.

154
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,059
This is the moment of truth.

155
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,970
Our flight kept getting cancelled because the tarmac was frozen.

156
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,900
It's just a rough, gravel runway.

157
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,139
We're not landing...

158
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,850
- on a traditional paved runway.
- What on earth?

159
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,849
We're finally in Antarctica.

160
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,890
(Landing in Antarctica, 9am)

161
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,419
I'm really curious about the weather.

162
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,190
(The moment of stepping onto Antarctica)

163
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,230
- Bye.
- Bye.

164
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,600
(At last, they face...)

165
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,940
(the unknown land of Antarctica.)

166
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,750
Stepping onto Antarctica for the first time...

167
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,820
left me in awe.

168
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,960
No way.

169
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,200
I couldn't believe I was at the ends of the earth.

170
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,669
The thought alone made my heart feel full.

171
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,940
(The thought alone made my heart feel full.)

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,309
I guess you could say it was refreshing.

173
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,210
(I guess you could say it was refreshing.)

174
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,340
I couldn't even tell if this was Earth anymore.

175
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,180
I knew it was a moment I'd never experience again.

176
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,489
It looks like something from a movie.

177
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,959
Doesn't it feel like another planet?

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,690
(Like being on an undiscovered planet)

179
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,769
It felt like only the chosen could come here.

180
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,530
(A place only for the chosen)

181
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,369
Not just anyone can come here.

182
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,940
(Not just anyone can come here.)

183
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,050
(A land of snow and ice)

184
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,380
(A frozen time capsule holding the history of Earth)

185
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,120
(Antarctica)

186
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,730
(Treasuring the mysteries of the ages)

187
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,470
(The ends of the earth)

188
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,600
(Where the members of the 37.8th crew took their first steps)

189
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,340
(The unofficial capital of Antarctica)

190
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,710
(King George Island)

191
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,019
(Stations from 8 countries: South Korea)

192
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,949
(Russia, Chile, China, Uruguay, Argentina, Poland, Brazil)

193
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,989
(Where crew members...)

194
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,190
(of all different languages, cultures, and backgrounds...)

195
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,889
(live side by side, )

196
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,230
(united in the shared purpose of conducting research in Antarctica)

197
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,670
(At the forefront of human research)

198
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,470
(A small settlement in Antarctica, King George Island)

199
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,039
(The crew members head somewhere in the airport bus.)

200
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,610
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

201
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,459
We took a two-hour flight,

202
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,660
and I thought that was it.

203
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,690
But it wasn't.

204
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,060
(Their journey is not over yet.)

205
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,199
(This time, )

206
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,400
(they travel by sea.)

207
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,710
(King Sejong Station sits along the coastline.)

208
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,810
(Transportation to the station)

209
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,750
(The taxi in Antarctica)

210
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,850
(A RIB)

211
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,279
(Light and convenient, )

212
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,450
(it's efficient for moving around in Antarctica.)

213
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,590
(We'll come pick you up soon.)

214
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,390
(The crew members wait to board the RIB.)

215
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,290
I can't believe we're seeing penguins already.

216
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,629
We can't pet them, right?

217
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,900
(What penguins?)

218
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,770
(Hi!)

219
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,339
They're adorable.

220
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,970
(Waddling)

221
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,870
I'd love to grab one.

222
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,339
(Keep your hands to yourself, despite the temptation.)

223
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,350
(Touching penguins is not allowed unless it's for research.)

224
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,819
(I should at least take photos, then.)

225
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,220
They're so adorable.

226
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,780
They're so cute.

227
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,589
They don't seem scared of people.

228
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,090
(We'll let you take photos of us.)

229
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,059
One, two, three.

230
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,490
(While the crew members take photos, )

231
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,000
(Crew Paik gazes out at the sea, lost in thought.)

232
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,669
This must be something from the sea,

233
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,100
not food waste.

234
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,409
This is some funny-looking seaweed.

235
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,440
(Antarctic seaweed)

236
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,580
(Looking closely)

237
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,690
(He gently touches the Antarctic seaweed.)

238
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,819
Has anyone made a salad with this before?

239
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,320
(Has anyone made a salad with this before?)

240
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,720
(We highly doubt it.)

241
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,229
I should ask...

242
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,160
if anyone has ever cooked this before.

243
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:42,530
(Could Antarctica be a paradise of undiscovered ingredients?)

244
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
We should check in.

245
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,839
Right, since we're here.

246
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,270
(Since they're here, they should check in.)

247
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,139
King Sejong Station,

248
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,040
this is Crew Paik.

249
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,549
Crew Paik,

250
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,990
this is the communication room at King Sejong Station.

251
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,319
All three are in good health.

252
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,589
Wait, there are four, including me.

253
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,829
All four are in good health,

254
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,230
and no one has motion sickness.

255
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,099
We'll see you shortly...

256
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,330
after the RIB ride, over.

257
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,299
Noted.

258
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,100
The wind speed is currently between 6m to 9m per second.

259
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,399
We have an east wind,

260
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,469
and the sea looks calm,

261
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,540
but there's still a lot of drift ice.

262
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,840
Keep that in mind when you're out at sea, over.

263
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,479
Thank you for the update. We copy you loud and clear.

264
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,620
We'll see you shortly. Thank you, over.

265
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,290
Roger, out.

266
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,860
(How's that?)

267
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,460
There's a reason I carry the radio around.

268
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,990
I served as an artillery officer,

269
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,130
even though I was assigned to kitchen duty.

270
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,829
(Starting today, you're assigned...)

271
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,300
(to the kitchen at King Sejong Station.)

272
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,410
Put on the top. I'll help you.

273
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,240
Thank you.

274
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,280
Don't I look like an expert?

275
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,949
(Expert Paik looking out for the other crew members)

276
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,380
Thank you.

277
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,080
How sweet of you, Crew Paik.

278
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,850
(The embarrassed Mr. Sugar)

279
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,619
If you're here for the RIB, you can board now.

280
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,620
(Ready to board the RIB)

281
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,430
(The final part of the journey to King Sejong Station)

282
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,159
Goodness, hello.

283
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,830
(Crew members of King Sejong Station are here to greet them.)

284
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,900
- Do I get on it?
- Yes.

285
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,340
Just slide over the edge to get into the boat.

286
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,039
As we were trained.

287
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,070
(As they were trained)

288
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,109
I'll hold that for you.

289
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,110
(Light as a feather)

290
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,580
(He moves to the back of the boat, being the first to board.)

291
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,849
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

292
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,019
(Heave-ho!)

293
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,419
(With his long legs, Jong Hyeop easily boards the RIB.)

294
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,490
Hello.

295
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,389
(SUHO and Soo Hyang also board the RIB.)

296
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,360
Goodness. Thank you.

297
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,560
(All crew members are on board.)

298
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,229
I'm the maritime safety team member driving the RIB.

299
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,199
- Give him a round of applause.
- Hello.

300
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
(Responsible for safety out at sea)

301
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,470
(Maritime safety team member, Kwon Oh Seok)

302
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,110
I'll set out with 11 people on board Sejong 15.

303
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,980
(See you at King Sejong Station.)

304
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,710
(Leaving the dock at the Chilean station)

305
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,550
(They head to King Sejong Station, the final stop on their journey.)

306
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,190
Are those penguins?

307
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,190
I can see them swimming.

308
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,420
They must not be cold.

309
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,230
That's fascinating.

310
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,059
There are so many penguins out here.

311
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,660
(Have a safe trip.)

312
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,400
Looks like we have good weather today.

313
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,100
- Grab on tight for your own safety.
- Got it.

314
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,610
Off we go.

315
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,040
How long will it take?

316
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,409
About 40 minutes.

317
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,710
- Forty minutes?
- Yes.

318
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,980
Gosh, 40 minutes?

319
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,719
We call this part of the sea...

320
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,619
Maxwell Bay.

321
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,290
- Max?
- Maxwell.

322
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,720
- Maxwell?
- Yes.

323
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,060
Okay.

324
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,030
(Heading to the middle of Maxwell Bay)

325
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,770
What on earth?

326
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,640
What was that?

327
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,500
What is this?

328
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,179
And this is considered calm.

329
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,310
We wouldn't be here if the sea were rough.

330
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,879
Waves and swells are usually stronger...

331
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,550
in the middle of the bay.

332
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,079
- I see.
- It's different from the coast.

333
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,150
(Waves are stronger than they were near the coast.)

334
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,320
SUHO, try to block the water from your end.

335
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,689
(Glancing)

336
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,120
I've been blocking it for you.

337
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,060
(Drenched)

338
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,370
(The splashes keep coming.)

339
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,269
(My gosh)

340
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,100
(Laughing)

341
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,740
Now I get why we have to wear this gear.

342
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,279
I think my underwear is soaked.

343
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,540
(I think my underwear is soaked.)

344
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,849
I'd say the sea is calm today.

345
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,310
(Unbelievable)

346
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,049
This is part of the charm.

347
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,180
(The crew members are going through their initiation.)

348
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,360
Over there, you can see a small chunk of ice drifting.

349
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,359
That small piece of drift ice.

350
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,030
- Drift ice?
- That's right.

351
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,329
- I see 1 over there.
- There's 1 over there too.

352
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,360
Right.

353
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,499
- There are a lot.
- Check out all that ice.

354
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,970
There's a lot.

355
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,269
Did that break off because it melted?

356
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,869
Yes, they are...

357
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,709
pieces of ice that fell off the glaciers over there.

358
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,780
(Drift ice: Small chunks of ice that broke off from glaciers)

359
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,110
(They're as hard as rocks.)

360
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:22,310
- We must avoid them.
- Sorry?

361
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,909
We need to avoid them.

362
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,980
(Drift ice is sharp and needs to be avoided, )

363
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,820
(unless you're a penguin resting after a swim.)

364
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,390
(Current location)

365
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,200
This is where Marian Cove begins.

366
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,670
It's this area.

367
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,529
It's called Marian Cove.

368
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,170
(A gigantic glacial wall stands before them.)

369
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,540
(Marian Cove)

370
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,510
It's not as big as it used to be.

371
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,510
The glacial wall continues to collapse.

372
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,490
(The front side has completely collapsed.)

373
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,690
(The steeply carved ice wall)

374
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,330
(The traces of the collapse below)

375
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,500
There is drift ice around that area.

376
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,050
It melted down...

377
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,880
and went in like that. I see.

378
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,020
(The Mariana Cove is continuing to retreat.)

379
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,959
We are prohibited from getting closer than 300m.

380
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,460
Oh, is it dangerous to get closer than that?

381
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,490
- Yes, it keeps collapsing.
- I see.

382
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,230
That's why it's dangerous.

383
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,030
That's the part that keeps collapsing.

384
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,069
That shape...

385
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,139
was a lot bigger just a few months ago,

386
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,740
but it all collapsed.

387
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,379
When the weather is nice,

388
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,249
the ice walls come crashing down.

389
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,820
(Antarctica's screams get louder as the weather gets warmer.)

390
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,530
(Where climate change is happening the fastest)

391
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:29,170
(The speed at which ice walls fall...)

392
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,740
(has been increasing recently.)

393
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,579
(By 2024,)

394
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,750
(it has retreated about 2km.)

395
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,360
(Now, in 2025,)

396
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,460
(even the bedrock is visible.)

397
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,340
(The highest temperature recorded in Antarctica in 2020)

398
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,170
(18.3°C)

399
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,480
(The ice walls melting due to global warming...)

400
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,649
(has caused a rise in sea levels, a drop in water temperatures, )

401
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,850
(and a decrease in salinity.)

402
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,960
(Seaweed colonies have been destroyed.)

403
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,390
(Mass deaths of krill have been occurring continuously.)

404
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,260
(Penguins consume live krills.)

405
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,439
(By 2040,)

406
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,840
(their population will be reduced by half.)

407
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,010
(To stop the tragic ecological change in Antarctica, )

408
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,680
(we can no longer look away from the crisis in Antarctica.)

409
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,349
So it must've collapsed a bit more compared to before, right?

410
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,920
- Because of global warming?
- Yes.

411
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,520
It gave me chills.

412
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,759
I felt that it was serious.

413
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,930
I could see the drastic change...

414
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,070
of Earth's temperatures.

415
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,470
It gives me chills.

416
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,110
- We'll return to the station.
- Okay.

417
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,269
This is the communication room.

418
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,540
Sejong 13 will arrive at the station in 10 minutes.

419
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,709
(They're almost at King Sejong Station.)

420
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,920
(Marian Cove, South Korea's King Sejong Station)

421
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,289
- Isn't that King Sejong Station?
- That's right.

422
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,749
- This is King Sejong Station.
- And this...

423
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,420
- This is the gymnasium?
- Yes.

424
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,190
This is so cool.

425
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:30,460
(They finally see the orange buildings.)

426
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,260
It's a lot bigger than it seems in pictures.

427
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,870
Yes, it's quite big.

428
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,200
This is so cool.

429
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,609
Hello.

430
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,310
(Hello.)

431
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,150
(A place 17,240km away from Korea)

432
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,290
(Korea's first research station in Antarctica)

433
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:11,900
(The King Sejong Station)

434
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,610
(To begin full-scale research of Antarctica, )

435
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,380
(a permanent research station was built on February 17, 1988.)

436
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,349
(With hopes of scientific advancement...)

437
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,220
(and a pioneering spirit, King Sejong Station was built.)

438
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,830
(38 years later)

439
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,160
(It was expanded to 5,610m².)

440
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,530
(There are 16 buildings in total.)

441
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,740
(A winter crew, )

442
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,240
(composed of 18 members, live here.)

443
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,280
(From the 1st winter crew sent in 1988,)

444
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,650
(over 600 people have been sent over the past 38 years.)

445
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,390
(They don't just research Antarctica.)

446
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,830
(They also maintain the station.)

447
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,599
(Station Managers, Research Team)

448
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
(Maintenance Team, Administrative Team)

449
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,710
(Even in extreme conditions, the winter crew works hard...)

450
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:29,280
(to explore Antarctica.)

451
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:36,520
(The 37th crew protects King Sejong Station.)

452
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,460
(We're on our way to meet them now!)

453
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,369
We'll arrive at the dock soon.

454
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,400
Would you like to try throwing the rope?

455
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,670
Yes, sir.

456
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,770
That was a great throw.

457
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,180
(Pulling the docking rope taut)

458
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,610
Nicely done.

459
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,880
Good work.

460
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

461
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,480
(Careful)

462
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,360
My underwear is wet.

463
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,060
How did water get in my pants? Isn't it interesting?

464
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,570
(All members of the 37.8th crew have arrived.)

465
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,940
What is that?

466
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,100
Is that a whale? A dolphin?

467
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,870
No way. What is that?

468
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,210
(A leopard seal is lying on the ice.)

469
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,910
Is... Is it dead?

470
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,979
(Peekaboo.)

471
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,719
Is it sleeping in that cold place?

472
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,020
(Napping on the ice bed)

473
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,430
That's amazing. It's sleeping?

474
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,060
- I'm Leader Lee Hyeong Geun.
- Hello.

475
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,299
Welcome to King Sejong Station.

476
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,199
- Thank you for coming all this way.
- Not at all.

477
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,940
(Leader Lee Hyeong Geun, King Sejong Station's godfather)

478
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,270
(He's an expert of all equipment in the station.)

479
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,340
(He was part of the 17th crew sent to the station 20 years ago.)

480
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,180
(Using his past experience as a communications member, )

481
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,320
(he also supports communications tasks.)

482
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,450
(He proactively recruited applicants in their 20s and 30s...)

483
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,389
(to build the 37th winter crew.)

484
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,290
(Winter Crew Leader Lee Hyeong Geun)

485
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,499
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

486
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,299
Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you.

487
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,000
I look forward to working with you.

488
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,429
Thank you for coming all this way.

489
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,570
(We look forward to working with you, Leader Lee.)

490
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,739
It must've been a while since you saw an outsider.

491
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,739
- It's been nine months.
- Nine months...

492
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,809
Nine months.

493
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,840
(He's happy to see outsiders for the first time in 9 months.)

494
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,209
Nice to meet you.

495
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,309
- This is Secretary Kwon Young Hoon.
- Nice to meet you.

496
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,919
- Say hi to everyone.
- Hello.

497
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,250
I look forward to working with you.

498
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,590
(King Sejong Station's homemaker)

499
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,320
(Secretary Kwon Young Hoon)

500
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,859
(After they take off their life jackets, )

501
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,400
(Secretary Kwon leads the crew somewhere.)

502
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,560
(Where are we going?)

503
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,200
- You can stand here.
- Here?

504
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,699
- What is this?
- All right.

505
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,140
(He brought them to the statue in front of the living quarters.)

506
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,509
There is something everyone must do...

507
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,209
when they first arrive at King Sejong Station.

508
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,679
The first thing you must do...

509
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,109
is to have a moment of silence...

510
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,320
in front of the statue of former crew member Jeon Jae Gyu.

511
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,919
Crew member Jeon Jae Gyu, who you see in front of you now,

512
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,789
was working as a crew member...

513
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,890
of King Sejong Station exactly 21 years ago.

514
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,959
Three crew members who went to transport the other members...

515
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,699
became stranded at sea.

516
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
(They became stranded due to a blizzard.)

517
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,399
Crew member Jeon Jae Gyu and another member...

518
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
went out to rescue them,

519
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,039
but the conditions got even worse.

520
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,410
(The weather conditions got even worse during that time.)

521
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,640
(Their RIB was flipped over.)

522
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,420
(Former crew member Jeon Jae Gyu died in the cold ocean.)

523
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,989
To honour the noble sacrifice...

524
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,489
of former crew member Jeon Jae Gyu,

525
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,259
all visitors of King Sejong Station...

526
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,659
must have a moment of silence when they first arrive.

527
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,730
(A moment of silence for former crew member Jeon Jae Gyu)

528
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,660
Please observe a moment of silence.

529
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,399
(You became a star in the Antarctica sky.)

530
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,880
(We won't forget your noble sacrifice, Mr. Jeon Jae Gyu.)

531
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,249
Were the others rescued?

532
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,379
The others were rescued.

533
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,249
Only previous crew member Jeon Jae Gyu was...

534
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,520
He went to save the others and only he...

535
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,759
The second floor...

536
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,889
is the living quarters, and the first floor is the lab.

537
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,160
(The members of the 37.8th crew head to the research building.)

538
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,329
Lunch is at 12pm,

539
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,099
so please come to the cafeteria by 12pm.

540
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
- Okay.
- Thank you.

541
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,899
(They head to their assigned rooms.)

542
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,640
Okay. This is nice.

543
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,470
(Looking around)

544
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,540
- Soo Hyang, can I see your room?
- Sure.

545
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,610
(Oh, my)

546
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,920
This is nice.

547
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,790
- What is this?
- What?

548
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,989
What?

549
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,320
You have one inside.

550
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,590
This is nice.

551
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,960
Are you jealous?

552
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,220
I'm jealous.

553
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,100
(Crew Paik organises his things.)

554
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,330
(Is SUHO meditating at his desk?)

555
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,640
(Station communication error)

556
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,409
(Retransmission success)

557
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,150
Yes, this is King Sejong Station.

558
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,480
(Taking a bite first)

559
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,989
I was so hungry.

560
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,749
Starting 3am...

561
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,960
(Recording his daily log at King Sejong Station)

562
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,920
It took 6 days and 12 hours.

563
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,660
Anyway,

564
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,129
I'll do my best to support...

565
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,270
the crew members at King Sejong Station.

566
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,270
Let's go.

567
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,209
(Looking tired)

568
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,479
(Is he also having communications errors?)

569
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,049
(Affiliation: 37.8th Crew)

570
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,720
The view from the room looks like this.

571
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,420
Anyway, we're here.

572
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,520
That's it for today.

573
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,560
We haven't met all of the crew members yet.

574
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,260
I think I should try memorizing all of their names soon.

575
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,800
The leader is Mr. Lee Hyeong Geun.

576
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,299
I remember Eun Su too. Maintenance.

577
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,540
(While Soo Hyang works hard to memorize their names, )

578
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,769
(the morning passes by.)

579
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,040
(12pm)

580
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,979
(Right at noon, an announcement rings through the station.)

581
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,179
(The actual mealtime announcement at King Sejong Station)

582
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,250
It's lunchtime.

583
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,550
Hurry on over and eat.

584
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,390
If you're late, we may run out of the yummy side dishes.

585
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,759
Hurry.

586
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,660
(Hurry.)

587
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,860
(It's time to eat.)

588
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,670
(The 37th winter crew members came at the sound of the bell.)

589
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,270
(They naturally grab their trays.)

590
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,570
(I'm hungry.)

591
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,140
(Scanning the menu)

592
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,050
(Everyone checks the menu.)

593
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,079
(Today's lunch...)

594
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,490
(is stir-fried spicy pork.)

595
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,290
(Kimchi, garlic leaves, radish wrap)

596
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,960
(Light seaweed soup with beef)

597
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,429
Hurry up.

598
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,930
Hold on.

599
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,700
I shouldn't talk while grabbing food.

600
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,329
Did you come here to eat?

601
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,500
Yes.

602
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,640
(One by one, in order)

603
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,310
(Grabbing the dishes they want)

604
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,749
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

605
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,850
Enjoy.

606
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,519
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

607
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,250
(Happy lunchtime begins.)

608
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,320
(The crew members enjoy their tasty lunch.)

609
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,530
(While the crew members eat, )

610
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,930
(one person slowly approaches them.)

611
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,400
It's all cold, right?

612
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,840
Does it still taste good, even though it's cold?

613
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,100
Does it still taste good, even though it's cold?

614
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,340
(Nodding)

615
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,239
It can't taste bad if you're making it, Chi Young.

616
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,380
It tastes good, of course.

617
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,709
(Who is this crew member with the sanitary hat?)

618
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,980
It always tastes good, right?

619
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,020
Hello, I am...

620
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,720
King Sejong Cooking Station...

621
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,289
I'm sorry.

622
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,749
- From the top, a bit louder.
- Okay.

623
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,190
(Be calm.)

624
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,129
I'm An Chi Young, the culinary crew member...

625
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,860
of the 37th crew at King Sejong Station.

626
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,530
(He's responsible for the cafeteria in Antarctica.)

627
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,900
(A Chinese cuisine chef of 7 years, the original "Chef of Antarctica")

628
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,840
I cooked for the crew members by myself for one year.

629
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,340
Every day.

630
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
Three meals a day.

631
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,649
(Breakfast, 8am)

632
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,779
(Lunch, 12pm)

633
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
(Dinner, 6pm)

634
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,849
(To make three meals a day for the crew members)

635
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,719
The other members do most of their work outdoors.

636
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,559
I stay in this kitchen all day.

637
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,890
(Crew Member An Chi Young works hard in Sejong Center.)

638
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,930
In Antarctica,

639
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,330
there isn't a lot to enjoy.

640
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,870
(King Sejong Station is isolated by snow and the ocean.)

641
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,340
(There's nothing to do for fun.)

642
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,140
(The only joy)

643
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,410
Having three meals a day is the biggest joy for our crew.

644
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,050
(The time when they fill their bellies with warm food)

645
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,989
All 18 crew members work in different places,

646
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,290
even within our station.

647
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,290
(Heading out to sea for work)

648
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,129
Some of us do research.

649
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,730
(The research team observes Antarctica.)

650
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,599
Some work on maintenance and repair.

651
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,570
(The maintenance team protects Antarctica.)

652
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,740
(The crew members spread out during work hours.)

653
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,080
I check on how they're doing...

654
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,910
and whether they're alive...

655
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,579
during meals.

656
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,620
(Mealtime is time to check whether everyone is alive.)

657
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,249
If someone doesn't come, I get worried...

658
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,549
that something happened to them.

659
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,550
(Mealtime is especially important for the crew members.)

660
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,820
During the one year we spend in isolation,

661
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,290
I want to give them as much joy as I can.

662
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,930
I think not being able to eat out...

663
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,870
is one of the hardest parts for the crew members.

664
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,199
We can't eat out.

665
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,370
(We can't eat out.)

666
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,270
(It's hard to come here, )

667
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,640
(but it's just as hard to leave Antarctica.)

668
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,880
(In Antarctica, where there are no places to eat out, )

669
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,080
(Sejong Center is the only restaurant.)

670
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,720
The crew members always say,

671
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,620
"Your food is tasty too,"

672
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,129
"but it must be nice if someone else could cook for us."

673
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,729
(It must be nice if someone else could cook for us.)

674
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,370
(Someone)

675
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,640
It gave me a greater sense of responsibility.

676
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,410
I really want to be helpful.

677
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,109
Mr. Paik.

678
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,450
We'll get to that in a second.

679
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,379
I hope we can share warmth...

680
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,220
with one warm meal.

681
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,490
Let's have a meaningful meal.

682
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,999
(Chef of Antarctica)

683
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,059
(But)

684
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,800
(The storage room is completely empty.)

685
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,770
- There aren't many onions.
- Right.

686
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,939
(They already have trouble.)

687
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
(Are these all?)

688
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,170
So these...

689
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,340
(It's the end of winter, and most ingredients are gone.)

690
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,740
Are these all the noodles you have?

691
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,910
Yes.

692
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,480
There were so few ingredients.

693
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,080
What should we do now?

694
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,350
(Chef of Antarctica has finally come to Antarctica.)

695
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,320
(Hello.)

696
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,519
(We came to serve you a nice meal.)

697
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,720
Do you have cabbage?

698
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,989
We don't have cabbage.

699
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,560
The onions are frozen.

700
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,329
How about carrots?

701
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,760
We have frozen baby carrots.

702
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,299
(How about...)

703
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,329
(We don't have that.)

704
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,729
You don't have that?

705
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,540
(Feeling lost)

706
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,610
(Chef of Antarctica never gives up.)

707
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,369
(Falling apart)

708
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,010
When will this melt?

709
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,909
(They only have frozen ingredients.)

710
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,179
(This is a frozen food party.)

711
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,879
(Chef of Antarctica has fallen into the trap of defrosting.)

712
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,419
(Only the time goes by quickly in Antarctica.)

713
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,360
(Will they be able to serve up a warm meal?)

714
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,790
(They came to Antarctica on water.)

715
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,299
(This time, they're going on land.)

716
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,400
(Two of our crew members head somewhere.)

717
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,099
