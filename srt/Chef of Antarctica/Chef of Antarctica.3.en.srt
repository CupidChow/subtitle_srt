1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,579
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,910
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,580
(Antarctica is on the front line of climate change.)

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,349
(The Chef of Antarctica crew has been assigned...)

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,020
(to work in the kitchen at King Sejong Station.)

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,949
(They went through multiple safety trainings...)

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,560
(and received special training to improve their cooking skills.)

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,660
(You're doing great!)

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,190
(Seeking new environments and experiences, )

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,900
(the crew members set off for the edge of the world.)

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,529
(And...)

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,570
(finally, )

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,410
(after a long wait, )

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,310
(they encountered the landscapes of Antarctica.)

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,939
(A land of snow and ice)

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,549
(A vast, unfamiliar land)

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,550
(And those who live here)

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,820
(Gosh, what's this?)

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,419
(Isn't that the King Sejong Station?)

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,520
(The King Sejong Station)

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,319
(An Chi Young, a culinary crew member)

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,490
(There isn't much to enjoy here.)

23
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,630
(Having three meals a day is the biggest joy of their lives.)

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,799
(This is what everyone in the crew always says.)

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,630
(I wish there was another dish cooked by someone else.)

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,640
(I feel more responsible now.)

27
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,810
(I really want to be helpful.)

28
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,650
- Let's do it later.
- Okay.

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,120
(I hope they feel the warmth of a comforting meal.)

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,660
(I want to prepare a meaningful meal.)

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,830
(Chef of Antarctica)

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,840
(Episode 2: Cold or Possibly Spoiled)

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,099
(Anxious)

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,370
(The crew members are eating, )

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,180
(and he's extremely nervous.)

36
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,050
Please smile while you're eating.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,750
I hope you enjoy it.

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,890
(He's really nervous.)

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,190
(They enter the Sejong Center.)

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,860
Hello.

41
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,659
(They've finally met for the first time.)

42
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,969
Why are you standing up? Please sit down and enjoy your meal.

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,000
It's nice to meet you.

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,970
(The crew members welcome them.)

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,809
(Welcome, new crew members.)

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,810
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,079
(Oh, my)

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,179
- Here...
- Hello.

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,550
(Fascinated)

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,949
- Here...
- Hello.

52
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,120
- You can get the spoon and...
- Hello.

53
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,050
- You're the cook. Hello.
- Hello.

54
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,119
- Hello.
- Hello.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,090
- Hello, Chi Young.
- Say hi.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,059
(She knows my name.)

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,500
Hello.

58
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,639
(Welcome to King Sejong Station.)

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,010
Here, you can get the spoon and the chopsticks.

60
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,710
Enjoy your meal. What are you having today?

61
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,510
Seaweed soup and stir-fried spicy pork ssambap.

62
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,080
(Ssam?)

63
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,890
You have vegetables here.

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,059
(Vegetables?)

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,890
They were grown by the crew members...

66
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,959
- I see.
- in the greenhouse.

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,600
- You grew kale and lettuce?
- Yes.

68
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,170
(With the weather shifting several times a day, )

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,970
(planting directly in the ground is impossible in Antarctica.)

70
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,640
(A greenhouse farm was built to grow fresh vegetables.)

71
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,210
(When seedlings are planted, )

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,780
(they grow well in the warm greenhouse, )

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,490
(producing enough for the crew to eat.)

74
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,359
That's nice.

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,730
(As a result, there's never a shortage of vegetables.)

76
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,059
(The crew members help themselves too.)

77
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,060
All right.

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,129
(It looks good.)

79
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,330
It feels like we're having home-cooked food here.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,500
You get it, right? But we came here to cook for them.

81
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,610
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you.

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,540
Chef An Chi Young.

83
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,010
(Soo Hyang called me by my name.)

84
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,020
- Enjoy your meal.
- The crew members in Antarctica...

85
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,790
Aren't you Eun Su?

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
- Yes, I am.
- Right?

87
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,320
You're the youngest one, right?

88
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,089
Are you the youngest?

89
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,329
(I guess so.)

90
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,629
- Aren't you the youngest?
- He's the youngest.

91
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,630
- You're right.
- You are, right?

92
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,000
(He's just happy.)

93
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,570
He's over the moon.

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Eun Su might not be able to sleep tonight.

95
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,510
He's in trouble.

96
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,380
He's overstimulated.

97
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,839
(Gosh, I should calm down.)

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,910
We should get an IV.

99
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,350
Eun Su, your face suddenly turned red.

100
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,480
(Chi Young looks nervous somehow.)

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,389
(It's probably because the new culinary crew members...)

102
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
(are getting the food.)

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,490
This kimchi was frozen and then thawed.

104
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,490
(He's analyzing the condition of the side dishes.)

105
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,630
(He's getting more nervous.)

106
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,100
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

107
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Okay.

108
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
(After SUHO left, )

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,610
(only the current chef and the new chef remained.)

110
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,579
I heard you've studied Chinese cuisine.

111
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,180
- Yes, I have. I hope you enjoy it.
- It's nice to meet you.

112
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,750
(He's nervously watching them.)

113
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,419
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

114
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,059
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks for the food.

115
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,120
(Their first lunch at King Sejong Station begins.)

116
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,790
(Savoring)

117
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
It's delicious.

118
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,199
It feels like I'm having school lunch again after a long time.

119
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,400
(It feels like eating school lunch for the first time in a while.)

120
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,440
(The crew members are enjoying the veggie wrap.)

121
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,469
(Chi Young is looking intently.)

122
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,910
He made seaweed soup. Is it someone's birthday?

123
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,510
(Crew Paik tries the seaweed soup first.)

124
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,820
(Nodding)

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,890
- This is good.
- The kimchi is...

126
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,590
(Should I make a wrap too?)

127
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,989
(He adds a generous amount of spicy pork sauce.)

128
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,160
- Maybe not knowing is better.
- Okay.

129
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,860
(Eating the wrap in one bite)

130
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,700
(Something is off.)

131
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,970
(He tries the stir-fried spicy pork again.)

132
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,269
(Glancing)

133
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,180
(Chi Young keeps looking at him nervously.)

134
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,310
(Jong Won is chewing quietly.)

135
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,150
(Startled)

136
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm really sorry to the cook, but I was very disappointed.

137
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,820
The pork had a strong smell.

138
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,360
The smell of meat that's past its prime.

139
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,764
The pork definitely smells, doesn't it?

140
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:36,663
- Sorry?
- The pork smells off, doesn't it?

141
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:38,034
(Hesitant)

142
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,063
- Didn't you notice?
- It smells a bit.

143
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:41,674
- The pork smells off.
- Yes.

144
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:43,303
It's because it was in the freezer for a long time.

145
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,074
(It's because it was in the freezer for a long time.)

146
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:49,514
The ingredient wasn't fresh.

147
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:54,454
It smelled off, which was a bit disappointing.

148
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,024
The ingredients at the base...

149
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:01,193
The ingredients used here...

150
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:06,224
were purchased in Korea over a year and a half ago.

151
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,564
(A year and a half ago?)

152
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,034
(A whole year past its prime)

153
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,604
(Giving off a strong, unpleasant smell)

154
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:18,704
(Real old food)

155
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,474
(That's why it had a strong odor.)

156
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:24,414
So there won't be any extra supplies?

157
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:28,453
Usually, a large ship arrives...

158
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:31,054
in early December to deliver supplies.

159
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:35,794
But this time, they'll come in January next year.

160
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:37,993
We'll have to manage until then.

161
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:41,034
Food supplies are very limited in December.

162
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,403
(Coinciding with the summer season...)

163
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,234
(when overwintering crew members arrive, )

164
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,773
(once...)

165
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,034
(a year, )

166
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,904
(RV Araon delivers long-term supplies.)

167
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:57,173
(With a pier just 30m long, )

168
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:59,714
(King Sejong Station...)

169
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,284
(can't accommodate large ships.)

170
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:06,954
(Supply ships anchor offshore, )

171
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:11,324
(and supplies are transported directly to land...)

172
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,764
(using RIBs and barges.)

173
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:18,034
(This is the most demanding unloading operation of the year, )

174
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,833
(which runs 24 hours a day...)

175
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,574
(for 5 days and 4 nights.)

176
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,974
(This operation is also called the "1-year harvest of Antarctica.")

177
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,144
(Once the supplies are brought to land, )

178
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:37,584
(all heavy equipment is mobilized.)

179
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:39,653
We should carry the supplies.

180
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:40,654
(And the entire crew starts sorting the food.)

181
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:41,754
Ramyeon is here.

182
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,064
Under the chef's command,

183
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,294
we move the food supplies in perfect order.

184
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,364
- Fish goes to the right.
- Fish goes to the right.

185
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,664
(The overwintering crew carries and organizes the supplies.)

186
00:08:56,204 --> 00:09:00,274
(The items are sorted into 4 food storage areas.)

187
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,573
(Storage A: Seafood, Storage B: Vegetables, )

188
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,284
(Machinery Storage: Meat, Non-staple Food Storage: Dry foods)

189
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:07,013
There are piles of food supplies.

190
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,554
(The storage is filled with food supplies.)

191
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:09,813
It's frozen.

192
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:12,824
(There's plenty of food during the early months of overwintering.)

193
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:16,654
(However, by the end of the winter...)

194
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:17,764
(Empty)

195
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:20,194
(Empty)

196
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,534
(There are only some frozen ingredients left.)

197
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:28,934
(The Chef of Antarctica crew came in November.)

198
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,704
You came at the time of year with the least food available.

199
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,974
It won't be easy to cook.

200
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:38,114
Are we putting too much burden on them?

201
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:42,384
Rumor has it you have a lot of meat, though.

202
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:45,284
Yes. It's old, but there's a lot of meat left.

203
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:47,524
(Thinking)

204
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:52,264
First off, the meat was old, so the smell was inevitable.

205
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:56,264
Understanding this, I judged him more generously.

206
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,563
It felt like a halo was shining behind him,

207
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,304
and I realized he'd been doing great.

208
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:04,034
(He's been making a wide range of dishes with limited ingredients.)

209
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:07,574
(He even baked bread and cookies.)

210
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,784
(An Chi Young was the only light during the toughest times.)

211
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:13,343
On the contrary, I lost confidence.

212
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:14,583
I was like, "What do I do?"

213
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,914
(The new culinary crew member lost confidence.)

214
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:21,394
(Will tonight's dinner be okay?)

215
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,653
(He starts inspecting the ingredients.)

216
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:26,624
Do you have any cabbage then?

217
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:29,564
We don't have any cabbage. We just have frozen onions.

218
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,664
(He looks cheerful.)

219
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:32,863
(He looks troubled.)

220
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:33,903
How about carrots?

221
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:36,533
We have frozen baby carrots.

222
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:37,874
(He just looks cheerful.)

223
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:39,743
(Sighing)

224
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,244
- No whole carrots?
- No.

225
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,144
(The frozen vegetables are making him increasingly worried.)

226
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,684
How about scallions? Do you have them?

227
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,554
No, we don't.

228
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,853
You don't have scallions? Even the frozen ones?

229
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:56,854
(Shocked)

230
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:58,094
Why?

231
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:01,033
We get supplies only once a year.

232
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,494
- So you've used them all?
- Yes.

233
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,363
You don't have scallions.

234
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,364
(Hopeless)

235
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,634
(During the pre-shoot)

236
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,573
(He thought they'd have basic vegetables.)

237
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:13,204
(Scallions were one of them.)

238
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:16,144
(Scallions are essential to his cooking.)

239
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:19,784
(A bunch of scallions)

240
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:22,784
(He added a generous amount.)

241
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,553
You don't have scallions.

242
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,584
(He didn't expect that there would be no scallions.)

243
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:29,994
You don't have scallions. This is a serious issue.

244
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,894
(Solemn)

245
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,234
You must be really worried.

246
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,734
(Gloomy)

247
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,434
If Mr. Paik had come last year,

248
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:44,844
there would've been more ingredients left.

249
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,714
(Laughing)

250
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:51,613
We have very limited ingredients.

251
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:55,414
We've already used 70 percent of them.

252
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:57,483
So 30 percent is left.

253
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,884
(They have 30 percent of the ingredients left.)

254
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,024
(He has an idea.)

255
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,624
We can just do it.

256
00:12:03,294 --> 00:12:04,364
I want to visit the storage.

257
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:05,994
- The storage?
- Yes, let's have a look.

258
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:09,663
(They head to the cold storage.)

259
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,104
Let's go to the meat freezer first.

260
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,534
Is there another freezer besides the meat freezer?

261
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:18,043
Meat and seafood are stored separately.

262
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,244
- Seafood?
- Yes.

263
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,313
(Freezer 1: Seafood and vegetables)

264
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:22,913
(Freezer 2: Meat, noodles, and eggs)

265
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,444
(Living quarters: Kitchen and cafeteria)

266
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,554
(They carefully enter the freezer.)

267
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,723
(The moment they enter the freezer, their faces tense up.)

268
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,454
- There's not much food.
- There isn't much food.

269
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:37,824
The ingredients are very limited.

270
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:43,834
(Empty)

271
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,774
(The freezer had even fewer supplies than expected.)

272
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,734
- These are the only eggs left.
- Oh, my gosh.

273
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,144
These are egg yolks, and these are egg whites.

274
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,574
There isn't much.

275
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:57,214
- We don't have much left.
- We don't have many eggs.

276
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,814
You don't have squid either.

277
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,654
Are these the only noodles left?

278
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,353
No. We didn't receive many food supplies.

279
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:05,354
(They only have two packs of thick noodles.)

280
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:08,224
(Looking around)

281
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:10,323
- These are pork ribs.
- Yes. They're back ribs.

282
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,823
(Pork back ribs)

283
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,334
It should be enough for 18 servings. It's around 5kg.

284
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,294
So it's for one meal.

285
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,774
When I saw the cold storage for the first time,

286
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,903
I felt bad...

287
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,514
because there wasn't much food.

288
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,053
What's this?

289
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,583
It's pork belly.

290
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,423
- It must have a strong smell.
- You can't eat it.

291
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:42,494
- It's too old.
- Yes.

292
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:43,993
(This pork belly has been stored for over a year...)

293
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:44,994
(and is no longer edible.)

294
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,763
This looks like pork shoulder or ham.

295
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,734
Yes. These are cubes of pork shoulder.

296
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,363
(It's completely covered in frost.)

297
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,004
This is sirloin from Chile.

298
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:56,533
It must be tough. It's not good.

299
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,534
(The meat is old and tough.)

300
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,204
Was this pork or beef?

301
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,574
It's chuck flap tail.

302
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,414
It's meant for chopped steak, but we got the wrong one.

303
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:05,714
You can't eat it then.

304
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:07,784
We've had no choice but to eat it.

305
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,224
- You don't have many onions left.
- No.

306
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:15,893
- Is this all?
- Yes.

307
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:16,894
(They only have 8 packs of peeled onions.)

308
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:22,794
(There's hardly any frozen vegetables remaining.)

309
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:28,703
(He checks the expiration date.)

310
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:29,704
Flip it.

311
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:38,343
(Expiration date: August 31, 2023)

312
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,784
(Expiration date: November 27, 2023)

313
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,353
(Expiration date: April 15, 2023)

314
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:44,354
(Expiration date: November 10, 2023)

315
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,354
Most of them had expired.

316
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,753
There wasn't much food left.

317
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:53,424
I wasn't sure if it was even possible to make proper dishes.

318
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:57,593
The condition of the frozen ingredients and vegetables...

319
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,004
crushed all hope.

320
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,974
They hardly had any ingredients left.

321
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,804
No carrots to add a nice color, no scallions.

322
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:07,074
There are so many things missing here.

323
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,644
What should I do?

324
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,114
(Worried)

325
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:18,223
(What caught his eye?)

326
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:21,253
You have more pork belly than I thought. These are all pork belly.

327
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,393
Yes. It's pork skirt.

328
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:23,894
(Pork skirt)

329
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,124
Beef ribs?

330
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,493
You have pork rind too.

331
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,494
(Pork rind)

332
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,993
You have a lot of beef.

333
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,164
(Fortunately, there's plenty of meat from different cuts left.)

334
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,464
Let's gather over there.

335
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:35,434
Let's discuss what dishes to make.

336
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,003
- So what should we make?
- What are you going to make...

337
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,004
- for dinner?
- Throw in some ideas.

338
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:45,844
In the storage, some types of meat were still abundant.

339
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:48,183
- There's a lot of chicken.
- There's a lot of chicken.

340
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:52,684
(There was a lot of chicken in the freezer.)

341
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:54,993
We came here to make dinner.

342
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,594
Don't you think we should fry something to make it smell savory?

343
00:15:57,794 --> 00:16:01,294
It'd be nice if they could cut something.

344
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,334
I'm amazing at frying things.

345
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,564
You're amazing?

346
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,574
Frying is the most important.

347
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,373
I'm confident in my frying skills.

348
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:12,543
(Before they came to Antarctica)

349
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,243
I practiced in advance.

350
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:15,544
What do I do?

351
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:18,614
(Frying)

352
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,984
(He shakes the chicken with his biceps.)

353
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,824
(Starting with 9 pieces of fried chicken)

354
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,554
I think I've fried around 100 pieces of chicken.

355
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,924
(Taking out)

356
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,133
I fried chicken until my body smelled of oil.

357
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:37,064
(You can count on me.)

358
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:40,464
(So we have a fritter master?)

359
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:44,774
Let's thaw the chicken, season it,

360
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:46,644
coat it with the powder they have, and fry it...

361
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:50,274
like Japanese chicken nanban.

362
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:53,514
We're going to make chicken nanban...

363
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,154
and coat it with sweet and sour sauce.

364
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:02,293
(Over the chicken soaked in soy sauce)

365
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:03,893
We'll drizzle tartar sauce over it.

366
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:09,394
(Topped with tartar sauce)

367
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,433
(This is chicken nanban.)

368
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:15,134
- What do you think?
- I like it.

369
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:18,373
(It's the fritter master's turn to step up.)

370
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:22,313
As for the side dish...

371
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:23,613
(Thinking hard)

372
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,143
Let's use the frozen one.

373
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,483
I want to stir-fry it...

374
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,254
to add something green.

375
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,054
(I got it!)

376
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,253
(That's a great idea.)

377
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,963
Let's stir-fry the sausages...

378
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:39,063
with some ketchup.

379
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,064
(Stir-fried sausages in ketchup as a side dish)

380
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,133
- Doenjang soup goes well with it.
- Right.

381
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:45,233
- Yes. Like miso soup.
- Miso soup.

382
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,304
Okay. Done.

383
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:47,404
- Yes.
- Yes.

384
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,434
(The first dish for the crew members at King Sejong Station)

385
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:50,133
There are two important things.

386
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:54,504
First, make good use of the remaining ingredients.

387
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:58,384
(Make good use of the frozen ingredients!)

388
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,413
Second, make the dishes...

389
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,984
visually appealing and different.

390
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,283
I want the meals to be enjoyable.

391
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,993
Not just in taste, but also to the eye,

392
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,493
making mealtime something to look forward to.

393
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,364
(A meal that pleases both the palate and the eyes)

394
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:16,364
(Chicken nanban with yellow tartar sauce)

395
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,363
(The combination of green bell peppers and red ketchup)

396
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,364
(Stir-fried sausages in ketchup)

397
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:22,404
(Seasoned green vegetables to be revealed later)

398
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:27,644
(A special meal...)

399
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,884
(to satisfy all five senses of the crew members)

400
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:35,014
(And...)

401
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:36,353
(Sejong Center)

402
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:38,654
(To the new culinary crew member...)

403
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,693
Good luck.

404
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:43,623
(A heavy responsibility is placed.)

405
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,594
(Lighthearted)

406
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,394
(Burdened)

407
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,764
(Tightening the strings)

408
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:52,104
(The Chef of Antarctica will start cooking.)

409
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:56,204
(Jong Won is at the meat freezer.)

410
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,703
This is 5kg.

411
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,274
(He gets plenty of chicken.)

412
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,383
- Onions. I got a pack of onions.
- A pack of onions?

413
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,984
Onions. A pack of onions.

414
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:09,084
I got it.

415
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,623
I think we can put them in the water now.

416
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:15,653
(They start thawing the ingredients right away.)

417
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,023
Do you think I'll be scolded later?

418
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,424
No. It'll be fine.

419
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,534
(Sausages)

420
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:26,934
(They put the frozen vegetables in the sink.)

421
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:30,974
(It starts to thaw.)

422
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:34,244
(The ingredients are completely frozen.)

423
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:38,184
(Proper thawing is crucial.)

424
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:41,754
(They use cold water to maintain flavor and texture.)

425
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:45,454
(What will their first dish using frozen ingredients be like?)

426
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:50,294
(Jong Hyeop checks how well it's thawed.)

427
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:53,993
(Touching)

428
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,564
When will this all thaw?

429
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:57,434
Will we be able to eat today?

430
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,403
Thawing isn't easy.

431
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:01,774
(They've been thawing them for 1 hour.)

432
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,701
(Will they thaw by today?)

433
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,941
(He's thawing the vegetables himself.)

434
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,081
(He's separating the frozen vegetables by hand.)

435
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:24,681
They're all frozen, so we need to thaw them all.

436
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:26,990
This is like a frozen food party.

437
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,391
(A frozen food party)

438
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,461
(Onions)

439
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,591
(Green beans)

440
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,131
(What do I do?)

441
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:42,541
(Ragged)

442
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,240
It's not thawing at all.

443
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,410
(The chicken won't defrost.)

444
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,841
Thawing meat...

445
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:52,981
isn't as easy as I thought.

446
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,981
It's going to be a tough task.

447
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:02,861
(Separating each piece with his hands)

448
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,691
It was completely frozen.

449
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:08,331
Separating each piece was hard.

450
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,200
It was tough, but I separated all of them.

451
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,201
(After defrosting the chicken)

452
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:16,341
Twenty-five chickens.

453
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:19,741
(Completed after 40 minutes)

454
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:23,881
(Meanwhile, Crew Paik...)

455
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,081
(lights the stove.)

456
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:30,681
I love how strong the stove is though.

457
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,461
(Pouring plenty of oil into the hot frying pan)

458
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:37,061
I get to use garlic to my heart's content.

459
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,461
(Adding garlic that's right up a Korean's alley)

460
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:45,270
(When the garlic is golden, )

461
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,800
I smell garlic.

462
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,071
(add in salt.)

463
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,641
(Plenty of sesame oil that'll add a flavorful aroma)

464
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:57,081
(What is the dish with a heavy amount of garlic?)

465
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,221
(He's pouring it in.)

466
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:05,621
All good.

467
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,791
(What is the vegetable mixed with garlic?)

468
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:13,530
(Rapeseed greens?)

469
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:14,961
Use rapeseed greens well,

470
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:18,600
and you can make them taste...

471
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,931
like homemade seasoned greens.

472
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:24,441
(Crew Paik's twist: Frozen rapeseed greens)

473
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:26,841
It's frozen rapeseed greens.

474
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,380
I'm thinking of frying it with rapeseed greens.

475
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,980
We need some greens in our food.

476
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,111
(Homemade food with greens)

477
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:36,080
In the one-dish menu, the rapeseed greens...

478
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:37,081
will add color.

479
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,691
We can try it.

480
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:41,291
(Seasoned rapeseed greens)

481
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:44,291
(Frying the rapeseed greens after a quick blanch...)

482
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:47,131
(will soften the stems.)

483
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:51,131
(But to keep the texture, the rapeseed greens won't be fried.)

484
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:56,071
(Instead, they'll be mixed with seasoning as is.)

485
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,200
It smells good.

486
00:22:58,201 --> 00:22:59,611
(Keeping the rapeseed greens' aroma and crunchiness)

487
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,681
(Homemade food in Antarctica)

488
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:08,151
(What's the next dish?)

489
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:11,380
Stir-fried sausages, one of the favorite dishes served...

490
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,920
at an old-style pork cutlet restaurant.

491
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:14,591
(Stir-fried sausages with fusilli)

492
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,431
(Garlic, Worcester sauce, and sugar)

493
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,200
It's stir-fried sausages with pasta.

494
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,201
(Adding in the cooked yet chewy fusilli)

495
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,671
(Using ketchup to add sweetness and tang)

496
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:31,001
(Mixing in bell peppers for crunchiness and green color)

497
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:32,770
The moment they eat it,

498
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:34,211
I want them to think...

499
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:37,411
they're at an old-fashioned pork cutlet restaurant in Korea.

500
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,751
(While the crew members are cooking, )

501
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:44,351
(the winter crew of King Sejong Station...)

502
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:51,891
(is heading to a harsh location for research.)

503
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,530
(Even in the extreme cold of Antarctica, )

504
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:57,861
I'm changing the antenna.

505
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,900
This is the antenna's cable.

506
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:04,601
(they maintain King Sejong Station...)

507
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,381
(and give their all to their tasks.)

508
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:15,051
(For those working hard in the land of extremes, )

509
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,851
(will the crew members serve a successful meal?)

510
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:23,361
(Getting hungry)

511
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:25,661
(While everyone is wrapping up)

512
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:26,691
(Cutting)

513
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:28,731
(Cutting)

514
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,070
(Cutting)

515
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,931
(Brows knit in focus)

516
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:35,840
(Cutting)

517
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,741
(SUHO is desperately fighting the pickled radish alone.)

518
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,981
(Completely focused)

519
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:44,511
I'm good at what I'm told to do.

520
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:47,081
For example, if I'm told to chop a radish,

521
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:51,081
I can chop 100 of them. That's how I am.

522
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:53,221
(In Punta Arenas, SUHO kept...)

523
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,361
(chopping...)

524
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,421
(and chopping.)

525
00:24:57,721 --> 00:25:00,461
(Even when no one was watching, )

526
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:02,860
(SUHO kept chopping with full focus.)

527
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:06,301
It's cool when people use knives in the kitchen.

528
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:09,571
(His training is already paying off in Antarctica.)

529
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,541
There's no end to this. Goodness.

530
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,711
It won't chop well.

531
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,310
(SUHO is locked in with the pickled radishes.)

532
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,311
Was chopping pickled radishes always this hard?

533
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,021
Are things going well, SUHO?

534
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:27,351
No, it's not.

535
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:30,790
- It's too thin.
- You mean the pickled radish?

536
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:32,161
(Things aren't going as planned.)

537
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:36,301
Had it been a big one, I could've just sliced it.

538
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,671
But since they were small, it was tough.

539
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:43,241
It felt like cutting gummies.

540
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:45,611
Because the pickled radishes were frozen,

541
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,141
they were small and thin.

542
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,211
My arms hurt twice as much.

543
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:52,651
I don't see an end to it.

544
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,811
I kept chopping without thinking.

545
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:00,951
(He's finally done.)

546
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:05,491
(But what is the pickled radish for?)

547
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,361
(Onions)

548
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:12,971
(Adding the chopped pickled radish to the onions)

549
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:15,871
(Starch syrup)

550
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:18,371
(Plenty of mayonnaise)

551
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,811
(What is SUHO making?)

552
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,280
Tartar sauce.

553
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:26,811
(Tartar sauce)

554
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:30,421
(Normally, tartar sauce...)

555
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:33,851
(is made with onions and cabbage...)

556
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:38,091
(for both texture and sweetness.)

557
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:41,960
There was nothing but frozen onions.

558
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:45,700
They didn't even have mustard sauce, which would help with the texture.

559
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:47,630
Luckily, there was frozen pickled radish.

560
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:49,101
I made it by chopping the pickled radish.

561
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,241
Tartar sauce made with pickled radish is quite good.

562
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,441
(Tartar sauce made with pickled radish for texture)

563
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:02,281
(Pouring in oil)

564
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:05,551
(Stove on, and it's the fritter master's turn.)

565
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:08,821
Once it floats after three seconds.

566
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:14,660
I can start. I'm going to start frying.

567
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:15,661
(Floating)

568
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,771
(In goes the chicken.)

569
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:24,201
(Once the white batter...)

570
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:28,170
(turns golden)

571
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:32,080
Once the fritter is done, dunk it in here once, then take it out.

572
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,111
Got it.

573
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,611
Don't be stingy with the sauce.

574
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:36,881
"Don't be stingy with the sauce."

575
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:38,890
Top it off with the sauce.

576
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,390
(Topping it off...)

577
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,461
(with tartar sauce)

578
00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:45,431
(On top of the crispy-and-juicy fried chicken)

579
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:47,530
Now is the time.

580
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:51,901
(Sweet, tangy, and crunchy tartar sauce)

581
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:57,741
(The first meal made in Antarctica's King Sejong Station)

582
00:27:58,101 --> 00:28:01,171
(Chicken nanban is complete.)

583
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,281
When are they coming?

584
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,580
In five minutes.

585
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:05,581
(Current time: 5:55pm)

586
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,411
(The fritter master starts deep-frying the chicken.)

587
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:12,251
(While the chickens cook until golden...)

588
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,591
If you scoop the rice, I'll place the others around.

589
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,191
(Neatly)

590
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:18,961
(Neatly)

591
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,561
(Plating the food so it's visually appealing)

592
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:26,030
(Today, )

593
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:28,871
(the food is plated instead of being self-served.)

594
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:32,711
(Preparing it with love, as it's the first meal they've made for them)

595
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,911
You guys are better than me.

596
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:37,641
(Soo Hyang is proud.)

597
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:42,021
(It's already evening in Antarctica.)

598
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:43,651
(Unlike other days, )

599
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:46,651
(King Sejong Station will have a slightly special dinner.)

600
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:50,221
(What will the first dine-out in Antarctica be like?)

601
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:52,560
(Dinner time: 5:59pm)

602
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:55,291
(Dinner time: 6pm)

603
00:28:55,831 --> 00:28:59,400
(The song signaling dinner time goes off at King Sejong Station.)

604
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,971
It's already time for dinner.

605
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:05,341
Please wrap up what you're doing and head to the cafeteria.

606
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,270
Make sure to eat.

607
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:08,311
(The crew gathers at the cafeteria.)

608
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,081
Hi. Please eat.

609
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,481
Okay.

610
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,551
They're here. They've come for dinner.

611
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:15,780
They're coming.

612
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:17,281
(Storming in)

613
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,291
(Chef Chi Young is excited.)

614
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:23,220
(The crew lines up as if they were waiting.)

615
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:25,731
There's already a line.

616
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:29,131
(The line stretches all the way outside.)

617
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:32,101
(Packed)

618
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:36,301
(Everyone's attention is on the dinner.)

619
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:39,371
(Focused)

620
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:42,111
(Impressed)

621
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,381
It looks very neat.

622
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,121
(Look forward to it.)

623
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:51,121
(Gulping)

624
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:53,651
(Peeking)

625
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,991
(I want to see it too.)

626
00:29:57,391 --> 00:29:59,561
Give us a minute. It's being deep-fried.

627
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:03,701
(The fritter master has become busy.)

628
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:06,831
(Frying them again to make them crispy)

629
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:10,901
(Crew Paik coats them in soy-based sauce.)

630
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:14,971
(Lastly, the highlight of the chicken nanban)

631
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:20,051
(The main dish is complete once topped with the tartar sauce.)

632
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,450
All right. One at a time, please.

633
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:24,581
Enjoy.

634
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:27,891
(The long-awaited serving time)

635
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:31,621
Thank you for the food.

636
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:33,430
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

637
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,431
No problem.

638
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,131
Enjoy.

639
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,130
Enjoy.

640
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:39,501
(In hopes everyone will enjoy the meal, )

641
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:42,400
(Chef of Antarctica members hand out each plate.)

642
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:43,401
Enjoy.

643
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:46,911
(Chef of Antarctica members hand out each plate.)

644
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:50,811
(Antarctica, the distant and harsh land)

645
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:53,881
(A lonely world of snow and ice)

646
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,881
I'm tired.

647
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,250
(Tiring and repetitive, )

648
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:01,321
(an endless 11-month treadmill life in Antarctica)

649
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:05,191
(For those enduring the harsh polar environment, )

650
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,531
(they prepared a gift.)

651
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:10,731
(The first dine-out in Antarctica)

652
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:15,900
(It's just one meal...)

653
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:19,671
(and a piece of fried chicken, )

654
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:24,941
(but the crew smiles at the sight of it.)

655
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:27,381
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

656
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:28,651
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

657
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:29,651
Of course.

658
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:32,251
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

659
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:36,421
(Enjoying a dining-out-style meal for the 1st time in 11 months)

660
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:39,191
What's this? It looks so appetizing.

661
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:40,991
(Smelling)

662
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:45,131
What could it be? I'm curious.

663
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,131
- Isn't it a chicken cutlet?
- Isn't it? Or is it something else?

664
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:51,471
It's chicken nanban, but think of it as a chicken cutlet.

665
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:54,271
It's a Japanese-style old-fashioned cutlet.

666
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,311
(Shall I dig in?)

667
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,081
(How is the chicken nanban?)

668
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:05,550
It must be good. No need to even try.

669
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:06,951
(Walking over)

670
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,490
(Super nervous)

671
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,891
Whether the chicken was fried well,

672
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,890
whether it suits the crew's taste.

673
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,461
I was nervous and worried.

674
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,070
(Amazed)

675
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,271
Have another serving after this. Have more.

676
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:22,641
It's good.

677
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,941
(Jong Hyeop feels relieved.)

678
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,301
It made me feel a bit proud.

679
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:27,971
(He sure is enjoying it.)

680
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,141
- Shall I try it?
- It's delicious.

681
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,651
(Plenty of sauce)

682
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:36,581
Eat lots, okay?

683
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:39,291
Okay. Thank you for the food.

684
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:42,261
(Blowing)

685
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:44,260
(The youngest crew member eats a piece.)

686
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:45,991
Have more after this.

687
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,761
It's good.

688
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:51,201
(The winter crew is enjoying the meal.)

689
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,301
Is the fried chicken different?

690
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,001
- It's been fried well.
- Really?

691
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,441
(Then I'll have a bite too.)

692
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,211
It's for your information.

693
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,611
- It's been fried really well.
- I agree.

694
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:06,711
The cutlet is different.

695
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:09,021
The cutlet is really crispy.

696
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:11,051
It's crispy yet juicy.

697
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,391
Is this the frozen chicken we had?

698
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,991
- It's...
- Didn't they bring it with them?

699
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:19,191
No, they didn't bring anything with them.

700
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,531
All of this was made with what we had.

701
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:21,691
It doesn't smell gamey at all.

702
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:24,561
How is this possible with frozen chicken?

703
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:26,471
How did they do it?

704
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:28,531
It's been defrosted well.

705
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,741
It's been evenly defrosted.

706
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:33,940
- It's frozen chicken, - To think this was frozen.

707
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:36,111
but it tastes nothing like it.

708
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:40,411
(How did they make the meat odorless yet still tender?)

709
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:45,991
(The chicken had been in cold storage for a year.)

710
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,121
(Crew member Chae Jong Hyeop...)

711
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:53,161
(separated each piece and defrosted it for 40 minutes.)

712
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:58,361
(Removing the smell with salt and black pepper)

713
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:03,241
(The grand finale was deep-frying it twice.)

714
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,910
- Even the sauce is unique.
- It's good.

715
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:10,841
(The crew enjoys the fried, odor-free chicken.)

716
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:14,851
(Jong Hyeop watches the crew's reaction from afar.)

717
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,321
(He can't help but smile.)

718
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,721
The crew enjoyed the fried chicken.

719
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:25,861
I was kind of proud of myself.

720
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:29,361
It was my first time cooking for someone.

721
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:33,371
It made my heart feel...

722
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:36,101
all fuzzy and warm.

723
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:42,981
(A magical moment where both the eater and the watcher feel happy)

724
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,980
(Glancing)

725
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,521
I think your evaluation matters more than ours.

726
00:34:52,151 --> 00:34:55,591
(One person is more excited than the others today.)

727
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:59,431
(Crew member An Chi Young, the only chef at King Sejong Station)

728
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,761
(The first to wake up every morning)

729
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:06,631
I'm going to eat now. Once it's mealtime,

730
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:10,041
the crew has to eat quickly and get back to their tasks.

731
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,910
I only eat after the crew is done eating.

732
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,911
(The soup is self-served.)

733
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:17,840
I'm used to eating alone now. It's okay.

734
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:18,841
(He's more used to serving others.)

735
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,721
(Today, it's his first time...)

736
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,291
(in 11 months to be served.)

737
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:31,191
(Eating with the crew today)

738
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:34,491
It's been months since I last had a meal cooked by someone else.

739
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:37,761
(Tearing up a little)

740
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,270
(Starting to cut the cutlet)

741
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,401
It sure is different.

742
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:44,901
You're right.

743
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:47,871
(A mouthful bite)

744
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:51,441
(Munching)

745
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:56,281
(In bliss)

746
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:59,651
(Trying the sauce again right away)

747
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,391
The tartar sauce is good.

748
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:04,421
- The sauce is unusual.
- It's fried perfectly.

749
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:06,391
Is there cabbage inside?

750
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,601
I think it's pickled radish. We don't have cabbage.

751
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:11,331
- You mean crunchy pickled radish?
- Yes.

752
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,211
(After struggling with the pickled radish for 30 minutes)

753
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,340
(The chicken nanban's highlight)

754
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:24,681
Instead of cabbage, pickled radish was used...

755
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,411
for both taste and texture.

756
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,520
Seeing the crew enjoy it made me proud of myself.

757
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,981
(The crunchiness adds to the texture.)

758
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:33,621
Pickled radish was used for the texture.

759
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,390
It made me realize what I could do...

760
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:40,431
with the ingredients we had...

761
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,761
and reflect on why I hadn't tried doing things differently.

762
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,201
(Trying the stir-fried rapeseed greens)

763
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,071
(Also trying the stir-fried rapeseed greens)

764
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:52,541
They must've made the spinach themselves too.

765
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,771
- This is also frozen.
- It is?

766
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,410
(The youngest is shocked.)

767
00:36:57,411 --> 00:36:59,411
They made everything with what we had.

768
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,281
It still has that crunchy texture.

769
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,421
I can't tell it was frozen.

770
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:12,931
(The vibrant color of the rapeseed greens frozen for a year)

771
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:16,531
I haven't had a dish like this in a while.

772
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:19,831
- The vegetable?
- It's refreshing.

773
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,401
Everyone is in love with the rapeseed greens.

774
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,540
That's something only you could have at home.

775
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,171
- You can't find it here.
- Right.

776
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,051
We used many frozen ingredients on purpose...

777
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:36,720
because the station receives a lot of frozen products.

778
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,391
If you use those frozen ingredients well,

779
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,850
the dish looks fresh.

780
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:42,821
As for vegetables,

781
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:46,131
they've been rapidly cooled when fresh.

782
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:52,671
(The freshness locked in ice)

783
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:55,531
Season them after defrosting well, and they turn out great.

784
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:02,811
(From 1-year-old frozen food to fresh rapeseed greens)

785
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:04,411
Is it okay?

786
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:06,380
How is it? Is it good?

787
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:07,881
- Yes, it's good.
- It's good.

788
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,181
Which is the best? Is the fried chicken good?

789
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:12,021
The fried chicken is delicious.

790
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:14,520
(Smiling)

791
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:15,690
The rapeseed greens for me.

792
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:16,721
- Is it good?
- It's the rapeseed greens.

793
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,831
If you want more, we can always fry more.

794
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,831
(Getting up)

795
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:25,901
Jin Woong has already set off.

796
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:27,431
I'm getting seconds.

797
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,341
(Getting up)

798
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,671
(As soon as Soo Hyang mentions it, )

799
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,871
(the crew gathers at the serving table.)

800
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,081
(Wait for me.)

801
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:41,080
- What more would you like?
- The chicken.

802
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:42,451
The chicken?

803
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,291
Was the fried chicken thoroughly cooked?

804
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,391
(Wanting to hear that it's good)

805
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,121
Yes, it's really good.

806
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:52,831
Really? That's a relief.

807
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:56,101
(Fueled up, he starts deep-frying again.)

808
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,430
Enjoy.

809
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:59,330
(The crew members of Antarctica refill their plates.)

810
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:00,701
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

811
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:06,011
This really feels like a get-together.

812
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:09,611
(It really does feel like a get-together.)

813
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:13,811
(The 37th crew enjoys their 1st dine-out in Antarctica.)

814
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:16,181
(In total happiness)

815
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:18,721
It tastes much better after working hard.

816
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,751
(Totally.)

817
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:23,061
Thank you for the food.

818
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,160
Thank you for the food.

819
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:27,391
- Good.
- Thank you.

820
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:29,961
Did you enjoy it?

821
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,431
I loved it. Thank you.

822
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,471
- Thank you.
- Of course.

823
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:40,911
(Simply to make food for the crew, )

824
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:48,281
(the members trained hard in Korea.)

825
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:50,780
(From the pit of fritters...)

826
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:53,220
(to the pit of pickled radish, )

827
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:56,021
(it was their first actual cooking in Antarctica.)

828
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:03,431
(Thankfully, the 37th crew enjoyed the meal.)

829
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:08,771
(The crew members of Antarctica are happy to see this.)

830
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:12,400
Our crew came with the thought...

831
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,741
of cheering them up.

832
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:15,871
"I'll work hard..."

833
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:18,941
"and treat them to good food."

834
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:23,621
I thought we could make 18 portions in no time.

835
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:27,191
But I was wrong.

836
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:31,061
My legs were shaking.

837
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,061
They all loved it.

838
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:39,261
I felt grateful that they enjoyed it.

839
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,871
"I should prepare another delicious meal for these people."

840
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:46,170
That crossed my mind.

841
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:49,711
(37.8th Crew, Name: SUHO)

842
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,240
Our first mission...

843
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,381
went better than I thought.

844
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,781
As soon as we entered, everyone knew what to do.

845
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,890
Jong Hyeop...

846
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,191
practiced deep-frying food, which came in handy.

847
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,560
Soo Hyang knows the taste of many dishes...

848
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,590
and is quick-witted.

849
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,761
(She read the room and moved fast.)

850
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:13,370
Since SUHO's hobby was cooking,

851
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,230
he knew the basics.

852
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:16,700
(Filled with passion about food)

853
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,801
I'm sure they were surprised themselves...

854
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,811
at accomplishing the mission.

855
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:24,681
The three will be pros by the time we return to Korea.

856
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:31,821
(You too can become pros, crew members of Antarctica.)

857
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,390
Great work.

858
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:36,291
Jong Hyeop is the star of today.

859
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:37,621
(Laughing)

860
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,431
To think I'd be the star among our members.

861
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,361
(Happy)

862
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:43,700
Great work.

863
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,161
- Great work.
- Great work.

864
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:48,901
(They successfully served the first meal.)
