00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:05,514
(Sponsors: The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:06,955
(and Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:13,595
(King Sejong Station has been busy since the morning.)

4
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:16,594
Make sure to cook delicious dishes for the Chinese station.

5
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:19,335
- Of course.
- Okay. We're off.

6
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:21,905
(This time, is it the Chinese station?)

7
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:24,975
(China's Great Wall Station and King Sejong Station...)

8
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,805
(share similar Asian cultures.)

9
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:31,345
(Due to the short distance, the two have a close partnership.)

10
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:34,045
(To cheer on both stations' futures, )

11
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:39,615
(the Chef of Antarctica sets off.)

12
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:42,485
Let's work hard today.

13
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,225
The Chinese Station...

14
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,794
helps the King Sejong Station, and vice versa.

15
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,265
(A sibling-like relationship where they help each other out)

16
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:54,405
It's to return the kindness.

17
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:58,135
(Off to the Chinese station with excitement)

18
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:04,115
- That's the Chinese station, right?
- Yes.

19
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,385
The Chinese station is huge.

20
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,955
They put up the Korean flag because we're coming.

21
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:12,715
You're right.

22
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,455
(Hello.)

23
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:21,424
(The Chinese crew members are already out to welcome them.)

24
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,035
(Li Zhuang, Station Manager, Wang Jianzhong, Station Commander)

25
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,535
Welcome to The Great Wall Station.

26
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,235
Hello.

27
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,105
Hi.

28
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,005
- Welcome.
- Hi.

29
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,615
(Greeting each member warmly)

30
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:41,284
Thank you for inviting us to your station.

31
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:42,844
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

32
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,715
- He's our commander.
- Commander.

33
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,225
- Our commander.
- Commander.

34
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:48,624
Welcome.

35
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,094
Our commander will give you a short tour.

36
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,655
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:54,695
(Touring Great Wall Station)

38
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:56,565
Little did I expect to come to the Chinese station.

39
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:04,205
(As if China were transported to Antarctica)

40
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:14,145
(The Great Wall Station)

41
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:17,314
(Out of the 5, it's the 1st station that China set up.)

42
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:19,215
(The Great Wall Station)

43
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:24,625
(Inviting neighboring crew members, )

44
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:30,325
(they share their culture and build closer ties.)

45
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:33,534
(King Sejong Station's crew members and commander)

46
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:34,804
(The Great Wall Station's commander)

47
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:37,635
(King Sejong Station often visits the Chinese station.)

48
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:44,915
That stone is the foundation stone.

49
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,344
There are three Chinese words.

50
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:49,445
I see.

51
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:51,714
This marks the founding...

52
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,455
of China's research team.

53
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:56,325
"The Great Wall Station."

54
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,125
- In 1985.
- In 1985.

55
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,594
So this stone is special.

56
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,265
(A special symbol that represents the long years of the station)

57
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,395
And that's a bell.

58
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:11,735
(Next to the memorial stone...)

59
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:15,445
(stands a big bell.)

60
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:18,774
That's a bell from my hometown, Suzhou, China.

61
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,245
- Suzhou. Yes.
- Do you know?

62
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,984
(The heavy 1.6t bell...)

63
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:26,785
(was brought from Suzhou to Antarctica.)

64
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:31,695
(The Great Wall Bell, a symbol of peace)

65
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:35,665
(On New Year's Day, the bell is struck 3 times.)

66
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:40,865
This rock symbolizes wishes and peace for everyone.

67
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,934
We usually ring the bell on important days...

68
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,674
and festivals, like the Chinese New Year.

69
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,775
Because you are special guests...

70
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,145
- Special.
- You can...

71
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:53,315
Special.

72
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:54,385
You can try.

73
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:56,485
- Yes, sure.
- Let's go.

74
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,114
I never thought I'd get to ring a bell here.

75
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,254
(How does the bell sound in Antarctica?)

76
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,384
You can touch it.

77
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:02,685
It will bring you luck.

78
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,325
(Luck)

79
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,295
(Luck for Paik)

80
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,965
- Three times? Okay.
- Three times.

81
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,395
The first one is for your luck.

82
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,864
Are you ready?

83
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:14,865
- Yes.
- Start.

84
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:16,904
(Surprised)

85
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,005
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

86
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,204
It sounds nice.

87
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:23,274
(The sound rings out clearly.)

88
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,815
The sound is beautiful.

89
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,014
(Touched)

90
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,044
(Entranced)

91
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,955
The second strike is for your family's luck.

92
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,215
- Okay?
- Okay.

93
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:42,825
(The sound carrying one's wish rings, )

94
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,934
(hoping it reaches the families in their faraway hometown.)

95
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:49,435
It sounds nice.

96
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,774
- For all of us, okay?
- Yes.

97
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,105
(The last strike is for us.)

98
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:03,515
(Hoping great luck reaches everyone working hard in the polar region)

99
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:06,315
As I hit the bell,

100
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:09,124
I wanted to absorb all the energy,

101
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,155
and I felt it throughout my entire body.

102
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,365
(Chef of Antarctica has been blessed with luck.)

103
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,634
- They're all so kind.
- Right?

104
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,495
Yes. They're kind.

105
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:25,135
(Sighing)

106
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:28,875
Little did I think this would happen.

107
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,045
It was frightening and made me worried.

108
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:35,545
At first, I thought the production crew was joking.

109
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:39,155
(Suddenly, the crew members are in chaos?)

110
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:43,284
(Episode 5: An Antarctica-like Day)

111
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,425
- Hi.
- Hi.

112
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:46,655
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:48,995
(Hi. Welcome.)

114
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,434
Our staff is having lunch right now.

115
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,595
(The Chinese station crew members are having lunch.)

116
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,605
They must be having biangbiang noodles.

117
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:59,875
(Crew Paik finishes scanning the menu.)

118
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:03,605
(The main noodle dish of Shanxi, China)

119
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,374
The name comes from the sound.

120
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,944
Biangbiang.

121
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,984
It's the sound of making the noodles.

122
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,545
(The noodles are thicker than regular noodles.)

123
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,525
(Biangbiang noodles)

124
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:16,924
It's authentic Chinese cuisine.

125
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,055
(Eaten by pouring sauce over the rectangular noodles)

126
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:24,035
(Everyone is slurping the noodles.)

127
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,994
Our culinary crew member is in the kitchen.

128
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,035
I see.

129
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:29,765
(Past the dining area, )

130
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:33,235
(deeper inside is the kitchen.)

131
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:36,145
(From a large wok...)

132
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,745
(to a sharp Chinese cleaver...)

133
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:41,385
(and various spices)

134
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,515
(A kitchen specialized in Chinese cuisine)

135
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,685
(The one in charge of this kitchen)

136
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:52,925
(The master of Chinese food through and through)

137
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:58,265
(Yongtao Xiang, Chef of Chinese station)

138
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:02,235
(What will the meeting with the Chef of Antarctica be like?)

139
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:03,765
Hi.

140
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:07,745
Hi. Welcome.

141
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,245
Welcome to our station.

142
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:11,544
What's your name?

143
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:12,944
My name is Xiang.

144
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,085
- Xiang?
- Xiang.

145
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:16,015
Xiang. Chef Xiang.

146
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:20,085
Our chef wants to invite you to our kitchen.

147
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,994
So let's start with the refrigerator. Please.

148
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,055
Okay.

149
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,155
(The food storage of China's Great Wall Station)

150
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,265
Little did I expect to come to the Chinese station.

151
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,795
These are our containers.

152
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,294
Food storage.

153
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:34,864
- Food storage.
- For food storage.

154
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:36,005
(Keeping the containers as they are)

155
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:46,945
(As it's hard to manage the ingredients, )

156
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:52,055
(only the necessary ones are chosen and stored inside the station!)

157
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:55,685
(What kind of ingredients does the Chinese station have?)

158
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:57,955
- It's crab.
- Fish, yes? Zuixia.

159
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,825
And it's shrimp inside alcohol.

160
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,894
- Zuixia.
- It's called zuixia.

161
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:03,964
- Zuixia.
- Zuixia.

162
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:05,265
It means drunken shrimp.

163
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,064
What's this?

164
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:09,864
- Lamb lung.
- Lamb lung.

165
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,535
- Lamb heart.
- Lamb heart.

166
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,005
You can eat lamb heart?

167
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,844
This is nuwa.

168
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,545
Nuwa.

169
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:20,645
- What is it?
- Bullfrog.

170
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,345
Amazing.

171
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:26,585
They even have bullfrogs?

172
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:31,425
(Unbelievable)

173
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:35,565
There were many ingredients that King Sejong Station didn't have.

174
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,565
It was interesting.

175
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:43,005
The chef here has it good with all the various ingredients.

176
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,504
(One person in particular is quite excited.)

177
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,145
You have a lot of ingredients.

178
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:50,675
Daoyu. It's hairtail.

179
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,145
Bazhuayu.

180
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,015
It's webfoot octopus.

181
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,955
- Liangban?
- Yes, liangban.

182
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:02,225
(Spotting ingredients not found at King Sejong Station)

183
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:07,095
(Exploring without noticing the time passing)

184
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:10,395
He's talking in Chinese as if it's his first language.

185
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:13,365
I had so much fun,

186
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:16,165
especially since I'm very interested in Chinese ingredients.

187
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,405
It was like visiting...

188
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,335
a Chinese grocery store again after a long time.

189
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,145
(Looking around with his mouth open)

190
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,144
- Hulatang.
- Hulatang.

191
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:26,674
(In bliss)

192
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,015
I didn't expect hulatang to be packaged like this.

193
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:30,815
What's hulatang?

194
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:34,014
Hulatang is a thick soup eaten for breakfast.

195
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,284
I didn't know it came out like this.

196
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,655
(A boiled dish with peppers, mala, starch, and various ingredients)

197
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,725
If you'd like, I can give you some.

198
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,464
- Thank you.
- Yes.

199
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:42,764
(Accepting)

200
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:44,264
- Thank you.
- He accepts right away.

201
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,495
(I'm grateful.)

202
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,935
It's like I'm in a Chinese department store.

203
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:50,065
You look all bright and happy.

204
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,775
Looking at the ingredients was fun.

205
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:55,475
But coming back to my actual job,

206
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,315
having to make Korean food with them left me confused.

207
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,745
Do you have onions?

208
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,555
We don't have onions.

209
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:09,325
It's been a long time.

210
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:10,824
How do they not have onions?

211
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:11,895
For real?

212
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,225
They went bad. It's been a long time.

213
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:16,995
What about scallions?

214
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:20,065
(We don't have scallions either.)

215
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,404
(Onions or scallions, )

216
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,234
(they don't have either.)

217
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,405
So you only have chives.

218
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:30,845
(Putting that aside...)

219
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:33,615
Do you have carrots?

220
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:35,545
Carrots?

221
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,254
No carrots.

222
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,715
(Carrots? None as well.)

223
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:43,854
You have all the rare ingredients...

224
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:45,025
- but not the common ones.
- I see.

225
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:46,455
No carrots.

226
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,225
There was a variety of ingredients.

227
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:52,565
But they didn't have any commonly used in Korean cuisine.

228
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:55,635
We must make do with what we don't have.

229
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,735
The Chinese station was no different from ours.

230
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:04,274
They had zero onions, scallions, and carrots.

231
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,675
(The Chinese station has no basic ingredients.)

232
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,514
(What catches Crew Paik's attention while stuck at a crossroads)

233
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,284
Isn't that electronic?

234
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,415
I see.

235
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,855
This is an induction-powered Chinese stove.

236
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:18,994
- Nice.
- Interesting.

237
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:20,225
Goodness.

238
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:21,764
I was surprised.

239
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,095
Little did I expect to see such a kitchen in Antarctica.

240
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:28,605
That right there is a Chinese stove run on electricity.

241
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:30,805
It's the newest stove.

242
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:33,775
(The newest stove run on electricity)

243
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:37,005
(In Antarctica, where dry conditions make fires easy to spread, )

244
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,685
(strong fire stoves aren't allowed to prevent fires.)

245
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:44,454
(Instead, an induction-powered stove...)

246
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,315
(that runs on electricity was installed.)

247
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,984
The pro is that it gets hot quickly.

248
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:52,055
(Pro: Gets hot quickly)

249
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,355
The con...

250
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,894
is that you cannot add the smoky flavor.

251
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:58,665
(Unable to add the smoky flavor)

252
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,834
(The smoky aroma and flavor come from frying ingredients...)

253
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,434
(over a short, powerful flame.)

254
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:06,734
(Chinese cuisine's kick)

255
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,705
(Smokiness)

256
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,445
(The smokiness can't be achieved with an induction-powered stove.)

257
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:17,715
Interesting. There's no fire.

258
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,355
You can't get the smokiness.

259
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:25,325
(We can't add the smoky flavor?)

260
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,964
Gosh, how stressful.

261
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:32,765
(A poor situation with no smokiness and missing basic ingredients)

262
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,864
To think they don't have onions and carrots.

263
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,505
But we don't have scallions.

264
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,004
Considering the ingredients we saw,

265
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,474
- Yes?
- the Korean dishes we could make...

266
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,405
The ingredients we brought as gifts...

267
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:45,275
are one doenjang and one gochujang.

268
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,715
I definitely knew they wouldn't have doenjang and gochujang.

269
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:52,554
That was why we brought a box of each as gifts.

270
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:56,225
(Doenjang and gochujang were packed right before leaving.)

271
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:01,965
(He leaves with both hands full, with a warm heart.)

272
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:04,834
We need to use the gochujang we brought.

273
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:06,835
What can we use it for?

274
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,905
There was a bag full of webfoot octopus in the freezer.

275
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:12,235
Stir-fried webfoot octopus?

276
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,944
(A collaboration of chewy webfoot octopus and spicy gochujang)

277
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:18,074
Webfoot octopus? With webfoot octopus.

278
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,715
(Stir-fried webfoot octopus)

279
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:21,985
Stir-fried webfoot octopus.

280
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:23,345
Webfoot octopus and rice cakes.

281
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,114
Rice cake octopus.

282
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,554
(Excited about rice cake octopus)

283
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,285
Rice cake octopus is new.

284
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:32,325
People like doenjang stew.

285
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,725
The Chinese do?

286
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:40,165
(Doenjang stew made with doenjang brought from King Sejong Station)

287
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:42,705
But there are no onions.

288
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,235
What can we add to the doenjang stew?

289
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,405
Do we only add meat?

290
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:52,415
In China, something similar to this is added into doenjang stew.

291
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:58,454
It was my first time hearing that this ingredient...

292
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,315
was added to doenjang stew.

293
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:04,695
Although there were no onions or carrots, there were potatoes.

294
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,025
We can make something similar to jjimdak with chicken thigh meat.

295
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:12,095
It'd be good with some wide glass noodles.

296
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:14,434
Make it slightly sweet.

297
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:17,334
(The tender meat in sweet and salty seasoning)

298
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:18,874
Something like Andong jjimdak.

299
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,505
(Andong jjimdak)

300
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,645
In a situation where there weren't enough ingredients,

301
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,275
we still wanted to serve Korean food,

302
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,345
so we racked our brains.

303
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:32,555
(Look forward to it.)

304
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:35,355
Chicken thigh meat. Chicken thighs and webfoot octopus?

305
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:38,755
(Stir-fried webfoot octopus)

306
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,595
(Jjimdak)

307
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,365
(Doenjang stew)

308
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:49,735
(A feast of Korean cuisine made with Chinese station's ingredients)

309
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,905
(I leave my kitchen in your care, Chef.)

310
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:03,615
(Chef of Antarctica is ready.)

311
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:09,285
(Current time: 2pm)

312
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,095
Defrosting the meat is the top priority.

313
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:15,495
- That's enough, right?
- Yes.

314
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,164
We can make doenjang stew with that.

315
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,865
(Pork belly for doenjang stew)

316
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:22,065
- What is it?
- Webfoot octopus.

317
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,575
- Twenty-six.
- The webfoot octopus is huge.

318
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,904
Eighty.

319
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:28,605
(Prepared 15 portions of webfoot octopus)

320
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,374
(Brought all the chicken thighs!)

321
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,945
These are everything. Fifteen.

322
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:33,845
- Fifteen?
- Yes, fifteen.

323
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,515
- Soak them in the water.
- Yes, sir.

324
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,645
Defrost the pork belly in water as well.

325
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,215
We're running short on time.

326
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,084
There are also eggplants.

327
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,825
We can use these for the doenjang stew.

328
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:47,624
- About ten potatoes.
- Ten?

329
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,565
- Ten should be enough.
- Got it.

330
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,234
Glass noodles.

331
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,734
Bring out anything you think will taste better...

332
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:57,935
or make the dish more complete when added.

333
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:01,134
(Will they be able to cook Korean cuisine...)

334
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,645
(with unfamiliar ingredients?)

335
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:08,285
(Rice Jong Hyeop starts with the rice first.)

336
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:11,915
(Keeping the rice water for later)

337
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,155
Here's the rice water.

338
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:15,755
Good enough.

339
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,925
(SUHO...)

340
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,425
(is prepping the potatoes.)

341
00:16:24,665 --> 00:16:26,295
- SUHO, the eggplants...
- Yes.

342
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:28,464
We were told to cut them into cubes.

343
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:29,465
Exactly.

344
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:32,105
After washing them under water, cut off the ends,

345
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:35,074
then cut vertically and horizontally...

346
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:36,645
- to make cubes.
- Okay.

347
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,875
You can do it.

348
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:42,644
(Rice Jong Hyeop)

349
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:46,215
(Eggplant Jong Hyeop)

350
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:50,785
(Cutting them vertically)

351
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,925
(I'm doing it right, no?)

352
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,965
(Jong Hyeop cuts them to stew-friendly sizes.)

353
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:02,034
Cut them a bit thicker. Good.

354
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:03,304
(You get a pass.)

355
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,674
- Thank you.
- Cut them thicker near the end.

356
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,335
If you're not sure about the size,

357
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,245
imagine how they look when you eat out.

358
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,315
(Staring)

359
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:18,185
(Disciple SUHO is peeking to learn.)

360

(imagine how they look when you eat out!)

362
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:25,225
(Visualizing the potato size just as Crew Paik said)

363
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,425
What is that for?

364
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:28,565
The doenjang stew.

365
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,165
Isn't this the size they use at restaurants?

366
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,534
Okay.

367
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,235
- For the doenjang stew.
- That's for the doenjang stew.

368
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,505
(The two cut the potatoes according to the menu.)

369
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:42,075
(Cutting the soaked shiitake mushrooms with scissors)

370
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:45,215
(With great teamwork)

371
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:48,544
(Eggplants, potatoes, green beans, garlic, mushrooms)

372
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:51,245
(These will be revealed later.)

373
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,454
(The chicken thighs and pork belly have thawed...)

374
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,125
(while the vegetables were prepped.)

375
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:59,355
(Are the webfoot octopus thawed?)

376
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:05,594
These aren't bazhuayu. It's squid.

377
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,665
It's squid. Wuzei.

378
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,665
Wuzei means squid legs.

379
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,634
But we were told it was webfoot octopus.

380
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:14,104
(Flustered)

381
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,405
They weren't webfoot octopus.

382
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:19,145
What threw me off was that,

383
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,345
when frozen, they looked like...

384
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:24,784
webfoot octopus. But once they thawed,

385
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,255
they turned out to be squid legs.

386
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:28,455
In short, wuzei.

387
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:30,684
(While checking the fridge)

388
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:32,995
- These are...
- These are bazhuayu.

389
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,495
Bazhuayu. Was it webfoot octopus?

390
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,364
Okay.

391
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:42,265
(The shape can be confusing.)

392
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:45,734
(So SUHO brought the webfoot octopus.)

393
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,435
The webfoot octopus is huge.

394
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,545
It's way bigger than I expected.

395
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,945
No wonder they looked big.

396
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:54,815
- That...
- How many did you grab?

397
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,315
- Eighty. Yes.
- All eighty squids?

398
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,885
(Legs of 80 squids)

399
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,654
(Crew Paik...)

400
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:08,725
(What do we do?)

401
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:10,925
It doesn't matter. We'll just make stir-fried squid.

402
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:13,734
(Even better.)

403
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,734
Originally, the plan was stir-fried webfoot octopus...

404
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,075
with tteokbokki sauce.

405
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,944
But since we found pork belly, we switched to...

406
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:24,645
squid and pork belly bulgogi with tteokbokki rice cakes.

407
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:27,414
That idea popped into my head.

408
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:28,644
The menu changed.

409
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,385
(Squid and pork belly bulgogi)

410
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:34,255
(The switch was smooth.)

411
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:37,925
(But the problem is, )

412
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:41,825
(we need time to prep all the squid legs.)

413
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:45,295
(Legs of 80 squids need to be handled fast.)

414
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,565
Should I do it?

415
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:49,365
Can you? Watch closely.

416
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,334
Cut the squid down the middle.

417
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:54,635
- It's split now, right?
- Yes.

418
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,704
Flip it inside out. Here are the eyes on each side.

419
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,415
- Okay.
- One.

420
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,615
Two. And in the center is the mouth.

421
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:04,215
- Take it out. All clean.
- Yes.

422
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,385
- Let me try.
- Looks fun, right?

423
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:07,885
Easy, isn't it?

424
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:10,924
(He must finish the squid prep quickly...)

425
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:13,425
(so it can be served on time!)

426
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,795
I love you.

427
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,324
(Eggplant Jong Hyeop)

428
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:18,735
(Squid Jong Hyeop)

429
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:21,295
Crew Chae Jong Hyeop's skill has improved a lot.

430
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:27,575
It's my first time prepping squid.

431
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,175
Put it in and slide.

432
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:32,575
Cut.

433
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,445
Take out the mouth.

434
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:39,085
(Adding sound effects after talking to himself)

435
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,524
Like this, and then three of them.

436
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:42,855
(Prepping the squid while talking to himself)

437
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:46,054
(Focused without leaving the station once)

438
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:48,595
(Or he tries to.)

439
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,095
(Sighing)

440
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,835
Wait. Just one tablespoon.

441
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,765
(What is it?)

442
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,005
There's no end to this.

443
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:03,375
(An endless pile of 80 squids)

444
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,375
It's not easy.

445
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,884
Prepping the squid wasn't the hard part.

446
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,585
It was the low sink.

447
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,955
I had to bend over the whole time,

448
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:15,355
so my back hurt a lot.

449
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,325
Now, I understand why he rests...

450
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:20,625
his elbows on it.

451
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:23,595
(SUHO watched...)

452
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,135
(Jong Hyeop struggle.)

453
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,205
Is it hard?

454
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:32,175
No, it's not.

455
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:37,645
(Soo Hyang approaches him quietly...)

456
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,015
(and pats his aching back.)

457
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:45,115
Is your back okay?

458
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,615
I'm fine.

459
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:51,054
(They're busy in the kitchen preparing food for 15 people.)

460
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,155
It hurts, doesn't it?

461
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,495
(But the members encourage and support each other.)

462
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:03,034
(Thanks to Jong Hyeop, Jong Won can focus on other dishes.)

463
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:04,504
Doenjang stew.

464
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:08,805
(Doenjang stew, Andong jjimdak, squid and pork belly bulgogi)

465
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,275
(He's getting ready to use the stove.)

466
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,385
Induction stoves boil water really fast.

467
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,555
But the downside is that they can't give the food that smoky flavor.

468
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:20,755
I've seen it a lot,

469
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,454
but I've never used one.

470
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:23,685
(He's never used an induction stove.)

471
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:26,795
There was another thing that perplexed me.

472
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:31,394
We usually use a wok...

473
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:34,094
with one handle.

474
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:35,435
(It has one handle.)

475
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,235
But in China,

476
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:40,975
they use a double-handled wok.

477
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:44,204
(In some regions of China, people use double-handled woks more often.)

478
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:46,074
The wok itself is different.

479
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,514
It's really hard to use if you don't have experience.

480
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:50,015
(It's a heavy, hard-to-handle tool for Chinese culinary experts.)

481
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,884
I haven't used one for a while,

482
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:54,984
so I was perplexed.

483
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:58,495
(Can he handle the induction stove and the double-handled wok?)

484
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,265
(I'm the chef of Antarctica, Paik Jong Won.)

485
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:06,235
(He turns on the stove seriously.)

486
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,465
(He calmly preps the handle as well.)

487
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:16,205
(To prevent the food from sticking, )

488
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:20,575
(he coats the wok with oil over high heat.)

489
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:24,445
(The oil heats up quickly.)

490
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:27,885
(The first dish he's going to make is doenjang stew with pork belly.)

491
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:31,585
(Shall I begin?)

492
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:35,625
(Putting in pork belly)

493
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,625
Oh, my.

494
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:41,335
(The crowd gathers for the delicious smoky show.)

495
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,705
It's so cool.

496
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,805
I'm going to cook the pork belly like this.

497
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:50,975
(Shaking)

498
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:53,345
(Tossing)

499
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,915
(Adding a dash of water)

500
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,714
It already smells good.

501
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:01,485
(As he continues stir-frying it, it releases savory juices and fat.)

502
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:05,625
(The stir-fried pork belly is ready, enhancing the flavor of the stew.)

503
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:09,694
You can hook the ladle on the opposite handle.

504
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:12,935
You can hook it and pour it like this.

505
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,005
I did it without realizing it.

506
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:18,475
I did it many times when I was in China.

507
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:20,805
Fortunately, my body remembered,

508
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,344
so I put my skills to use.

509
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:23,575
Otherwise, I'd have been in trouble.

510
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:27,775
(Jong Won is serious about Chinese cuisine as expected.)

511
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,485
(He uses another induction stove to boil the stew.)

512
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:33,054
Rice rinse water.

513
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,055
(The apron might fall.)

514
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:35,625
(Slipping down)

515
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,795
(SUHO saw it at the perfect time.)

516
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,225
Let me...

517
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,095
Let me...

518
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:45,664
(Disciple SUHO...)

519
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:48,535
(immediately runs to him.)

520
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:50,565
Why are you touching my apron?

521
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,134
I didn't take it off.

522
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:54,805
I was wondering why you were taking off my apron.

523
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,744
(Laughing)

524
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,615
We need romance.

525
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:01,445
It's bromance.

526
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,685
(Embarrassed)

527
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,925
(After fixing his apron, he focuses on the stew again!)

528
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:14,355
(Adding the rice rinse water for nutrition and flavor)

529
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:15,725
Pour it.

530
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:17,024
(The shiitake mushrooms add an umami aroma.)

531
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,065
Okay.

532
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,234
Doenjang.

533
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,035
(Throwing in the doenjang he brought as a gift)

534
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,434
(Potatoes cut by SUHO and Soo Hyang)

535
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:25,475
(Eggplants cut by Jong Hyeop)

536
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:28,405
- All of them.
- Should I put in all of these?

537
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,004
It's loaded with chunky ingredients.

538
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:32,475
(What are these green vegetables?)

539
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:35,884
(In China, people add...)

540
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,915
(lettuce to doenjang stew!)

541
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:42,285
(It's a combination they can't imagine.)

542
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:46,325
It's a green vegetable similar to lettuce.

543
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,265
(It has a crunchy texture.)

544
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:53,134
In China, they either blanch it or stir-fry it.

545
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,464
It tastes great when stir-fried.

546
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,105
(People usually stir-fry it or blanch it.)

547
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:59,304
In Yanji, located in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture,

548
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:02,844
people add green vegetables to stews,

549
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:05,044
similar to Korean doenjang stew,

550
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:07,214
and enjoy it as gukbap.

551
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,145
It tastes great, so I thought I'd add lettuce to my doenjang stew.

552
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:13,685
(But where did the lettuce come from?)

553
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:19,425
(A place that looks like a stylish cafe on the outside, )

554
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,995
(with beautiful lighting when the sun sets)

555
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:28,805
(A greenhouse at the Chinese station)

556
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,104
(It's full of green vegetables...)

557
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,674
(that look fresh.)

558
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,075
They have chili peppers.

559
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,345
Eggplants too.

560
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:44,884
It's amazing.

561
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,685
(The farm of the Great Wall Station, the greenhouse)

562
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:51,054
(You can get fresh vegetables here throughout the year, )

563
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:55,225
(just like in Sejong Greenhouse.)

564
00:26:58,095 --> 00:27:01,334
(The lettuce from the greenhouse adds more umami flavor.)

565
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:02,564
The stew is ready.

566
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:03,934
(Just let the stew simmer over low heat to bring out its rich flavors.)

567
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:06,305
It already smells good.

568
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:09,104
What should I do with the squid legs?

569
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,105
We should prepare them.

570
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,344
- How?
- Just let them drain.

571
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:12,644
Should I just drain the water?

572
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:14,975
(The squid legs are prepared at the perfect time.)

573
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,145
(Jong Hyeop can do anything.)

574
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:21,715
(He starts making the second dish, squid and pork belly bulgogi.)

575
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:24,124
I want them to try stir-fried spicy pork and squid...

576
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,554
at the same time.

577
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:27,724
(The pork belly is cooking.)

578
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:28,765
Squid.

579
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:31,935
(Putting in squid legs)

580
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:34,834
(The key to stir-fried dishes is that smoky flavor.)

581
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,505
(How will he get it without a flame?)

582
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,875
(Let me see.)

583
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:44,575
(Various Chinese sauces and spices that make his heart beat faster)

584
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,915
(What's the first thing he's going to put in?)

585
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,485
(No hesitation)

586
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,154
When you add sugar,

587
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:55,555
it mixes with the oil and sticks to the pan.

588
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,895
This is how you create that smoky, charred flavor in stir-frying.

589
00:27:59,055 --> 00:28:02,165
I'm trying to get the most out of the ingredients' natural qualities.

590
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,564
(Dark soy sauce is a Chinese soy sauce...)

591
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,365
(that is low in salt and full of umami flavor.)

592
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,204
(Dark soy sauce is rich in umami and has a deep color, )

593
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:13,005
(adding both color and flavor to dishes.)

594
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:14,374
Minced garlic.

595
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,345
(Garlic is a must for the spicy flavor of Korean cuisine.)

596
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:20,145
(He adds gochujang, the key ingredient in the seasoning.)

597
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,144
It's sweet and spicy.

598
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:25,815
(The spicy and sweet sauce is ready to be enjoyed with rice.)

599
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:29,285
(It's being absorbed by the squid and pork belly.)

600
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,654
Let's cook the chicken now.

601
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:31,824
(He starts making the third dish, Andong jjimdak.)

602
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,125
Here's the chicken.

603
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:37,165
(He's going to use a pot this time.)

604
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,435
Another dish is Andong jjimdak.

605
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:44,165
(Adding garlic cloves to the heated oil)

606
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:46,734
- Put it in.
- I'll do it.

607
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:48,235
(Here comes the chicken.)

608
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:51,545
(The oil is hotter than he thought.)

609
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:53,545
Okay.

610
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:56,245
(The garlic and hot oil remove the chicken's gamey smell.)

611
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:02,384
- What's that?
- It's called crystal sugar.

612
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:04,884
(Crystal sugar is commonly used in Chinese braised dishes.)

613
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:08,765
It adds flavor, shine,

614
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,795
and gives braised dishes a rich color.

615
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,795
Crystal sugar is widely used in Chinese cuisine.

616
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:17,435
(He's an expert indeed!)

617
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:20,074
There's nothing Crew Paik doesn't know.

618
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,235
(Jong Won skillfully adapts Chinese ingredients to suit each dish.)

619
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,874
I'm going to use Chinese soy sauce since we have it here.

620
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,275
(He adds a dash of soy sauce for a salty flavor this time.)

621
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:29,685
(Sprinkling seasonings to enhance the umami flavor)

622
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,915
(Once the soy-based sauce comes to a boil, )

623
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,224
(he adds water to get the right consistency.)

624
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,255
Good.

625
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,794
(He adds a generous amount of potatoes, )

626
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:41,055
(which are essential to jjimdak.)

627
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:45,065
(He simmers the chicken and potatoes until they absorb the sauce.)

628
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,805
Can you check the freezer...

629
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,765
and find something green?

630
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:52,574
(The seasoning is done, )

631
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:54,975
(but they need something to enhance the texture and color.)

632
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:56,874
I should decide whether to put the green beans...

633
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,915
- here or there.
- Okay.

634
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,914
Please find something else that is green.

635
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,115
In the freezer?

636
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:04,715
Please find something to put in here.

637
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,055
(Soo Hyang ran to the fridge.)

638
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,855
Earlier, I opened the freezer.

639
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,925
I saw edamame, which is green.

640
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:16,425
I was like, "This is it."

641
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,225
So I ran to the fridge and got it.

642
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:23,135
(Jong Won is also looking through the storage again.)

643
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:30,745
(What did he find?)

644
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,975
I need a chopping board. I'll add some cabbage.

645
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:34,944
What's that for?

646
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:36,985
I want to add more texture.

647
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,514
For the people who work here,

648
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:41,354
- Something crunchy.
- the crunchy texture...

649
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:44,354
of fresh vegetables is the best, even though the taste of the food...

650
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:45,395
is also important.

651
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,694
Oh, my gosh. The cabbage is in really bad condition.

652
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,125
(But it's not in good condition.)

653
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:54,035
(Oh, no!)

654
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:57,105
(He tries cutting it in half first.)

655
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,435
It's okay.

656
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:00,335
(The inside is fine.)

657
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,705
- Remove and discard...
- Okay.

658
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,645
the outer leaves and rinse it.

659
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,875
Yes, sir.

660
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:08,945
(A precious cabbage)

661
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:12,685
(He cuts it into large pieces to keep its texture...)

662
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:16,685
(and adds it to the squid and pork belly bulgogi.)

663
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,024
The crunchy texture.

664
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:20,025
(When cooked, the cabbage becomes tender yet still crunchy, )

665
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,025
(enhancing the dish's texture.)

666
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:23,894
I'm going to add green beans for a nice color.

667
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:26,465
(The hint of green in the red sauce)

668
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,635
I'm going to add some rice cake...

669
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,364
so they can get a hint of tteokbokki flavor too.

670
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:30,835
(Adding chewy rice cake)

671
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:34,535
(With all the ingredients added, it looks like restaurant food!)

672
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:38,774
Korean squid and pork belly bulgogi.

673
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:40,145
(Spicy and sweet squid and pork belly bulgogi)

674
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:43,745
(Jong Won is thinking hard.)

675
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:48,255
(He wants to add crunchy texture to the jjimdak as well.)

676
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,385
- Yes.
- Give me the board for the veggies.

677
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:54,895
(I'm sure we don't have any vegetables left.)

678
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:57,794
It has an interesting shape.

679
00:31:57,795 --> 00:31:59,535
(The vegetable looks unusual.)

680
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,894
- What's this?
- Bamboo shoots.

681
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:02,935
I see.

682
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:05,405
I can use some.

683
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:08,375
(When Jong Won was collecting ingredients, )

684
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,845
(he paid special attention to the bamboo shoots.)

685
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,015
(For their crunchy texture, )

686
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:19,815
(bamboo shoots are used in various Chinese dishes.)

687
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,655
(Instead of carrots in Andong jjimdak, )

688
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:27,295
(he's going to add bamboo shoots to enhance the texture.)

689
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:31,865
(Will they go well with Andong jjimdak?)

690
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,635
(He adds the remaining shiitake mushrooms for umami flavor.)

691
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:39,135
(He also puts in edamame that Soo Hyang found.)

692
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:41,805
For authentic Andong jjimdak,

693
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:43,644
you need glass noodles, and they're commonly used in China.

694
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,544
I put in bamboo shoots and potatoes.

695
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:47,515
(Look at this. It works.)

696
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,915
I made sweet Andong jjimdak.

697
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,584
Yes. You can put it there.

698
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:59,094
(He places the prepared dishes...)

699
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:00,154
Soup.

700
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:01,795
(on the serving counter.)

701
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,225
(Everything is ready.)

702
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:08,334
I wanted to make Korean-style food...

703
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:11,765
and highlight its fresh, vivid colors. That's what I wanted.

704
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,235
Foreigners have different preferences,

705
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,944
so I was worried whether our food would suit their tastes.

706
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:19,075
(Will it suit the tastes of the Chinese crew?)

707
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:27,055
(Dinner time: 6pm)

708
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,655
(Chattering)

709
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:33,855
(The Chinese crew is entering the cafeteria at mealtime.)

710
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:35,495
Hello.

711
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:37,695
(Hello.)

712
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:41,435
(Everyone goes straight to the serving counter.)

713
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,735
(Full of anticipation)

714
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:46,535
(Gulping)

715
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:48,305
What kind of soup is this?

716
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,205
It's a soup commonly enjoyed by Koreans.

717
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,075
(I see.)

718
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:55,345
Next is squid and pork belly bulgogi.

719
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,815
It's stir-fried pork belly and squid.

720
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:02,085
I used gochujang, the Korean paste used in tteokbokki.

721
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:04,655
It's a bit spicy.

722
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:09,165
This is a regional Korean dish.

723
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,595
Andong jjimdak.

724
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:14,064
"Andong jjimdak?"

725
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,165
Andong jjimdak.

726
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:17,865
It's Andong-style braised chicken.

727
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,775
In the future, Korea and China...

728
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,675
Korea and China...

729
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,215
(He couldn't finish the sentence.)

730
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,815
(You know what I'm trying to say, right?)

731
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,585
(Of course.)

732
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,825
I hope they like the rice.

733
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:38,355
I cooked the rice perfectly.

734
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:42,325
(Scooping a generous serving of perfectly cooked rice)

735
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:46,835
(Starting with the doenjang stew, )

736
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:52,035
(he puts the dishes in the bowl 1 by 1.)

737
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:54,735
He put everything in the bowl.

738
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:59,845
He got all the dishes together to mix them.

739
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:03,745
In their culture, all the food is served in one bowl.

740
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,014
I was worried that the dishes...

741
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:09,955
would lose their original flavors if they all got mixed together.

742
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:11,355
It smells good.

743
00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:13,625
Thank you.

744
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:20,035
(When all the dishes are served together in one bowl, )

745
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:25,905
(what would Korean food taste like?)

746
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:29,805
(Having a bite of stir-fried squid)

747
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,515
(Peeking)

748
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,045
(Observing carefully)

749
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:39,915
It tastes good.

750
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:42,015
(Having another bite)

751
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:44,084
I like the subtle sweetness.

752
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:45,125
Yes.

753
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:51,725
(Jong Hyeop carefully prepared the squid legs.)

754
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:55,295
(The squid legs and thawed pork belly...)

755
00:35:55,965 --> 00:36:00,605
(were stir-fried in a sweet and spicy sauce.)

756
00:36:01,705 --> 00:36:05,604
They stir-fried squid and meat. It's good.

757
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:09,445
(It's not spicy. It's sweet.)

758
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:12,215
(They're enjoying it.)

759
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,814
It looks like napa cabbage.

760
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:18,155
It tastes like napa cabbage to me.

761
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:27,035
It tastes like home.

762
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:31,465
(It tastes like my mom's food.)

763
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,505
How is your food?

764
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:37,305
- Which dish did you make?
- Which dish?

765
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,614
Did you make this?

766
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,945
- Rolled omelet? I made it.
- Rolled omelet.

767
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:45,785
(Rolled omelet was served with today's dishes.)

768
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:50,055
(Did SUHO make the rolled omelet?)

769
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:51,784
(While they were checking the fridge)

770
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:53,954
- There are eggs.
- There are eggs.

771
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:55,554
(They found eggs.)

772
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:57,225
- There are eggs.
- There are eggs.

773
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:00,995
(They received eggs from the Chilean base a while ago.)

774
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:03,004
Is there anyone brave enough to make a rolled omelet?

775
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,864
(I'm looking for someone willing to take on making a rolled omelet.)

776
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:06,335
- Me.
- Good.

777
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,474
Coat the pan with oil.

778
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,145
Roll it just like this.

779
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,374
Coat the pan with oil again and roll it.

780
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,475
At first, it won't take shape, but don't worry about it.

781
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:19,915
(He already practiced making omelets.)

782
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:23,555
I thought it was time to show something.

783
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:27,325
And I like cooking with eggs.

784
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:28,955
So I volunteered.

785
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:32,295
(The problem is, he has to make 15 servings of rolled omelet.)

786
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,965
I've never cooked for many people, so I was worried.

787
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,375
The stove is...

788
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:44,105
(He has to make it on a huge griddle instead of a frying pan.)

789
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,044
They didn't have a frying pan.

790
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,314
The griddle can be used for many dishes,

791
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:50,214
but in China, they usually spread pastry dough,

792
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,084
similar to hotteok, on the griddle,

793
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,084
add minced meat, cover it,

794
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,525
and cook it on both sides.

795
00:37:56,555 --> 00:37:58,284
It's used to make crepe-like dishes.

796
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:01,095
(It's a pancake griddle.)

797
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:02,964
I told him to use the griddle.

798
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:04,425
(Using an unfamiliar griddle is a challenging task.)

799
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,034
I had a mental breakdown.

800
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,495
Instead of a normal frying pan,

801
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,765
I had to use a big griddle I've never seen before.

802
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,835
It was hard to control.

803
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:14,575
I wasn't sure if I could do it well.

804
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,845
You can make a rolled omelet as long as you're not afraid.

805
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:20,175
Keep planning how you're going to make it.

806
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:24,685
Surprisingly, foreigners find Korean rolled omelets fascinating.

807
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:26,014
They do?

808
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:28,455
(Preparing eggs for 15 people)

809
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:33,825
(Chopping aromatic shiitake mushrooms...)

810
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:37,395
(and firm shrimp to add a nice texture)

811
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:38,765
Mix it.

812
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:40,064
Mix it here.

813
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,095
(Throwing in the eggs)

814
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,705
(Seasoning with salt)

815
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,235
(The egg mixture for the large rolled omelet is ready.)

816
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:49,675
(Rummaging)

817
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:51,074
This is it.

818
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,545
(This is it!)

819
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:56,645
Let me try it. It'll be fun.

820
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,555
(He coats the griddle with oil.)

821
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:02,485
Here we go.

822
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:05,284
(One ladleful)

823
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:06,824
(Two ladlefuls)

824
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:08,855
(Three ladlefuls)

825
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:12,565
(Roll the slightly cooked eggs.)

826
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:19,335
I was confident in making rolled omelets in small portions.

827
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:21,375
But it was my first time making it for many people.

828
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:22,844
It's okay.

829
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:24,475
(It's okay. I can do it!)

830
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,115
Don't you have to pour another ladleful of eggs first?

831
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,645
That's how you do it.

832
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:33,785
(The rolled omelet is gradually taking shape.)

833
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,855
(For the nervous SUHO)

834
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,925
I'll make the big shrimp pieces smaller.

835
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:43,265
(Soo Hyang cuts the shrimp into smaller pieces to make it easier.)

836
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:44,995
SUHO. Here are chives.

837
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:48,835
(Jong Hyeop found chives to add color.)

838
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,304
- Add some chives.
- Yes.

839
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,364
(Oh, that's a great idea.)

840
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:52,405
Put them here.

841
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:54,134
Try adding them.

842
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:56,345
(The egg mixture is upgraded.)

843
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,015
(Everyone is supporting me. All I need to do is just roll it.)

844
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,115
(The egg is heavy now.)

845
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:05,014
(Tensing his legs)

846
00:40:05,015 --> 00:40:06,855
(Bouncing)

847
00:40:08,585 --> 00:40:11,625
(He successfully rolled the eggs in a strange posture.)

848
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:16,365
(It looks thick and delicious.)

849
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:19,025
You did a great job.

850
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:21,795
You think so?

851
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:23,565
This isn't your first time, is it?

852
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,065
I've made rolled omelets at home,

853
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,675
but I've never made a big one like this.

854
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:29,134
(His compliment makes him happy.)

855
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,245
Have confidence.

856
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:34,715
(He cuts it into 15 pieces.)

857
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:37,815
(Wiping the tray neatly)

858
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,154
It almost looks like a pancake.

859
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:41,955
(This is his 1st rolled omelet for 15 people.)

860
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:45,285
(Trying the rolled omelet)

861
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:49,155
(All the Chinese crew members enjoyed it.)

862
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:52,225
(The rolled omelet is also really good.)

863
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:54,095
Can you cook eggs like this?

864
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:56,535
I'll learn how to make it.

865
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:00,505
It's delicious.

866
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,205
(Thumbs up)

867
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:06,445
(SUHO's rolled omelet got the crew's biggest reaction.)

868
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:10,244
Actually, I didn't like the shape.

869
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:13,255
But everyone enjoyed it, so I was very proud of myself.

870
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,155
It was such a relief.

871
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:23,924
I made SUHO make the rolled omelet.

872
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:25,565
I thought he would mess up a little.

873
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:27,235
But he was good.

874
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:29,035
It was the most popular dish.

875
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:33,275
I was extremely nervous when the crew members were eating.

876
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:39,344
But everyone said they liked the food,

877
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:40,775
so it was a huge relief.

878
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:49,885
(The Korean meal for the Chinese crew was a huge success.)

879
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:53,895
(It's time to return to King Sejong Station, feeling proud.)

880
00:41:57,325 --> 00:41:59,465
(Sighing)

881
00:41:59,835 --> 00:42:03,135
Little did I think this would happen.

882
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,305
It was frightening and made me worried.

883
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,705
At first, I thought the production crew was joking.
