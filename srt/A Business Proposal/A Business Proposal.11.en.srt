1
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,176
I didn't mean to lie to you
from the very beginning.

2
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,721
I just happened to go on
that blind date, and I met Mr. Kang--

3
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,097
Blind date?

4
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,850
Why were you there?

5
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,478
I'm friends
with Jin Young-seo of Marine Group.

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,855
She didn't want
to go on the blind date, so…

7
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,023
And?

8
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,026
After Mr. Kang found out
that I was a fake,

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,446
he asked me
to pretend to be his girlfriend.

10
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,159
because he didn't want to
waste his time on blind dates.

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,080
So, you weren't a real couple
in the first place,

12
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,249
but started seeing each other
just to trick me?

13
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,673
-Yes, sir. But--
-If there's nothing between you two,

14
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,635
-then I don't need to hear more of this.
-But…

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,263
Stop seeing Tae-moo.

16
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,600
I don't think
you want to be in a situation

17
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,977
that other people may misinterpret.

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,147
Sir, I have something to tell you…

19
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,774
Yes, Sung-hoon.

20
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,151
What?

21
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,070
What about Tae-moo?

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,912
I'm fine!

23
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,749
Yes, let's go.

24
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,232
Mom!

25
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,525
Come on, Tae-moo!

26
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,609
Dad!

27
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,998
How dare you show up here?

28
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,999
Sir.

29
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,042
Didn't you hear me?

30
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,005
I don't want anybody to see
anything that could be misinterpreted.

31
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,010
Grandfather…

32
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,096
I don't want you calling me that.

33
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,934
Whose fault do you think it is
that Tae-moo got into an accident?

34
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,646
I'm fine, so don't get upset.

35
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,985
Are you all right, Tae-moo?

36
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,572
Are you hurt anywhere else?

37
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,829
You got into a fake relationship because
you didn't want to go on blind dates?

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:29,250
How could you
tell an absurd lie like that?

39
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,340
I'll be on my way now, President Kang.

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,687
Grandfather.

41
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,566
We're not in a fake relationship.

42
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,626
I love Shin Ha-ri.

43
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,011
EPISODE 11

44
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,853
Did you

45
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,439
know all about this, too?

46
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,067
I'm sorry, sir.

47
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,612
So you two worked together to fool me?

48
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,282
You bastards!

49
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
Don't be mad at Sung-hoon.

50
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,830
He's my secretary.
Of course he's on my side.

51
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,249
What are you thinking?

52
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,335
You need to end this now!

53
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,587
Fine.

54
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,547
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

55
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,464
But…

56
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,883
don't expect to ever have
any great-grandkids.

57
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,428
What?

58
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,389
-What do you--
-I don't think that I'll ever meet

59
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,141
a woman I love as much as Ha-ri.

60
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,809
So do as you please

61
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,896
if you want me to devote myself only
to work and never get married.

62
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
Are you threatening me right now?

63
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,236
Grandfather, that's not what I--

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,530
What if I say, "Over my dead body"?

65
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,283
You liked her
when you met her as Geum-hui.

66
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,576
Back then,

67
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,039
I didn't know that it was all a lie.

68
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,834
Everything about her has been a lie.

69
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,711
I'm the one who made her do that.

70
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,505
I forced her
into a contractual relationship.

71
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,759
All of this is mostly my fault.

72
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,763
So direct your hate at me,

73
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,390
and cut her some slack.

74
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,187
I genuinely like her,

75
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,064
Grandfather.

76
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,860
I'm so glad that Tae-moo
didn't get seriously injured.

77
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,196
Chairman Kang
must have been really surprised.

78
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,405
Yes.

79
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,825
By the way, what did he say to you?

80
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,244
Did he give you money
and tell you to break up?

81
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,038
Are you trying to cheer me up?

82
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,373
No, it's not that.

83
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,086
Don't you remember my ex from college?
The guy from that indie band.

84
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,215
My dad gave him an envelope of money
because I was so obsessed with him.

85
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,136
And he disappeared with that envelope.

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,225
What is this?

87
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,812
Why does it rain so often these days?

88
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,273
Young-seo, I'm sorry,
but I need to go back to the hospital.

89
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,484
What? Why? It's raining!

90
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,653
I'm sorry. Could you pull over?

91
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,959
You should go back now, sir.

92
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,670
Okay.

93
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,557
It's raining outside,

95
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,892
so I was worried

96
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,311
about Tae-moo.

97
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,996
You can go in.

98
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,599
Don't turn on the lights.

99
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,356
What are you doing over there?

100
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,609
I was looking out the window.

101
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,321
Why did you come back?

102
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,118
Don't tell me…

103
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,665
Because you missed me?

104
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,086
Yes, you're right.

105
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,422
Come here.

106
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,183
Do you see that?

107
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,396
What about the N Seoul Tower?

108
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,527
I just remembered,
my father told me once that the tower

109
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,946
looked like a Christmas tree.

110
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,739
What do you think?

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,492
Now that you say that,
I can kind of see it.

112
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,787
On that day,

113
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,748
my father was put
in a really awkward situation.

114
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,544
I caught him wrapping
some Christmas presents for me.

115
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,172
I cried asking
if Santa Claus didn't exist,

116
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,133
and my mother had a hard time
calming me down.

117
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,803
Your parents must have
been really flustered.

118
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,762
Yes.

119
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,306
But my mother told me

120
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,478
that Santa Claus was busy,
so he asked him to wrap my presents.

121
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,438
She came up with a good cover.

122
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,109
So I kept believing in Santa Claus
for a few years after that.

123
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,539
I don't remember the last time

124
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,834
I looked at the rain for this long.

125
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,008
Thank you for coming back
because you were worried about me.

126
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,471
I used to hate it.

127
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,352
Words of sympathy or worried expressions.

128
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,481
I felt like no one knew
what I was really feeling.

129
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,444
So they just felt like
empty words and actions.

130
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,073
So I pretended to be fine,
and eventually, I believed it too.

131
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,160
But one day…

132
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,998
I realized I was rotting on the inside.

133
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,085
So I was in a lot of pain for a while.

134
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,296
I think

135
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,090
that anybody would have felt the same.

136
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,180
My parents' accident…

137
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,016
happened because of me.

138
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,528
Don't go, Mom.

139
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,238
It's my birthday today.

140
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,495
Dad, you said you would go
to an amusement park with me today.

141
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,789
Tae-moo.

142
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,834
We'll be right back, okay?

143
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,427
We're on our way back so we can go
to the amusement park with you, Tae-moo.

144
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,845
Wait just a bit longer.

145
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,515
Hurry back. We're already late.

146
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,974
Quickly!

147
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,144
Tae-moo, you shouldn't
talk to your mother like that.

148
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,896
Yes, okay.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,439
Is Mom coming?

150
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,484
Yes, she is. She'll come soon. Okay?

151
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,116
Let's hurry.

152
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,428
Dad!

153
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,804
Tae-moo, don't look!

154
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:06,016
-Mom!
-Don't look.

155
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,643
Mom!

156
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,353
Tae-moo, come on!

157
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,189
Mom!

158
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,441
Tae-moo!

159
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,608
Dad!

160
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,360
Don't cry, Tae-moo!

161
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,319
Mom!

162
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,696
I can never see

163
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,241
my parents' faces in my dreams.

164
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,453
Always only the backs of their heads.

165
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,332
And every time,

166
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,213
I think maybe they resent me.

167
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,924
And that's why…

168
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,388
they won't let me see their faces

169
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,016
even in my dreams.

170
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,024
How could you

171
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,985
say something so ridiculous?

172
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,571
Tae-moo.

173
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,160
Do you know how bright
your smile was when you were

174
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,330
talking about your parents just now?

175
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,876
I could tell by looking at that face…

176
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,381
how much your parents loved you
when you were growing up.

177
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,886
They loved you so much.
Do you really think…

178
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,973
they resent you?

179
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,727
Darn it.

180
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,855
I'm scared now that I've heard your story.

181
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,567
Do you secretly think your accident was
because of me and resent me for it?

182
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,277
Not at all.

183
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,112
How could you think that?

184
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,449
Look at this.

185
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,494
This is what you're doing.

186
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,581
How could your parents resent…

187
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,586
their own son?

188
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,340
They probably want you

189
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,218
to be happy, more than anybody else.

190
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,349
I…

191
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,894
thought I didn't deserve to be.

192
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,315
I thought that I should never…

193
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,735
forgive myself.

194
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,957
I'm sure…

195
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,587
your parents want you to be happy.

196
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,507
They probably want you

197
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,429
to be free from your past…

198
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,226
and live as happily as anybody else.

199
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,384
What's wrong with me?

200
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,027
Did I really fall asleep here?

201
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,343
Sleep well.

202
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,241
You!

203
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,250
Are you going to work this early?

204
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,503
Yes.

205
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,547
There's a lot to do at work today.

206
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,676
Look at you, working so hard
to earn money.

207
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,012
You've got this! Have a great day!

208
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,971
Okay.

209
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,389
And always be careful.

210
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,391
-Yes, but I--
-Come on.

211
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,561
Don't skip any meals,
and don't buy any weird foods, okay?

212
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,563
-Okay.
-I'm so proud of you.

213
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,522
Go on.

214
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,482
-Bye, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

215
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,241
Where's my phone?

216
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,744
Did I leave it at the hospital?

217
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,580
Ha-ri.

218
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,374
What are you doing here?

219
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,751
Here, Ha-ri.

220
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,586
Hey!

221
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,214
I left this in here, then?
I thought I'd lost it!

222
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,091
Thank you, my friend!

223
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,303
Look at the comments
on the nertube video of you and Min-woo.

224
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,346
Why?

225
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,515
It's complicated. Just look at it.

226
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,726
Yoo-ra made a mess of things again.

227
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,813
Chef Lee Min-woo and the researcher
look so good together.

228
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,399
That's true. Maybe they're already dating.

229
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,651
Your phone was blowing up
early in the morning,

230
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,862
so I looked to see if something was wrong.

231
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,365
They look good together, right?

232
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,534
Even as his girlfriend,

233
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,953
I think that they look cute together, too.

234
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,038
Maybe too much.

235
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,167
She's had a crush on Min-woo
for seven years

236
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,002
and followed him around as a friend.

237
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,172
And now she's hitting on him
using work as an excuse.

238
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,842
What's funnier is that her boyfriend
is the president of her company.

239
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,136
She always pretends
to be so pitiful, kind,

240
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,015
and acts like she's the victim

241
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,143
while going back and forth
between the two men.

242
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,604
It makes me sick.

243
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,403
If that's true, isn't
the go food researcher a total snake?

244
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,907
Breaking news! Her boyfriend
is the president of go food!

245
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:44,206
Oh, my God. So she's two-timing
the president and the chef?

246
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,249
My goodness…

247
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,001
So she's dating her boss
to get her crush work?

248
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,170
This is like the plot
of a really bad TV show.

249
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,422
That researcher's really something.

250
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,219
Do you think it's true,
what they're saying in the comments?

251
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,097
Yes, that's why she posted it.

252
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,807
The picture says it all.

253
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,018
How could he date his employee
at a time like this?

254
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,021
What's the point of taking down
the nertube video

255
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,357
and blocking the comments

256
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,777
when there are people like you
babbling away on the inside?

257
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,737
Sir, it's not like that.

258
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,948
We were just worried.

259
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,241
If you're worried,

260
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,328
then watch your own mouth!

261
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,343
The higher-ups wanted to see you, right?
What did they say?

262
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,095
Will Ms. Shin be disciplined?

263
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,890
Ms. Kim, did you
put the paper on the door like I said?

264
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,308
I did.

265
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,642
NO ENTRY
EXCEPT FOR TEAM 1

266
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,188
Come on, we're all a part
of the Food Development team.

267
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,939
We're just like family, right?

268
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,526
Did you guys know
that those two were dating?

269
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,736
If we knew,

270
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,239
would we be sitting here
looking shell-shocked like this?

271
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,783
How did Ms. Shin
seduce President Kang, anyway?

272
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,620
Do you think President Kang
knows she two-timed him?

273
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,372
Why do you think
he didn't come to work today?

274
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,584
The shock and the embarrassment
of being two-timed.

275
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,754
I wouldn't come to work
if I were him, either.

276
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,589
I could never.

277
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,758
I'm sorry that I'm late.

278
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,263
Look at the time! How could you be
so late? You didn't even pick up my calls!

279
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,433
I'm sorry. I lost my phone.

280
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,602
-Have a good day, then.
-Bye.

281
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,980
You know the current situation, right?

282
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,107
Yes.

283
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,319
-But, Ms. Yeo--
-Hold it for a second. Just listen.

284
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,491
The higher-ups want us
to stop what we're doing.

285
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,660
What?

286
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,536
-What?
-They took down the nertube video

287
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,330
and blocked all of the comments,

288
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,041
but the story has spread already.
It's not looking good.

289
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:56,964
I think they've decided
it's a bad idea to continue with a project

290
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,300
that has your name on it.

291
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,177
Then what will happen to our project?

292
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,221
They'll hand it over to Team 2 and 3.

293
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,640
Then what do they want us to do now?

294
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,058
Come to work to do nothing?

295
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,811
They want us to assist Team 2 and 3.

296
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,980
We did all the hard work,

297
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,524
but the other teams will take the credit.

298
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,152
I was hoping
that I would get promoted this time.

299
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,737
I guess not…

300
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,123
Chairman Kang was worried
Tae-moo would lose it,

301
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,833
so he told them not to tell him.

302
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,251
Really?

303
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,712
How about you? Are you okay?

304
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,756
Are your coworkers
talking behind your back?

305
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,925
No. Not at all.

306
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,345
I was just about to go out
for lunch with my coworkers.

307
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,139
I'll hang up now.

308
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,016
Okay, then.

309
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,019
Yes. I'll call you later.

310
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,232
I love you too.

311
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,862
You're having a really good time.

312
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,614
What? Why are you glaring at me like that?

313
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:05,991
Do you have something to say to me?

314
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,787
Don't you know your father?

315
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,415
Why are you raining on my parade?

316
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,500
Why would you bring up Dad?

317
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:19,379
Don't make it so obvious at work
that you're in a relationship.

318
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,132
He'll be angry if he finds out
that you're dating Sung-hoon.

319
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,675
Mind your own business.

320
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,303
Don't you dare tell him.
I'll kill you if you do.

321
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,016
It's not for you.

322
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,561
-What?
-It's not because of you!

323
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,314
I won't tell him

324
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,232
for Sung-hoon's sake.

325
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,985
This is the last act…

326
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,656
of kindness I can do for him.

327
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,161
Right.

328
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,872
What is this?

329
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,750
I guess she really liked Sung-hoon.

330
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,591
Too bad our tastes in men overlap.

331
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,345
Maybe I shouldn't have come to work.

332
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,471
Yes.

333
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,099
-Let's sit for a bit.
-Yes, ma'am.

334
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,016
Sure.

335
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,107
I wonder where Ms. Shin is.
I didn't see her in the cafeteria.

336
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,070
Stop worrying about Ms. Shin.
Let's worry about ourselves.

337
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,740
Our work lives are about
to get harder because of someone.

338
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,911
Did you hear?

339
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,540
The employee in Food Product Development
Team 1 who's dating President Kang…

340
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,584
I hear she got her Mega Hit Award
because she was dating Mr. Kang.

341
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,753
-Really?
-Yes.

342
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,131
I saw her picture,
and she's not even that pretty.

343
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,093
I wonder how she seduced President Kang.

344
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,053
Right?

345
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,806
Apparently, she's had a lot of flings
with other guys too.

346
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,601
-Shouldn't we tell President Kang?
-You will?

347
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,316
-Looks like you're having fun.
-Sir?

348
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,236
You're having so much fun
talking about something

349
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,863
-that hasn't even been confirmed yet.
-Who are you?

350
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,906
Me? I'm on Team 1.

351
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,285
Just like the employee
that you were talking about.

352
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,620
Associate Director Gye Bin.

353
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,456
Hello, sir.

354
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,502
She didn't get her award
because she was dating President Kang.

355
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,087
She's always been competent.

356
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,464
-Right?
-Yes.

357
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,717
Ms. Shin has always been good at her job.

358
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,968
Of course!

359
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,388
She got that award over her senior.

360
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,267
I'm that senior she surpassed.

361
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,560
-Yes, sir.
-She beat me.

362
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,062
-That says it all.
-Of course. Yes.

363
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,441
Let's not talk so badly about something
that you don't know about.

364
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,358
Okay?

365
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,321
Also, our Ms. Shin is

366
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,617
way prettier than you.

367
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,785
What?

368
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,788
See? That's…

369
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,832
Let's go. Yes.

370
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,585
Goodbye, sir. Wait for me.

371
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,760
Mr. Gye, that made me feel great.
I didn't think you had it in you.

372
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,761
It's nothing.

373
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,014
Yes. You've been the one grumbling
about this the most,

374
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,309
but I guess
she's your teammate, after all.

375
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,604
Of course,
I should take my teammate's side.

376
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,732
It's okay if I talk badly
about my own family,

377
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,193
but I can't stand it
when other people do it.

378
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,110
Look at you.

379
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,738
What?

380
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,823
Ms. Shin!

381
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,535
How long have you been there?

382
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,959
Mr. Gye!

383
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,419
Oh, my God.

384
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,430
-Wait, Ms. Shin, wait.
-Wait. Can you let go--

385
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,015
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,018
I thought you guys hated me now.

387
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,190
I love you.

388
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,779
What brings you here?
Are you meeting Ha-ri?

389
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,448
Yes. Has anything happened here?

390
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,535
What? Mom, nothing bad
happened here, right?

391
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,452
No, why?

392
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,454
Young-seo asked. I'm going on a delivery.

393
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,248
-Go, quick.
-I'm going.

394
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,293
Look at him. I was just asking
about the store, that's all.

395
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,629
-Ms. Han.
-Yes.

396
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,631
Draft beer
and two orders of fried chicken.

397
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,008
One each for Ha-ri and me.

398
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,009
-One each?
-Yes.

399
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,343
Sure.

400
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,886
I'll get the beer.

401
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,846
Sure.

402
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,518
I don't think she knows yet,
thank goodness.

403
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,355
Gosh, the president of go food
is dating his employee.

404
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,817
But someone exposed
that she's two-timed him,

405
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,902
and it's a mess right now.

406
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,240
Wait, the owners' daughter
works at go food.

407
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,908
-Yes.
-Right.

408
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,123
Hey, you're spilling our precious beer.
Snap out of it.

409
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,791
-I'm sorry.
-Come on, Young-seo.

410
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,418
Should we ask the owners?

411
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,586
Sir.

412
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,713
-What?
-You said that

413
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,798
your daughter works at go food, right?

414
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,550
Yes, why?

415
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,472
What? Why did you scream? What is it?

416
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,099
-I--
-Here.

417
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,809
-Here--
-I will…

418
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:32,609
pay for everyone's drinks

419
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,944
-and food!
-Really?

420
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,071
Give me the menu, here.

421
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,365
-Oh, sure.
-I want two beers.

422
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,701
-Sir, could I have some beer?
-We have so many customers.

423
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,828
-Slowly.
-Right, gently.

424
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,039
Does it hurt?

425
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,124
A bit more gently, then.

426
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,672
-It's not.
-It's not.

427
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,508
I'll come back later.

428
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,094
Wait.

429
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,846
This is your fault!

430
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,972
I hate this, too.

431
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:03,932
What?

432
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,020
Slowly.

433
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,648
Let's do this side first.

434
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,150
I also hate you

435
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,152
breathing down on my neck.

436
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,738
Why did you whisper?

437
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,615
It's better than yelling.

438
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,160
-I was trying to be nice.
-Don't try to be nice, please.

439
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,205
Here!

440
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,167
It smells good. What cologne do you use?

441
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,710
Come on!

442
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,131
You can button those up by yourself.

443
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,847
You got everything that I wanted, right?

444
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,266
Why did you make me do that?

445
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,190
Why do you need so many books
all of a sudden?

446
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,316
I'm bored.

447
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,111
The chairman's not letting me do any work.

448
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,954
I thought you'd need it.

449
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,460
What are you going to do

450
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,837
regarding Ha-ri?

451
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,591
Chairman Kang is firmly against it.

452
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,968
You can't just keep pushing this on him.

453
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:26,222
Would you be able to give up Young-seo
if her father didn't approve of you two?

454
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,436
Although I feel bad for my grandfather,

455
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,605
I'm not giving up Ha-ri.

456
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,577
I never thought that I would
end up spending 457,000 won on chicken.

457
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,914
Maybe I should frame this.

458
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,252
So why did you pay for everyone there?

459
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,255
Why do you think? I didn't want
everyone to find out about you!

460
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,425
Thanks for that.

461
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,346
I'm already on a tight budget.

462
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm really going to be broke this month.

463
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,144
My neck.

464
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,521
Are you hurt?

465
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,648
Young-seo, you must be hurt?

466
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,732
Where, here?

467
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,069
-Does it hurt right here?
-I'm a bit sore right here.

468
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,154
Hey, Shin Ha-ri.

469
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,491
Be thankful that you have
a friend like me.

470
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,702
Of course.

471
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,872
Hey, that's why I treat you so well.

472
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,415
Right.

473
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,627
This is all because of Yoo-ra.

474
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,129
Why are those two so quiet
after making this mess?

475
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,548
Did Min-woo call you?

476
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,384
He did, but…

477
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,636
But?

478
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,721
I just

479
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,932
didn't pick up.

480
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,768
Why? You should have yelled at him.

481
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,770
I was going to at first,

482
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,189
but I thought about it

483
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,942
and I'm at fault too.

484
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,737
One of the comments said
something like this.

485
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,283
"If she's had a crush on him
for seven years,

486
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,451
isn't she basically a stalker?"

487
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,038
You shouldn't care about a stupid
comment like that. It's not like you.

488
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,833
Hey, you said that I was
obsessed with him, too.

489
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,960
Hey, that's different.

490
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,964
If my best friend thought that too,

491
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,341
then what would have…

492
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,053
Yoo-ra thought of me?

493
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,599
So, I'm just going to say…

494
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,518
that we both got even.

495
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,148
How can you say that about this situation?

496
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,526
If it were me,
I would have punched Yoo-ra in the face.

497
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,695
I used to be called Bloody Head, remember?

498
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,739
Should I show you my skills again?

499
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,491
Young-seo.

500
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,076
Ha-ri.

501
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,547
What?

502
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,966
Hello?

503
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,177
Hello. Is this Ms. Shin Ha-ri?

504
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,094
Who is this?

505
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,639
I called you to remind you
of something important.

506
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,515
Can you guess what it is?

507
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,605
What are you doing, Tae-moo?

508
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,856
What do you think?

509
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,859
I'm calling the girlfriend
who's been ignoring her injured boyfriend.

510
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,779
I thought you would drop by after work.

511
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,573
I'm sorry. I've been
all over the place today.

512
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,450
Do you know who I'm with right now?

513
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,078
What? Who are you with? Who?

514
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,079
A friend.

515
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,247
You probably know this friend, too.

516
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,792
Me? A friend who I know?

517
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,379
-Who is it?
-I have a friend like that.

518
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,800
A thoughtful friend who listens to me
by my side whenever I'm feeling angry.

519
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,804
Actually, she looked a lot like you,
now that I think about it.

520
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,684
So that friend
must be really pretty, right?

521
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,353
No. She's really ugly.

522
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,897
What? Hey!

523
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,858
I'm just kidding.

524
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,277
That friend is

525
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,738
the thank-you gift that you gave me

526
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,991
when I went to that concert with you.

527
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,160
It's a Worry Doll.

528
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,373
It's a doll that I can talk to
about my worries.

529
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,001
I see.

530
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,881
Why are you sighing?

531
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,216
Is something wrong?

532
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,052
No, I just…

533
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,972
I just yawned like this.

534
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,810
You're yawning
while talking to your boyfriend?

535
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,186
That's a bit harsh.

536
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,440
No, I…

537
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,650
I didn't sleep very well last night.

538
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,693
You didn't?

539
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,862
I heard you snoring.

540
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,321
I don't snore.

541
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,034
Did I really snore?

542
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
No.

543
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,915
Ha-ri.

544
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:04,917
Do you know?

545
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,128
Know what?

546
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,796
Honestly, I feel

547
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,340
so relieved right now.

548
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,968
I've been feeling bad about

549
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,471
keeping our relationship a secret…

550
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,099
from my grandfather.

551
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,395
But now that I don't have to
hide it anymore,

552
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,230
I feel so relieved.

553
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,359
From now on,
I want to tell everyone about it

554
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,779
and meet with you without hiding.

555
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,697
So…

556
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,949
to do that, Ha-ri…

557
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,995
Yes.

558
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,457
We should get…

559
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,417
married…

560
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,838
Hello?

561
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,632
The call's disconnecting…

562
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,217
Hello.

563
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,760
Hello?

564
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,095
Ha-ri?

565
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,679
Hello?

566
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,724
I can't hear you. Hello?

567
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,934
Ha-ri.

568
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,936
Ha-ri!

569
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,940
Wait, are there any coins?

570
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:10,942
Coins…

571
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,402
Damn it.

572
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,870
Why did it have to cut off
at such an important moment?

573
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,333
I think I'm going to send Tae-moo
by next month.

574
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,340
So make sure to take care of
the house and car in New York.

575
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,676
Yes, okay.

576
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,388
Am I going to the United States?

577
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,722
Where have you been?

578
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,975
Tell me. Am I going?

579
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,853
Sit.

580
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,526
You haven't even talked to me about this.

581
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,198
Are you doing this because of Ha-ri?

582
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,327
Are you doing this to pry us apart?

583
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,038
Do you think it'll break us up?

584
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,331
I know.

585
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,751
I know that this isn't enough
to separate you two.

586
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,254
So why are you doing this?
This isn't like you.

587
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,676
Okay, so let's say

588
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,013
that I approve of you two.

589
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,392
But, once people find out
that you're dating,

590
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:31,939
do you think
that she'll be able to come to work?

591
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,152
The employees will gossip about it.

592
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,070
You might be fine,

593
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,782
but she's just an employee.

594
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,951
She won't be able to endure it.

595
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,288
Until it blows over,

596
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,249
work at the American branch for two years.

597
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,878
If you haven't changed your mind
after that,

598
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,214
I'll approve.

599
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
No.

600
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,594
-Tae-moo.
-It won't matter if it's two or 20 years.

601
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,554
My feelings will never change.

602
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,306
Besides…

603
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,808
I don't want to be away from her anymore.

604
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,856
I'm going to marry Ha-ri.

605
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,528
-Tae-moo!
-Then people won't gossip anymore.

606
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,908
So, please

607
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,703
approve of our relationship.

608
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,301
Maybe I should have told Tae-moo.

609
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:50,059
I should have talked to Ha-ri
about marriage, first.

610
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,904
Let's have dinner together this weekend.

611
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,030
Really?

612
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,783
We've been too busy to have a date lately.

613
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,369
-I'll look forward to it, okay?
-Sure.

614
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,746
Young-seo.

615
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,544
Dad. What are you doing here?

616
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,796
I dropped by to see you,
among other things.

617
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,009
Who is this?

618
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,429
Hello, sir. I'm Cha Sung-hoon. I'm--

619
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,055
The man who's dating my daughter?

620
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,724
Have you been watching me?

621
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,727
There are a lot of people
willing to report things to me.

622
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,353
It's nice to meet you, sir.

623
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,314
I think Young-seo has hidden you away

624
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,566
because she didn't want
to introduce you to me.

625
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,318
How about dinner together?

626
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,694
What are you planning?

627
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,446
What do you mean?

628
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,575
What's wrong with having dinner
with my daughter's boyfriend?

629
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,454
Let's not drag it out. How about tonight?

630
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,046
Right, mix up the filling really well.

631
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,673
I know we're supposed to be helping them,

632
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,717
but they're making us
do all of their work.

633
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,260
Let's look on the bright side.

634
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,846
It's more efficient
that we continue to do it.

635
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,100
I want to throw them my letter
of resignation because this is unfair

636
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,562
but I can't since I have to get married.

637
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,147
Married?

638
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,691
Mr. Gye, are you marrying Ms. Yeo?

639
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,652
What else am I going to do?
The whole company knows about us,

640
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,072
so I need to take responsibility.

641
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,242
Stop talking nonsense.

642
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,828
Marriage, my foot.

643
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,956
You like it too, Ms. Yeo!

644
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,876
Ms. Shin Ha-ri?

645
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,879
Chairman Kang wants to see you.

646
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,050
Chairman Kang wants to see me?

647
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,562
I'll be back.

648
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,656
Why did he call her?

649
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,449
Maybe…

650
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,368
Is Ms. Shin getting fired?

651
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,953
Don't say useless things.

652
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,831
Let's just see what happens.

653
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,423
Why did you want to see me, sir?

654
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,927
I want you to go down to the factory
in Daejeon

655
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,055
until this situation dies down.

656
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,265
Dae…

657
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,351
By Daejeon, you mean…

658
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,272
Isn't that our distribution center?

659
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,066
There's nothing
for a researcher to do there.

660
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,651
If you're unhappy with it

661
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,945
then resign.

662
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,363
Re…

663
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,199
Resign?

664
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,578
Has anything else been posted?

665
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,246
No.

666
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,749
Rich people are really scary.
They got rid of all the gossip articles.

667
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,834
SEOUL KANGSUNG HOSPITAL

668
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,463
Do you think that employee
named Shin Ha-ri is still working there?

669
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,132
No way. She must have been fired by now.

670
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,469
There are rumors that she's two-timed
the grandson of the chairman.

671
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,845
They must've fired her.

672
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,140
What are you talking about?

673
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,561
What was that just now?

674
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,023
Where have you--

675
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,357
Why didn't you tell me?

676
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,067
Sir?

677
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,907
-That's--
-You should have…

678
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,659
You should have told me.

679
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,165
Ha-ri must have been suffering
on her own without me.

680
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,210
I didn't even know.

681
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,006
Are you going to the office? You should
wait until the chairman's less angry--

682
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,801
Even after all this time,
I should wait more?

683
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,304
I can't do that.

684
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,245
You need to hear this. Right now--

685
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,288
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

686
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,457
Where's Ms. Shin?

687
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,460
Chairman Kang called her up.

688
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,922
It's been a while since she was called,
but she hasn't come back.

689
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,676
Damn it.

690
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,978
What are you doing here?

691
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,648
What did you talk about with Ha-ri?

692
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,984
I told her I'd send her
to a provincial office.

693
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,402
And I told her to resign

694
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,904
if she wasn't happy with it.

695
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,030
Did you…

696
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,616
Did you have to do this?

697
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,910
You must have heard the rumors, too.

698
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,497
You know what she has done
to this company.

699
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,082
How is that her fault?

700
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,542
It's my fault.

701
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,085
I liked her first

702
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,962
and caused this situation.

703
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,798
I don't think you know
how serious this is.

704
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,717
The board of directors

705
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,762
could ask you to take responsibility
for this situation

706
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,765
and ask you to resign.

707
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,435
If that's what ends up happening,

708
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,314
then I'll take full responsibility,
and resign.

709
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,190
So…

710
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,943
don't do anything to Ha-ri.

711
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,741
Tae-moo!

712
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,247
-Welcome.
-Hello.

713
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,668
-He's not here.
-That young owner isn't here today.

714
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,961
-Young owner?
-Yes.

715
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,338
-Please, sit.
-Sure.

716
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,757
Are you talking about Ha-ri's father?

717
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,800
Honey, come out here for a second.

718
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,926
Why?

719
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,178
What is it?

720
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,137
-Here.
-What is it?

721
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,222
-Oh, my God.
-Not him.

722
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,349
There was…

723
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,978
There was this tall and handsome guy here.

724
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:08,937
Yes.

725
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:09,980
With a young woman.

726
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,274
A young woman and a tall guy?

727
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,193
Are you talking about Ha-ri and Ha-min?

728
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,945
They must be talking about our kids.
They're tall.

729
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,238
I guess so.

730
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,616
There he comes.

731
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,242
The handsome young owner!

732
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,037
You must have been mistaken.

733
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,375
He's my daughter's coworker.

734
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,168
-What?
-His name's Mr. Gye.

735
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,003
But I'm sure he's the guy from before.

736
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,171
Hello. Did you--

737
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,673
Yes, Mr. Gye.

738
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,883
What brings you
to our restaurant at this hour?

739
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,469
Did Ha-ri come back home?

740
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,764
What? Ha-ri went to work.

741
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,723
Yes.

742
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,017
Is she not at work?

743
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:50,979
What? Hey!

744
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,194
-Let's talk for a second.
-Sure.

745
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,658
Sorry about this.
I'll introduce myself properly next time.

746
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,660
Father and Mother.

747
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,870
Okay.

748
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,712
Didn't he just call us Father and Mother?

749
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,131
He did.

750
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,142
Are you telling me to turn in
my letter of resignation, sir?

751
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,436
Yes. Resign,

752
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,606
and leave our company.

753
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,240
I can't…

754
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,660
do that, sir.

755
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,412
What?

756
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,080
I'm not going to resign.

757
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,750
Do you know how hard I've worked
ever since I got hired?

758
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,294
The products I've come up with?

759
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,546
All of them made it
into the top five that year.

760
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,757
My Bucket List Fish made it
into the top three.

761
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,678
On top of that, I'm the youngest person
to ever be awarded the Mega Hit award.

762
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,389
I don't think it makes any sense
for me to resign.

763
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,559
If love is a crime,

764
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,020
then yes, I'm a criminal.

765
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,314
But, resign?

766
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,983
I can't resign, sir!

767
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,614
I shouldn't have said the last bit.

768
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,740
Ha-ri, you idiot!

769
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,242
Why did you have to say that?

770
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,666
She's not picking up.

771
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,710
What's wrong?

772
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,420
It's hard to explain right now.

773
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,299
Could I borrow your cellphone?
I don't have mine right now.

774
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,181
Brother-in-law.

775
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,020
I hope you make up with my sister,
brother-in-law.

776
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,858
How is Mr. Gye your brother-in-law?

777
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,152
-Mom.
-Mother.

778
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:06,198
You referred to us as if
we were your in-laws back there, too.

779
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,700
Are you and Ha-ri…

780
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,160
Dating? Mr. Gye?

781
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,286
Come on, tell us!

782
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:16,208
What's your relationship with Ha-ri?
And why did you come to our house?

783
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,503
-What? Tell me!
-Mother, that's…

784
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,213
Stop calling me like that!

785
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,800
You're damn well over 40 years old.
How could you try to date Ha-ri?

786
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,302
You think you can do that
since you're handsome?

787
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,554
How dare you?

788
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,764
Honey, you can't use violence.

789
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,765
You should go.

790
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,934
-Go where?
-Why?

791
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,644
I'll explain everything later.

792
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,895
Mother and Father.

793
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,522
You're doing again.

794
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,357
Where are you going, Mr. Gye?

795
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,651
-Mr. Gye!
-Mom, listen to me.

796
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,737
That's not Mr. Gye.
That's go food's president, Mr. Kang

797
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,655
What?

798
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,156
What are you talking about?

799
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,784
How can that person be--

800
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,911
I'm being serious!

801
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,539
It's been so hard keeping this a secret.

802
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,542
Our hard-working days are over.
You'll get a rich son-in-law!

803
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,712
What? He's rich?

804
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,672
President?

805
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,966
Rich…

806
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,968
You're so frustrating.

807
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:20,480
HA-MIN'S PHONE
HE DID NOT STEAL IT

808
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,779
Where are you, Ha-ri?

809
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,704
Sung-hoon.

810
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,958
Is this okay? If you don't want
to be here, we can just go.

811
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,211
My father could do
a complete 180 and throw a fit.

812
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,172
-Let's just--
-It's all right.

813
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,052
This is something we need
to go through eventually.

814
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,888
Let's go.

815
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,106
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

816
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,566
A little over a month, sir.

817
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,944
I was worried about my daughter,
so I did some research.

818
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,571
You don't have any parents,

819
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,990
and you grew up
under Chairman Kang, right?

820
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:14,826
Yes, sir.

821
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,995
If you grew up
with Chairman Kang's support,

822
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,749
does that mean you can't leave go food
and can't work at a different company?

823
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,085
-Let's just go, Sung-hoon.
-Young-seo.

824
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,212
-Young-seo.
-I've heard enough of this.

825
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,881
Why would you ask something like that?

826
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,216
What's wrong with it?

827
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,009
He might become my son-in-law.

828
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,554
Son-in-law?

829
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,472
Yes.

830
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,600
You're the only child that I have,
so who knows?

831
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,521
What's so wrong with checking
if my son-in-law could inherit my company?

832
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,776
Are you saying that you approve of
me dating Sung-soon?

833
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,446
If I wasn't going to,
why would I have called him to dinner?

834
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,701
I know.

835
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,371
I know how stubborn and arrogant
I've been.

836
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,501
But I don't want to be on bad terms
with my only daughter anymore.

837
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:11,007
So let's just try to understand each other
a bit more, yeah?

838
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,511
Could you come back home, too?

839
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,142
Young-seo.

840
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,229
Fine.

841
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,190
But I need some time
to think about going back home.

842
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,993
What are you thinking about?

843
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,579
It's just my dad.

844
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,166
You know what they say,
people do weird things before they die.

845
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,586
What if he's sick?

846
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,588
I don't think so.

847
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,716
When something good happens,

848
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,178
you should think about it positively.

849
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,096
Don't think about something bad.

850
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,016
It's just that I've never seen him
like that before.

851
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,396
Sorry, Sung-hoon.

852
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,024
Do you have any tissue?

853
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,692
You don't.

854
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,319
What?

855
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,112
What's this?

856
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,492
It's nothing. Put it back.

857
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,828
It's for me, isn't it?

858
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,122
A ring?

859
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,707
A diamond ring?

860
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,961
Is this for a proposal?

861
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,175
Well, it's your birthday soon.

862
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,093
It's your birthday present.

863
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,263
What? So you're not going to
propose to me?

864
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,351
Well, I will eventually.

865
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,812
But I haven't gotten
your father's approval.

866
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,939
And I don't know how you feel about it.

867
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,857
We got my father's approval today,

868
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,901
and I want to marry you, too.

869
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,486
What?

870
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,363
So…

871
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,365
let's get married.

872
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,915
Sung-hoon.

873
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,571
Do you not want to marry me?

874
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,491
It's not that.

875
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,078
You really need to stop stealing my words.

876
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,344
Will you marry me?

877
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,909
Look at that.
Shin Ha-min left me a voicemail.

878
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,119
My goodness.

879
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,663
Ha-ri, it's me.

880
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,540
Where are you?
Why aren't you picking up my calls?

881
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,877
I've looked everywhere
but I couldn't find you.

882
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,922
Did you hide somewhere
because you're angry at me?

883
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,174
Please call me back.

884
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,568
Ha-ri, where are you?

885
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,278
I'm…

886
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,699
in front of the Christmas Tree?

887
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm at N Seoul Tower.

888
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,414
What are you doing there?

889
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,832
I don't know.

890
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,837
I didn't have anywhere to go,
so I was just walking aimlessly.

891
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,257
Just because?

892
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,592
Don't go anywhere. I'm coming.

893
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,764
Wait--

894
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,555
Do you know how worried I've been?

895
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,778
I'm not a kid.

896
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,532
Never disappear again

897
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,701
without saying anything.

898
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:22,744
