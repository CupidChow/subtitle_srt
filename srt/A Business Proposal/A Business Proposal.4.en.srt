1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,018
-What are you doing?
-Well, I…

2
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,687
-Hey.
-We'll have to delay

3
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,813
the meeting by an hour.

4
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,942
Mr. Go got into a minor car accident
on his way here.

5
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,111
-Really? Delay it, then.
-Yes, sir.

6
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,832
It's because I have a stye on my eye.

7
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,584
Aren't you going to press a floor?

8
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,711
Oh, right.

9
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,596
Let's attend the tasting event
for the new product lineup then.

10
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,514
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,518
The tasting event?

12
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,894
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

13
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,187
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 2

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,230
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 3

15
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,024
Please give us your honest feedback.
Thank you.

16
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,735
-We're Team One.
-We'd really appreciate some feedback.

17
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,487
-Thank you very much.
-Here.

18
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,364
-Please fill out a feedback form.
-Sure.

19
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,032
We're Team One.

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,408
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

21
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,409
Thank you.

22
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,037
-We're Team One.
-Take it easy.

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,958
Chef Lee, you're working so hard
when the other chefs aren't even here.

24
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,461
The other chefs are quite experienced,
but this is a first for me.

25
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,926
We're Team One.
This is white kimchi ravioli.

26
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:15,844
The president is here.

27
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,761
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

28
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,055
-Welcome, President Kang.
-He's so hot!

29
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,348
Thank you all for your hard work.

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,100
President Kang, how are you?

31
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,853
Sir, you should have told us
that you were coming.

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,690
You should always be prepared.

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,905
Sir, Team One is always prepared.
Even our chef is here today.

34
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,365
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

35
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,618
Let me introduce him to you.
This is Chef Lee Min-woo from M Kitchen.

36
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,663
He developed
the white kimchi ravioli with us.

37
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,456
I'm Kang Tae-moo.

38
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,959
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,088
Ta-da!

40
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,798
Is this the white kimchi ravioli?

41
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,757
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,011
Please give it a try, sir.

43
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,989
Chef Lee.

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,742
You don't have a good eye for things.

45
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,659
Pardon?

46
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,828
I heard this was for staff meals.

47
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,789
Why didn't you put something
this delicious on the menu?

48
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,337
That's what you meant?

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,298
That was hilarious, sir.

50
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,342
It was something I had whipped together.

51
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,094
But thanks to Ha-ri,
it's our signature dish now.

52
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,138
Right. I read Ms. Shin's proposal.

53
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,724
I could feel her deep trust in you,
Chef Lee.

54
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,393
The two have been good friends
since college, so…

55
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,811
I think

56
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,190
that's why they worked together so well.

57
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,233
Yes, that's right.

58
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,027
Come to think of it, I don't see Ms. Shin.

59
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,951
Ms. Shin, is your stomach okay?
Do you want me to buy you some medicine?

60
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,621
No, I'm all right now.

61
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,290
Hey, how are people
reacting to our ravioli?

62
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,625
Are they saying it's good?

63
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,049
Nobody's responding to me.

64
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,971
Mr. Kang should have left by now.
Should I go back inside?

65
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,473
Did you see President Kang? He's so hot.

66
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,518
That chef was handsome too.
Was his name Lee Min-woo?

67
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,230
Right. But the white kimchi ravioli?

68
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,399
It was my first time trying it,
but I liked it.

69
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,193
Me too. I think it was
the best dish there.

70
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,328
Your bruise is getting worse.
Do you want something to put on it?

71
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,455
Don't you know me? I'd rather just eat.

72
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,373
I'll be fine.

73
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,044
Oh, right. What are people
saying about the tasting?

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,589
Everyone said the food was good,
but I'm not sure if they meant it.

75
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,467
Trust me. The guys at my company
don't sugarcoat things.

76
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,552
They're really picky.

77
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,388
They say it's perfect, taste-wise.

78
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,517
Now it just needs some fine-tuning
as we commercialize it.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,561
Just leave things to me, Chef Lee.

80
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,981
Then I'll do just that, Ms. Shin.

81
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,900
Oh, right!

82
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,819
Where's your review?

83
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,903
What review?

84
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,490
Of the concert you went to.
Yoo-ra was wondering, too.

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,285
How was it? Did you have fun?

86
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,537
Yes, I had fun.

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,374
Man, I was hoping you would go with a guy.

88
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,667
I bet you went with Young-seo.

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,668
I went with a guy.

90
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,087
Really?

91
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,005
Who?

92
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,718
Just someone I got to know by chance.

93
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,929
You never told me you were seeing someone.

94
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,766
Do you even know what kind of guy he is?

95
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
Yes, well…

96
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,563
You're too naive
to even get a good read on guys.

97
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,190
Bring him with you sometime, will you?

98
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,192
I'll take a look at him for you.

99
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,486
I can take care of myself, Min-woo.

100
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,447
So take care of your girlfriend now,
instead of your friends.

101
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,241
You two got back together
after breaking up.

102
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,826
Pay more attention to her.

103
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,332
Why is Young-seo so late?

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,840
She's so impatient!

105
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,467
I'm here.

106
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,390
He looks a lot like the guy
who lives next door.

107
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,603
Wait!

108
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,022
That is him!

109
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,529
YOUNG-SEO

110
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,619
It's President Kang!

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,079
Sir.

112
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,998
Hello. I didn't know you were coming.

113
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,169
After the tasting event, I was even
more curious about your cooking, Chef Lee.

114
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,338
I'm glad you came, then.

115
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,382
I'll whip up something delicious for you.

116
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,300
Just as expected, this place is popular.

117
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,095
Please, have a seat. This way.

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,059
Oh, right, Ha-ri is here too.

119
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,730
That's weird.

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
She was just here a minute ago.

121
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,026
Why don't you have a seat?

122
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:44,464
You'd get sick of me
If we spent all of our days together

123
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,381
I, too…

124
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,929
Hello.

125
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,556
Where are you, Ha-ri?

126
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,058
Oh, apparently there's a big group
at the chicken shop.

127
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,186
I think Young-seo and I
need to go help out.

128
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,605
Hey!

129
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,274
Okay!

130
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,985
Yes, okay. See you!

131
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,362
Hold on,

132
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,200
so the handsome guy you saw
at the convenience store is Secretary Cha?

133
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,244
-Yes.
-And Mr. Cha lives right next door?

134
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,496
Yes.

135
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,750
-Just how do you meet someone like that?
-That's what I'm saying.

136
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,961
Hey, you don't think
I'll run into him here too, do you?

137
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,550
This is driving me nuts.

138
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,304
Just, don't even think about
coming to my apartment for the time being.

139
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,264
Or dress up as Shin Geum-hui if you do.

140
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,557
It's you who needs to be careful.

141
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:41,187
Don't get all friendly with him and blab
that Shin Ha-ri is actually Shin Geum-hui.

142
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,774
I don't think I'll talk to him again.

143
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,859
So don't worry about that.

144
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,152
-Why?
-Well…

145
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,114
You know how Tae-moo's family and mine are
on bad terms because of the blind date?

146
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,868
So he said he doesn't want to
get involved with me, either.

147
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,246
-What?
-Seriously!

148
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,082
He definitely liked me at first.

149
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,209
No, really!

150
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,503
Hey. You don't believe me?

151
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,340
Wait, what if Tae-moo bad-mouthed me

152
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,093
and told Mr. Cha to avoid me
because I'm completely nuts?

153
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,886
That petty archaeopteryx.

154
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,932
No, no. I don't think President Kang is
the type to talk badly about other people.

155
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,976
He looks a bit cold-hearted,

156
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,937
but he has a considerate side to him too.

157
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,482
Why are you taking Kang Tae-moo's side?
That's suspicious.

158
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,942
It's not. It's just--

159
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,696
You and this supposedly fake relationship,
yet you even went to a concert together.

160
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,905
Have you fallen for him?

161
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,948
It's not like that.

162
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,534
It's just, I didn't know
when I saw him from a distance,

163
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:40,454
but now that I've seen him up-close,
you know, he's not that bad.

164
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,373
You know, that's all it is…

165
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,583
Really?

166
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,294
-Is that really all there is to it?
-Yes!

167
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,878
That's enough. Let's just order.

168
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,634
-How was your meal?
-I think I know now.

169
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,555
Why Ms. Shin says your food
tastes cheerful and happy, Chef Lee.

170
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,764
I agree.

171
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,225
Thank you. Ha-ri is always
generous with my food.

172
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,643
You're college friends, right?

173
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,938
We met when we were 20,
so we've known each other for 7 years now.

174
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,442
And you've been just friends
this whole time?

175
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,360
Excuse me?

176
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,030
Oh. I apologize
if my question was too personal.

177
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,907
I just thought maybe one of you
could have developed feelings

178
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,827
since you've known each other
for such a long time.

179
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,049
I have no regrets, though.

180
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,300
I was really happy…

181
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,553
for those seven years.

182
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,888
Seven years, huh?

183
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,600
Sir, when you asked Chef Lee
about his relationship with Ms. Shin,

184
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,435
was it because of something you heard?

185
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,686
What do you mean?

186
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,772
I overheard some of the employees talking,

187
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,149
and apparently,
Ms. Shin had a crush on Chef Lee.

188
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,233
Is that so?

189
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,448
I guess there's someone else
like Ms. Shin Geum-hui too.

190
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,171
What now?

191
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,632
Did he just avoid me?

192
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,428
Excuse me!

193
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,138
Wait a second.

194
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,436
Am I a virus or something?
Why are you avoiding me?

195
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,314
You don't even want to take
the same elevator as me now?

196
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,524
-It's not--
-I mean.

197
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,984
how could you so openly avoid me?

198
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,987
-Do you not have any manners?
-I wasn't avoiding you.

199
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,365
It was because of this.

200
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,164
I thought you might be bothered
by the smell of the trash.

201
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,543
I was mistaken, then. I'm sorry.

202
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,545
Well, then.

203
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,921
Wait a second.

204
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,341
It's true that what I did
to President Kang was wrong.

205
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,884
That's why I apologized to him.

206
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,639
But that's between Mr. Kang and me.
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

207
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,518
Since we're already in this position,
even if we can't be friends,

208
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,604
can't we be cool and say hi
when we run into each other?

209
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,111
I'm sorry.
I've never been a "cool" person.

210
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,995
He's stomping on my pride.

211
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,541
Is he President Kang's younger brother
or something?

212
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,543
Why is he so damn loyal?

213
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,721
Yes, sir, I've just arrived.
I'll go right up. Yes, sir.

214
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,213
TRUE LIGHT FOUNDATION FOR SOCIAL WELFARE
TRUE LIGHT CHILDREN'S HOME

215
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,969
What are you doing here?

216
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,846
Just looking.

217
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,224
You've left this place exactly as it was.

218
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,934
Of course.

219
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,812
My grandfather really
wants you to move back in.

220
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,857
So do I. Are you really not going to?

221
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,568
No, never.

222
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,654
I don't want to suffer
when I'm at home too.

223
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,573
Suffer?

224
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,241
Hey, what have I ever done to you?

225
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:35,249
How long has it been
since we all ate together like this?

226
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,710
This place finally feels like a home.

227
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,711
It really does.

228
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,087
Right?

229
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,341
Now, if I just had a granddaughter-in-law
like Ms. Geum-hui

230
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,052
along with some adorable
great-grandchildren,

231
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,015
I'd die a happy man
even if I died tomorrow.

232
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,642
You've been saying that
ever since I turned 20.

233
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,768
Aren't you tired of it?

234
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,396
What's the point of being superrich?

235
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,817
All I ever do is eat by myself
in this empty house like a lonely old man.

236
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,777
Don't you know eating alone
is trendy these days?

237
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,071
That's why our products are selling well.

238
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,574
You always have to have the last word.

239
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,619
Either get married by the year's end,

240
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,663
or we're all eating here together
twice a week.

241
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,460
Grandfather, twice a week is too much. My…

242
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,047
My schedule is packed and…

243
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,219
And my place is far away, too.

244
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,931
I was so tired when I got up this morning.

245
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:38,395
Now that you mention it,
move back in, Sung-hoon.

246
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:43,901
Look at you. You moved out
the minute you graduated from college.

247
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:48,322
Now you're acting like even having
a meal together is something so difficult.

248
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,658
And you call yourselves my grandsons?

249
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,078
How's my schedule this week?

250
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,335
You're free Friday morning.
Should we schedule our next meal then?

251
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,462
Hey, let me look at that.

252
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,636
Tae-moo, do you know
what day this Saturday is?

253
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,222
-What? This Saturday?
-Yes!

254
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,936
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

255
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,356
I can't believe you forgot, you punk.

256
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,441
How could you forget a day like that?

257
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,777
Look!

258
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,822
29TH
SATURDAY

259
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,992
PRESIDENT KANG AND MS. SHIN GEUM-HUI'S
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

260
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,082
Will you only come to your senses
after Geum-hui dumps you again?

261
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,668
How can you forget a one-year anniversary?

262
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
You bastard. You little brat.

263
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:51,343
Look at you, I bet you'd even forget to
show up at my funeral.

264
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,595
How could you say something like that?

265
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,055
It's not that I forgot--

266
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,473
Then?

267
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,767
Why did you schedule something else
on that day?

268
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,353
I told you, that's…

269
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,479
Cancel everything.

270
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,608
Cancel everything and schedule
a date with Ms. Geum-hui.

271
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
I'll make a reservation for you.

272
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,196
Go on, you.

273
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,288
Manager Oh! It's me, Da-goo.

274
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,667
I'm sorry. I had marked it on the calendar
just in case the chairman asked.

275
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,879
What should we do?
Your schedule that day is tight.

276
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,216
No, we can always move things around.

277
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,223
He's okay with changing his schedule?

278
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,233
NAMHAE

279
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,739
Gosh, what are you doing?

280
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,325
That's like putting lipstick on a pig.

281
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,786
It might not make me more handsome,

282
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,246
but at least
I can make myself look average.

283
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,125
They're filming
the entire research process

284
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,419
to upload it
on the company's nertube account.

285
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,923
This is the least I can do,
don't you think?

286
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,469
Maybe I should have gotten
my hair and makeup done too.

287
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,678
It's fine.

288
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,305
They'll be mainly focused on the chefs.

289
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,475
Researchers like us
will barely be in the shot.

290
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,982
We're here. Let's all get off the bus.

291
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,109
Let's get off.

292
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,777
Okay.

293
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,737
Move.

294
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,533
-That way.
-Okay.

295
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,867
Thank you.

296
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,370
Gosh, I'm nervous.

297
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,790
This is so nice.

298
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,752
Thank you.

299
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,045
What's with all the bags?

300
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,380
This way.

301
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,090
Oh, this looks like a nice spot.

302
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,550
Here.

303
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,888
-You can put those bags here.
-Oh, sure.

304
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:05,185
Can you check that we packed
the right number of lab coats?

305
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,774
There's no view quite like this
in all the eight provinces of Korea.

306
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,026
It's perfect for de-stressing.

307
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,405
For sure. You have this sweeping farmland,

308
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,199
with those vast mountains as a backdrop,
and the ocean beyond that.

309
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,661
It's a shame that we don't have
anyone else to share this view with.

310
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:26,081
Stop beating around the bush
and give it to me straight.

311
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,457
What are you saying?

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,670
Chairman Kang, why don't we just bulldoze
all of this and build a resort here?

313
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,216
A resort?

314
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,426
Look at the land here.

315
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,554
All we're doing with it
is commercial farming.

316
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,140
Imagine a golf course here

317
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,975
and a ski resort
by the mountains over there.

318
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,978
We could fill the whole place up
with our subsidiary franchises.

319
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,189
Wouldn't that be something?

320
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,775
Why is that idea skipping over
President Kang and coming straight to me?

321
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,696
We submitted a business proposal,
but he shot it down almost immediately.

322
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,698
Is that so?

323
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,618
President Kang is still young
and inexperienced,

324
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,287
so he can't make
a bold move like you'd do.

325
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,040
He's not interested in long-term plans
with guaranteed profits like this.

326
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,959
All he does is play house with his chefs.

327
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,421
So, if you were to directly suggest, sir--

328
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,592
You! Do you want President Kang
to fire you too?

329
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,801
Sir?

330
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,806
You've been buying
the land here bit by bit.

331
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,558
Didn't you think I'd know?

332
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,770
Chairman Kang, that's not--

333
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,105
It seems to me
like you're trying to make a buck

334
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,441
by raising the real estate
prices around here.

335
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,652
Stop it with your ridiculous ideas

336
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,822
and just support President Kang
as he plays house!

337
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,660
Chairman Kang,
this is all a misunderstanding.

338
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,707
All they ever do is try to find ways
to fill their own pockets.

339
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,130
Hold on. Stop the car.

340
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,051
Here are the premium ingredients…

341
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:09,768
That go food product researchers
have picked from the farm themselves…

342
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:16,400
To present to the chef!

343
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,651
Oh wait, it's that way.

344
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,320
Cut!

345
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,447
-Hey, Jeong-hwan.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,949
-Jeong-hwan!
-Yes, I'm coming!

347
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,576
What's with the actor?

348
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,412
Wasn't I quite good?

349
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,122
-It was a bit awkward.
-Okay.

350
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,581
Do I need to put more into it?

351
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,335
How can you mess up a line
this short, over ten times?

352
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,880
What was the point of the makeup?
Your acting is still crap.

353
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,302
It's just because I'm camera shy.

354
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,095
Are you taking more calming pills?

355
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,014
He knows that's not candy, right?

356
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,351
If Ms. Shin's eye wasn't like that,
we would have switched you out right away.

357
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,939
Whatever! It's not like
we're filming an epic here.

358
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,026
I can take care of myself,
so don't you worry about a thing!

359
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,695
Don't say such stupid things!

360
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,780
All right, everybody. Stand by, please.

361
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,532
-Okay!
-Okay.

362
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,117
Oh, Ms. Shin.

363
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,452
Do it right!

364
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,330
Am I that bad?

365
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,540
-You got this.
-Yes, I got this.

366
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,833
Let's do it, everybody!

367
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,294
Ready, and cue!

368
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,005
Here are the premium ingredients…

369
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,093
That go food researchers
picked from the farm themselves…

370
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,308
To present to the chef!

371
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,155
-Chairman Kang.
-Chairman Kang!

372
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,033
-You're all working hard, I see.
-Chairman Kang!

373
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,118
My gosh!

374
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,286
Be careful, there.

375
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,414
Oh, here it is. Here it is.

376
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,416
Oh, come on.

377
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,544
Why did this thing get bigger?

378
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,255
Thank you.

379
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,173
Sure.

380
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,509
-Thank you.
-I'll have the chamomile.

381
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,511
Chamomile is perfect for this setting.

382
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,721
-I hope you enjoy it.
-Thank you.

383
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,935
Why did he have to drive past
our shooting location?

384
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,603
He won't recognize me, will he?

385
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,443
It's my first time
seeing the chairman this close.

386
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,695
So Ms. Yeo and Chairman Kang are close?

387
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,617
No, they're not close at all.
She's barely seen him this close-up.

388
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,329
Sucking up is all part of the job,
you know.

389
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:38,667
It's difficult to work with President Kang
because he's quite strict, isn't it?

390
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,836
Not at all.
Since he knows the entire process

391
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,838
from the ground up better than anyone,

392
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,215
communication is smooth,
and it's more rewarding.

393
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,092
You don't say?

394
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,639
What?

395
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,059
By the way,

396
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,896
what's this weird noise
I've been hearing for a while now?

397
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,481
Oh, I think you're right.

398
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,858
What a weird noise.

399
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:13,243
Hey, it looks like
somebody left their phone here.

400
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,746
Oh, I think this belongs
to our employee, Ms. Shin.

401
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,081
Oh, really?

402
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,208
Ms. Shin!

403
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,919
Ms. Shin!

404
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,963
-Me?
-Yes.

405
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,924
-What for?
-Come on, quickly.

406
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,886
What?

407
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,640
Come.

408
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,976
You called for me?

409
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,896
Ms. Shin, I think this phone
belongs to you.

410
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,982
Oh, my. Yes, that's mine. Thank you.

411
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,443
Hold on, I think somebody's calling.

412
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,454
"Archaeopteryx?"

413
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,372
ARCHAEOPTERYX

414
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,416
Oh, no!

415
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,961
I'll give it to you
if there's any leftover.

416
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,965
What's wrong with her?
She didn't even thank me.

417
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,719
Come on.

418
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,932
Why did he have to
pick the worst time to call me?

419
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,061
Why aren't you picking up?
It's an emergency, so call me back.

420
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,313
The situation here
is much more of an emergency!

421
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,441
Where am I?

422
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,359
RESTROOM

423
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,568
Oh, the bathroom!

424
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,664
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

425
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,056
Hello.

426
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,975
What emergency? What's going on?

427
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,811
Never mind that. Why didn't you pick up?

428
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,273
It's against company policy
to be on our phones during work hours.

429
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,692
What? What kind of company does that?

430
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,485
Anyway, what is this about?

431
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,280
Would it kill you
to exchange pleasantries first?

432
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,865
How have you been?
How's your eye doing? And so on.

433
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,078
Oh, sorry. I just have a lot
going on at the moment.

434
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,038
My eye is fine.

435
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,958
Do you know what day this Saturday is?

436
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,668
This Saturday?

437
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,836
Saturday?

438
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,046
Isn't that our fake one-year anniversary?

439
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,427
You're better than me.
I'd forgotten about it.

440
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,430
Well, I've always been good
at memorizing stuff, you know.

441
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,265
What about it, though?

442
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,059
My grandfather found out,
so things got a bit complicated.

443
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,063
Your grandfather?

444
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,983
Do you want to

445
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,360
meet for dinner today?

446
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,281
Oh, but I'm on a business trip right now.

447
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,450
A business trip?

448
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,411
Yes, they scheduled it last minute.

449
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,121
That's a shame then.

450
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,957
Oh, and it turns out
that song is rather popular.

451
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,251
What song?

452
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,545
The song that you've set
as your ringback tone.

453
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,465
I've been hearing it
play all over the place.

454
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,469
I'll call you tomorrow, then.

455
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,595
Okay.

456
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,561
What company bans people
from picking up their phones

457
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,439
and sends an employee with an injured eye
on a business trip?

458
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,490
Sir, are you feeling all right?
You're sweating all of a sudden.

459
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,658
No, it's…

460
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,328
My stomach is…

461
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,207
Oh, maybe it's because
you suddenly had cold food. I can…

462
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,667
I'll get you something warm.

463
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,420
Well, instead of that

464
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,673
I just want to go to the bathroom.

465
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,093
My goodness.

466
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,137
Hello, sir.

467
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,766
It's an honor to have you here, sir.

468
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,228
I woke up this morning
knowing today would be “eye-opening.”

469
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,563
"Eye-opening"?

470
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,191
Oh, man, my stomach.

471
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,485
Yes, sir! “Waking up” is “eye-opening.”

472
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,363
"Eye-opening…"

473
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:23,368
You've been a big inspiration to me, sir!
I used to be afraid of hurdles in life,

474
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,912
but I “got over” them! Salute!

475
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,542
You're a bit young to be making
dad jokes. Even I don't do those.

476
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,460
God, my stomach.

477
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,212
If you thought this was the end,

478
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,880
you're wrong!

479
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,465
Wrong.

480
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,093
Listen, my stomach hurts.

481
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,056
I have a few more jokes about

482
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,602
how I'm not unemployed thanks to you, sir,

483
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,563
but none of them "work"!

484
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,773
Oh, my stomach.

485
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,193
Hey, I've got a joke about construction,
but I'm still "working on it."

486
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,155
Where can I find a bathroom around here?

487
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,034
So my ringback tone was still that song?

488
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,870
I'd forgotten about it.

489
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,664
But how do I cancel this?

490
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,499
-Oh, man.
-Right this way, sir.

491
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,752
Why is it so far?

492
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,919
Here…

493
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,839
Wait! One second, sir.

494
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,968
Ms. Shin! That's you in there, right?

495
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,221
I saw you running over here.
Make it quick and come out, okay?

496
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,098
Okay, I'm coming out.

497
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,268
Okay. Sir, your bathroom is ready.

498
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,771
Then good luck with your number two, sir.

499
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,730
To healthy bowels!

500
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,281
Hey, look here.
Why did you go back inside?

501
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,242
-Hey!
-What do I do?

502
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,163
For God's sake. There's only one stall.

503
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,540
-What do I do? Oh, my stomach.
-Damn it.

504
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,043
This is bad.

505
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,922
Hey, I really need to go.

506
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,216
Could you hurry up a bit?

507
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,217
Look here!

508
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,845
Jeez, at least give me an answer!

509
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,639
What do I do?

510
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,393
This won't do.

511
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,189
-One, two, three!
-Two, three!

512
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,625
Oh, no!

513
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,836
God, it's so cold!

514
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,258
-Chairman Kang!
-Why didn't you come out sooner?

515
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,552
Are you all right, Mr. Kang?

516
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,679
-What's this noise…
-It's so cold!

517
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,138
Chairman Kang!

518
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,141
Sir! How did you end up like this, sir?

519
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,270
-How did this happen?
-It's so cold.

520
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,315
This way.

521
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,109
This way, sir.

522
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,739
I might as well be
wearing shorts right now.

523
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,032
It's cold.

524
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:08,950
I'm sorry, sir.

525
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,285
Oh, my.

526
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,791
It's fine.

527
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,420
I'm so sorry, Chairman. Please forgive us.

528
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,754
There's no need for that.

529
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,715
Good luck with the rest of the shoot.

530
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,216
Well, then.

531
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,265
Let's go.

532
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,391
Yes, sir.

533
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,522
-Take care.
-Yes, sir.

534
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,565
Goodbye, sir.

535
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,566
Take care.

536
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,650
Yes, sir!

537
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,446
I hope your new pants are comfortable!
I'm Associate Director Gye!

538
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,038
Ms. Shin, you should have been
more careful!

539
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,164
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,375
-Be careful yourself, Mr. Gye.
-What do you mean?

541
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,502
I think you're revealing
too much of yourself.

542
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,133
Before launching
"A Collaboration With the Chef,"

543
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,678
we are planning to put together videos
of interviews with the chefs

544
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,307
alongside the manufacturing process and
upload it to our social media platforms.

545
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,517
It's the researchers' shoot today, right?

546
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,852
Yes, sir.

547
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,356
We received a portion of the footage.
Would you like to take a look?

548
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,441
Sure.

549
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,199
Here are the premium ingredients…

550
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,204
That go food researchers
picked from the farm themselves…

551
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,919
To present to the chef!

552
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,967
Would you like to watch
some behind-the-scenes footage as well?

553
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,388
To present to the chef!

554
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,935
That was good. Let's do another take.

555
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,439
Ms. Shin, you don't need to keep
catching the cabbage.

556
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,733
I don't want it to fall and go bad.

557
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,569
A food researcher
should care about the ingredients.

558
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,197
We should use
this behind-the-scenes video.

559
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,032
Yes, I will, sir.

560
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,326
Come on, get it right!

561
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,870
Yes, sir.

562
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,664
Let's go again!

563
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,374
What?

564
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,593
Excuse me.

565
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,430
That's my mailbox.

566
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:40,101
Oh, hello. I live in unit 622.

567
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,479
I took your mail by mistake.

568
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,732
I'M SORRY
I TOOK YOUR MAIL BY MISTAKE

569
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,944
Sorry. If you're offended, I apologize.

570
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,070
No, it's okay.

571
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,576
It's human to make mistakes sometimes.

572
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,661
You apologized, so it's fine.

573
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,747
Because I'm cool like that.

574
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you for understanding.

575
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,795
-You moved here just recently, didn't you?
-Yes, how did you know?

576
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,007
Oh, I saw your furniture going in,

577
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,259
and you have a great taste in furniture.

578
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,595
You must like vintage products.

579
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,430
Oh, yes, well…

580
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:21,392
I'm actually a furniture designer,
so I couldn't help but take a peek.

581
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,520
You can tell a lot about a person
by looking at their furniture.

582
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,314
You're a designer?

583
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,151
After meeting like this,
let's not be strangers.

584
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,862
Sure. I can always say hi to my neighbors.

585
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,375
Look at that inconsiderate bastard.

586
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,212
Even with his grandfather in this state.

587
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:53,132
The hospital says you need to watch out
for just one thing.

588
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,718
What? What is it? What's wrong with me?

589
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,055
-The fact you're a hypochondriac.
-You little!

590
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,725
Even the CT scan says you're just fine.
Why are you being a crybaby?

591
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,393
I am not!

592
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,480
Do you know how hard I fell

593
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,483
because Shin Ha-ri, or Shin Na-ri,
or whatever her name is,

594
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,319
didn't bother to catch an old man
as he was falling over?

595
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:17,824
I'm sure Ms. Shin didn't do it on purpose.
I like her. She's good at her job.

596
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,992
Why would you like her?

597
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:24,580
Her hair was all messed up like this,
like she was a ghost or something.

598
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,165
That was a wig, right?

599
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,626
Anyway, I don't like her.

600
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,336
Is she shy?

601
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,965
But our Geum-hui is totally different,
isn't she?

602
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,051
She's around her age,
but look how bright and quick she is.

603
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,178
How nice is that?

604
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,807
Where should we send
the medicine that you requested, sir?

605
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,852
Oh, yes, about that…

606
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,021
What's Geum-hui's address?

607
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,274
What?

608
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,914
-Hello?
-Are you back from your business trip?

609
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,709
Oh, yes. I just got back home.

610
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,588
That's good. I'm in front of your house.
Can I see you for a moment?

611
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,174
You're in front of my house? Wait, why…

612
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,886
Where?

613
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,306
I have something for you.
It won't take long.

614
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,479
I'm so sorry, but I don't think
I can go out right now.

615
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,564
Really?

616
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,983
Then should I leave it at the shop?

617
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,193
At the shop?

618
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,070
No! Don't do that.

619
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,414
Did you wait long?

620
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,834
Who…

621
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,759
No. But what are you wearing?

622
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,803
This? I told my family
that I was going on a delivery.

623
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,514
In case they ask me
who I was going to meet.

624
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,184
I can't tell them
I'm meeting my fake boyfriend.

625
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,143
1. TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT

626
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,186
2. THERE ISN'T ANYONE
WHO RECOGNIZES ME, RIGHT?

627
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,187
3. MAN… THIS IS EMBARRASSING…

628
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,230
4. I'M IN SUCH A PICKLE…

629
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,232
Sorry, I didn't think that through.

630
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,651
I just wanted to give this to you.

631
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,072
What is this?

632
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,242
My grandpa went to a clinic
and ordered this special tonic.

633
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,785
Was he injured that badly?

634
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,078
What?

635
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,291
How did you know that he was injured?

636
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,711
GRANDPA, PAIN, CLINIC, TONIC

637
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,005
What? Well, I mean…

638
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,970
You said that he went to a clinic,
so I thought that maybe he got hurt?

639
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,641
He had a light fall,
but he tends to overreact.

640
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,352
Oh, okay.
Please tell him thank you for me.

641
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,147
And…

642
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:01,153
I picked up some ointment on the way here.
It's supposed to be good for bruises.

643
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,071
Use this.

644
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,035
Oh, you really didn't have to do this.

645
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,953
IS HE WORRIED ABOUT ME?

646
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,246
Thank you.

647
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,290
Oh, wait, I have something too!

648
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,294
Here.

649
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,129
Fried chicken?

650
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,924
I couldn't come out to deliver chicken
without bringing chicken, right?

651
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,551
Go eat it with your grandfather.

652
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,136
Our chicken is really good.

653
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,432
They're looking for me back at the store.

654
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,393
I'm going to go, then.
I'll see you this weekend.

655
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,369
Oh, my. Look at all this.

656
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,665
I thought he was just cold.

657
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,667
OINTMENT

658
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,961
But he has a sweet side to him too.

659
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,472
I went to see her face
to check if her bruise was okay.

660
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,765
What?

661
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,809
Why do I care if he's sweet or not?

662
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,019
Whatever.

663
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,486
Stop it!

664
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,514
Your eye looks completely healed now.

665
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,767
Oh, yeah. The ointment that you gave me
was really effective.

666
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,018
That's good to hear.

667
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,646
But where are we going right now?

668
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,857
It is our one-year anniversary after all,
so somewhere nice.

669
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,078
BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI

670
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,329
Are you stupid, Geum-hui?

671
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,373
Do you not have a mouth?

672
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,292
Why can't you just say
that I'm the man you love?

673
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,255
How can I say that
looking like this, Gwang-bok?

674
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,717
I want to buy all of this,
from here to here.

675
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,887
How much? How much do you need?

676
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,891
Hey, you have those clothes too, honey.

677
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,268
What do you mean?

678
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,770
Why would you display
clothes that are out of stock?

679
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,108
I'm right! The clothes that I bought you.

680
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,569
It's exactly what Geum-hui is wearing!

681
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,155
Anyway, that TV show makes no sense.

682
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,657
What kind of rich guy
buys his girlfriend a t-shirt

683
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,950
that's only 15,000 won?

684
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,660
That's all just advertisements.

685
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,122
They just film the show at any store
that's willing to sponsor them.

686
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,415
Young-seo said so.

687
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,460
Anyway, Geum-hui is so lucky.

688
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,337
Gwang-bok buys her
the entire store and everything.

689
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,424
I heard that Man-sik,
the guy who used to follow me around,

690
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,551
runs his own company now.

691
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,849
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,478
If only I had hidden
my love for you back then,

693
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,481
you wouldn't be living like this.

694
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,905
By the way, where did Ha-ri go again?

695
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,657
She's been going out every weekend.

696
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,911
-Maybe she's dating someone.
-Dating, my ass.

697
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,287
It's obvious.

698
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,372
She's probably with Young-seo,

699
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,625
chatting away and acting all pitiful.

700
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,257
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

701
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,386
This way, please.

702
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,735
It smells really good.

703
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,338
Let's see this, this,
and everything from here to here.

704
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,506
Yes, sir.

705
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,222
What's with the cliché lines and vibe?

706
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,266
I think you've seen way too many TV shows.

707
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,726
Not me. It's my grandfather
who's seen too many.

708
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,936
What?

709
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,272
If we don't do this, he'll hear about it.

710
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,150
So do your best.
As if this is real, not fake.

711
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,706
Can you try on another one?

712
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,304
-We'll take a look at this one, too.
-Yes, sir.

713
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,850
How about this skirt?

714
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,212
I like this one.
What do you think, Geum-hui?

715
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,422
I like it too.

716
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:58,302
You have an excellent eye, sir.
Let me help you with your payment.

717
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,557
Do you have a bigger size?
I can't zip this up.

718
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,018
This is the only piece
in the country right now.

719
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,856
I'd say this fits very well, ma'am.

720
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:11,774
Really?

721
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:19,490
It's so damn expensive,
yet so damn stingy with the fabric.

722
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,159
I have a bad feeling about this.

723
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,203
Shall we go?

724
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,384
Ms. Jo! It's been so long
since we last saw you!

725
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,012
I need a dress to wear
to the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

726
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,722
Then why don't you take your time--

727
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,849
Never mind that.

728
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,977
Kim Se-jeong.

729
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:53,190
The dress that actress wore to
the press conference for her new show.

730
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,652
Only one of them has been imported
to South Korea.

731
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,653
Where is it?

732
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,488
I'm afraid it was just sold.

733
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,198
To who?

734
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,450
Over there…

735
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,542
Thank you.

736
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,876
That's Kang Tae-moo.

737
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,633
Who's the girl next to him?

738
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:34,148
Protect your skin
before time leaves a mark.

739
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,358
That was good.

740
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,820
Sir, let us touch up her hair and makeup
before the next shot.

741
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,613
Let's do that.

742
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,573
Could you…

743
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,119
Could you touch up her hair
and blot some of the oil from her face?

744
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,328
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thanks.

745
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,540
Hello, my babies.

746
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,712
Ms. Jin.

747
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:03,552
-Aren't you going to greet your director?
-Oh, Director Jo, I'm sorry.

748
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,304
I didn't recognize you

749
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:09,266
because your face changes so much
every time I see you.

750
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,519
Did you touch up your forehead this time?

751
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,481
What do you mean?
I didn't "touch up" anything!

752
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,984
Don't you know that
I am a natural-born beauty?

753
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,861
Yu-jeong, if you're…

754
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,198
I mean, Director Jo,
if you're a natural-born beauty,

755
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,742
then is ramyeon an organic, superfood?

756
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,619
-Hey!
-What?

757
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,954
-Ma'am.
-Fine.

758
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,667
You seem to think you can act up
because of your dad.

759
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,503
But at work, I'm your boss.

760
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,297
I won't go easy on you
just because you're my cousin.

761
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,509
Then again…

762
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,636
I'll be the bigger person.

763
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:50,641
You must be so stressed
because you were rejected by Kang Tae-moo.

764
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,520
What did you just say?

765
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,688
Kang Tae-moo.

766
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,149
Apparently, he has a girlfriend.

767
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,110
Her hair and eye makeup were stunning.

768
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,530
She was so much prettier than you.

769
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,449
I just saw them shopping at a boutique.

770
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,618
with my very own eyes.

771
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,287
Goodness, Director Jo!

772
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,790
Your employees are working
hard on the weekend

773
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,959
to shoot this commercial,

774
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:20,921
but you went shopping?
When you should be setting an example?

775
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,800
No.

776
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,386
No, that's not what I…

777
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,014
I just stopped by
to dress properly as a director.

778
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,228
For directors,
working hard is more important

779
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,729
than going shopping.

780
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,190
Also, if you have the time to go shopping,

781
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,943
maybe you should go to
the dermatologist too.

782
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,320
Look at all those wrinkles
around your eyes!

783
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,530
They look like noodles.

784
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,158
Hey! Where do you see any wrinkles
on my face, huh?

785
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,453
You should really go to the dermatologist.

786
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:59,126
It sounds like you're also
working hard today, Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

787
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,419
I'm sorry, Ha-ri.

788
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,636
That's a sample.

789
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,477
This is grilled sea bass
and anchovy salad.

790
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,981
It's been garnished with lotus root,
asparagus, and arugula puree. Enjoy.

791
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,902
It smells so good, doesn't it?

792
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,744
You must come here often.

793
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,622
The chef and the staff
all seem to recognize you.

794
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,333
You came with a girlfriend, right?

795
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,213
Would you take your boyfriend to
the chicken shop run by your own parents?

796
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,174
When they'd ask endless questions?

797
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,426
What are you talking about?

798
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,928
My grandfather owns this restaurant.

799
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,472
Chairman Kang Da-goo?

800
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,224
Well, the chef that you just saw
is the owner on paper.

801
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,194
This dish tastes quite familiar.

802
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,032
That dish was developed
at this restaurant, so I doubt it.

803
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,159
You know,
anchovies are fermented fish too.

804
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,703
Maybe it's because this is
pretty similar to jeotgal?

805
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,831
It tastes a bit like fresh kimchi!

806
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,794
You have a very accurate palate, Ms. Shin.

807
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,711
What?

808
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,838
Actually, I made this myself.

809
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,800
Really?

810
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,637
I've been planning
to make kimchi more localized.

811
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,098
In a country that doesn't have cabbage,

812
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,768
you could make kimchi with the most
popular vegetable of that country.

813
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,479
For example, making kimchi with cilantro
in Southeast Asia,

814
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,981
since that's popular there.

815
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,859
Or you could use anchovies
instead of fish sauce.

816
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,112
It's the same fishy taste,

817
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,115
but foreigners are more used
to the taste of anchovies.

818
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,372
I'm sorry. I'm boring you
with all this work talk, aren't I?

819
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,834
No, I'm enjoying it.
I'm always interested in food.

820
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,422
The food's going to get cold.

821
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:09,923
Let's eat.

822
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:10,924
Okay.

823
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,855
It sure is nice to have a gym
right in front of my place.

824
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,482
It's so big!

825
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,110
Let's get started then.

826
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,034
Hello.

827
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,580
Oh, right.

828
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,750
You said that you don't even
want to say hi to me, right?

829
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,919
I'll just cancel that "hello," then.
Just pretend it never happened.

830
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,464
You can use it first.

831
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,346
That's not what I wanted.

832
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,516
Oh, are you here to work out?

833
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,602
Oh, hello.

834
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,026
-All right, one second.
-Yes?

835
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,068
It's good,

836
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,863
but straighten your back a little bit.

837
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,657
Breathe out as you lower it.

838
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,952
Okay, let's raise it slowly now.

839
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,078
-Slowly?
-Yes.

840
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,790
He's handsome and has good manners.

841
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,751
And above all,
he's obviously interested in me.

842
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,962
But I'm just not feeling anything.

843
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,637
That one has no manners
and is super annoying,

844
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,139
and on top of that,
he has zero interest in me.

845
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,560
But look at that.

846
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,188
That's making me feel
a whole lot of different things.

847
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,233
He's totally my type.

848
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,112
You're a really good teacher.
No, I'm all right.

849
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,160
Hello.

850
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,704
Hey, what time is it?

851
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,832
I don't know. My phone's in my locker.

852
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,124
It's seven past eight.

853
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,585
Look over there.

854
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,507
Oh, thank you.

855
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,849
Why is someone who can see just fine
wearing glasses?

856
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,725
Here, take this.

857
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,520
What is it?

858
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,938
It's a standing lamp.

859
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,316
I wanted to apologize
for taking your mail last time.

860
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,986
No, it's okay. You didn't have to.

861
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:39,072
This is actually
something I designed myself.

862
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,950
You can just give me
some feedback in return,

863
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,410
so don't think too much of it.

864
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,662
You really didn't have to.

865
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,622
Thank you.

866
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,756
Why is this dress so tight?

867
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,884
I didn't even get to eat properly.

868
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,453
Crap, seriously?

869
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,633
Congratulations on
your one-year anniversary.

870
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,513
Thank you all for congratulating us.

871
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,226
Ms. Shin, shall we
blow out the candle together?

872
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,312
Sure.

873
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,649
One, two, three.

874
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,998
Come on, stop it. What's so funny?

875
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,541
Oh, sorry.

876
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,002
I've never seen clothes rip like that.

877
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,382
I told you, the issue is
with the clothes, not me.

878
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,093
How is this a small?
These are like kids' clothes.

879
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,679
The sizing of women's clothing is
problematic nowadays.

880
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,308
Great, now my heels are acting up?

881
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,247
Be careful.

882
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,595
Thank you.

883
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,948
I've never seen
the fireworks at Han River before.

884
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,722
I didn't realize when I watched it on TV,

885
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,974
but it's really pretty.

886
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,976
Isn't it?

887
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,227
Yes.

888
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,732
Very pretty.

889
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,796
Don't you have to tell your grandfather
about our date tonight?

890
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,091
Don't worry. Manager Oh probably
already told him all about it.

891
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,136
What do we do about this?

892
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,930
You can't even get a refund
because it's ripped.

893
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,182
It's a fake anniversary,
but it's still a gift.

894
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,642
Of course, I won't ask you to pay for it.

895
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,275
I had fun
on our fake anniversary date tonight.

896
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,777
I had fun too

897
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,362
on our anniversary date.

898
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,158
I better head inside.

899
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,290
I got to wear such expensive clothes.

900
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,636
Hey, Ha-ri! Hey, Shin Ha-ri!

901
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,182
Have you no conscience at all?

902
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,350
You were out all day
on this precious Saturday.

903
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,728
Can you switch with me now?

904
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,271
Okay, I'll be right out.

905
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,523
Get out.

906
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,550
The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave your message…

907
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:34,636
Hey, Ha-ri.

908
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,096
Hey, Min-woo. What's up?

909
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,140
I brought some abalones for your mom.

910
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,185
-Really? Go ahead inside.
-Okay, see you inside.

911
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,144
Okay.

912
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,605
Why is Ms. Shin…

913
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,246
NATIONAL ID CARD
SHIN HA-RI

914
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,306
Hello?

915
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,312
Hello, Mr. Kang?

916
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,518
Shin Ha-ri, Shin Geum-hui,
Shin Ha-ri, Shin Geum-hui…

917
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,187
-Again.
-Again.

918
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,690
Do you really not realize
who Shin Ha-ri is?

919
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,860
Schedule a meeting at two
with Food Product Development Team One.

920
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,903
You want me to go to
the Founding Anniversary Ceremony…

921
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,493
-Shin Ha-ri!
-Get this woman out of here, now!

922
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:27,457
