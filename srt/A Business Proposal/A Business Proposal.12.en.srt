EPISODE 12

2
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,972
You're up.

3
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,183
Wake up. Let's have breakfast.

4
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:46,731
Okay, but could you wait outside?
I'm embarrassed.

5
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,570
What?

6
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,829
Okay. Just go outside. I'll be right out.

7
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,664
I'm hungry, so be quick.

8
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,975
What's so wrong with checking
if my son-in-law could inherit my company?

9
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,646
Are you saying that you approve of
me dating Sung-hoon?

10
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,275
If I wasn't going to,
why would I have called him to dinner?

11
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,193
Will you marry me?

12
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,703
This is Cha Sung-hoon.

13
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,246
Hey, this is Chairman Jin.

14
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,878
I won't beat around the bush.

15
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,337
Break up with my daughter.

16
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,048
Why aren't you saying anything?

17
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,051
Did you not hear me telling you
to break up with Young-seo?

18
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,601
Also, keep this a secret from Young-seo.
I'm sure you're smart enough to do that.

19
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,918
Sung-hoon, I'm coming in.

20
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,593
You haven't eaten, right?
Let's go eat seaweed soup.

21
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,720
Ha-ri's parents are
making me a birthday meal.

22
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,888
Ms. Shin's parents?

23
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,390
They've celebrated
my birthday with me every year.

24
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,354
But Ha-ri used me as her cover story
to stay out last night.

25
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,522
I guess she was with Mr. Kang.

26
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,026
Are you all right, Young-seo?

27
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,986
What do you mean?

28
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,239
I'm fine.

29
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,867
Well, other than my lousy luck
with my parents,

30
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,286
I have so many people around me
who care about me.

31
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,041
My goodness.

32
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,422
Why are you worrying about me?

33
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,676
I should be the one
asking you if you're okay.

34
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,267
I'm sorry you're going through this
because of me.

35
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,562
Something's definitely fishy.

36
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,815
We're talking about that again?

37
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:38,069
We've been regulars at the rice cake shop
for ten years. They'd never deceive us.

38
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,697
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about Ha-ri.

39
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,614
What about Ha-ri?

40
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,617
I think she was with President Kang
last night.

41
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,496
Jeez, now you're talking nonsense.

42
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,041
Ha-ri isn't that kind of girl.

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,461
Do you think I lied to my parents
and went on a trip with you

44
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,130
because I was that kind of girl?

45
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,673
You talked me into--

46
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,590
Anyway!

47
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,591
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

48
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,511
Ha-ri isn't that kind of girl!

49
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,931
As a mother, you should trust
your child more.

50
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,893
Well, I just don't want to
be betrayed by someone I trust!

51
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,395
I just have a weird feeling.

52
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,356
Whenever you say that you have
a weird feeling about something,

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,608
it turns out to be nothing.

54
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,361
Just trust our daughter.

55
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,654
My goodness.

56
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,616
Go on in, Ha-ri.

57
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,704
-Okay, I will.
-I really don't want to let you go.

58
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,706
Same here.

59
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,545
Hey, Shin Ha-ri!

60
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,963
Honey!

61
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,049
-Honey, honey!
-Shin Ha-ri!

62
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,593
You said you were
going to sleep over at Young-seo's,

63
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,678
but you spent the night with him?

64
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,515
-You crazy brat! You've gone insane!
-Calm down, honey!

65
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,143
Please calm down,
and let's talk it out, Mother.

66
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,978
"Mother"? Don't call me that!

67
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,646
-You brat!
-Mom!

68
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,773
-Honey!
-Are you okay?

69
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,732
Yes, I'm fine.

70
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,691
-You brat!
-Mom.

71
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,651
How could you hit him?

72
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,820
Have some class! Use your words!

73
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,239
"Class"? Are you serious
right now? Come here!

74
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,449
-Come here!
-Stop it.

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,366
Stop what?

76
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,534
Come over here!

77
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,913
-Ha-ri, no!
-Come here!

78
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,831
-What?
-Ms. Han!

79
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,421
Dad, I'm sorry for lying, but…

80
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,926
Father, Mother…

81
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,470
it's not Ha-ri's fault.

82
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,805
I'm the one to blame.

83
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
Mr. Kang.

84
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,307
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,266
KANG TAE-MOO

86
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,476
You're the president.

87
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,311
ENTREPRENEUR
PRESIDENT OF GO FOOD

88
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,063
How did you end up dating Ha-ri?

89
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,817
I fell in love with her at first sight

90
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:46,030
and I wanted to keep seeing her
so I kept using work as an excuse to meet.

91
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,492
That's how we ended up dating.

92
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,703
Why would a man
who's so intimidatingly perfect like you

93
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,874
be head over heels in love with our Ha-ri?

94
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,127
In my eyes,

95
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,171
Ha-ri is the prettiest there is.

96
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,971
I've met a lot of beautiful women

97
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,932
with impressive backgrounds.

98
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,310
But Ha-ri is the first woman I've met

99
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,897
who is a joy to be around
and always makes me laugh.

100
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,984
So I held onto her.

101
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,153
Does your family

102
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,114
know about Ha-ri?

103
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,243
They're probably not happy

104
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,413
about a boss dating his employee.

105
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:40,168
I believe
as long as we each do our job well,

106
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,378
there won't be a problem.

107
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,007
I will make sure
to get my family's approval.

108
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,970
So, if you two would approve…

109
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,101
I would like to date Ha-ri
with marriage in mind.

110
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,152
Be quiet!

111
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,653
What are you so happy about?

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,280
You want to kneel here too?

113
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,992
Well, I know I'm not
completely innocent here,

114
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,786
but could I please eat
before being scolded?

115
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,205
I'm just so hungry.

116
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,122
Yes, Mom.

117
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,124
It's Young-seo's birthday after all.

118
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,042
Right?

119
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,587
Gosh.

120
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,933
President Kang.

121
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:42,438
I'm sorry for hitting you back there.

122
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,857
It wasn't on purpose.

123
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,735
I just got so angry
when I saw Ha-ri getting out of that car--

124
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,905
Enjoy the food.

125
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,534
Eat.

126
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,413
Are you okay, Sung-hoon? Have some water.

127
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,416
Everyone!

128
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,418
It's my birthday!

129
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,505
Are you really going to be down like this?

130
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,466
Yes, why are you so down?
Ha-ri brought the top…

131
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,720
I mean, the best husband material.
We should be throwing a party.

132
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,473
Yes. So both of you lighten up a bit.

133
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,642
I brought something for us to drink.

134
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,102
Sung-hoon.

135
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,438
What? Do you want
to drink in the middle of the day?

136
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,481
It's champagne.

137
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,360
I heard that you liked this last time,
so I got the same one.

138
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,030
How about we each have just one glass
to celebrate my birthday?

139
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,241
We have to open up the store.

140
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,245
Okay, maybe just one glass each?

141
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,622
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

142
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,040
President Kang.

143
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,126
Here, have a drink.

144
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,086
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,551
You can really hold your liquor.
That's nice to see.

146
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,721
I don't know if you already know this,

147
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,390
but Ha-ri can really hold her liquor.

148
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,684
Mom, why would you mention that?

149
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,644
What? You can drink three bottles easily.

150
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,606
-Three? She can do four. I saw it.
-It's not true!

151
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,732
-Right, right.
-No.

152
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,816
-Water.
-Oh, water?

153
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,776
You must be happy.

154
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,612
My dear Young-seo, happy birthday!

155
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,529
What do you mean?

156
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,739
Ms. Shin's mother.

157
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,949
I think she really likes you.

158
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,118
-Really?
-By the way, Ha-ri,

159
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,036
What?

160
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,663
where's my birthday present?

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,541
Why don't you go talk to her dad?

162
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,126
-I have a question.
-Okay, ask.

163
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,336
Right now?

164
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,755
You should get on his good side.

165
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,006
-Go on.
-Give me a kiss.

166
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,132
Come on!

167
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,677
You want to know a secret?

168
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,429
-Mom, you want to know?
-What?

169
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,557
About three years ago,
Ha-min called me when he was drunk.

170
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,351
You brat, you drunk-dialed her?

171
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,479
-Why did you call me when you were drunk?
-That's all in the past.

172
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,938
Did you hit on her?

173
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,856
My goodness.

174
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,524
-Mom, you--
-Hey, you.

175
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,486
How dare you flirt with a woman
who's older than you?

176
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,155
Hey, I'm practically your sister.
Why did you do that?

177
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,085
Father.

178
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,171
Why did you come down to the store?

179
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,928
I just wanted to check on something.

180
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,013
I understand

181
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,641
that you're angry at me.

182
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,769
But, sir, I--

183
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,688
I'm not…

184
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,109
angry at you, Mr. Kang.

185
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,527
Pardon?

186
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,780
You know, Ha-ri…

187
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,616
She's been a great singer
since she was young,

188
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,369
so I asked her
if she wanted to be a singer.

189
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,413
But she said no.

190
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,376
Then in high school, she got a lead role

191
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,171
as soon as she joined the theater club

192
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,590
and even got an award.

193
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,553
So I asked her
if she wanted to be an actor.

194
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,849
But she said no again.
That it was just a hobby.

195
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,309
Then I found out…

196
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,730
she was only holding back

197
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,983
from doing those things

198
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,529
because I wasn't able to provide for her.

199
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,531
And now that little girl…

200
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,618
is seeing someone as incredible as you.

201
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm just worried…

202
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,461
that people might compare the two of you

203
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,882
because of her parents.

204
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,888
That will hurt her feelings.

205
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,017
Let me ask you one thing.

206
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,481
Are you sure Ha-ri won't get hurt…

207
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,403
and won't have to suffer?

208
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,824
If I said that I was sure,

209
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,076
I would be lying.

210
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,625
I know that she could
get a lot of unwanted attention

211
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,629
or be the subject of rumors
just because she's seeing me.

212
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,675
No matter how hard I try,
I can't stop all of that.

213
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,385
But…

214
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,805
I promise I will always be by her side

215
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,475
and protect her
with everything that I have.

216
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,063
I will be someone who stands by her

217
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,982
and understands her.

218
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,779
So please, could you trust the two of us

219
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,242
and root for us?

220
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,716
Mother.

221
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,802
Don't call me your mother.

222
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,970
BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI

223
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:10,224
I abandoned you,
and I tried to ruin your life.

224
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,767
What?

225
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,644
-Wait…
-I'll make sure that Geum-hui…

226
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,438
Why is Geum-hui calling her "mother"?

227
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,650
It seems I've missed a lot.

228
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
I mean, Mother.

229
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,196
It turned out that Geum-hui
is the daughter she abandoned

230
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,408
before getting married
into that rich family.

231
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,868
What?

232
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:34,039
Then she yelled at Geum-hui all this time
without knowing that she's her daughter?

233
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,625
Unbelievable.

234
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,378
I'm home.

235
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,550
Where have you been
when you're not even fully recovered?

236
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,219
I'm fine now, so don't worry.

237
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,973
You were with Ms. Shin or whatever, right?

238
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,894
So you're not going to give up on her

239
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,438
no matter how much I disapprove.

240
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,232
When have you ever been
able to change my mind, Grandfather?

241
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,817
What? You brat.

242
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,653
Grandfather, I'm going to marry Ha-ri.

243
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,865
I'm actually coming back
from meeting her parents.

244
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,950
So…

245
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,411
just give up, Grandfather.

246
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,122
That little…

247
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,835
My chest. Gosh.

248
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,880
It hurts.

249
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,215
That little brat…

250
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,478
The door is closing.

251
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,189
The door is opening.

252
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,315
Aren't you getting in?

253
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,081
Hey.

254
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,540
What are you doing?

255
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,964
The two of them are dating, right?

256
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,842
So they say.

257
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,724
How can President Kang act
so nonchalantly, then?

258
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,897
Wasn't Team 1 in charge
of the cilantro dumplings?

259
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,941
Another team took it over.

260
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:30,280
Our team dropped out of the project
as Chairman Kang ordered, sir.

261
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,907
Have your team resume the project.

262
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,160
Your team has handled it until now,
so you should see it to the end.

263
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,287
Yes, President Kang.

264
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,205
Thank you.

265
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,716
-Aren't you getting out, Mr. Cha?
-Sir?

266
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,429
President Kang,
the tenth floor is our team's office.

267
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,522
I'm going to walk upstairs.
I need to think about my health.

268
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,568
Let's go up to the 17th floor, Mr. Cha.

269
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,240
I always work out, though.

270
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
Sir. This way.

271
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,498
Right.

272
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,500
Stay healthy, sir.

273
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,890
I ordered tea for you, instead of coffee.

274
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,225
They have your favorite, rooibos tea.

275
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,562
What brings you here so early?

276
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,938
President Kang asked me

277
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,232
to do another collaboration,

278
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,943
saying we shouldn't worry
about the rumors.

279
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,363
But I'm just coming back
from telling him I can't do it.

280
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,948
Why? It's a great opportunity.

281
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,201
If it's because of me, don't do that.

282
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,660
Actually, I…

283
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,082
I'm closing my restaurant
and going to Europe.

284
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,125
So suddenly?

285
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,628
Are you going with Yoo-ra?

286
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,629
We broke up.

287
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,298
We should have done this ages ago.

288
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,926
But I think we mistook
our regrets for affection.

289
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,222
Yoo-ra asked me to tell you she's sorry.

290
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,432
She couldn't face you herself.

291
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,395
How long will you be traveling?

292
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,232
I just got a one-way ticket
to Naples for now.

293
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,401
I'll visit a bunch of places
in Italy, eat a lot of delicious food,

294
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,154
and when my money runs out,
I'll get a job at a restaurant.

295
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,367
You know that
it's been on my bucket list for a while.

296
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
Of course. It's been your dream
since you were in college.

297
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,580
I don't know when I'll come back,

298
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,499
but…

299
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,167
I'll see you again.

300
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,546
Okay. Take care of yourself.

301
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,798
Ha-ri.

302
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,800
When I come back from my trip,

303
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,718
do you think that we could

304
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,222
go back to being
close friends like before?

305
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,855
That will

306
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,233
take some time, don't you think?

307
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,695
You know…

308
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,240
I started liking rooibos tea…

309
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,660
because of you.

310
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,538
Because you like it,

311
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,002
I started drinking it too,
and I took a liking to it.

312
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,922
After some time…

313
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,094
when I longer have any feelings for you

314
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,598
and when I'm not someone you see so often…

315
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,267
Maybe then we could

316
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,353
become friends again.

317
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,982
Okay.

318
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,693
Let's see each other again then.

319
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,778
My friend.

320
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,826
Okay. Take care of yourself.

321
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,454
I will.

322
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,141
Here.

323
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,812
I was about to call you.

324
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,691
I was thinking it's about time
we made you a director.

325
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,485
You can do as well as Yu-jeong, right?

326
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,445
We really don't see eye to eye.

327
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,032
The day you want
to appoint me as a director,

328
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,909
I've come to hand in my resignation.

329
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,035
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,332
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

331
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,465
Did Mr. Cha tell you?

332
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,342
Don't jump to conclusions.

333
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,345
I was there when you were
on the phone with Sung-hoon.

334
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,430
And I overheard it.

335
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,390
So…

336
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,267
what's the meaning of this?

337
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,521
You're going to cut ties with your father
because of some good-for-nothing guy?

338
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,731
No, that's not it, Dad.

339
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,358
It's not because of him.

340
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,819
It's because of you,
since you only care about money.

341
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,405
-What?
-Do you know how embarrassed

342
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,240
and sorry I was in front of Sung-hoon?

343
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,368
What have you ever done for me, Dad?

344
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,496
You kicked Mom out
because she wasn't up to your standards

345
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,748
and you want to separate me
from the man I love.

346
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,335
You don't think of me as your daughter.

347
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,130
I'm just something you own, aren't I?

348
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,507
You got the worst qualities
from your mother.

349
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,926
You have such a narrow point of view.

350
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,553
I've done nothing for you?

351
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,056
Do you think you can do anything without
the privilege my name has given you?

352
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,892
Actually…

353
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,395
I think I can.

354
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,232
And I'll prove it.

355
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,446
That I'll be perfectly fine on my own,
without using your name.

356
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,955
I truly thank you
for raising me for all these years.

357
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,048
Did you even know it was my birthday?

358
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,280
Is that a new recipe?

359
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,116
What are you doing?

360
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,870
No matter how much you miss me,
you can't come in here!

361
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,790
What if the other employees see us?

362
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,416
I'm not here as your boyfriend.

363
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,503
I'm here as your boss to see
how our new products are coming along.

364
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,214
I see.

365
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,715
Yes, sir.

366
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,134
How is it going?

367
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,808
You increased the amount of cilantro.

368
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,060
Yes, sir. I increased
the ratio of the spices,

369
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,729
but I'm worried
that some people may not like it.

370
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,024
I think this is better
than being too plain and forgettable.

371
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,567
I think so too, but--

372
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,693
Yes, Ms. Yeo.

373
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,196
I'm in front of the kitchen right now.

374
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,865
-Oh, my God! Ms. Kim's coming!
-What?

375
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,244
Why--

376
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,496
Yes, I'll tell Ms. Shin.

377
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,416
What? She's not here.

378
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,293
Did she go to the bathroom?

379
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,881
Why are we hiding?
We weren't doing anything weird--

380
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,135
It's weird we're by ourselves
during work hours in the first place.

381
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,761
Ms. Shin.

382
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,351
-Hye-ji.
-What?

383
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,603
-I'm at the cafe in your lobby.
-Oh, my God.

384
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,188
Could you come down for a second?

385
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,984
But my face is so dry
because I couldn't sleep last night!

386
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,917
There we go.

387
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,253
My face is shiny now.

388
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,713
Oh, right. Ms. Shin.

389
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,299
Whatever.

390
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,980
Stop laughing.
Do you know how nervous I was?

391
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,441
How about this?

392
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,240
Will you stop?

393
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,618
One second.

394
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,580
Yes, Director Go.

395
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,791
President Kang, I have bad news.
Chairman Kang has collapsed.

396
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,169
What?

397
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,465
His blood pressure rose
after our lunch meeting.

398
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:13,303
We brought him to Kangsung Hospital.

399
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,722
Please come quickly.
We're at Kangsung Hospital!

400
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,557
Okay, I'll be right there.

401
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,393
What did he say?

402
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,230
Did he seem surprised
when he heard that I was hospitalized?

403
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,941
Yes, he was.
He said he'll come right away.

404
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,027
What can he do? He thinks I've collapsed!

405
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,947
He needs to break up with that girl.

406
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,031
Of course!

407
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:38,662
Professor Kim,
run every test that you have

408
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,914
so Tae-moo gets scared. Okay?

409
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,666
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

410
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,251
-It's my turn, right?
-Yes, sir.

411
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,503
I think you're going to lose.

412
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,545
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

413
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,089
Oh, this is--

414
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,219
I'm glad that he's not actually sick.

415
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,889
This isn't going to work.

416
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,813
I'm so bored.

417
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,566
It's so stuffy here.

418
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,443
Those bastards…

419
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,242
Why isn't this opening?

420
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,870
What?

421
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,456
Damn it.

422
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,549
My head.

423
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,093
My goodness.

424
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,680
Oh, my.

425
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,435
What? What are you doing here?

426
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,063
How dare you show up here?

427
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,693
Hello. I brought some books and clothes
from your house.

428
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,739
President Kang has an important meeting,
so he sent me here in his place.

429
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,906
Look here.

430
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,200
You're the reason that I collapsed!

431
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,580
I might pass out again from anger
if I keep looking at your face,

432
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,290
so go away!

433
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,584
My goodness.

434
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,760
-Let me open it for you.
-Damn this thing.

435
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,428
I'll get it for you, sir.

436
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,097
There we go.

437
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,724
Ta-da!

438
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,187
I told you to leave!

439
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,485
Do you need to go to the bathroom?
Let me help you.

440
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,820
I don't need it!

441
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,114
I told you to go!

442
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,534
My gosh.

443
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,744
Are you all right?

444
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,872
Didn't you collapse
because of your high blood pressure?

445
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,417
It's not high blood pressure.

446
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,546
Right now, I just have a cramp in my leg…

447
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,464
What?

448
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,884
Let go. I'm fine.

449
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,472
Let me help you even if you don't like it.

450
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,308
If you collapse again,
then you'll really be in trouble.

451
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,686
-I'm really fine.
-My goodness.

452
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,730
Let's go.

453
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,316
This isn't how it's supposed to go…

454
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,531
Take your time.

455
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,957
I'm glad that he's not actually sick.

456
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,209
This isn't going to work.

457
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,006
How about I go to the hospital myself?

458
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
-What?
-He really liked me

459
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,053
when he thought I was Geum-hui.

460
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,179
Who knows?

461
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,850
He might start liking me again
if we spend some time together.

462
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,061
Right?

463
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,985
I'll just be here
until President Kang gets here, sir.

464
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,405
Unbelievable.

465
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,501
Did you just get off work?
Come in, let's eat together.

466
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,093
It was your birthday, but I didn't
get to cook you a birthday meal.

467
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,553
Sit.

468
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,097
What?

469
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,600
Did you make all of this yourself?

470
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,185
Just the seaweed soup.

471
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,812
I'm not a very good cook
so I ordered the rest.

472
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,690
Come on, try some.

473
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,365
I followed the recipe exactly
but I'm not sure if you'll like it.

474
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,203
It's good.

475
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,705
It's really good.

476
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,293
What's wrong?

477
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,421
Did something happen at work?

478
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,718
I gave my father
my letter of resignation today.

479
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,055
I thought it would feel good,

480
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,934
that I would be okay
with never seeing him again, but…

481
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,816
Young-seo.

482
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,528
Still, don't hate my father too much.

483
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,489
The more a person has,
the more greedy they become.

484
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:30,537
I'll be even better to you
from now on, Sung-hoon.

485
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,705
Okay?

486
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,403
What are you going to do
now that you're unemployed?

487
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,323
I'm going to start a company
under my name.

488
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,867
When did you think of that?

489
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,535
It's always been my dream.

490
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,664
I wanted to start my own company
with a single unique idea at its core.

491
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,126
I've always thought about it
and I'm doing it earlier than I planned.

492
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,420
But you'll need quite a lot of money.

493
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,798
So I'm going to use
the severance pay that I got

494
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,050
and take out some loans.

495
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,222
Hold on.

496
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,307
What?

497
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,112
What's this?

498
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,784
BALANCE
1,700,600,000 WON

499
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,913
It's the money Chairman Kang gave me

500
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,707
and some of the stock I own.
Use it to start your company.

501
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,001
It's fine.

502
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,338
It's a lot of money and couples
shouldn't be lending each other money

503
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,381
That's not what I'm doing.

504
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,593
I'll be the first person
to invest in your company.

505
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,348
-You mean it?
-You know I'm picky, right?

506
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,809
Bring me a proper business plan first.

507
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,436
If I'm happy with that

508
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,480
then I'll invest in full.

509
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,273
Sung-hoon.

510
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,109
Thank you.

511
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,820
You can't just
try to gloss over it like this.

512
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,238
I want a business plan.

513
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,698
Don't worry.

514
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,753
Wait. Isn't she supposed
to be taking care of me? Where is she?

515
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,171
My goodness.

516
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,803
Chairman Kang.

517
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,930
Since it's cold outside,

518
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,140
here's some ssanghwa tea.

519
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,606
I got this from a cafe nearby

520
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,026
because I heard they make
proper ssanghwa tea.

521
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,905
And it's so good.

522
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,533
It's amazing.

523
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,201
Try it, sir.

524
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:19,330
Well, how good could it be?
It's just ssanghwa tea.

525
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,873
Wait.

526
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,835
Here…

527
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,050
They said if I put the yolk in too early,
it'd overcook, so…

528
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,386
Really?

529
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,150
This is the real deal.
It's perfect for the weather right now.

530
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,735
Right?

531
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,667
I'm glad that it's to your liking, sir.

532
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,462
What do you mean? It wasn't that great.

533
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,757
Let's just watch some TV.

534
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,594
How pretty.

535
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,262
All-natural.

536
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,597
That's red seabream, right?

537
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,849
-It's red seabream!
-How do you know that?

538
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:24,854
Of course. I researched all sorts of fish
when I made our fish stew products.

539
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,565
That's pretty big for a red seabream.

540
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,985
You're calling that tiny little thing big?

541
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,653
Have you caught a bigger one?

542
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,030
Of course.

543
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:38,451
Back in the day,
I even caught a shark once.

544
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,120
A shark? Like an actual shark? Really?

545
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,207
Of course! Do you not believe me?

546
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,126
It was even bigger than I am.

547
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,920
It was probably as big as this bed.

548
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,505
I think it weighed 80 or 90kg.

549
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,882
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?

550
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,010
Jeez. Do you want to see some proof?

551
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,388
My goodness.

552
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,433
There!

553
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,644
See?

554
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,316
Is that really you? You caught that?

555
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,236
Of course I caught it. Who else… Come on.

556
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,488
Do you have any other pictures?

557
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,451
Now, that's what I call a red seabream.

558
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,662
What is that?
That thing's just a little baby.

559
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,705
You're right! It's a baby!

560
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,210
I'll tell you what. When you go overseas,
sharks are very common.

561
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,295
But you saw that picture, right?

562
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,006
I was on this small rock,
with just a fishing pole,

563
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,050
and I was fighting that shark
all by myself!

564
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,552
Not everyone can do that.

565
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,469
Oh, my God.

566
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,471
You can't get that anywhere…

567
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,392
You're a professional!

568
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,894
Damn it, what am I doing?

569
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,313
Anyway…

570
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:54,694
I don't want to talk to you anymore,
so just quietly watch TV.

571
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,112
That's amazing.

572
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,240
-Yes, sir.
-That looks delicious.

573
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:12,962
Crossing Youngdong Bridge alone

574
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:17,383
In the night rain

575
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:21,304
He probably doesn't know

576
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,724
He probably doesn't know how it feels

577
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,310
Oh, my parents really like this song.

578
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,854
I didn't say anything.

579
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,820
I really like this part.

580
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,533
Regret, regret, regret

581
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,912
It's probably regret

582
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:52,084
It's a habit. I always sing along
when I'm watching TV with my parents.

583
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,545
I was being loud again, wasn't I?

584
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,588
No.

585
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,927
I'm old and hard of hearing.
It wasn't loud at all.

586
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,931
If you want to sing along, go ahead.

587
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,683
I don't mind at all.

588
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,353
Yes, sir.

589
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,609
Wandering around Youngdong Bridge alone

590
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:20,112
In the night rain

591
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:27,662
He probably doesn't know

592
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:33,668
I'm drowning in the rain

593
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:38,339
In my sadness, in my pain

594
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:43,010
I keep wandering around Yeongdong Bridge

595
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,514
In the night rain

596
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,433
VIP SUITE 1701
MR. KANG **-GOO

597
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,109
Thanks.

598
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,660
Thank you. Grandfather gave you
a hard time, didn't he?

599
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,164
I volunteered to come here. It's okay.

600
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,335
But why do you look so down?

601
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,967
You know, I'm usually super popular
with people who are over 60.

602
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,845
Young-seo even teased me
about it one time,

603
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,139
calling me the Nursing Home Celebrity.

604
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,435
But it didn't really work…

605
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,104
on your grandfather.

606
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,401
You're popular with me.
I think you're being too greedy.

607
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm not in a joking mood right now.

608
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,699
Let's take it slow.

609
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,826
There's no need to rush things.

610
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,620
President Kang.

611
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,164
Professor Kim.

612
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,877
I'm sorry about my grandfather.

613
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,086
Not at all.

614
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,672
It would've been worse
if he hadn't gotten the checkup.

615
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,631
Pardon?

616
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,967
What do you…

617
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:19,023
Why won't they let me leave the hospital?

618
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,985
Professor Kim wants to
run some more tests.

619
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,990
Sung-hoon, I'm fine.

620
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,658
I feel great.

621
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,579
I was just putting on a show
when I said I was sick.

622
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,332
Tell him that he can let me go, okay?

623
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,170
I'm sorry, sir.
Please just wait one more day.

624
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,508
I guess I've put myself in this position.

625
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,675
My goodness.

626
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,428
Doctor Kim, that bastard, I'm going to--

627
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,348
Chairman Kang can't handle
any more operations.

628
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,477
Then are there
any other treatment options?

629
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,563
They've developed
stents coated with stem cells,

630
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,440
But, in Korea…

631
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,401
What about Korea?

632
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,277
What are you talking about?

633
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,780
What operation?

634
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,365
What treatment?

635
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,282
Sir.

636
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,745
Tae-moo, what's going on?

637
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,054
There's a problem with the stent
that was inserted into your heart vessel.

638
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,974
The inner walls of the vessel are damaged.

639
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,435
And since you've had the surgery
several times,

640
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,187
I don't think
your body can withstand more surgery.

641
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,194
Grandfather.

642
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,531
Yes.

643
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,911
You should have told me
that you were going fishing.

644
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,998
It would have been better
to come in the same car.

645
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:03,169
You usually never listen to me
when I ask you to go fishing with me.

646
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,672
It's been a while since we did this.
Do you want to bet on who catches more?

647
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,594
There's no way that
the two of you can beat me, punks.

648
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,721
You won't know until we actually try it.

649
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,763
Sure.

650
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,823
Don't worry.

651
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,243
I will cure your illness.

652
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,372
Don't be cheeky.

653
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,126
No matter how much you've grown,

654
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,795
you're still my grandson.

655
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,383
I can take care of my own illness.

656
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,886
You've always been a mountain to us.

657
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,972
Please be healthy and stay that way,

658
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,560
Grandfather.

659
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,902
Being sick is kind of nice.

660
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,321
I never thought

661
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,199
I would hear you call me that.

662
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,021
When did you get back?

663
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,070
How's Chairman Kang?

664
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,700
There's a problem with his blood vessels,

665
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,452
but there's no treatment in Korea yet.

666
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:02,913
So…

667
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,836
I'm going to take him to the States.

668
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,216
Speaking of which, Ha-ri,

669
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,928
will you come with me?

670
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,560
I know that it's selfish

671
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,479
and I know it's a lot to ask of you.

672
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,773
But I want you

673
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,735
by my side.

674
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,739
I'm not telling you to quit your job.

675
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,451
There's that program we have,
where we send researchers overseas.

676
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,121
If you apply for that, I'm sure you will--

677
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,293
No.

678
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,963
I'm sure I'd get it, though.

679
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,673
But…

680
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,092
if I do that,

681
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,012
there will be rumors about it
at the company.

682
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,972
Don't worry about other people.

683
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,141
I don't care about other people, either.

684
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,934
I just…

685
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,687
don't want

686
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,068
this situation to hurt you anymore.

687
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,370
Ha-ri, I'm so worried.

688
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,292
My grandfather is…

689
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,962
both my father

690
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,049
and mother.

691
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,302
But if something…

692
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,974
happens to him…

693
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,782
I know.

694
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,994
That's all the more reason
why I can't go with you.

695
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,209
Chairman Kang's health is
the most important thing right now.

696
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,796
He still doesn't approve of me.

697
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,258
So how could I possibly go with you?

698
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,055
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,600
I know it all…

700
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,645
but I couldn't help it.

701
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,815
I understand how you feel.

702
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,365
Will we be okay away from each other?

703
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,369
What? Are we never going
to see each other again?

704
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,328
No.

705
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,122
Then why are you saying it like that?

706
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,876
Other people might think
we're breaking up right now.

707
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,051
I'll be back before you know it.

708
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,430
So wait for me here.

709
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,891
Okay?

710
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,060
Okay.

711
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,032
1 YEAR LATER

712
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,950
GO FOOD COMPANY RECORDS
2 TRILLION WON IN SALES

713
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,953
Do you think
we'll get a bonus this quarter?

714
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,288
A bonus?

715
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,081
What bonus?

716
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,083
Our dumplings that entered the US market

717
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,336
took the majority share
in the global market.

718
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,213
Our Danji Kimchi was a huge hit, too.

719
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,255
That's right.

720
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,384
I heard that go food's sales
just rose to two trillion won.

721
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,677
Strictly speaking,

722
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,722
we already developed those items
before you all got hired.

723
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:49,890
But what, a bonus?

724
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,142
A bonus?

725
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,617
They have to give it to us. They will!

726
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,160
Really?

727
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,456
-You've all worked so hard.
-I'm so happy.

728
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,999
Development Team 1!

729
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,252
Is this

730
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,672
all that your team's capable of?

731
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,174
What's wrong? What did we do?

732
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,469
You know Team 4 is
developing a curry product, right?

733
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,390
But apparently, Team 1 is
also developing a curry product, right?

734
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,935
How can you betray us like this?

735
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,687
Associate Director Gye,

736
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,648
when did we betray--

737
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,119
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 4
DEPARTMENT HEAD GYE BIN

738
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,162
Stop calling me "associate director."

739
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,373
I became a department head ages ago.

740
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,793
Sorry, old habits die hard.

741
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:05,048
Anyway, what we're making is curry toast.

742
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,259
It's a snack!

743
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,887
But the one that you're making
is some kind of curry… What was it?

744
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:11,847
Stew.

745
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:16,393
Right. Curry stew or whatever.

746
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,353
"Whatever"?

747
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,064
Are you insulting our curry stew?

748
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,859
You ate it up
when I made it for you at home.

749
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,652
Apologize!

750
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:32,826
Whatever.

751
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,164
You must have come to pick a fight
because you're jealous of my team.

752
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,957
If you're going to keep doing this,

753
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,126
then at least buy us some coffee,
all right?

754
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,003
"Pick a fight"? "All right"?

755
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,759
Look at those rhymes.

756
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,470
What are you, a rapper?

757
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,727
Let me say it again.

758
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,397
Watch yourselves, Team 1!

759
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,523
Stop it, Mr. Gye.

760
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,526
Sorry, we're going now.

761
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,861
Bye!

762
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,113
You should speak up more, Ms. Kim!

763
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,658
You saw how that newbie
didn't even get up to greet us!

764
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,209
Those two are scary when they fight.

765
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,419
What if they get a divorce?

766
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,796
No way.

767
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,682
Babe.

768
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:42,896
I acted a bit tough
because my team was watching. Sorry.

769
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,274
Let's go home together after work, okay?

770
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,192
Promise?

771
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:50,862
Promise?

772
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,076
Watch out, Team 1.

773
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,414
I'm going to make her curry stew again.

774
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,107
Hi, Young-seo.

775
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,610
Right now?

776
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,322
Jeez.

777
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,752
Sorry, Sung-hoon.

778
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,006
Here you go.

779
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:51,965
Thanks.

780
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:56,052
The advertisers are coming in ten minutes,
but I left my edited copy at home.

781
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,722
I don't know where my head is these days.

782
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,933
I'm not working anyway.
Don't worry and order me around.

783
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,353
It's so nice that my boyfriend
is taking the year off.

784
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,315
I'll see you at home. Bye.

785
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,400
Young-seo.

786
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,027
Yes?

787
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,779
I love you.

788
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,114
I love you too.

789
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,168
Here is your fried chicken.

790
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,211
Thank you.

791
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,046
No problem. Enjoy.

792
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,798
What?

793
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,717
Doesn't your daughter work there?

794
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,093
What?

795
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:46,978
GO FOOD'S MANDU CREATES SENSATION
INTERNATIONALLY

796
00:51:53,610 --> 00:52:00,617
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO SPEAKS ON
FOREIGN TALK SHOW

797
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,498
President Kang Tae-moo appeared
on a talk show this day and--

798
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,292
Why did you do that?

799
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,461
They're talking about
the dumplings Ha-ri made.

800
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,757
There's no reason to stare
at that damn face for so long.

801
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,717
He said that he'd be back soon

802
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,429
but he hasn't for a year, working at
the New York branch or whatever.

803
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,558
He's probably just doing some work

804
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,060
since Chairman Kang
is still being treated there.

805
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,019
Who knows?

806
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,188
Maybe he has another girl.

807
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,439
Don't be ridiculous.

808
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:37,404
I thought you hated him. Why are you
taking his side now? I don't get it.

809
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,340
Ha-ri.

810
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,009
Hi, Tae-moo.

811
00:52:59,092 --> 00:52:59,968
Did you sleep well?

812
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,512
I worked late last night
so I didn't get much sleep.

813
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,015
Really? Did you wake up because of me?

814
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,182
No, it's all right.

815
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,518
You're doing well, right?

816
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,062
Of course. I'm always doing well.

817
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,231
How's your grandfather?

818
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,318
He got his regular checkup yesterday,
and they said he's fine.

819
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,652
That's a relief.

820
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,489
So, Tae-moo…

821
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,367
-About your work in the US--
-One second, Ha-ri.

822
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,537
I need to take this call. It's for work.
I'll call you later.

823
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,580
Sure.

824
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,797
Hey, that was a bit rude
of Tae-moo, right?

825
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,133
I'm allowed to feel hurt
about that, right?

826
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,521
-Wake up. You need to see this.
-What?

827
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,065
-Come on, get up.
-Why?

828
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,816
Mr. Kang's caught in a scandal!

829
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,361
-What?
-Come on, look at it.

830
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:05,075
ROMANCE SUSPECTED BETWEEN PRESIDENT
KANG TAE-MOO AND CELLIST BAEK YUN-SEO

831
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,078
That's just a rumor, right?
Nothing bad happened between you two?

832
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,791
Yes.

833
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,751
Nothing seemed off
when you were calling him?

834
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:20,006
When I called him yesterday,
he just seemed busy because of work.

835
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,509
Come to your senses.

836
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,303
There must be
a load of hot women around him.

837
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,514
What are you saying?

838
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,558
Ha-min.

839
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,477
Get out.

840
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,437
Get out!

841
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,608
-Come on, get out!
-Come to your senses.

842
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,392
The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave your message…

843
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,353
He's not going to
pick up my call in this situation?

844
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,818
Did you see the news articles
about that scandal?

845
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,695
So you're really going to be like this?

846
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,251
Yes, Ms. Yeo,

847
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,712
I'm going to be on vacation
until next Wednesday.

848
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,922
Are you finally using your vacation days?

849
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,257
Why, though?

850
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,842
I'm going to New York.

851
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,727
Sir, could you open the trunk?

852
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,414
How are you here?

853
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,875
I came here without telling you
to surprise you.

854
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,794
Where are you going?

855
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,587
Of course, I was going to the States…

856
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,590
Damn it!

857
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,758
What's wrong with you?

858
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,801
What?

859
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,970
You mean the scandal?

860
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,680
You knew about that?

861
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,642
You ignored my calls and messages
when you knew?

862
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,936
Do you know how much I…

863
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,650
Sorry. I only found out
after I got on the plane.

864
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,072
The two of you aren't…

865
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,658
It's nothing, right?

866
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,369
Of course not.

867
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,164
She's dating some international student.

868
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,168
Her family leaked fake news
because they're against the marriage.

869
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,135
Hug me.

870
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,604
You're not going to shove me away
and hit me, right?

871
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,066
You still hit me.

872
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,199
You look so pretty today.

873
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,203
Do you want to walk with me for a bit?

874
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,879
Why did you come here by yourself?
What about your grandfather?

875
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,006
He'll come back to Korea
sometime next week.

876
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,133
I came back a bit earlier to see you.

877
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,011
Did he approve of our relationship?

878
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,473
Well, that is…

879
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,851
I don't know if I should tell you.

880
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,603
Hey, stop teasing me!

881
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,813
Fine.

882
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:04,981
I'll tell you.

883
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:11,321
He told me not to come back home
until you took this.

884
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:15,158
What's this?

885
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,167
Are you…

886
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,337
proposing to me right now?

887
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,840
You know I hate wasting my time, right?

888
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,259
I can't be apart from you any longer.

889
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,429
So let's get married.

890
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,518
We will see about that.

891
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,524
It'll be your loss
if you try to play hard to get.

892
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,568
You know I'm good
at a lot of different things, right?

893
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,985
That took a while.

894
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,821
I didn't say yes yet.

895
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,781
You put the ring on. That means yes.

896
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,200
Hey, I told you we'll see about that.

897
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,953
Tell me that you love me.

898
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,454
What?

899
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,916
Be good to me, okay?

900
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:24,370
