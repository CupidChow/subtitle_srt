EPISODE 7

2
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,644
Where did she go?

3
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,815
ARCHAEOPTERYX

4
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,068
Why don't you pick it up?
It could be important.

5
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,282
Hello? Ms. Shin!

6
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,450
Hello?

7
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,997
Isn't this Shin Ha-ri's phone?

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,040
Who is this?

9
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,794
You also said that you have a date today.

10
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,921
Are you here with your boyfriend?

11
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,131
Well, that's--

12
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,717
Hey, no need to play shy between friends.

13
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,470
Since we've met like this,
let us see your rich boyfriend.

14
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,639
Yes, let us meet him, Ha-ri.

15
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,224
-Let us see him!
-Let us see him!

16
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,226
Actually, I didn't come
with my boyfriend--

17
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,185
Babe.

18
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,860
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

19
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,581
Did you wait long?

20
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,463
Ha-ri.

21
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,424
-Who is this?
-Oh, he's--

22
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,137
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ha-ri's boyfriend, Kang Tae-moo.

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,975
Hello.

24
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,854
Hello.

25
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,816
Ha-ri, since we're all here,
we should all have dinner together.

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,819
-Are you okay with that?
-Shall we?

27
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,529
It's okay, right, babe?

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,451
Right this way.

29
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,290
What are you doing?

30
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,292
Why are you pretending to be my boyfriend?

31
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,043
Shouldn't you thank me first?

32
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,798
I just saved you from your friends
finding out about your lie.

33
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,384
Shouldn't you

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,386
apologize first?

35
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,265
You left me on some road in the rain
because of some meeting.

36
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,438
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,150
That's why I came here
after canceling my meeting.

38
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,696
Really?
I guess I was worried for nothing, then.

39
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,823
What do you mean?

40
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,658
Never mind. It's not important.

41
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,952
Then let's go in.
Your friends must be waiting.

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,246
What? Go in where?

43
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,582
I need to finish
what I've started, don't I?

44
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,791
It's fine.

45
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,418
Don't make this any bigger. Just--

46
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,588
My God. Ha-ri really has a boyfriend.

47
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,923
Right?

48
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,177
It seemed suspicious,
so I thought it was a lie.

49
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,095
Anyway, the guy is…

50
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,306
so good-looking.

51
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,350
Right?

52
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,935
He looks like a model.

53
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,354
He's decked out in designer clothing…

54
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,356
He's amazing.

55
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,153
Hey, you don't think Ha-ri is the one
who buys him all those expensive clothes,

56
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,530
right?

57
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,867
Please. Do you think
Ha-ri has the money for that?

58
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,620
Do you think you telling them the truth

59
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,914
is the best option here?

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,667
Just accept my help

61
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,461
and keep your pride, at least.

62
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,714
Let's see.

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,925
If we want to take your friends' ego
down a notch.

64
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,177
what should my concept be?

65
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,517
Dinner is on me today.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,435
-So please, eat all you want.
-Thank you.

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,895
-Thank you.
-It's so expensive.

68
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,813
Babe.

69
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,484
Don't look at that. Look only at me.

70
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
Do you know what my love for you

71
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,906
and this credit card have in common?

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,618
They both have no limit.

73
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,414
There's no limit at all.

74
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,627
SHOW OFF YOUR WEALTH

75
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,045
That's so cool.

76
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,273
Stop staring at me, please eat--

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,483
Just eat.

78
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,154
I'm full from just watching you eat, babe.

79
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,452
You're so clumsy.

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,081
It's okay. I can do it.

81
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,460
You're just too pretty.

82
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,674
I'm going to the bathroom real quick.

83
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,470
Shall we go?

84
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,056
No. I can go by myself.

85
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,476
I get nervous
when you're out of my sight, babe.

86
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,603
I'll just walk with you over there.

87
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,526
ACT CLINGY

88
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,837
Be careful!

89
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,048
-Are you all right?
-What?

90
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,841
-You're not hurt?
-I'm fine.

91
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,093
Look at that guy.

92
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,386
He's perfect
and it looks like he loves Ha-ri.

93
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,515
Yes, I'm so jealous.

94
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,641
Hey, you!

95
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,352
What would you have done
if you hurt my girlfriend?

96
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:39,774
BE LOYAL LIKE A DOG

97
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,611
What is it about Ha-ri
that you like so much?

98
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,571
She's pretty.

99
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,160
I've never seen anyone as pretty
as Ha-ri in my entire life.

100
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,082
Stop exaggerating just
because you're in front of my friends.

101
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,834
I'm not exaggerating.

102
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,796
I knew it when I first saw her.

103
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,798
That she was the girl for me.

104
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,301
What? How many women has he dated

105
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,388
for these comments to come so easily?

106
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,183
I'm so jealous, Ha-ri!
Your boyfriend is such a sweetheart.

107
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,727
Hey, Min-woo is no chump either.

108
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,605
If Min-woo was here too,
being all sweet to you…

109
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,775
It's creeping me out
just thinking about it.

110
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,820
Min-woo? Do you mean Chef Lee Min-woo?

111
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,905
Do you know Min-woo?

112
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,032
I've met him for work, at the office.

113
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,035
You work at the same company as Ha-ri?

114
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,788
-Which department do you work in?
-Well, he--

115
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,706
Well…

116
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,208
What department
does the president belong to?

117
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,753
-Are you okay, Ha-ri?
-Ha-ri!

118
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,839
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

119
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,340
The president?

120
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,093
-The president?
-I didn't mishear that, right?

121
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm so full.

122
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,479
Thank you for the meal, President Kang.

123
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,732
Don't call your friend's boyfriend
"President Kang." It's so formal.

124
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,068
We really enjoyed the meal.

125
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,779
Oh, right. Where are you two staying?

126
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,156
Today, we're--

127
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,574
We're also staying here.

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,620
Really?

129
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,746
Great.

130
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,249
Then let us buy you guys lunch tomorrow.
Since you bought dinner today.

131
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,044
-Yes, let's do that.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

132
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,630
-See you tomorrow.
-Have a good night!

133
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,427
What are you doing?
We need to go back to Seoul.

134
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,054
There's no bus now.

135
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,264
And we can't drive since we drank.

136
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,269
Right.

137
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,579
-What are you doing there?
-What?

138
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,546
This wallpaper is so pretty.
I wonder where it's from.

139
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,634
If you want more to drink,
care to have some wine with me?

140
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,135
A drink?

141
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,347
No, I'm fine.
I don't want to drink anymore.

142
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,598
All right, then.

143
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
Sir.

144
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,951
Can we get separate rooms?

145
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,497
How can the two of us share a room?

146
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,250
Does it make sense
for a couple to sleep in separate rooms?

147
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,670
How will you explain that
to your friends if they find out?

148
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,006
I mean,

149
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,049
that's true, but…

150
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,093
I won't bite you, so don't worry.

151
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,512
You can take the bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

152
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,432
No. I'm more than fine on the couch.

153
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,476
How can I let you sleep on the couch?

154
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,894
Here we go.

155
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,067
Sleep here if you want.

156
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,654
I'll move you to the bed
once you're asleep.

157
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,657
Is that…

158
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,577
what you're hoping for?

159
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,168
No. Right, I should sleep
in the bed, right?

160
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,502
Yes, thank you.

161
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,174
She's so adorable.

162
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,390
This will leave a stain.

163
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,809
I can't go to bed like this.

164
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,322
Maybe this is even weirder.

165
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,825
But…

166
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,078
I can't just sleep

167
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,871
in this bathrobe.

168
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,168
What do I do? This whole situation
is weird to begin with.

169
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,464
Why is she dating such a perfect guy?
How annoying.

170
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,635
Everything Ha-ri does gets on my nerves.

171
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,523
You're done shooting already?
You're back early.

172
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,234
Yes. By the way, what's with the suite?

173
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,112
Ha-ri's boyfriend upgraded our room.

174
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,905
Ha-ri's boyfriend?

175
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,699
Yes. We ran into them
so we ate dinner together.

176
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,247
Did you not know who her boyfriend was?

177
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,249
No.

178
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,959
Who is he?

179
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,795
Don't be surprised.

180
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,550
It's Kang Tae-moo,
the president of go food.

181
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,509
What?

182
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,428
President Kang?

183
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,318
How did you meet Mr. Kang, anyway?

184
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,030
Yes. How did a lowly employee
get to date the president?

185
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,449
I can't believe them.

186
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,491
Is something wrong?

187
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,828
No, it's nothing.

188
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,038
Why aren't you replying?

189
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,291
Are things getting steamy
between you two already?

190
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,334
Who's texting you at this hour?

191
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,878
Are you in a fling with some guy?

192
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,381
No. It's my friends from before.

193
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,551
Do they think I'm not your real boyfriend?

194
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,512
They don't suspect a thing.

195
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,264
They're totally into it.

196
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,850
They all want to know how we met.

197
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,727
Well…

198
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,229
my acting was perfect, after all.

199
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,361
What should I tell them?

200
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,197
What's there to worry about?

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,491
Just tell them I fell in love with you

202
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,284
-at first sight.
-What?

203
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,496
If it's too cheesy for you,
do you want me to type it out for you?

204
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,459
No. I can type it myself.

205
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,548
But what should I do?

206
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,593
About what?

207
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,055
I'm not worried about my friends
because you won't have to see them again,

208
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,726
but you'll keep running into Min-woo
because of work.

209
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,437
I just don't want to put you
in an uncomfortable position.

210
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,276
Are you worried about me
being in an awkward position?

211
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,780
Or are you worried
because of your crush on him?

212
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,367
What?

213
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,203
How did you--

214
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,955
Did you think I was that clueless?

215
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,706
Yes.

216
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,500
You really are clueless.

217
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,089
Clueless enough to bring up
a one-sided crush from the past again.

218
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,718
Are you sure it's over?

219
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,179
I don't need a girlfriend
who cheats on me.

220
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,475
Well…

221
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,021
I noticed back there
that you're an amazing actor.

222
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,731
You should have been an actor.

223
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,442
I've told you before.
I'm good at many things.

224
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,201
Well, then, would you like
to finish what you were doing?

225
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,495
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

226
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,372
I'm so tired.

227
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,296
Good night.

228
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,725
I'm not getting any sleep tonight.

229
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,576
I'm definitely not getting any sleep.

230
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,693
Hello?

231
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,028
Are you still asleep?

232
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,738
It's time to get up.

233
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,341
Where are you?

234
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,136
I'm working out. I didn't wake you up
because you were sleeping.

235
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,183
I couldn't sleep all night and ended up
nodding off early in the morning.

236
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,142
Yes.

237
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,228
Somebody will be up there soon.

238
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,521
Open the door for them.

239
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,022
Who's coming up?

240
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,362
Hello, I was sent by President Kang.

241
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,322
He said you needed a change of clothes.

242
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,407
What?

243
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,954
It'd be a bit strange to wear
the same clothes two days in a row.

244
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,250
Pick out what you like.
Preferably something white.

245
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,793
So we can wear matching clothes.

246
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,254
Do we really have to?

247
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,744
What?

248
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,454
What?

249
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,873
What?

250
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,342
What is this?

251
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,013
This is Sung-hoon's apartment!

252
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,019
I picked these
because they suit me the best.

253
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,229
They won't think
we matched our outfits, right?

254
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,150
Hey, Min-woo!

255
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,820
I thought you couldn't make it.

256
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,822
Last night. The shoot was canceled.

257
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,075
Really?

258
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,284
I heard.

259
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,621
You're dating President Kang?

260
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,916
Well…

261
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,917
yes.

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,502
I was surprised to hear about it.

263
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,629
I never would have imagined.

264
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,255
I'm sure.

265
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,008
I never imagined
it would ever happen either.

266
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,596
Ha-ri.

267
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,309
Ha-ri.

268
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,981
Are you up?

269
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,068
You made it, Chef Lee.

270
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,283
He knows about us.
There's no need to be shy.

271
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,244
Right?

272
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,416
I'm hungry. Let's go get breakfast.

273
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,175
What on earth happened?

274
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,058
Right.

275
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,935
Then after that…

276
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,495
You're seriously out of your mind!

277
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,834
My coat and my phone…

278
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,883
-Are you all right, Young-seo?
-Yes.

279
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,801
I'm fine.

280
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,431
I got us some hangover soup.

281
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,017
No, I'm fine.

282
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,603
I need to get to work.

283
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,564
You're going to work on a Sunday?

284
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,276
Right…

285
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,030
I'm really busy at work these days.

286
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,325
Hey.

287
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,702
About yesterday…

288
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,707
Are we--

289
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,876
Yes, about yesterday.

290
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,295
Let's pretend it never happened.

291
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,925
What do you mean it never happened?

292
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,134
Well…

293
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,094
I mean just pretend it never happened.

294
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,847
It's null and void.

295
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,267
Now, if you'll excuse me.

296
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,321
Null and void?

297
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,868
Is it because I'm so tense?
I can't digest anything.

298
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
I just want to go home and rest.

299
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,587
Yes. I will contact them right away.

300
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,675
I have to go back to Seoul right away
because of a meeting.

301
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,884
All right, then.

302
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,719
Are you leaving already?

303
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,472
Yes. He's really busy.

304
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,350
Don't be like that. Hang out here
for at least another day.

305
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,353
Right. We're going to tour
the area nearby after breakfast.

306
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,188
Stop it. He says he's busy.

307
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,606
Hari, you should stay.

308
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,568
There's no need for you to leave too.

309
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,238
Isn't that right?

310
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:23,949
That's true.

311
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,785
Then I'll adjust my schedule
to fit Ha-ri's.

312
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,498
Babe. Do you want
to stay here for one more day?

313
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,416
Excuse me?

314
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,626
What?

315
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,768
This is amazing.
Who did you borrow it from?

316
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,228
It's my grandfather's.

317
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,771
He likes sea fishing.

318
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,566
Wealthy people really are
on a different level.

319
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,484
I'm jealous, Ha-ri.

320
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,658
Why is he going this far?

321
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,493
This is driving me insane!

322
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,831
Let's go.

323
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,585
Shall we?

324
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,593
Take my hand, Ha-ri.

325
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,184
This is crazy.

326
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,895
Why is your heart fluttering
right now? Come on, Ha-ri.

327
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,856
It's okay. I can get up by myself.

328
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,525
Thank you.

329
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,792
Want some?

330
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,251
You should have some, too.

331
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,003
I'm all right.

332
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,713
Cheers!

333
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,258
It looks like it'll be hard
to see any dolphins today.

334
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,636
I know it's your wish to see a dolphin.

335
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,012
What a shame.

336
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,722
How did you know that?

337
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,475
You told me before.

338
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,435
Don't you remember?

339
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,062
I did?

340
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,564
Everyone knows
how much you love dolphins, Ha-ri.

341
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,191
It's all over your social media.

342
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,568
Wouldn't it be weirder
for your boyfriend not to know?

343
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,238
I guess so?

344
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,697
Right.

345
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,993
How did you two start dating?

346
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,039
It's not common for a president
to date his employee.

347
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,876
That's true. Now that I think about it,
I'm really curious.

348
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,254
Well…

349
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,090
I followed her around
because I fell for her at first sight.

350
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,887
Love at first sight?
You probably thought I was crazy.

351
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,889
I've never met anyone as crazy as Ha-ri.

352
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,057
It was refreshing.

353
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,519
Every time we met,
she would do something weird

354
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,271
and say the craziest things.

355
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,566
Remember what you said?

356
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,153
Two-timing?

357
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,988
I've never done that in my life.

358
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,324
Though I have seen three
or four guys at the same time.

359
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,870
Later, I found out that she was
only trying to push me away

360
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,998
because she realized
I was interested in her.

361
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,583
No way.

362
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,793
What didn't you like about him?

363
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,673
When we met for the second time,

364
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,758
I proposed to her.

365
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,304
But she turned it down immediately.

366
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,140
So I had no choice
but to go on blind dates with other women.

367
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,729
But the more I did that,
the more I thought of her.

368
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,733
So I asked her to see me again.

369
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,529
How is he so good at making lies
sound like the truth?

370
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,158
So stop asking me to get married to you
so early in our relationship.

371
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,162
Okay.

372
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,332
She hasn't dated many guys,
yet she's so good at playing hard to get.

373
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,751
She always keeps me on my toes.

374
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,966
You really cut right to the chase.

375
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,722
-You think so? Do you want to?
-Come on.

376
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,391
-Okay. I'm going to the bathroom.
-Okay.

377
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,810
Chef Lee.

378
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,230
I heard you shot an SBC TV show yesterday.

379
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,775
Yes. I'm getting contacted a lot lately.
Thanks to the recent collaboration.

380
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,237
The marketing team was confident
that you would have the best reception.

381
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,573
I guess my Ha-ri really does
have a good eye.

382
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,993
President Kang.

383
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,246
Yes.

384
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,958
May I ask you something?

385
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,585
Go ahead.

386
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,921
Why did it have to be Ha-ri,
of all people?

387
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:48,922
Of all people?

388
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,508
What's that supposed to mean?

389
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,551
I won't beat around the bush.

390
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,972
To put it bluntly, you can date
any woman you want, right?

391
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,599
But you're seeing Ha-ri,

392
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,519
who's not only from a normal family
but also your employee.

393
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,062
I just don't understand it.

394
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,313
So you're saying,

395
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,109
"Ms. Shin isn't good enough
to be dating someone like me."

396
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,193
Is that what you mean?

397
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,946
-I'm just worried about Ha-ri.
-I guess you only date

398
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,991
people who are on your "level"?

399
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,995
In my eyes,

400
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,540
Ms. Shin is someone with endless charm.

401
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,710
So don't you dare judge my girlfriend

402
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,546
ever again.

403
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,841
Is that clear?

404
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,979
Gosh, this weather!

405
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,108
I saw a fishing rod in the back.

406
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,693
Can we do some fishing?

407
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,653
Yes. I think it'll be fun.

408
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,779
A fishing rod?

409
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,158
That's my grandfather's.

410
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,952
It reminds me of when I went fishing
on a boat with Min-woo.

411
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,498
Min-woo made sashimi out of the red
sea breams we caught, right on the spot.

412
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,834
It was really fun, wasn't it?

413
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,587
Yes. That was some of the best
sashimi I've ever had.

414
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,340
-It was so good.
-There's a spot

415
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,343
famous for having a lot of red sea breams.
Do you want to fish?

416
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,221
We can catch some sea breams
and make sashimi. How about it, babe?

417
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,390
You want to go fishing?

418
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,101
Yes, why not? Sure.

419
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,300
What are you doing here?
Come stand next to me.

420
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,761
Mr. Kang. Right now, I'm actually--

421
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,597
-Hey, Min-woo already caught one!
-That's amazing!

422
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,393
I guess that's one to zero.

423
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,521
Damn it. He started already?

424
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,774
-Mr. Kang. I--
-Wait! Let's talk later.

425
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,372
I got one!

426
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,624
Okay, come on.

427
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,000
There!

428
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,460
Now it's one-to-one.

429
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,924
Min-woo got another one.

430
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,134
He got another one!

431
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,136
He got one more.

432
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,139
Two-to-one.

433
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,057
Damn it.

434
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,608
I think my fish is a bit bigger, though.

435
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,404
Why don't we stop now?

436
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,240
I think we're tied.
Let's just go for just one more hour.

437
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,658
Okay, one hour.

438
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,872
Hey.

439
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,708
Ha-ri, why is your hand so warm?

440
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,460
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

441
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,296
Are you all right?

442
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,052
Let me go with you.

443
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,889
I'll take care of it.

444
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,448
Hang in there.
We'll be at the hospital in ten minutes.

445
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,575
It's okay. I don't need
to go to the hospital.

446
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,993
Just listen to me!

447
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,669
-Mr. Kang?
-I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.

448
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,593
You must be busy.

449
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,094
Let's go straight to Seoul.

450
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,645
Excuse me.

451
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,773
Sung-ho!

452
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,361
Welcome.

453
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,993
If I'm being honest,

454
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:34,791
I fell for you at first sight
when I met you at the convenience store.

455
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,710
Is it okay to run around
with something like this?

456
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,254
Not okay, right?

457
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,384
Ta-da!

458
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,135
-Guess what this is.
-Poop?

459
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,389
How does this look like poop?
It's a flower.

460
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,603
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,320
She's pretty.

462
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,078
I found my love.

463
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,708
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,126
It's no problem.

465
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,756
Should I ask? Or not?

466
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,593
Excuse me.

467
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,888
It was love at first sight for me, too.

468
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,890
But she said she liked me.

469
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,393
Why is she saying she wants to
forget about last night?

470
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,081
We're here? You should have woken me up.

471
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,751
I couldn't since you were
sleeping so soundly.

472
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,503
-Are you feeling better now?
-Yes.

473
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,299
Since I got treated and got some sleep,

474
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,550
I feel a lot better now.

475
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,899
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

476
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,405
Why do you keep apologizing?

477
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,865
Well, that's…

478
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,494
You wasted your time
just to act like my boyfriend,

479
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,124
and you had to go through all that trouble
today with the boat and everything.

480
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,417
Don't be sorry.

481
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,962
I did it all because I wanted to.

482
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,382
What?

483
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,097
I should get going now.

484
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,264
Get home safely.

485
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,450
Ms. Shin.

486
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,663
Do you really not know?

487
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,006
Why I spent the entire weekend
pretending to be your boyfriend

488
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,425
when I hate wasting my time
more than anything?

489
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,846
Why I went through your social media
to find out the things you like,

490
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,931
and why I put off my meetings for you?

491
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,308
Do you really not know?

492
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,477
What?

493
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,563
I have feelings for you.

494
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,235
I know it must feel sudden.
It's the same for me, too.

495
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,321
I was too jealous of Chef Lee

496
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,116
to realize you were feeling sick.

497
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,617
I'm an idiot.

498
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,331
So stop apologizing to me.

499
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,625
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

500
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,843
President Kang

501
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,220
has…

502
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,141
feelings for me?

503
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,312
Am I in a dream?

504
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,814
It doesn't hurt.

505
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,530
Ha-ri, I went to the mall today!

506
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,367
And when I saw these clothes,
I knew that they were made for you.

507
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,078
-Come on, let's try it on.
-What?

508
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,704
That looks great. Try it on.

509
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,207
-Try it on. Yes.
-Right now?

510
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,291
No.

511
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,794
I'll try it on tomorrow.
I'm too tired right now.

512
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,795
-You're tired?
-Yes.

513
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,505
Look how tired your eyes look.

514
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,425
What kind of company makes an employee
work so hard even on the weekends?

515
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,139
Well, some fried chicken shop makes
their only son work as a delivery guy

516
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,724
even on the weekends.

517
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,394
But how could you
only buy new clothes for Ha-ri?

518
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,939
Why you little…

519
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,233
Do you know how much money
I've had to pay so far

520
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,819
because of the trouble that you caused?

521
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,114
Is that something to say to your mom?
Stop right there, you!

522
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,740
Get down here!

523
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,908
Whatever!

524
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,243
Why you little!

525
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,640
-Here!
-Thanks.

526
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,475
You're wearing the clothes I bought you?

527
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,145
They look so good on you!
My daughter's so pretty.

528
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,229
-Really?
-Yes.

529
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,397
Hold on!

530
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,275
You can't go out wearing that.

531
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,609
-Why not?
-Why?

532
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,112
You look too pretty.

533
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,364
What if all the guys
start following you around?

534
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,867
That's true.

535
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,327
You take after me
and can make any outfit shine.

536
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,997
-I'm going to work.
-Bye.

537
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,418
Wait.

538
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,129
If I dress nicely
the day after I was asked out,

539
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,842
he'll think I'm trying
to look good for him. Gosh.

540
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,679
Why are you going back in?

541
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,682
To change. I can't afford to look pretty.

542
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,189
Did she go crazy?

543
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,025
You punk, watch what you say
about your sister!

544
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,489
I should get going.

545
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,493
I know that you must be flustered

546
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,121
because it's out of the blue.

547
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,169
I won't rush you, so take your time to
think things over and let me know.

548
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,972
I shouldn't have told her
to take her time.

549
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,184
I should have given her a deadline.

550
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,103
-Sir, Chairman Kang is--
-Move, you fool!

551
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,107
You. Just what do you think you're doing?

552
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,485
Why are you so angry?

553
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,736
You really don't know?

554
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,531
Look at this. What's all this?

555
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,617
What is it?

556
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,413
This is ridiculous.

557
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,299
Who sent you these pictures?

558
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,927
That was Chairman Park's hotel.

559
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,722
I thought you went on a date with Ms. Shin
over the weekend.

560
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,183
Who's that woman?

561
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,352
I can't tell you that yet.

562
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,188
What? You crazy bastard!

563
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,025
Are you really going to cheat on Geum-hui?

564
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,819
-You bastard, you!
-No, it's not--

565
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,904
-Hey! Stop right there!
-It's a misunderstanding.

566
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:02,863
Grandfather!

567
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,157
-Stop!
-Don't give me that!

568
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,618
-Grandfather.
-I have the evidence right here, punk.

569
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:12,039
You even asked the hotel employees
to get her some new clothes too?

570
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,834
And you went sailing on my yacht.

571
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,171
I knew I did a bad job of raising you
but you're taking it to a whole new level.

572
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,383
-How could you do that?
-Grandfather, sir!

573
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,551
You bastard!

574
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,719
Hey!

575
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,263
Grandfather, stop.

576
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,391
I had my reasons.

577
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,434
What reasons?

578
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:32,893
All right.

579
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,355
Let's hear what you have to say.

580
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,946
I broke up with Geum-hui.

581
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,449
What?

582
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,533
I ended it.

583
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,329
So I'm not cheating on her
even if I'm seeing another woman.

584
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,456
Didn't you break up because you cheated?

585
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,083
That's not the case at all, sir.

586
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,628
How can I trust you
when you two are in cahoots?

587
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,591
My, God! What on earth is this?

588
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,719
Jeez, I'm getting dizzy.

589
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,972
Why did you tell him that
you broke up with Shin Geum-hui?

590
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,640
It had to be done eventually.

591
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,434
I can't tell him they're the same people.

592
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,435
That's true.

593
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,900
CHAIRMAN KANG HAS SENT YOU A TEXT

594
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,527
He's already telling me
to set up your blind dates again.

595
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,532
Why don't you tell Ms. Shin your feelings
and bring her to the chairman?

596
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,201
I've already…

597
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,037
confessed my feelings to her.

598
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,038
What?

599
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,250
You didn't get rejected, did you?

600
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,544
Rejected?

601
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,922
I'm still waiting for an answer.

602
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,927
I told her that I would give her time,
that she could think over it slowly.

603
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,346
You've been rejected.

604
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,642
I said, I wasn't!

605
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,521
IT WAS DELICIOUS
I LOVE YOU!

606
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,525
I was really
craving this spicy tteokbokki today.

607
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,027
What is it? Why were you so stressed out?

608
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,655
Please, I don't even know where to start.

609
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,950
I have something to say, too.

610
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,912
They say friends take after
one another. What's your story?

611
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,958
So…

612
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,379
Where do I even start?

613
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,757
If you're going to take all day,
I'll just go first.

614
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,806
I slept with Sung-hoon.

615
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,726
What?

616
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,770
I slept with him,

617
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,650
but I couldn't remember any of it,
so I just ran out of there.

618
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,404
-What?
-I must be crazy.

619
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,576
I'm shocked that you slept with him
and you don't even remember it.

620
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,162
I'm speechless.

621
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,080
Hey, I feel exactly the same!

622
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,374
I'm going to go insane!

623
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,335
How can I not remember
sleeping with someone?

624
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,339
You know how much I like Sung-hoon, right?

625
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,928
Then how can I not remember
such an important moment?

626
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,638
Still, how could you
tell him to forget it?

627
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,515
He must have been shocked.

628
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,351
It was just because I was so flustered.

629
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,353
You should have just told him the truth.

630
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,438
Hey!

631
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,064
How could I do that?

632
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,777
Then he'll think that I do that
whenever I'm drunk.

633
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,946
It'll hurt his pride, too.

634
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,574
That's true.

635
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,620
So, what are you going to do?

636
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,079
I have no idea.

637
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,043
Hey, so, what's your thing?

638
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,005
Never mind. It's fine.
We can talk about it later.

639
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,926
DA-HYE

640
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,724
Why?

641
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,351
What?

642
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,394
-What?
-Why are you so surprised?

643
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,938
Surprised? I'm not.

644
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,148
Fine, don't tell me.

645
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,776
What are you hiding from me? I'm curious.

646
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,820
DA-HYE
THANKS TO YOU, WE'VE HAD A GREAT TIME

647
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,738
What is this?

648
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,117
What's this picture?

649
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,328
So, that…

650
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,040
"Tell your boyfriend I said hi?"

651
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,960
What are they talking about?

652
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,420
Why are they calling President Kang
your boyfriend?

653
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,007
It's a long story.

654
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,595
I knew it!

655
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,223
You remember that bastard
who took secret videos of us?

656
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,309
I heard President Kang helped
all of his past victims file lawsuits

657
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,435
against him.

658
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,396
I thought it was weird,

659
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,773
but he only did it
because he was into you!

660
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,695
I have feelings for you.

661
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:57,533
I won't rush you, so take your time
to think things over and let me know.

662
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,746
Just think how surprised
she must have been.

663
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,916
So I gave her some time to think
because I was being considerate.

664
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,959
Sure.

665
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,673
But how long does it usually take
to come to a decision?

666
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,719
Well, it's probably different
from person to person.

667
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,636
Right.

668
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,183
I shouldn't call her first

669
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,853
when I said that I'd give her time, right?

670
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,104
That's right.

671
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,662
What the heck?

672
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,999
Stupid spam call.

673
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,223
My leg just cramped up all of a sudden.

674
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,687
Please stop making me feel so pathetic.

675
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,688
Sorry?

676
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,692
I'll pretend that night
never happened like you said.

677
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,444
So please stop avoiding me.

678
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,822
-That's not--
-Also…

679
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,325
I wasn't going to say this,

680
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,452
but I don't want my sincerity disregarded.

681
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,497
I wasn't acting compulsively that night.

682
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,250
What do you--

683
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,003
I was also interested in you ever since
I first saw you…

684
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,465
at the convenience store.

685
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,386
I should have kept my distance.

686
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,763
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,537
What are you doing?

688
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,624
Were you really interested in me
from the beginning?

689
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,542
Really?

690
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,460
Does any of that matter now?

691
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,381
I wasn't avoiding you.

692
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,300
-I had my reasons--
-It's fine.

693
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,760
I have nothing more to say.

694
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,387
It's nothing like that…

695
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,098
So…

696
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,143
Actually…

697
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,063
I don't remember what happened that night.

698
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,523
What?

699
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,986
I don't remember anything…

700
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,448
about sleeping with you.

701
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:48,537
I was so flustered, and that's why
I left after saying that it didn't count.

702
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,496
So…

703
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,581
Really?

704
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,667
You really don't remember anything?

705
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,046
No.

706
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,634
I know how crazy I must sound right now.

707
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,345
But it's unfair for me, too.

708
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,556
How can I like you so much

709
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,934
and not remember anything
about what happened?

710
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,354
I felt so shameful and embarrassed.

711
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,152
Did you just laugh?

712
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,613
Why?

713
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,781
Because you're so adorable.

714
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,658
Adorable?

715
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,703
You're not mad or shocked or anything?

716
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,580
No.

717
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:37,252
But back there, you said that
we should draw a line again.

718
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,546
Let's make that null and void.

719
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,841
And, from now on…

720
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,429
I'll make sure that you never forget.

721
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,659
THE NEXT DAY

722
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,620
What's this?

723
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,746
A COLLABORATION WITH THE CHEF PRODUCT

724
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,789
WHITE KIMCHI RAVIOLI
IS AT THE TOP IN SALES

725
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,544
The president is here.

726
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,264
My face is so dry.

727
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,022
What's with him?

728
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,358
Didn't he say he liked me?

729
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,735
What's wrong with me?

730
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,029
Why are you disappointed

731
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,573
when you're going to reject him?

732
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,075
You're funny, Ha-ri.

733
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,747
AND THE NEXT DAY

734
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:00,919
DELICIOUSLY SPICY
TTEOKBOKKI

735
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,008
"Deliciously Spicy Tteokbokki"
is one of our products.

736
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,093
I came up with that.

737
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,512
What?

738
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,598
Why do I keep thinking of Mr. Kang?

739
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,058
President Kang is here.

740
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,270
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT

741
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,484
We live in two different worlds.

742
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,736
Hello, sir.

743
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,071
The president and I can't be a couple.

744
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,159
What? The girl's face
isn't even in the picture.

745
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,036
Right? What a shame.

746
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,495
I wonder who she is.

747
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,122
It's obvious.

748
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,001
She's super pretty
or went to a really good school.

749
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,878
Or she's from a really wealthy family.

750
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,005
Or she's all three.

751
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,633
They're probably imagining
some incredible girl.

752
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,594
How shocked would they be
if they found out that it's just me?

753
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,180
We'll submit the proposal as soon
as it's put together.

754
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,850
Stop being so vague and set an exact date!

755
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,645
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to just wait?

756
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,979
Sir?

757
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:11,823
While go food's sales revenue
is on the rise in the United States,

758
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,826
there are other countries
that are trying to compete with us,

759
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,537
so I believe a more aggressive strategy
will be necessary.

760
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,373
People tend to think of Korean food

761
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,918
as "home food," or as healthy food
that's made with love and care.

762
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,003
Let's focus on that.

763
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,129
Yes, sir.

764
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,471
It's already been a week.

765
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:35,972
President Kang?

766
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,683
Is there a problem?

767
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,310
No.

768
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,104
How's the package revision plan?

769
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,857
In order to cater to local customers
who are used to buying things in bulk,

770
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:50,362
we are discussing a possible solution
of selling four packs in one box.

771
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,907
Let's keep the English label of
"MANDU" on the package.

772
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,785
-Keeping the Korean aspect of it.
-Yes, sir.

773
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,455
CHAIRMAN

774
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,214
Food product development teams,

775
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,842
start developing dumplings
suitable for localization.

776
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,343
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

777
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,975
CHAIRMAN

778
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,777
ADDITIONAL FILMING PROPOSAL

779
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,698
SUGGESTED CAST
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

780
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,246
When are the additional shoots
taking place?

781
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,584
Look at that.

782
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,211
This bastard.

783
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,673
Find out where he is, right now!

784
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,341
Yes, sir.

785
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,926
Come on.

786
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,014
Where's Ms. Kim? The shoot starts soon.

787
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,267
I think she went to the bathroom.

788
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,187
I'm jealous of Ms. Kim.

789
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,856
I wanted to do the shoot.

790
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,902
What's there to be jealous
about appearing in a promo video?

791
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,612
You don't get paid much for it.

792
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:18,700
Still, it's a chance to show everyone I
represent the researchers in the company.

793
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,494
And get on the president's good side.

794
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,247
Where have you been?

795
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,208
I went to get a calming pill.

796
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,959
Again? You already had some.

797
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,629
Didn't you say you haven't
eaten anything since yesterday?

798
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,214
Will you be okay on an empty stomach?

799
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,341
I'll be fine.
Let's hurry over to the studio.

800
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,425
Okay, let's go.

801
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,014
Hello.

802
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,350
Hello!

803
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,810
Hello, Chef Lee.

804
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,564
Isn't it nice that you're the center
of attention for these additional shoots?

805
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,857
It's all thanks to you.

806
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,776
Please.

807
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,110
How'd you know?

808
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,280
-Treat us to a meal next time!
-Sure.

809
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,074
By the way, where's Ha-ri?

810
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,911
I think Ms. Shin went to the bathroom
with Ms. Kim.

811
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,622
We have a problem.

812
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,581
What?

813
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,375
Ms. Kim…

814
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,588
Those pills are so effective!

815
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,633
How many did she take?

816
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,969
I think, like three?

817
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,428
Three?

818
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:25,183
How will she do the shoot like this?
It's starting soon.

819
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,853
We have no choice. I'll get ready.

820
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,563
-Don't.
-Okay.

821
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:31,940
Ms. Shin, get ready.

822
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,193
-Me?
-Yes!

823
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,195
You're friends with Chef Lee

824
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,739
and you will be much better than him.

825
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,339
WHITE KIMCHI RAVIOLI

826
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,216
Are you feeling better?

827
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,344
Yes. That was such a long time ago.

828
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,306
Okay, stand by.

829
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,142
Let's do this.

830
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,443
You said that you would wait
until Ms. Shin contacted you first.

831
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,697
Don't worry. I'm just going
to catch a glimpse of her quietly.

832
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,699
All right, let's get started.

833
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,617
Sure.

834
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,286
Damn it, where is she?

835
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,005
Wait. Why are those two
shooting it together?

836
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,384
Should I cut up the vegetables
while you're cooking, Chef?

837
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,552
Yes, please.

838
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,845
Sure. Okay.

839
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,810
You really know how to handle a knife.

840
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,273
Well, my family runs a fried chicken shop.

841
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,944
So I've been chopping up things like
cabbages ever since I was young.

842
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,445
Is that so?

843
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,369
Are the onions ready?

844
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,703
Just a moment.

845
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,511
Cut!

846
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,596
Blood!

847
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,890
Hey, are you all right, Ha-ri?

848
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,100
Yes.

849
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:35,397
This isn't blood. I accidentally pressed
on the sauce bottle. I'm sorry.

850
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:36,856
I'm okay.

851
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,328
My God. Why…

852
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,122
Why is he here?

853
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,335
Could it be…

854
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,797
because he wants to hear my answer?

855
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,390
It's been a while.

856
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,770
Hello, President Kang.

857
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,863
Thank you?

858
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,656
What are you thanking me for?

859
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,159
It's, I…

860
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:35,290
I heard that you personally took care
of the guy who secretly filmed us.

861
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,459
Thank you. I mean it.

862
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,301
-Chairman Kang is on his way.
-What?

863
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,018
You go.

864
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,188
Hey.

865
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,147
Hello, sir.

866
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,649
Where did Tae-moo go?

867
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,151
I'm not sure, sir.

868
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,319
What?

869
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,362
That's…

870
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,242
-This way.
-This way?

871
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,046
That little brat.

872
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,716
God, my legs.

873
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,218
I'm so tired.

874
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,302
-Oh, my.
-Sir.

875
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,431
Where is he? Tell him to come out at once!

876
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,933
Sir, the employees will hear.

877
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,727
You. Go tell him

878
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,980
to start going on blind dates again

879
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,150
if he's not going to get back together
with Geum-hui.

880
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,486
Sir, please calm down.

881
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,987
Calm down?

882
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,698
I'm getting dizzy. Gosh, I'm exhausted.

883
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,367
-Let's go, sir.
-That little brat.

884
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,369
Why that little…

885
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,998
I told my grandfather that we broke up.

886
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,294
After all, I can't introduce you
as Shin Geum-hui forever.

887
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,712
Go on the blind dates.

888
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,049
Are you

889
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,885
rejecting me right now?

890
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,224
What's the reason?

891
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,392
The reason…

892
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,187
There's a lot of them.

893
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,067
What would your grandfather say
if he knew about this situation?

894
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,777
Not to mention the other employees.

895
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,779
I'm not asking about others.

896
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,531
I only want to hear

897
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,533
what you think.

898
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:35,869
It's the same.

899
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,957
I don't think it's going to work out.

900
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,585
Do you really not have

901
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,671
any feelings for me?

902
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,559
I understand.

903
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,481
Then let me say this again.

904
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,277
I have feelings for you, Ms. Shin.

905
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,530
And I won't give up.

906
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,408
If you reject me,
I'll ask you out again and again.

907
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,452
Until you finally like me back.

908
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,579
So, you need

909
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,373
to brace yourself.

910
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,212
Why do you keep making it so hard for me?

911
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:32,300
Why do you keep being nice to me
and make me think about you?

912
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:38,306
You make me wonder if it really
might work out, even though I know

913
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,517
that it never could.

914
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,438
It's obvious
that I'm not the right girl for you.

915
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,483
So why…

916
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,280
Why do you keep making me want more?

917
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,077
Stop liking me.

918
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,997
Stop trying to get close to me.

919
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,253
What you're worried about

920
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,422
will never happen. I promise.

921
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:12,882
So…

922
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,803
stay by my side.

923
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:21,159
