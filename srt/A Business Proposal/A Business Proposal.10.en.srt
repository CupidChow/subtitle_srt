00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,466
EPISODE 10

2
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,551
Do you want to go for a walk to sober up?

3
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,763
Sure.

4
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,479
What are you doing there?

5
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,738
Sir.

6
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,617
Why are you two alone so late at night?

7
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,577
That's…

8
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,788
She and I had something to discuss work--

9
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,207
Stop. Enough!

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,500
Ms. Shin.

11
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,336
Why don't you explain yourself?

12
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,713
Why exactly

13
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,008
is the president of a company
meeting with his employee

14
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,844
secretly like this?

15
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,139
That's…

16
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,268
It's suspicious.

17
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,896
Every time I see you,

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,194
you cover your face with your hair
like some female ghost.

19
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,904
Wait, sir.

20
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,364
-Sorry.
-Damn it.

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,990
Look at her, there she goes again.

22
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,700
Ms. Shin!

23
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,164
Chairman Kang.

24
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,124
Hello, sir!

25
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,252
What? Were you going
for a second round of drinks

26
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,795
with Chairman Kang without us?

27
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,796
Right?

28
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,965
What's she talking about?

29
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,759
Our team had a team dinner
with President Kang, sir.

30
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,595
All of you had a team dinner together?

31
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,056
Yes, sir. Since the researchers
have been working so hard lately,

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,476
President Kang bought us dinner
as a way to encourage us.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,187
But our youngest employee
left her phone behind.

34
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,147
Is that so?

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,899
Then you should have told me that
from the very beginning.

36
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,025
Right?

37
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,362
Why didn't you tell him? Ms. Shin.

38
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
What?

39
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,199
Right?

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,288
By the way, is that rumor true?
Is your hair really a wig…

41
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,668
She dropped the bomb!

42
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,920
We'll be going, then.

43
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,381
-Sure.
-Please get home safe.

44
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,465
Good night, sir!

45
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,553
-Her cell phone!
-What?

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:02:59,929
Phone!

47
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,354
I should get going, too.

48
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,814
Yes, it's late, so you should.

49
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,732
Yes. Goodbye, sir.

50
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,150
Okay.

51
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,238
Look at her.

52
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,699
We should go, too.

53
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,867
Okay.

54
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,417
Good night.

55
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,003
How long will you keep it a secret?

56
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,839
A secret?

57
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,593
I heard it from Director Go,
so don't even think about denying it.

58
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,429
You're seeing someone.

59
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,183
You even had the secretary's office
send her a pair of heels, right?

60
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,562
Is it the woman you brought to Sokcho?

61
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,734
Is that why you didn't go
on the blind date with Yu-jeong?

62
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,654
Who is it? Why are you hiding her
from me like this?

63
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,113
I'm not trying to hide her.

64
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,865
Are you worried I won't approve?

65
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,702
Don't you know me?

66
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:10,458
I approved of Geum-hui
because you said you liked her.

67
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,335
Have you already forgotten?

68
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,266
I'll introduce her to you soon.

69
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,185
So please trust me
and wait just a bit longer.

70
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,437
Good night.

71
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,816
Yes, Sung-hoon.

72
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,276
The TFT Report?

73
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,027
I'll check on it.

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,364
Who on earth is she?

75
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,998
I'm good. You guys can hang out
without me. I don't have any money.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,043
What? Ye-jin's coming, too?

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,629
Okay, I'll call you later.

78
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,217
He was fine
at Won-sik's wedding last month.

79
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,305
You know how older people's condition
can change every day.

80
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,599
Besides, he was over 90 years old
and approaching 100.

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,227
Are you going to
Won-sik's grandfather's funeral?

82
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,186
Yes. We're going to Masan

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,104
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

84
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,523
and we'll be back tomorrow, so be good.

85
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,234
-What about the store?
-We'll have to close it for a day.

86
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,487
Lock the door well
and call us if anything happens.

87
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,198
I'll clean it up, so don't worry.

88
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,409
Mom, could you give me some money?

89
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,910
Ha-ri, we're going now.

90
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,288
Ha-ri's not home, Mom!

91
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,290
I have to use it for something.

92
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,085
Do you really need it?

93
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,503
Yes!

94
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,215
What are you going to spend it on?

95
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,551
Why are you spending so much money lately?

96
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,219
You always resort to violence.

97
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,014
It's better
than asking for money all the time.

98
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,641
Quiet! Where did she go
so early in the morning?

99
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,399
Why are you outside like this?

100
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,651
I couldn't stay in that house
all by myself.

101
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,529
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

102
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,907
I'm going to kill him!

103
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,160
Where is he? Where is that bastard?

104
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,621
Here.

105
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,292
I should warn you.
It's really big. I'm not kidding.

106
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,585
Like this.

107
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,506
It's still just a cockroach.

108
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,940
What's so scary about a cockroach?

109
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,025
You called me all the way here
on my day off.

110
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,321
If you were that scared,
why didn't you ask your boyfriend?

111
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,282
Ask what boyfriend?

112
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,578
What? What do you mean?

113
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,459
What? President Kang sent Mr. Cha
to the blind date in his place?

114
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,629
Kang Tae-moo is annoying,
but Cha Sung-hoon is even worse.

115
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,841
He's in the wrong, but he still
hasn't contacted me even once.

116
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,386
It's probably because he feels bad.
Don't be like that. Just--

117
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,472
No. It's all over. Dating or whatever.

118
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:16,102
If I keep seeing such an indecisive man,
I'll just become frustrated like I am now.

119
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,396
Come on.

120
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,357
Speaking of being frustrated,
don't you want some dumplings now?

121
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,608
What?

122
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,153
-Dumplings.
-Dumplings.

123
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,448
It's just around the corner.

124
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,199
I'm hungry.

125
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,412
What?

126
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,748
-Cha Sung-hoon?
-Rock, paper, scissors!

127
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,378
-Why are those two…
-They're playing rock, paper, scissors?

128
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
Here you go.

129
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,968
Should I call them?

130
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,678
No, it's fine. They're going.

131
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,054
They're going.

132
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,806
-If they're leaving, why…
-Taxi!

133
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,852
-Come on, quick!
-Should I get in?

134
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,729
-Get in!
-Wait, hey.

135
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,523
Sir, could you follow
that blue car in front of us?

136
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,608
-Quickly!
-Sure.

137
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,067
You're going to follow them?

138
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,361
-Come on, get in!
-Get in?

139
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,830
We're about to break up,

140
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,750
but he's going on a joyride
with Kang Tae-moo?

141
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,752
They're both dead.

142
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,837
Why President Kang?

143
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,548
He must be here since
Mr. Cha's feeling depressed. Like me.

144
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,259
Have you forgotten who caused all this?

145
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,887
Who sent him
on that blind date in his place?

146
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,598
Right? Yes.

147
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,483
TRUE LIGHT ORPHANAGE

148
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,069
Thank you.

149
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,238
Where did they go?

150
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,989
I think they went in here, right?

151
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,032
Yes.

152
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,785
-Let's go.
-You're going in?

153
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,119
-Come on!
-Hey…

154
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,287
Have you been well?

155
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,705
Of course.

156
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,582
How long has it been?

157
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,626
-It's good to see you.
-What is this place?

158
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,128
-Are the kids doing well?
-Yes.

159
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,213
Young-seo?

160
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,223
How did you…

161
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,603
Mr. Cha, this is…

162
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,314
Are you…

163
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,276
This is my girlfriend.

164
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,654
Really? It's nice to meet you.

165
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,739
I'm glad you came.

166
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,035
Say hello. This is my mother.

167
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,915
-Hello.
-Hello.

168
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,292
Hello.

169
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,049
Then, you were
at that restaurant yesterday?

170
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,220
Sung-hoon wanted to introduce you to me.

171
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming yesterday…

172
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,941
Have some tea first.

173
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,943
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

174
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,778
Yes, thank you.

175
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,956
That's when Sung-hoon was five

176
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,292
on the day he first came here.

177
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,586
I see.

178
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,552
They're President Kang Tae-moo's parents.

179
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,222
When they were alive, they supported
our orphanage for a long time.

180
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,894
And thanks to that,

181
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,397
Sung-hoon came to live at my house
when he started middle school.

182
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:56,822
No wonder your relationship
seemed quite extraordinary.

183
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,283
Is that so?

184
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,872
-Hello.
-Hi.

185
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,458
Tae-woo, Ye-ri, and Min-gyu.
How have you been?

186
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,377
-Good.
-You've grown a lot.

187
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,670
Have you been eating well?

188
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,629
Yes!

189
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,256
What's this? A laptop?

190
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,174
Yes.

191
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,635
For the older children
going to high school.

192
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,552
That's cool.

193
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,137
-It must be nice.
-I'm so jealous.

194
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,264
I'll buy you one too
when you go to school.

195
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,811
Let's have a look.

196
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,104
Do you want to open it?

197
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,232
I heard a lot about you from Sung-hoon.

198
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,652
I didn't even know
that he had a story like this.

199
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,822
He usually doesn't tell people
what's going on inside his head.

200
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,493
So I was so surprised when he said he
wanted to introduce his girlfriend to me.

201
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,247
I'm sorry. I bet you were disappointed
when you saw me.

202
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,998
Disappointed?

203
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,501
It seems like it's all Sung-hoon's fault.

204
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,755
And now he's acting so indecisive
about how to apologize.

205
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,006
You're frustrated, right?

206
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,133
Yes.

207
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,051
How do you know so well?

208
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,679
It's like you're a psychic…

209
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,932
Sorry. I'm sorry.

210
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,518
That's just how he is.

211
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,771
He might act a bit frustrating sometimes,

212
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,651
but he's not a bad kid.
So try to understand him a bit.

213
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,114
I know that Mr. Cha is thoughtful
and dependable.

214
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:25,369
If Sung-hoon makes you
frustrated again, call me.

215
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,246
I'll buy you a drink.

216
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,289
Really?

217
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,626
I can really drink a lot.
Don't regret saying that later.

218
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,670
Okay, Mother?

219
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:46,056
Oh, right. If it's all right with you,
could you give me a picture of Mr. Cha?

220
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,808
He's just so cute.

221
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,979
He had a pretty smile even back then.

222
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,190
-He still does, doesn't he?
-Yes

223
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,067
He's so cute.

224
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,662
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,332
For not telling you about this.

226
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,006
Do you have an overdraft account?

227
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,383
What?

228
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,220
I recently made one for the first time.

229
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,014
I didn't want to give in to my dad,

230
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,433
but my living expenses cost
a lot more than I expected.

231
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,227
So I made one,

232
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,646
and now I'm about 20 million won in debt.

233
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,274
Also, my blood type is Rh-negative B

234
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,194
so it's harder for me
to get transfusions than others.

235
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,363
My parents got a divorce
when I was in high school.

236
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,283
I know that my mom went to Germany

237
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,203
but I don't know
what she does or how she's doing.

238
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,499
Did I miss anything?

239
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,711
-Young-seo.
-What I'm trying to say is

240
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,257
that I haven't told you
about many things too.

241
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,676
One day,

242
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,679
we'll be able to tell each other
about these things.

243
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,806
Once we get closer with time.

244
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,437
You shouldn't be sorry
about not telling me about it sooner,

245
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,355
but about

246
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,150
making me meet your mother
looking like this.

247
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,488
After our fight, you should have
begged me for forgiveness

248
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,574
and asked me
to come see your mother together.

249
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,118
If I dress up, I can look really pretty.

250
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,036
But today, look at me.

251
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,673
You still look pretty.

252
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,134
The prettiest in the world.

253
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,639
Then hug me
instead of just holding my hand.

254
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,812
Sung-hoon! Let's play together!

255
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,105
Okay, sure.

256
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,860
Hey, Sung-hoon's here.

257
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,363
I wonder if Ms. Jin's less angry now.

258
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,616
That was your…

259
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,993
It was your fault.

260
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,164
Why did you send Mr. Cha
to that blind date in your place?

261
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,875
What? Don't you know who I did that for?

262
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,752
Are you saying it was for me?

263
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,548
Who's the person who ran over
because she was worried

264
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,175
I might go on a blind date?

265
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,343
Worried?

266
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,845
There's no way I was worried.

267
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,930
Who, me?

268
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:36,226
That's because you like me so much.

269
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,271
And it's because you said
you'd keep confessing your love to me

270
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,397
until I accepted it.

271
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,692
"I should be kind and understanding,
and accept his feelings."

272
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,070
That's what I thought
when I ran there that day.

273
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,237
Is that so?

274
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,323
I had no idea.

275
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,576
Well, at least you know now.

276
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,130
Thank you for accepting my feelings.

277
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,592
What if someone sees us?

278
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,596
Who cares? I'm just hugging my girlfriend.

279
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,603
I can't wait until the entire world
knows about us.

280
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,448
It's because you feel bad
about lying to your grandfather, right?

281
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,953
Actually, that day, I--

282
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,247
When you feel ready,

283
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,916
let's tell him.

284
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,885
Ha-ri! Come on, let's play together.

285
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,015
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

286
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,975
Over here. Pass it to me!

287
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,643
-Okay.
-Here!

288
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,686
Hey!

289
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,812
No!

290
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,939
-That's more like it!
-Over here!

291
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,649
Let's go!

292
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,328
-Okay.
-Shoot!

293
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,496
That's right!

294
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,230
This is fun.
I haven't played with the kids in a while.

295
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,732
It feels great.

296
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,775
Yes.

297
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,943
I still feel a bit stiff.

298
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,653
Maybe it wasn't enough.

299
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,738
Right?

300
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:57,451
Really? You were both running so hard
and sprinting as fast as you could.

301
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,245
And after all that running,
the kids still look so fresh.

302
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,921
Yes, Hyeong-jun. What's up?

303
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,966
What? What about Ha-min?

304
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,225
Ha-min, what are you doing?

305
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,690
I'm looking at it right now.

306
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,777
Ha-min's not answering my call.
He turned his phone off.

307
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,864
Okay, yes.

308
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,369
Ha-min, you son of a…

309
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,996
I'm going to kill him.

310
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,042
Sorry, you're here because of me.

311
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,460
It's fine.

312
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,587
You were cute even when you were young.

313
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,257
Hey, what are you looking at?

314
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,844
Can you give me a picture
of when you were young?

315
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,680
Hey, his silliness is similar to mine.

316
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,891
I just can't get used to this.

317
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,227
Are you guys hungry?
Should we go eat something?

318
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,728
Yes, I'm getting a bit hungry.

319
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,815
Are you taking customers?

320
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:11,942
One moment.

321
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,240
I just came back from hiking,
so my legs hurt and I'm hungry.

322
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,827
But all of the restaurants are on break,
so they're not taking customers.

323
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,830
Could I have some fried chicken?

324
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,291
But we…

325
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,294
Chicken.

326
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,302
She seems very hungry.
Let's make her some chicken.

327
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,429
Yes, let's do that.

328
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,476
Our smallest portion is half a chicken,
so let me get you half--

329
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,230
Half a chicken is way too small. Wait.

330
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,526
Come on in. They're open.

331
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,861
Come on.

332
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,656
Look, a handsome guy
is working at this one.

333
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,782
Yes. He's handsome.

334
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:09,041
Can you give us ten fried chickens?
One of each kind.

335
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,002
-You're so handsome.
-Ten?

336
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,421
Some draft beer, first.
Some beer over here!

337
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,505
I want some soju.

338
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,882
Let me get you tables…

339
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,342
Draft beers it is.

340
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,010
It'll be so delicious.

341
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,221
Eight glasses of draft beer.

342
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,890
-My gosh.
-You're so strong.

343
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,934
-Thank you.
-Thank you

344
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,020
-Here's some hot pizza too.
-Make way.

345
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,439
-It looks so good.
-Enjoy your meal.

346
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,566
This is a really good restaurant.

347
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,235
Let's go here. Want to say cheers?

348
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,778
Over here.

349
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,071
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

350
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,364
It looks delicious!

351
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,117
Did you ever work as a waiter?
How are you so good?

352
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,494
For a bit in New York.

353
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,247
Did Tae-moo make you
earn money even in New York?

354
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,915
As if.

355
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,250
He worked with me.

356
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,334
Really?

357
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,045
That's unexpected.

358
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,063
TUMBLING

359
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,529
What's that?

360
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,614
This? It's powdered brown rice.

361
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,575
If you coat the chicken with it,
it becomes really crispy.

362
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,160
-Really?
-Yes.

363
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,912
I wonder what it tastes like.

364
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,622
Do you want to know?

365
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
COMPLETE

366
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,217
-Try it.
-What?

367
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,260
Say "ah."

368
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,851
How is it? It's crispy, right?

369
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,731
But this is the customers'…

370
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,483
I fried more than usual
so we could eat too.

371
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,194
If you dip this in sauce,
it's even better.

372
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,834
This curry goes well with the chicken.

373
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,752
Right?

374
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,883
Is it still not done?
The customers are waiting.

375
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,551
Yes, it'll be right out.

376
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,261
Hurry.

377
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,681
Come on.

378
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,891
Come on, quick.

379
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,892
What are you doing?

380
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,268
You're drunk.

381
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,395
Be careful on your way back.

382
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,980
Where are you going, Yeong-suk?

383
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,941
Oh, my God.

384
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,861
Let me apologize

385
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,821
properly.

386
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,161
I'm sorry for making Sung-hoon
go to that blind date in my place.

387
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,621
It won't happen again.

388
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,540
I think your apology is kind of insincere.

389
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,836
-What?
-You should try a lot harder to apologize.

390
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,298
Or at least try to bribe me,
don't you think so?

391
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,759
A bribe?

392
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,270
Will this be enough?

393
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,155
What are you watching?

394
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,241
What? Nothing.

395
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,534
It's a bribe.

396
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,956
I'm sorry that you guys didn't
get to eat because of me.

397
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,957
Help yourselves.

398
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,834
It's okay.

399
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,045
Hey!

400
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,340
Oh, my goodness.

401
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,051
Your expensive clothes will get stained.

402
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,511
-It's okay.
-Get him a tissue.

403
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,138
Do you have any clothes for him?

404
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,223
Shin Ha-ri, my goodness.

405
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,767
One second.

406
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,323
You can change into this.

407
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,242
I can just let it dry.

408
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,910
I think it's going to stain.

409
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,163
I'll wash it quickly, so it'll be okay.

410
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,876
Come on. Change.

411
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,712
You're going to watch me?

412
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,802
You can watch if you want.

413
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,806
Of course, I don't want to watch.
Go to Ha-min's room--

414
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,765
No, I'll show you.

415
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,476
Come on, go to Ha-min's room and change.

416
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,440
We should have just spent the night there.

417
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,068
Why would you sleep over
at Man-sik's place?

418
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,740
The whole neighborhood knows he used
to chase you around because he liked you.

419
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,784
What? Young-seo.

420
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,411
Why are you guys back so early?

421
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,665
Why are you here at this hour?

422
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,378
Who's this?

423
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,005
This is my boyfriend.

424
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,298
This is Ha-ri's father.

425
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,134
Really?

426
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,762
Oh, so you were having a drink together?

427
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,721
Yes.

428
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,098
It's nice to meet you.

429
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,143
I'm Ha-ri's father.

430
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,520
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Sung-hoon.

431
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,774
Darn it. They can't find out.

432
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,534
Is it okay to borrow
your brother's clothes?

433
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,287
It's fine. He won't even notice
that it's missing.

434
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,082
What's so funny?

435
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,125
-It's just…
-Ms. Han!

436
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,088
Ms. Han!

437
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,090
Why do you keep calling me today?

438
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,634
Ms. Han!

439
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,804
Ha-ri, your parents are back!

440
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,805
Yes, I'm back.

441
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,098
Wait, I…

442
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,852
-Shoes.
-Shoes?

443
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,234
Ms. Han, wait.

444
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,527
What?

445
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,529
Well…

446
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,907
Please let me introduce you
to my boyfriend.

447
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,950
-Boyfriend?
-Yes.

448
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,493
You've got a boyfriend?

449
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,287
Where is he? Where?

450
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,630
He's at the store. Yes. He's at the store.

451
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,631
He is?

452
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,925
-Let's go down to the store.
-Really?

453
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,051
-Let's go.
-Sure.

454
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,845
I wonder where Ha-min is. I'll--

455
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,257
Have another glass.

456
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,302
We must have interrupted your date.

457
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,470
Not at all.

458
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,973
Let me pour you a glass, sir.

459
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,433
Sure.

460
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,478
-He's handsome, Young-seo.
-Right?

461
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,981
Sung-hoon? Mr. Cha Sung-hoon?

462
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,316
Yes, ma'am. Cha Sung-hoon.

463
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,026
Just looking at his face
must make you happy!

464
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,653
Right? Isn't he so handsome?

465
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,823
How did you two meet? Where?

466
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,575
Did Ha-ri set you guys up?

467
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,702
No, they live next to each other.

468
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,620
Yes.

469
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,748
Mom, Dad. You must be tired.
Should we call it a night now?

470
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,793
I'm not tired. Honey, are you tired?

471
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,294
-What?
-He's not.

472
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,629
-Right.
-He's not.

473
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,339
If you are, go ahead and rest.

474
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,591
-Dad must be tired.
-No, he's not tired.

475
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,470
So you're working as a secretary?

476
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,055
Isn't it so hard?

477
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:07,310
I heard that the president of your company
is well known for being fussy and mean.

478
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,645
Oh, my goodness.

479
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,856
He's not that kind of person.

480
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,733
He's very kind and gentle.

481
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,988
-Pour me a glass, too.
-Sure.

482
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,617
After this, I'll speak more casually.

483
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,369
Please do so.

484
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,751
This is nice. Getting a drink
from my second daughter's boyfriend.

485
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:39,050
Do you remember when Young-seo
first came to our house?

486
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:43,555
She was so skinny
as if she hadn't eaten for days.

487
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,434
She moved schools
when she was in high school.

488
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,479
But apparently,
she just slept at lunchtime

489
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,732
without eating a single grain of rice.

490
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:57,819
So Ha-ri brought her home
after school. To feed her.

491
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,739
The meal you cooked for me
was so delicious.

492
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,074
After that, I kept coming back
to eat your food.

493
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,286
You can keep coming,
and I'll cook for you.

494
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,372
You can do it even
after you get married and have a baby.

495
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,125
Here.

496
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,335
-What?
-Who drank it all? It's empty.

497
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,839
Oh, my. Since there's no more alcohol,
let's wrap this up, shall we?

498
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,550
Yes. I'll officially
introduce Sung-hoon next time.

499
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,052
-Yes.
-No, I'm just getting started.

500
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,223
Remember the traditional liquor you got
when you received that company award?

501
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,558
What happened to that?

502
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,851
Where did I put that?

503
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,772
What do you mean? I put it
in Ha-ri's room with her certificate.

504
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,273
We should drink that.

505
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,317
My room? Dad, wait.

506
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,319
-Wait!
-Dad, I'll go get it!

507
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,612
There's a bit left here.

508
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,031
It doesn't matter who brings it.

509
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,491
My dad's coming in!

510
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,203
Let's see.

511
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,248
Gosh.

512
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,504
It's good that we saved it, right?

513
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,088
Yes.

514
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,423
Goodness.

515
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,760
Honey.

516
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,515
President Kang.

517
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,266
President Kang!

518
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,103
Ha-ri!

519
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,065
Oh, on.

520
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,567
Are you all right?
You must have been startled.

521
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,489
I don't think it'll end soon.

522
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,003
-Maybe…
-Yes?

523
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,048
You can jump down from here.

524
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,428
I'll die.

525
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,513
-Right?
-Yes.

526
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,973
I just feel so anxious.

527
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,559
Ha-ri, what are you doing in there?

528
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,643
I'm coming!

529
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,606
-I should…
-Go back in there. I'll come back soon.

530
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,652
Don't rummage around in there.

531
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,903
What? Okay.

532
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,996
Right now!

533
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,205
Now?

534
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,045
Why is this so high?

535
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,423
Mr. Cha, can you get this for me?

536
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,924
Sure.

537
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,176
-Yes.
-Here.

538
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,470
-Which one? That one?
-Yes.

539
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,680
-Wait.
-That one?

540
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,764
How about this one?

541
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,142
Which one should I get?

542
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,476
Which one?

543
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,644
-This one.
-This one?

544
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,025
This one? That one looks good, too.

545
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,735
-Get this one for me.
-This one?

546
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,405
Ha-ri, where are you going?

547
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,658
Ha-ri's going down to the store
to get some beer.

548
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,620
Mr. Shin, let's have
another drink together.

549
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,748
Let's do that.

550
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,625
That scared me.

551
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,253
You have no idea how scared I was.
What a relief.

552
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,258
What are you thinking about?

553
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,551
What?

554
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,306
I was wondering how much longer
we need to keep this a secret.

555
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,893
They seemed to like Sung-hoon.

556
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,812
I want to introduce myself
to them officially too.

557
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,356
Ye-jin, did you get back home?

558
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,566
Yes, I'm almost home.

559
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,901
What?

560
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,195
Okay, call me later.
Let's watch another movie.

561
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,738
-Yes, let's do that.
-Get down!

562
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,826
My gosh.

563
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,787
This car is awesome.

564
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,374
When will I get to drive a car like this?

565
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,089
When can I buy something like this?

566
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,345
Shin Ha-ri!

567
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:00,853
Hey!

568
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,480
Wait a second.

569
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,399
-Who's this?
-I'm--

570
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,484
Ha-min, I can explain. Just a moment.

571
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,486
Hey, isn't that my shirt?

572
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,030
Are you dating some jobless bum?

573
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,156
Is he broke?

574
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,325
-My money…
-No, that's not it…

575
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,203
Hey, what kind of punk are you?
Why are you with my sister?

576
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,414
Hey, watch your mouth!
This is the president.

577
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,373
President?

578
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,083
What president?

579
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,251
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,545
I'll tell you who I am.

581
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,802
I'm Kang Tae-moo, the president
of go food and Ha-ri's boyfriend.

582
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,640
Kang Tae-moo, the president of go food?

583
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,272
I'm sorry. I was so rude.

584
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,065
No, I should be apologizing.

585
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,735
But out of all people, why date my sister?

586
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,654
Does she have something on you?

587
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,531
Is she blackmailing you?

588
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,490
Ha-min.

589
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:01,289
I don't mind being blackmailed
if I can stay with her forever.

590
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,917
What was that?

591
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,671
You're a really straightforward guy,
brother-in-law?

592
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,133
Brother-in-law?

593
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,051
Yes.

594
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,600
Go buy yourself some clothes,
brother-in-law.

595
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,603
This is awesome!
Thanks, fellow brother-in-law.

596
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,438
Stop it. You're going to spoil him.

597
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,522
Ha-min.

598
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,861
Come by the office sometime.
I'll pay you back for today.

599
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,238
Do you mean it? I'll really go soon.

600
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,198
Sure.

601
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,199
Goodbye, now.

602
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,700
-Good night.
-Get home safe.

603
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,744
Goodbye. I'll see you later.

604
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,497
Call me!

605
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,750
Bye.

606
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,043
He's so cool.

607
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,003
Follow me, Ha-min.

608
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,213
Damn it.

609
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,631
You little…

610
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,715
-What?
-Hey!

611
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,509
How on earth did you two meet?

612
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,719
Never mind that.

613
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,222
-I'll tell Mom and Dad--
-You won't tell them, right?

614
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,474
Then I won't tell them about him either.

615
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,230
Keep your promise.

616
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,439
Of course.

617
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,276
Anyway, does his family know
that you're dating?

618
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,613
Why do you want to know?

619
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,491
I'm just worried
that a rich family like his

620
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,743
won't be happy
with a normal family like ours.

621
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,831
We won't be able to cover your marriage
expenses even if we sell our store.

622
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,416
Should I debut as an idol
and make that money?

623
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,801
Do you think becoming an idol is easy?

624
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,263
Stop talking nonsense and don't worry.

625
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,306
Let's go home.

626
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,517
Wait for me.

627
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,839
So adorable.

628
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,594
Young-seo…

629
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,221
I miss you so much.

630
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,436
-Tae-moo, do something.
-What's this?

631
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,645
When did you get here?

632
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,691
This? Mr. Kang gave it to me as a bribe.

633
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,403
-Erase it!
-Why? It's so cute.

634
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,487
Come on, erase it.

635
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,281
"Young-seo, I can't break up with you!"

636
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,033
Young-seo, erase it, come on.

637
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,826
"Young-seo, why aren't you responding?"

638
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,620
-No, erase it.
-No, don't erase it.

639
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,996
Don't move, wait…

640
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,040
Wait, that hurts, wait…

641
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,379
Cha Sung-hoon, 29 years old.

642
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,840
He's currently working as a secretary
at go food.

643
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,595
Okay. You can go.

644
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,596
Sir.

645
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,101
I told her to try
getting with Kang Tae-moo,

646
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,562
but she's seeing his secretary?

647
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,568
BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI

648
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,488
I registered my marriage
with Geum-hui today.

649
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,614
What?

650
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:26,077
-What did you say?
-So please approve of our relationship.

651
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,496
What about Ye-ri then?

652
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,455
I'm sorry.

653
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
The only woman I love

654
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,876
is Geum-hui.

655
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,004
Don't you know
what Ye-ri has done for you?

656
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,423
You ungrateful bastard!

657
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,218
You bastard!

658
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,554
The merger and acquisition is coming up.

659
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,640
How dare you do this?

660
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:51,477
Sir, I'm going to back out
of this merger and acquisition.

661
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,650
Ms. Oh!

662
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,111
Ms. Oh!

663
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,863
-Father!
-Sir!

664
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,909
Father! Mr. Kim, call the ambulance.

665
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,619
-My goodness.
-Father!

666
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,705
No way.

667
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,040
Did he really die?

668
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,875
Gwang-bok's father?

669
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,086
That makes no sense.

670
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,131
How can he die of shock because
his son's marrying a regular woman?

671
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,633
Parents are just like that.

672
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,762
If you're rich, it's only natural to want
a daughter-in-law from a rich family.

673
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,764
I guess it's better for people

674
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,142
from two similar families
to marry each other.

675
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,437
I hope his family isn't like that.

676
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,897
What?

677
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,357
Nothing.

678
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,360
-Hello.
-Min-woo!

679
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
Hi, Min-woo.

680
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,157
Min-woo, what brings you here
at this hour?

681
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,493
I brought some good abalones for you.
You like abalones, Mr. Shin.

682
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,331
But they're so expensive.

683
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,458
Min-woo, you haven't
eaten dinner yet, right?

684
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,085
We were about to eat some noodles.

685
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,670
No, I've already eaten.

686
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,547
By the way, where's Ha-ri?

687
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,424
She went out to see Yoo-ra.

688
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,884
-Yoo-ra?
-Yes.

689
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,554
She wanted to have a drink with Ha-ri.
I thought you'd be with them.

690
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,481
You wanted to see me? What's the occasion?

691
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,650
Would you like a drink, too?

692
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,652
Please get us another glass.

693
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,949
You said you needed to talk.

694
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,410
Didn't you say it's urgent?

695
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,248
Shin Ha-ri.

696
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,834
You…

697
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,172
Can you please get out of Min-woo's life?

698
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,634
Are you trying
to get back at me or something?

699
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,178
What?

700
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,348
You told me seven years ago
that you liked Min-woo.

701
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,810
And you said that you'd back off
if I felt the same way.

702
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,271
Yes. I wasn't interested in him at first.

703
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,149
But since you said you liked him,

704
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,069
I decided to date him
because I didn't want to give him to you.

705
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,406
But you're trying to sway Min-woo
because of that now? How petty.

706
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,574
I think you're really drunk.

707
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,161
-Let's talk next time.
-Why didn't you tell him about that?

708
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,206
That I dated Seong-gyu
behind Min-woo's back

709
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,833
before I went to study abroad.

710
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,128
If you had told Min-woo about that,

711
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,921
he and I would've broken up.

712
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,507
Then you two might be dating right now.

713
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,676
Why didn't you tell him?

714
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,473
I thought it was too cruel.

715
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:40,062
How could I tell that to a guy whose
entire world ended when you left him?

716
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,399
But Yoo-ra,

717
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,318
right now, I regret it.

718
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,573
I wish I had told Min-woo about it.

719
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,414
Min-woo.

720
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,968
Ha-ri.

721
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,011
Ha-ri!

722
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,514
What did you mean by that?

723
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,099
What you said just now.

724
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,729
You're making a huge mistake.
You shouldn't be doing this.

725
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,689
To both me and Yoo-ra.

726
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,735
Okay.

727
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm sorry, Ha-ri.

728
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,822
Don't apologize to me.
Go apologize to Yoo-ra.

729
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,658
Now that I've seen how you act,

730
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,661
I can understand
why Yoo-ra's acting that way.

731
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,309
Hello? What's up?
You don't usually call this late.

732
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,477
It's just…

733
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,271
I stepped out for a bit

734
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,691
and got bored.

735
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,237
I miss you too.

736
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,991
You have a weird way
of telling me you miss me.

737
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,244
Do you want me to come?

738
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,829
No, it's okay.

739
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,581
It's late.

740
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,252
Let's…

741
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,464
go on a proper date after work tomorrow.

742
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,469
Let's go somewhere nice. Okay?

743
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,403
Hello. You two came to work early.

744
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,612
Hey.

745
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,620
I made a few different versions
of the mint chocolate cookie.

746
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,540
Could you check the ingredients
and pick the best one?

747
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,541
Sure.

748
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,751
Mr. Gye.

749
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,630
Didn't you say you'd change the formula
for the mint chocolate ice cream bar?

750
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,218
Mr. Gye?

751
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,345
Ms. Kim, tell Ms. Yeo

752
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,432
that I'll turn in the formula sheet
later this afternoon.

753
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,518
-What?
-Why would you ask Ms. Kim to…

754
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,020
Mr. Gye.

755
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,981
Please get it to me before noon.

756
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,651
Mr. Gye!

757
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,945
Ms. Kim, please tell Ms. Yeo

758
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,489
that I'm going to come up
with the formulas right now.

759
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,450
Coffee.

760
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,745
-I can't believe him.
-Did you two have a fight?

761
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,417
Last weekend, all of us who entered
the company together met up.

762
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,712
And he wanted to tell the people there
that we're in a relationship.

763
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,590
I said no, and now he's mad at me.

764
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,759
I think that was your fault, Ms. Yeo.

765
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,053
I know it might seem a bit weird

766
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,721
because you two are quite old,

767
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,972
but why does it matter?

768
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,182
You have no idea.

769
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,352
Nothing good comes out of people
knowing you're dating someone at work.

770
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,146
If either one of us
makes a mistake while working,

771
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,274
people will talk behind our backs
that we slacked off.

772
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,776
If we break up,

773
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,654
then they'll talk about
whose fault it was behind our backs.

774
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,155
I don't want to think about it.

775
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,283
I don't know why people are so nosy.

776
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,620
Did you hear about that newbie
who's dating Mr. Cho?

777
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,579
Who?

778
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,997
The one from the admin team.

779
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,583
Mr. Cho? The handsome guy
who looks like Jung-kook?

780
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,793
Who's dating him?

781
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,878
I'm going to ask in the group chat.

782
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,505
Here's one.

783
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,924
Someone who's really nosy.

784
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,552
Right.

785
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,513
The microbial analysis table is ready.

786
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,847
I'm going down.

787
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,807
Okay.

788
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,143
It's no problem.

789
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,897
It's their job, ma'am.

790
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,110
Tae-moo visited a couple of days ago?

791
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,153
What?

792
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,572
He went there with who?

793
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,748
I got here as quickly as I could.
Did you wait for a long time?

794
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,126
No. What do you want to eat?

795
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,795
Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or Western.
Just say the word.

796
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,965
I can get a table at any
restaurant in Seoul with one call.

797
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,137
Then let's start
with some greasy Western food,

798
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,139
and finish off
with some spicy Korean food?

799
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,723
Sure.

800
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,797
I've always wanted to go
on a certain kind of date

801
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,966
in weather like this if I got a boyfriend.

802
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,092
I want to do that now.

803
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,220
Can we?

804
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,600
The subway is the best when it rains.

805
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,226
There's no traffic or anything.

806
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,076
The next station is Dangsan station.

807
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,872
The doors are on your right.

808
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,917
If you are heading towards Gaehwa
or Sinnonhyeon,

809
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,252
please transfer to line…

810
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,170
Ha-ri.

811
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,559
Thanks.

812
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,105
Have you ever been on a subway in Korea?

813
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,483
No, it's my first time.

814
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,485
It's your first time? With me, right now?

815
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,779
What?

816
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,947
Really?

817
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,115
Korean subways are the best.

818
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,286
This train is the one I used to take
when I was in college.

819
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,456
My house was in the east,
and my school was in the west.

820
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,875
One day, Young-seo and I were
on the train together,

821
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,418
and we both fell asleep.

822
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,295
We should have woken up,

823
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,799
but we fell asleep
until we got to the last station.

824
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,554
Is the restaurant
that you want to go to nearby?

825
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,890
Before that, we need to go somewhere.

826
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,058
Follow me.

827
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,577
It's so pretty.

828
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,120
Do you like flowers?

829
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,080
Is there a woman who doesn't?

830
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,916
It was my dream to go to a place
like this with my boyfriend

831
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,126
if I ever got one.

832
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,419
It came true then.

833
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,462
That's true.

834
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,925
The carnations are so pretty.
So many different colors.

835
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,594
Look, there are purple carnations.

836
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,763
I think those are lisianthuses,
not carnations.

837
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,768
Right, lisian… Yes.

838
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,104
This one's pretty too.

839
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,148
These are…

840
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,358
Probably not carnations.

841
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,444
Aren't those mudans?

842
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,612
Mudans?

843
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,407
Nope, these are Peonies.

844
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,119
They're the same thing.

845
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:41,126
Hey, the name doesn't matter.
Don't be bound by formalities.

846
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,502
I was trying to say,

847
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,921
"focus on the beauty
of the flower", you know?

848
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,382
That's true.
Whether you're Geum-hui or Ha-ri,

849
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,344
you're still the prettiest woman
in the world.

850
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,265
Is today some special anniversary
or something?

851
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,643
How would you like your flowers?

852
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,560
Well…

853
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,064
Here you go.

854
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,234
Is this right?

855
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,239
Look at those flowers. I'm so jealous.

856
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,451
I almost forgot.

857
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,497
There's food that we have to eat
on a rainy day like this.

858
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,082
Let's go.

859
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,376
Thank you.

860
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,336
Enjoy.

861
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,472
It's so good.

862
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,724
Is it really that good?

863
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,436
When the weather is so humid
and gloomy like this,

864
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,108
you need to eat some jeon
that are oily and crispy like this.

865
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,025
Try it.

866
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,079
The texture is very unique.

867
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,457
How did they make it so crispy?

868
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,418
No, don't do that.

869
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,295
We're on a date. Don't talk about work.

870
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,630
Stop thinking about work.

871
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,966
Look.

872
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,593
You need to enjoy the food like this.

873
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,853
Like this?

874
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,604
Yes, like that.

875
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,610
He came with an employee.

876
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,739
I think her name was Shin Ha-ri.

877
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,657
If you look at it this way,

878
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,618
she looks a bit similar.

879
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,832
But at the same time, she doesn't.

880
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,506
Secretary Kim.

881
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,719
There's an employee named Shin Ha-ri

882
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,889
in Food Product Development Team 1…

883
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,182
This one looks good, too.

884
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,105
Excuse me.

885
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,410
Why is it pouring again?

886
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,544
I'm going down right now.

887
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,588
Yes.

888
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,382
You know, President Kang?

889
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,386
Doesn't he look more and more
like the late president?

890
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,971
Tell me about it.

891
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,683
Sometimes, I'm surprised
how much they look alike.

892
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,851
Right?

893
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,896
So what if he's the heir?

894
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,899
When he witnessed
his parents' car accident as a child.

895
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,901
It was an accident in the rain, right?

896
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,571
Yes. That's why
he can't even drive when it rains.

897
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,620
The doors are closing.

898
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,457
What is it?

899
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,167
I wanted to sit next to you.

900
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,138
Thanks.

901
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,563
Ms. Yeo and Mr. Gye
had a really bad fight today.

902
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,316
It got really uncomfortable.

903
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:18,737
President Kang, you can't make it obvious
to the employees when you're upset, okay?

904
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,072
Your employees will feel so uncomfortable.

905
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,533
Anyway…

906
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,452
it wasn't like
I could take someone's side.

907
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,371
I thought about what to do
for a long time with Ms. Kim.

908
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:32,125
Then we decided to have them talk it out
rather than take anyone's side.

909
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,127
So we wanted to let them talk…

910
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,797
Yes, it's still raining a lot, Mom.

911
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,561
Is the restaurant
you wanted to go to nearby?

912
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,398
We need to go somewhere before that.
Follow me.

913
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,452
It's done.

914
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,998
Is this right?

915
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,212
Look at those flowers. I'm so jealous.

916
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,798
-The rain's stopped. Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

917
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,265
I almost forgot.

918
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,102
There's food that we have to eat
on a rainy day like this.

919
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,855
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

920
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,360
You have no idea how hard I tried.
I really hate situations like that.

921
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:46,282
So, actually, I was thinking
about suggesting we go for a drink today.

922
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,826
But we brought the car.

923
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,495
So I told myself
that we'd go get a drink next time

924
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,205
when we didn't have the car with us.

925
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,249
I actually drink a lot with Young-seo--

926
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,505
What?

927
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,428
Walking like this feels nice.

928
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,221
Let's leave the car
behind again next time.

929
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,517
How long have you known?

930
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,902
I guess I'm the one
who didn't have the courage.

931
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,614
I've been wanting to tell you

932
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,242
all about it one day…

933
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,746
but I couldn't.

934
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,333
I'm sorry.

935
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,794
I tried to pretend I didn't know, but…

936
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,049
If I hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

937
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,258
It's not that.

938
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,429
I was thinking about
how to not seem too pathetic

939
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,433
when explaining my weakness
to a woman I like.

940
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,145
Ha-ri.

941
00:55:59,022 --> 00:55:59,856
I…

942
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,137
You're almost here?

943
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,847
All right.

944
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,144
Wait just a little. I called for the car.

945
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,896
I'll just go back by myself today.

946
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,607
Young-seo wants to see me,
so I need to go.

947
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,858
Really?

948
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,277
Then let me give you a ride.

949
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,947
It's okay. We're meeting near here.

950
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,448
I'll call you later.

951
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,159
Get home safely.

952
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,469
Hello, Chairman Kang.

953
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,639
Please sit, Ms. Shin Geum-hui…

954
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,682
No.

955
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,809
Shin Ha-ri.

956
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:23,500
What exactly is your deal?

957
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:29,005
Why did you approach Tae-moo?

958
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,675
What?

959
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,386
Where?

960
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,474
Okay, I'll call you later.

961
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,785
Why isn't she picking up?

962
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,217
Stop seeing Tae-moo.

963
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,762
I don't think
you want to be in a situation

964
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,931
that other people may misinterpret.

965
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,226
Sir, I have something to tell you…

966
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,978
Yes, Sung-hoon.

967
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:26,980
What?

968
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,482
What about Tae-moo?

969
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:10,898
