EPISODE 9

2
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,933
You won't say
this is a mistake too, right?

3
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,063
I'll pay you back for that kiss

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,148
with another kiss.

5
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,965
What's going on here?

6
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:31,966
First of all,

7
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,885
I'm very sorry.

8
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,804
-What?
-As you probably know,

9
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm not President Kang.

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,599
I'm Cha Sung-hoon, his secretary.

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,353
President Kang has someone else
that he wishes to marry.

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,731
I'm here instead, since this meeting
couldn't go on as planned.

13
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,151
I'm very sorry.

14
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,501
Hello?

15
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,753
Hey, you're up. Did you sleep well?

16
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,463
Yes. How about you?

17
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,589
I didn't sleep well.

18
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:12,966
Why?

19
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,634
Because I missed you so much.

20
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,803
Come on, what are you saying?

21
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,556
I'm in front of your house.
Let's go on a date before work.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,473
What?

23
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,434
But it'll take a while
for me to get ready.

24
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,895
It's okay. I'll wait. Take your time.

25
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,772
Although…

26
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,693
I want to see you as soon as possible.

27
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,696
What?

28
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,242
Does he want me to take my time
or hurry up? What should I do?

29
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,182
Are you okay?
Should I go get some medicine?

30
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,851
No, it's fine.

31
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,811
I'll be fine after eating some soup.

32
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,398
-It's hot!
-Here.

33
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,027
Just how much did you drink yesterday?

34
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,823
My team members are heavy drinkers.

35
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,411
By the way, this soup is so good.

36
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,537
You're a good cook.

37
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,289
These are all my company's products,
and I'm a terrible cook.

38
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,499
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

39
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,959
Mr. Kang is a good cook.

40
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,713
Right. I heard that Kang Tae-moo
went on a blind date with Yu-jeong.

41
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,757
How could he do that when he has Ha-ri?

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,050
What's wrong with him?

43
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,593
Young-seo, actually--

44
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,681
I have a morning meeting!
I'm so forgetful.

45
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,432
I have to run, Sung-hoon.

46
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,142
Thank you so much for the food.

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,063
I hope your business trip goes well.
I'll text you.

48
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,982
Text me!

49
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,537
This place is really popular nowadays.

50
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,747
I didn't know they were open at this hour.

51
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,833
My friend owns this place.
He did me a favor.

52
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,917
Please, sit.

53
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,128
Thank you.

54
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,135
I'm going on a business trip to the States

55
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,095
so I wanted to have breakfast together.

56
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,724
Wait here.

57
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,352
You're going to cook yourself?

58
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,106
Yes. The most popular
brunch course here was my idea.

59
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,567
I'll make you the original version,
so just you wait.

60
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,363
I'm already worried

61
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,200
that you'll love it and ask me
to make it for you every day.

62
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,955
Thank you for the meal.

63
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,960
Why aren't you eating?

64
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,007
This is so pretty. Can I take a picture?

65
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,180
What about me?
I'm the one who did all the work.

66
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,272
Sorry.

67
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,399
Why, this…

68
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,360
Your shoes…

69
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,945
What about my shoes?

70
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,249
You missed me so much that you didn't
know you put on mismatched shoes?

71
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,166
Wait…

72
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,168
Why did I…

73
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,338
Wait, your earrings are…

74
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,048
They're two different earrings?

75
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,425
No, they're pretty.

76
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,970
Darn it.

77
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,638
Are you having fun teasing me?

78
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,889
Yes.

79
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,100
Fine.

80
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,312
I was so nervous
that I put on two different shoes.

81
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,815
And I don't even know
if I can digest this food.

82
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,609
I don't usually get this nervous.
Why am I being so nervous?

83
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,653
I look so stupid, don't I?

84
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,239
You keep cheating.

85
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,740
What do you mean, cheating?

86
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,702
My heart just skipped a beat
because you're so cute.

87
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,669
What are you doing?

88
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,965
My face is getting a bit red
right now, right?

89
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,134
Can you not look at me? I'm embarrassed.

90
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,814
We'll be right on time if we leave now.

91
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,900
No, let's go separately from here.

92
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,527
Why? Let me drive you somewhere near work.

93
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,906
What if someone sees me
getting out of your car?

94
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,116
But it's a pretty long way.

95
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,452
It's okay, I'll take the bus.

96
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,661
Drive safely.

97
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:28,216
You know, this was
the most wonderful morning of my life.

98
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,145
-Ms. Kim. Good morning.
-Hello.

99
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,064
Good morning.

100
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,106
Hello.

101
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,860
How come you're coming in together?

102
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,196
We met in front of the building.

103
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,532
Yes, in front. In the morning.

104
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,576
You know, I smelled grapefruit
when you three came in.

105
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,036
It's not me.

106
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,248
It's coming from Ms. Yeo.

107
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,792
Mr. Gye smells like it too.

108
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,585
You two must use the same shampoo.

109
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,091
Come on. I don't like that.
Why do you use the same shampoo as me?

110
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,677
That's what I should say.

111
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,429
I should wash my hair again. Really.

112
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,889
What's wrong with that?

113
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,558
You guys are overreacting.

114
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,934
Right?

115
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,271
Right! Congratulations, Ms. Shin.

116
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,273
-On what?
-What do you think?

117
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,858
Because of that nertube video, Ms. Shin…

118
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,193
The video's a huge hit.

119
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,487
-A huge hit?
-Yes.

120
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,157
Because Ms. Shin mentioned that we don't
use any artificial coloring on nertube,

121
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,118
our sales have increased by 20 percent.

122
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,035
Really?

123
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,539
Did you

124
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,792
have a good time with Ms. Shin yesterday?

125
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,465
I'm not telling you.
You didn't tell me who you were dating.

126
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,678
I'll get going, then.

127
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh, right. Get me some women's heels.

128
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,766
The size

129
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,852
should be 230.

130
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,396
What? Why do you need women's heels
all of a sudden?

131
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,314
Who are they for?

132
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,067
My girlfriend.

133
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,527
Girlfriend?

134
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,237
No way.

135
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,993
Is Ms. Shin Ha-ri here?

136
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,661
That's me.

137
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,497
What is it?

138
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,750
Your boyfriend sent you a gift.

139
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,084
Boyfriend?

140
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,841
Could you sign here?

141
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,436
What is it?

142
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,314
Ms. Shin, are you dating someone
in secret?

143
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,441
What's the gift? Let me see.

144
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,526
Let's see.

145
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,612
What? They're heels.

146
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,240
Right! You've been upset today
because you wore mismatched shoes.

147
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,535
What? Then did your boyfriend
send these knowing about that?

148
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,956
I think Young-seo sent these.

149
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,084
I sent her a text about it earlier,

150
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,378
so she must have decided
to play a joke on me.

151
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,130
Right. You mean
the daughter of Marine Group?

152
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,924
-Yes.
-Right? You had me going there.

153
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,385
That makes sense.
These are really expensive.

154
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,095
She really is rich.

155
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,978
The data shows
that the white kimchi ravioli

156
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,731
developed by Researcher Shin Ha-ri
and Chef Lee Min-woo

157
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,566
had the highest sales rate.

158
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,611
Also, our future sales will
be positively impacted

159
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,488
by what Ms. Shin said
on our nertube video…

160
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,241
If it wasn't for this trip,
I'd go on a date with Ms. Shin.

161
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,910
Should I delay the trip?
I shouldn't, right?

162
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,081
This is driving me nuts.

163
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:51,168
President Kang, is there
something wrong with the report?

164
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,086
HA-RI! MS. SHIN

165
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,094
It's nothing. Please continue.

166
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,019
What's the occasion? You usually
only wear slippers while working.

167
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,272
Well, no reason.

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,151
I'm so tired.

169
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,904
Developing a new product
and renewing our existing products?

170
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,157
Why is this company
giving us so much work?

171
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,243
Thank you for your hard work.

172
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,287
Goodness.

173
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,832
You don't have to mention it, sir.

174
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,668
This company is like my family,

175
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,712
and to work hard for it
is my joy and happiness.

176
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,966
-To what do we owe the pleasure?
-I have something to say

177
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,593
to Ms. Shin.

178
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,721
To me?

179
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,809
What is it that you want to…

180
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,944
I heard you've been busy lately
because of the nertube shoot.

181
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,489
Yes.

182
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,241
So I made some adjustments
to your schedule.

183
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,576
About the Bucket List Fish.

184
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,870
HA-RI! MS. SHIN

185
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,413
About the plan, I--

186
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,378
Sir, are you all right?

187
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,506
Ms. Shin, why did you do that?

188
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,883
Why is there a fly here?

189
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,135
-A fly?
-What do you mean, a fly?

190
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,762
It's thoroughly sanitized here.

191
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,014
No, I saw it too. A fly. There.

192
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,642
You'll be late for your flight.

193
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,686
Wait, I'll send you the schedule
by email via Team Leader Lee.

194
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,313
A fly?

195
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,775
-Where is the fly?
-That's weird.

196
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,610
There's no way a fly is in here.

197
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,279
By the way, isn't President Kang
acting weird today?

198
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,741
He kept smiling at Ms. Shin
as he was talking.

199
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,915
Naturally.

200
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,877
The sales have gone up thanks to Ms. Shin.
I bet he's really thankful.

201
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,420
True.

202
00:13:59,088 --> 00:13:59,922
That's true.

203
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,882
Right?

204
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,344
I bet he just can't help
but smile when he sees me.

205
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,726
What?

206
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,063
Is she showing off now that he favors her?

207
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,606
Yes.

208
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,567
She says yes.

209
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,037
Right now, the time in Seoul…

210
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,456
It should be around eight.

211
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,584
She must've gotten off work, right?

212
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,796
I really don't know anymore.

213
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,173
I think that it'll be best if you decide.

214
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,592
PRESIDENT KANG

215
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,972
So I've been thinking, Ms. Shin.

216
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,730
Ms. Shin, you know that there's
no toilet paper in the bathroom, right?

217
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,702
What's the matter?

218
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,454
You surprised me.

219
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,416
No, go ahead and smoke.

220
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,085
Why is it so hard…

221
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,921
To take one call?

222
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,547
Why isn't she picking up now?

223
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,553
If things didn't work out with Yu-jeong,

224
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,098
then we need to
schedule your next blind date!

225
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,559
But you ran off
and went on a business trip!

226
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,146
He's yelling at me
to go on a blind date again.

227
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,901
Should I just tell him
that I'm seeing Ms. Shin?

228
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,486
Then…

229
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,530
you'll have to tell him
Shin Geum-hui is Shin Ha-ri

230
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,991
and explain everything that's happened.

231
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,202
Will it be okay?

232
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,048
Mr. Cha, are you busy?
Why aren't you checking my texts?

233
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,467
Please text me back.

234
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,808
I thought I ended things that day,
so why is she doing this?

235
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,313
President Kang has someone else
that he wishes to marry.

236
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,232
I'm very sorry.

237
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,278
This is…

238
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,281
It's fate.

239
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,282
What?

240
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,159
What are you--

241
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,079
You're totally my type.

242
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,041
Do you want to date me?

243
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,794
That…

244
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,463
won't be possible.

245
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,799
Why? Am I not your type?
Or are you married?

246
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,342
It's not like that.

247
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,802
I have a girlfriend.

248
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,850
You're not even married,
so it doesn't matter.

249
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,768
Let's just give it a try.

250
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,146
I'll give up
if you don't change your mind.

251
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,983
I don't think I can.

252
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,360
I'm very sorry.

253
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,572
Come on.

254
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,920
Yes, Ms. Jin.

255
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,716
You must be busy because of work, right?
Still, don't skip any meals, okay?

256
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,719
Why is he ignoring my text?
Is he really busy?

257
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,764
Yes, okay. I'll call you later.

258
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:43,520
You're not wearing
anything that's the same as me today!

259
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,733
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

260
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,776
I'm on a business trip.

261
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,195
I'll contact you when I'm back,
so stop texting me.

262
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,781
Don't skip your meals too, Young-seo.

263
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,826
He'll contact me when he's back.

264
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,952
Thank goodness.

265
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,290
Did something good happen?
You look so happy.

266
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,958
I could say the same thing.

267
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,461
It seems like you have something
that makes you so happy.

268
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,756
Haven't I told you?

269
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,424
I'm…

270
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,219
seeing someone.

271
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,261
Really?

272
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,140
Oh, my! I am too!

273
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,866
Ms. Han, Mr. Shin.

274
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,494
Congratulations on being discharged
from the hospital.

275
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,705
There's no need to bow.

276
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm sorry I didn't visit
you two at the hospital.

277
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,961
We know that it's because you were busy.

278
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,712
-Mom, did we have guests?
-Yes.

279
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,298
The people from your dad's hiking club
and my friends.

280
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,425
Oh, right. Ha-ri.

281
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,680
People asked me
to get them your autograph.

282
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:04,643
Dong-cheol's son became your fan
after watching that nertube video.

283
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,769
That's ridiculous.

284
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,563
What? It's not that weird.

285
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,232
You're even doing an interview tomorrow.
With Min-woo.

286
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,859
An interview?

287
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,528
My daughter is pretty impressive!

288
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,445
I'm not.

289
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,533
My company's marketing team arranged it.
It's a small online article.

290
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,743
By the way,
why hasn't Min-woo been around?

291
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,870
Is he really busy?

292
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,830
I think so.

293
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,833
What? What am I doing? It's time.

294
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,042
It's time.

295
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,711
Gosh, I thought he was in pain.

296
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,837
That's how he is.

297
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,088
Do you watch this, Dad?

298
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,173
What?

299
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,757
You watch this show, too?

300
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,092
I heard it's nuts.

301
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,887
He watched every episode in the hospital

302
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,472
and now he's crazy about it.
He likes it more than I do.

303
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,934
BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI

304
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,144
Hey, Ha-ri.

305
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,688
That's the cafe
that your company launched, right?

306
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,690
They're so openly advertising it.

307
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,527
And what kind of rich person
goes to a franchise coffee shop

308
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,154
and picks up his own coffee?

309
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,615
Does that make any sense, Young-seo?

310
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,074
Rich people are human too.

311
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,743
Just look at Young-seo.

312
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,204
She eats tteokbokki
and fried chicken like us.

313
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,538
Is that so?

314
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
Well, Young-seo's an exception.

315
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,668
Come on, I'm trying
to watch the show here.

316
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,836
All right.

317
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,299
Chairman Kang goes to roadside
steamed bun places too.

318
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,510
You got some red beans on your teeth.

319
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,304
My teeth? Oh, my!

320
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,432
I saw that scene yesterday too.

321
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,106
So what did you want to tell me?

322
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,860
I see that President Kang
hasn't told you, either.

323
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,947
Kids these days.

324
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,157
Apparently…

325
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,534
the two of them

326
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,995
are seeing each other.

327
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,955
What?

328
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,790
Are you sure?

329
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,170
Yu-jeong said

330
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,465
that she's very busy
dating someone lately.

331
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,844
Wait, then is she really seeing Tae-moo?

332
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,471
I'm sure of it.

333
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,518
So I was thinking,
before people start talking about it,

334
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,355
what do you think
about getting those two married?

335
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,439
What?

336
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,206
Hey. It's been a while.

337
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
Yes, it has.

338
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,171
Ha-ri, I'm sorry about that day.

339
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,217
I overstepped my boundaries
because I was so worried about you.

340
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,511
I'm so sorry.

341
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,722
It's okay.

342
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
I thought about it and I overreacted, too.

343
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,477
And you must have been surprised too.

344
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,773
What did you and President Kang
decide to do?

345
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,734
We're…

346
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,403
seeing each other.

347
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,366
Really?

348
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,286
Of course, like you said, the two of us

349
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,872
might not work out.

350
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,042
But I decided to give it a try.

351
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,672
Onto the next question.

352
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,760
Ms. Shin, you're famous for
the "Is President Kang Watching?" meme.

353
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,970
Did President Kang really see it?

354
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,263
Yes, he did.

355
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,599
Then did he give you a bonus?

356
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,267
-No.
-He didn't?

357
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,186
-No, he didn't.
-He's so cheap.

358
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,480
I can't believe it.

359
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,443
Ms. Shin, on a side note,

360
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,862
is President Kang really that handsome?

361
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,781
I've only seen him in pictures.

362
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,787
Well, I'm not so sure.

363
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,790
You keep asking questions
that are hard to answer.

364
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,999
President Kang.

365
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,876
President Kang.

366
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,087
Hello, President Kang Tae-moo.

367
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,214
I'm Hwang Bo-ra, a reporter for Estien.

368
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,673
It's nice to meet you.

369
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,591
Here.

370
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,469
It's been a while, you two.

371
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,014
Since you're here,
could you say a few words--

372
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,849
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

373
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,227
I think a question or two will be fine.

374
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,938
This question is similar to the one
I just asked Ms. Shin.

375
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,148
Are you going to give Ms. Shin a bonus?

376
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,067
Of course.

377
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,152
I need to keep my promise as a president.

378
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,321
And, Ms. Shin,

379
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,449
-do you want to have dinner with me today?
-What?

380
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,785
What? Dinner with Ms. Shin?

381
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,787
What's going on?

382
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,957
At our last company field day,
Ms. Shin was chosen as the MVP

383
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,835
-and won a chance to eat dinner with me.
-Right.

384
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,712
So let's have that dinner today.

385
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,839
Do you have the time?

386
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,383
Yes, I do.

387
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,034
Where are you meeting him?

388
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,245
At a restaurant, I'm sure.
But which restaurant?

389
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,955
Probably a really fancy one, right?

390
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,166
Well, I don't know either.

391
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,417
The place doesn't matter.

392
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,170
Just imagine eating dinner
with a guy like President Kang.

393
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,629
It would feel like a date.

394
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,131
A date, my foot.

395
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,133
I bet you'll feel really uncomfortable.

396
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,725
I was going to come get you. Get in.

397
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,227
Yes. Right…

398
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,064
The doors are closing.

399
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,234
Why? Wait, get in.

400
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,196
I'm in front of my place.

401
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,407
I'm almost there, too.
Why don't we have dinner together?

402
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,034
Sure.

403
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,827
I'll be waiting, then.

404
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,621
Okay.

405
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,793
Mr. Cha.

406
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,129
Ms. Cho, what are you doing here?

407
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,051
In this Information Age,

408
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,138
you can find out anything
you put your mind to.

409
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,562
Mr. Cha.

410
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,856
Why won't you like me back?

411
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,360
As I told you before,

412
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,070
I'm not interested in you.

413
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:35,075
I simply can't give up on you!

414
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,911
Please.

415
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,582
Please reciprocate my feelings! Please?

416
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,419
Are you feeling okay?

417
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,474
Sung-hoon, it's me.

418
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,142
Open the door.

419
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,401
You're here.

420
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,070
I thought you'd want a home-cooked meal,
so I bought groceries.

421
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,865
My house is a bit dirty to cook in,
so let's cook at your place.

422
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,661
I don't think that's a good idea.

423
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,914
Why? Your house is a lot better
than mine. It's okay.

424
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,212
What's that noise?

425
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,880
President Kang is here.

426
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,133
Mr. Kang Tae-moo?

427
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,010
It's Kang Tae-moo again?

428
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,514
I'll call you as soon as I can
after I take care of him.

429
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,227
Just go wait at home, okay?

430
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,229
-Okay, call me.
-Sure.

431
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,315
Yes. I'll call you as soon as I can.

432
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,903
In any case,

433
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,573
I really don't like Kang Tae-moo.

434
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,453
TTEOKBOKKI, FRIES, SUNDAE, FISH CAKES
MATNA SNACK BAR

435
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,916
Is this really the place
you wanted to go to with me?

436
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,917
Yes.

437
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,212
What are you doing? Let's go.

438
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,632
I can't believe her.

439
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,349
A date in a place like this?

440
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,727
This isn't a date.
This is a dinner with President Kang.

441
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,062
It's an excuse for a date.

442
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,732
Honestly, it felt good to say it
in front of other people

443
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,068
after hiding it for so long.

444
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,613
Do you know how surprised I was
because of that?

445
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,948
All of the employees came out to watch.

446
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,951
I was just happy to see you
after such a long time.

447
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,661
Are you really so unhappy about it?

448
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,954
I mean,

449
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,584
I'm just saying
that we should be careful at work.

450
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,546
Is that why you treated
your boyfriend's call like some spam call?

451
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,006
That's not it.

452
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,385
Then what should I do?

453
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,763
Should I go around telling people
I'm dating the president of my company?

454
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,891
You're here. It's been a while.

455
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,268
Hi, ma'am, have you been well?

456
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,937
Of course.

457
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,273
By the way, who's this?
I've never seen him before.

458
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,358
He's my company's…

459
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,362
He's my boyfriend.

460
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,155
What?

461
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,908
When did you get
such a handsome boyfriend?

462
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,244
Okay.

463
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,205
I'll give you two some sundae,
free of charge.

464
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,416
You don't have to.

465
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,792
Thank you.

466
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,210
Ma'am.

467
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,671
Why is she the only one
getting free sundae?

468
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,755
We want some, too.

469
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,173
Yes, give us some.

470
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,925
-We want some, too.
-We want sundae.

471
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:44,806
-We want some too.
-We want some too.

472
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,849
Students, listen!

473
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,439
Since the owner is giving us sundae,
I'll pay for all of your food.

474
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,440
How does that sound?

475
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,235
-Great!
-Great!

476
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,661
I'll contact you tomorrow then.

477
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,835
Sorry. I keep getting work calls.

478
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,963
Why are you laughing like that?

479
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,966
The more I think about it,
the funnier it is.

480
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,596
I've never seen someone pay
for everyone's food at a snack bar.

481
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,393
It's my first time spending
that much money at a snack bar too.

482
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,772
Did you eat that much
when you were in high school too?

483
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,357
I'm not sure.

484
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,071
Anyway, it felt good

485
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,451
when you introduced me
as your boyfriend to the owner.

486
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,664
Do you think that I always want
to hide it from other people?

487
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,337
"President Kang is my boyfriend."

488
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,924
I want to say that confidently.

489
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,642
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

490
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,355
There's something I've been wanting to do.

491
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,565
Can I?

492
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,818
What?

493
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,134
You had some sauce on your cheek,
so I was going to wipe it for you.

494
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,303
Why did you close your eyes?

495
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,474
My eyes were stinging.

496
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:50,366
Why isn't he saying anything to me
when he's seeing Yu-jeong?

497
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,254
-Why are you staring at me?
-What?

498
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,089
No. It's nothing.

499
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,595
Is it because he's embarrassed
it hasn't been that long

500
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,555
since he broke up with Geum-hui?

501
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,768
Should I just pretend not to know
for the time being?

502
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,694
Oh, my God.

503
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,780
You scared me.

504
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,789
What do you want?

505
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,748
Can I

506
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,376
vent to you for a moment?

507
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,714
I don't think we're close enough
to listen to each other's stories.

508
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,758
It's because
I don't have anyone to talk to!

509
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,678
You know I have no friends!

510
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,096
Okay.

511
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,851
Seriously.

512
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,647
What's wrong?

513
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,943
You know the guy
that I told you about before?

514
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,321
It's over!

515
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,991
What? It hasn't even been that long. Why?

516
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:18,621
Last night, I went to his place all drunk,
and I made a huge scene!

517
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,666
You go wild when you're drunk.

518
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,126
Why did you do that?

519
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,669
Because…

520
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,631
he kept trying to draw lines with me.

521
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,136
-Draw lines?
-I'm saying this only to you,

522
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,181
but that guy is not on our level.

523
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,059
He's just a normal guy.

524
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,854
It's the first time
I've fallen for someone

525
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:47,150
without caring
about his family, assets, or background.

526
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,319
But now…

527
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,951
It's game over!

528
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,347
So, you're just going to give up?

529
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,016
What?

530
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,976
Where's the Yu-jeong that I know?

531
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,229
You're the kind of person
who never gives up and tries

532
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,607
until they like you back. Right?

533
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,275
Right.

534
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,863
Actually, I had to be really persistent
to get with my current boyfriend

535
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,908
because he kept trying
to keep his distance.

536
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,832
So you should go and apologize to him
and try to make it work.

537
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,001
You can do it, girl!

538
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,252
I can do it!

539
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,378
You got this!

540
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,135
Yes, you can do it.

541
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,393
I'm sorry I'm late.
There were so many customers.

542
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,479
It seemed busier than usual today.

543
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,023
Maybe it's because of that news article.

544
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,817
-Did you read it?
-Of course.

545
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,319
You looked great in the photo.

546
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,365
A lot of comments say
you two look so good together.

547
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,492
You know how people are.

548
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,535
Right.

549
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,788
By the way,

550
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,456
do you have time this weekend?

551
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,374
This weekend? Why?

552
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,792
My parents want to see you.

553
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,171
I think they're worried since we keep
breaking up and getting back together.

554
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,967
And I also think
it's about time we got married.

555
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,722
Why aren't you saying anything?

556
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,608
Let's put off meeting with your parents.

557
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,736
I'm so busy with work these days,

558
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,697
and I don't think…

559
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,950
I'm ready for that yet.

560
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,041
Did something happen yesterday?

561
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,459
What? Why?

562
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,713
You look upset, so I was wondering
if you fought with Young-seo.

563
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,341
Actually, I have something to…

564
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,178
What?

565
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,220
What is it?

566
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,889
You look like you've seen a ghost.

567
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,473
What?

568
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,517
Mr. Cha.

569
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,566
Who…

570
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,401
Hello.

571
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,864
I'm Jo Yu-jeong. The one you were supposed
to go on a blind date with.

572
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,950
What brings you here?

573
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,913
Actually…

574
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,960
I fell in love at first sight with
Mr. Cha, who showed up to the blind date

575
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,463
instead of you.

576
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,926
But Mr. Cha wouldn't
reciprocate my feelings,

577
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,180
so I went to his place last night
after getting drunk.

578
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,141
-Please, don't.
-Don't be so startled.

579
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,978
I thought about it,
and it was such a big mistake.

580
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,233
So I'm here to apologize.

581
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,485
What is she talking about?

582
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,904
Mr. Kang.

583
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:20,863
Grandfather.

584
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,784
So, this is Ms. Jo Yu-jeong.

585
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,036
And you went on that blind date

586
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,665
instead of Tae-moo?

587
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,541
That's--

588
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,629
I think I came at a bad time again.

589
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,174
What?

590
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,761
You little brat.

591
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,638
-Come here!
-Grandpa!

592
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,847
-You!
-Sir!

593
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,141
-Grandfather, calm down.
-Sir, I'm Sung-hoon!

594
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,019
-You went instead of him? You brat!
-It's me, Sung-hoon.

595
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,402
Tae-moo, you really…

596
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,155
Then…

597
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,409
who's the woman

598
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,619
you've been seeing?

599
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,620
What?

600
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,789
What woman?

601
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,499
Do you think that I don't know?

602
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,961
I've heard you calling her every night.

603
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,424
If it's not Ms. Jo,
then who's the person you've been seeing?

604
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,177
-That's--
-Wait.

605
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,431
Are you seeing Geum-hui again?

606
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,772
Why aren't you saying anything?

607
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,528
My stomach. What's wrong with it?

608
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,613
Are you not feeling well, sir?

609
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,366
Of course, I'm not feeling well!
Because of this brat!

610
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,203
It must be because you keep
drinking cold drinks for the menu renewal.

611
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,372
You be quiet!

612
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,506
Tae-moo.

613
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,468
I need to use the bathroom.

614
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,263
Stop the elevator on any floor.

615
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,060
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

616
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,896
Ms. Yeo, here's the data
that you asked for.

617
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,813
Okay.

618
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,276
Ms. Shin's proposal was chosen
for our newest product!

619
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,362
Yes.

620
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:30,242
Mr. Gye. Your proposal was good,

621
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,453
but it's too similar to a product

622
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,748
that another company sold
about three years ago.

623
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,876
So I excluded it
because I didn't want people saying

624
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,086
that we copied it.

625
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,462
So don't be too sad.

626
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,424
Right. Nowadays, people are so quick
to criticize if anything seems wrong.

627
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,842
So we need to be careful.

628
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,885
Copy? Whatever…

629
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,265
Of course.

630
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:57,103
I'm sure that you made the best decision.

631
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,237
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

632
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,580
Mr. Gye, what's this?

633
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,623
What?

634
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,253
You're being harsh, babe.

635
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,714
Do you think I copied it?
You made me look bad in front of Ms. Kim.

636
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,428
You sent this in the group chat?

637
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,432
Don't tell me you two are…

638
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,769
No, this is…

639
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,106
I was going to say something else,
but I made a typo and typed "babe."

640
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,316
I don't know anymore!

641
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,234
Babe!

642
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,194
I mean, "hey."

643
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,529
Mr. Gye!

644
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,577
What's wrong with Mr. Gye?

645
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,870
What's he talking about?

646
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,247
Mr. Gye.

647
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,665
We need to talk!

648
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,333
I have nothing to say to you.

649
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,460
Let go!

650
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,419
It hurts!

651
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,631
How am I supposed to come to work now?

652
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:10,926
Mr. Gye!

653
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,179
Wait, Ms. Yeo…

654
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,640
Ms. Yeo, that's the men's bathroom.

655
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,933
Come on.

656
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,895
Calm down. Let's talk.

657
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
-I don't want to talk with you!
-Come on!

658
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:23,981
I want to be alone!

659
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,150
Ms. Yeo!

660
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,860
What if someone sees you?

661
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,445
I mean, seriously…

662
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,282
-Ms. Yeo, are you all right?
-She's too strong!

663
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,909
-Are you okay?
-That jerk!

664
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,619
Are you two…

665
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,290
Damn it.

666
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,416
Sir, this way.

667
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,251
I can see, too.

668
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,713
-Don't get in the way. Move.
-Chairman Kang?

669
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,429
Wait,

670
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,683
why is there a women's shoe
in the men's bathroom?

671
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,810
You're right. Why is this here?

672
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,648
Wait a minute.

673
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,026
What if there's a woman in here?

674
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,740
Hey, who's in there?

675
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,325
Say something.

676
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:17,952
What?

677
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,287
I was right.

678
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,083
But why is a woman in the men's bathroom?

679
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,751
She must be in here by mistake.

680
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,462
If you do this,
she'll be too embarrassed to come out.

681
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,339
You should go to another bathroom.

682
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,049
No!

683
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,511
The person who shouldn't be in here
should leave. Why should I?

684
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,353
Listen. Come on out
before it gets even more embarrassing.

685
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,240
I'm sorry.

686
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,200
Look.

687
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,161
How did you end up in the men's…

688
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,541
Wait, Shin Ha-ri?

689
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:12,131
You're the employee who shoved me
at the bathroom last time, right?

690
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,841
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,469
Why are you in the men's bathroom?

692
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,311
Okay, just get out.

693
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,229
Quickly!

694
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,439
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,567
Jeez.

696
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,910
LETTER OF APOLOGY
NAME: SHIN HA-RI

697
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,499
Why did Chairman Kang
have to go into that bathroom?

698
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:52,379
Right. You're so unlucky.

699
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,841
Ms. Shin's in trouble because of you two.

700
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,552
So how long have you been dating?

701
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,181
Babe, you should tell…

702
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,768
You should tell them, Ms. Yeo.

703
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,813
Well…

704
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,775
On the day of the field day,

705
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,944
he and I went for drinks
after it was over.

706
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,571
Damn blind date.

707
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,449
Fine, I'll go.

708
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,077
I'm hanging up.

709
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,997
It's so stressful.

710
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,465
Didn't you say
you can't eat chicken gizzards?

711
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,802
You always gave them to me.
What are you doing?

712
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,680
You're going on a blind date?
Then I won't yield to you anymore.

713
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,806
What?

714
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,600
What do chicken gizzards
have to do with that?

715
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,147
Do you really think I can't eat them?

716
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,026
I like chicken gizzards,
and I like spicy marinated crabs, too.

717
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,862
But since you like them,

718
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,075
I pretended not to eat them
and gave them to you.

719
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:04,952
What?

720
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,081
But you didn't know any of that,
and now you're going on a blind date.

721
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,917
I think you're really drunk.

722
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,920
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

723
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,133
Hey, Yeo Ui-joo,

724
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,509
I'm not drunk,

725
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,344
so listen closely.

726
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,430
Don't go…

727
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,766
on that blind date.

728
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,449
Stop!

729
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,539
It's fine. You can stop there.

730
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,666
Whatever.

731
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,044
Hey, Ms. Shin.

732
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:01,008
Could you just write that you went into
the men's bathroom accidentally?

733
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,011
I was going to do that anyway.

734
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,345
Thanks, Ms. Shin.

735
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,932
I'll buy you beef today.

736
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,184
Prime beef.

737
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,646
He must hate me now.

738
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,816
Today, I…

739
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,236
Today, I accidentally made
the mistake of going into

740
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,907
the men's bathroom
because I was looking at my phone.

741
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:30,746
I will deeply repent for causing
Chairman Kang great mental distress

742
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,415
and am submitting
this letter of apology as a promise

743
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,585
that I will never
walk around looking at my phone again.

744
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,258
Are you happy now that
you've gotten that letter of apology?

745
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,886
So why did you just let her go?

746
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:50,224
I was going to give her
a really good scolding.

747
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,311
It seemed like a simple mistake.
You should just let it go, sir.

748
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,355
A mistake or not,

749
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:00,192
I hate that I keep getting
mixed up with her.

750
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,654
I don't like it!

751
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,706
I told you we should have a team dinner.
Why are you leaving?

752
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,875
I'm good.
I don't feel like drinking today.

753
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,545
Since when did you need
to feel like drinking to drink?

754
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,129
-Let's go, Ms. Shin.
-Yes.

755
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,131
Don't be like this.

756
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,300
Let's go to So's. I think that's the best.

757
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,510
Yes.

758
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:30,138
Let's chew on some beef,
and the chairman too.

759
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,350
I can't believe he made
you write a letter of apology.

760
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,060
Yes, chew everything up!

761
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,020
Let's all go to So's!

762
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,522
Hello, President Kang.

763
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,983
Are you all going somewhere?

764
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:41,900
Yes.

765
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,837
-The enoki mushrooms are burning.
-What?

766
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,338
Here.

767
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,339
My mistake.

768
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,224
I've never even imagined
that our busy president

769
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,728
would come to a barbeque place with us
and grill meat like this.

770
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:36,246
Please leave. Everyone is uncomfortable
because of you.

771
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,914
Am I making you uncomfortable?

772
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,668
Not at all. Why would we be uncomfortable?

773
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,463
She's right! I couldn't be
more comfortable than this.

774
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,214
-Wait…
-Take off the cover.

775
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,141
Mr. Kang, I have a suggestion.

776
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,601
What is it?

777
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,062
I think that we're all feeling
a bit awkward

778
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,439
because this is our first team dinner
with you.

779
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,316
How about we each have a bomb shot?

780
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,818
-What?
-Come on, Ms. Kim.

781
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,197
Having bomb shots with the president?
Don't be so embarrassing.

782
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,615
I like bomb shots.

783
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,910
-Open it!
-Okay.

784
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,536
-Swirl it.
-Open it?

785
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,871
Yes.

786
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,250
What?

787
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,716
A WORKER'S GUIDE TO LIFE
1. HOW TO MIX BOMB SHOTS

788
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:51,988
The name of this drink that I made

789
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,284
with my blood, sweat, and tears

790
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,371
is…

791
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,292
The Dynamite Drink!

792
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,631
Here!

793
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,596
Go ahead and try one!

794
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,983
-Drink!
-Drink!

795
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,488
I'll arrive in about ten minutes.

796
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,073
Oh, my God.

797
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,366
I'll see you later.

798
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,161
What do you want now?

799
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,662
It's your fault!

800
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,122
What's my fault?

801
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,541
I went to see him at work

802
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,628
to sincerely apologize
because you told me to.

803
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,968
But now I'm screwed!

804
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,648
Are you feeling nervous?

805
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:13,445
Yes. I'm introducing my girlfriend
to you for the first time after all.

806
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,864
Come on.

807
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,408
You're making me all nervous too.

808
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,413
I'm going to the bathroom for a moment.

809
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,415
Sure, go ahead.

810
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,842
Sorry, you must've been waiting long.
Something came up on my way out.

811
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,260
It's all right.

812
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,553
-About today--
-I came

813
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,555
with someone.

814
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,473
Who?

815
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,353
She got rejected by a guy,
so she was bawling.

816
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,647
And I couldn't just ignore her.

817
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,691
I'm so sorry.

818
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,152
I really didn't want to be alone today,

819
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,363
so I followed her
even though I know it's rude…

820
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,374
What? Why?

821
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,462
Mr. Cha is your boyfriend?

822
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:14,840
Wait a second,

823
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,634
the guy that you like…

824
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,887
I had no idea.

825
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,935
Then you should have told me
in the beginning!

826
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,937
I clearly told you I had a girlfriend!

827
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,441
Young-seo!

828
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,244
My goodness.

829
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,579
What's going on here?

830
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,294
-Mother, just a second.
-What?

831
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,629
Young-seo.

832
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,548
Young-seo!

833
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,051
Don't just leave like this.
Please let me explain.

834
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,428
Yesterday…

835
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,640
when you said Kang Tae-moo was
at your place, was that Yu-jeong?

836
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,101
Well, it was…

837
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,023
Yes, but let me explain.

838
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,150
I went on a blind date
instead of Mr. Kang--

839
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,652
Yu-jeong fell for you
and started bothering you,

840
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,655
and things ended up like this. Right?

841
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,074
-Yes, that's right.
-What do you mean, that's right?

842
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,117
What?

843
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,703
You shouldn't have
gone on that blind date.

844
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,080
You shouldn't have let Yu-jeong
into your house.

845
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,959
No, you should have told me the truth
from the very beginning.

846
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,464
I'm really sorry about everything.
It's all my fault.

847
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,965
I didn't imagine things would--

848
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,967
Do you know what's most infuriating?

849
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,221
It's how you ignored me
and blindly did as Kang Tae-moo said.

850
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,890
Are you that family's servant?

851
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,021
Young-seo…

852
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,369
Are you okay?
You seemed to be drinking a lot.

853
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,498
I wasn't. I drank
way less than I usually do.

854
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,376
Really?

855
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,756
Then, if you drink
more than you usually do…

856
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,264
what happens?

857
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,611
Seriously.

858
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:47,826
By the way…

859
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,706
about your grandfather…

860
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,669
Is he really not angry anymore?

861
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,756
He's still mad, right?

862
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,927
I knew it.

863
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
Don't worry about it too much.

864
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,806
He'll get over it.

865
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,225
How can I not worry about it?

866
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,602
He's your grandfather.

867
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,607
I want to be loved by the person

868
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,902
you love the most too.

869
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,326
Do you know you looked

870
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,580
really pretty when you said that?

871
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,170
Okay!

872
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,757
The others must be waiting.
Should we go back?

873
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,228
I sprayed too much.

874
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,189
I'm sorry.

875
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,316
Is Ms. Kim spinning?

876
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,526
-Really?
-Or are my eyes spinning?

877
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,739
Ms. Yeo.

878
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,117
Why are you drinking so little?

879
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,121
Let's go get another round of drinks.

880
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,458
We should go do karaoke next.

881
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,085
How's that?

882
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,127
I…

883
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,589
-President Kang, you're going too, right?
-Sure.

884
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,049
I'll pay for this

885
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,426
and for the second round too.

886
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,764
-President Kang!
-President Kang!

887
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:38,019
-President Kang!
-President Kang!

888
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,523
Three beats per measure. Let's go.

889
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,525
-President Kang!
-President Kang!

890
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,693
President Kang.

891
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,779
Three beats per measure.

892
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,614
Okay, empty your glasses.

893
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,582
What are you two doing holding hands?

894
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,670
Who's holding whose hand?

895
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,671
President Kang

896
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,257
and Ms. Shin.

897
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,093
They were just holding hands.

898
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,094
Look.

899
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,727
They're not holding hands anymore.

900
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,441
You're drunk.

901
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,110
Why would President Kang
and Ms. Shin be holding hands?

902
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,862
It's not like they're dating.

903
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,988
Right.

904
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:34,075
Ms. Yeo and Mr. Gye are the ones dating.

905
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,413
Are the two of you

906
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,123
in a relationship?

907
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,166
Yes.

908
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,959
It's been a while.

909
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,307
It's time you went home.
You're spewing nonsense.

910
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,308
Yes.

911
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:02,854
No, I'm sure that those two
were holding hands.

912
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,689
I'm right!

913
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,278
Let's go.

914
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,739
Let's go home!

915
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,744
I swear I saw it.

916
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,330
I really saw it.

917
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,165
I'm serious!

918
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,585
Why are you being so insufferable today?

919
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,005
I'm sorry, sir.

920
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,673
It's all right.

921
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,133
She's drunk after all.

922
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,760
Should I call a taxi, then?

923
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,470
No. There's a lot over there.

924
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,388
Get home safe, President Kang.

925
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,848
We'll take care of this bomb…

926
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,683
I mean, send Ms. Kim home first.

927
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,018
Good night, then.

928
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,355
What about you, Ms. Shin?

929
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,690
What?

930
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,902
You're going in
the opposite direction, right? Bye, then.

931
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,445
Right. Yes.

932
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,531
Get home safe. Right.

933
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,659
Everyone is in a relationship except me!

934
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,245
Damn this world!

935
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,371
Shut it!

936
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,207
Her specialty is public speaking, you see.

937
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,001
-She has a good voice.
-Right.

938
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,136
What?

939
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,347
What is he doing there?

940
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,142
Do you want to go for a walk to sober up?

941
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,354
Sure.

942
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,611
What are you doing there?

943
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:15,153
