EPISODE 5

2
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,226
Hello?

3
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,856
Hello? Mr. Kang?

4
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,280
What was that?

5
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,082
Why did he just hang up after calling me?

6
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:22,999
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

7
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,876
It keeps bothering me.

8
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,962
What's bothering you?

9
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,089
Oh, nothing.

10
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,134
These abalones are so fresh.

11
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,053
Mom, Dad, come eat if you're done.

12
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,137
-Okay.
-Okay.

13
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,515
They look so good.

14
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,479
They're beautiful!

15
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,481
I should have bought some Kaoliang liquor.

16
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,526
You didn't have to do this.
These must have been expensive.

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,111
I remembered you craving them
the other day, Ms. Han.

18
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,906
Really? You're so sweet.

19
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,409
I wish you were my son
instead of this little brat.

20
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,373
Wait a second. You can still
become my son-in-law, Min-woo.

21
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,415
Mom, come on!

22
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,583
What?

23
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,584
That won't happen.

24
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,130
Young-seo told me that Min-woo
got back together with his ex-girlfriend.

25
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,631
You know, that one.

26
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,219
You broke up when she went
to study abroad, but you're back together?

27
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,387
Stop it.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,513
Stop.

29
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,392
Oh, right. How could you
be so clumsy and drop your wallet?

30
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,103
-What?
-It was in front of the store.

31
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,440
When did I drop this?

32
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,452
EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL RECORD

33
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,370
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

34
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,372
She's been right under my nose.

35
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,040
I went on a blind date

36
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,418
with an employee!

37
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,794
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

38
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,088
-What's your actual name?
-Geum… hui.

39
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,298
Geum-hui.

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,800
-Ms. Shin Ha-ri.
-I'm sorry.

41
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,303
-Will you present like that?
-Sir?

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,682
It's because I have a stye on my eye.

43
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,725
How dare she

44
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,518
fool me?

45
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,606
You would get sick of me
If we spent every second together

46
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,690
This is for you.

47
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,025
Very pretty.

48
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,320
Don't be like that.
Let's just get married.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,119
Shin Ha-ri, Shin Geum-hui.

50
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,546
This is not right.

51
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,132
This isn't right!

52
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,094
GO FOOD

53
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,309
Let's meet near your workplace for lunch.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,937
Near my workplace?

55
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,943
Near my workplace!

56
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,947
What's going to change
if I meet her in person?

57
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,206
I'm sorry I'm so late.

58
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,001
I had to go all the way to Gangnam
for a business meeting.

59
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,714
You work at a small company, right?

60
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,175
-What kind of company is it?
-What?

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,596
We produce all types of household goods.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,015
What do you mean by
"all types of household goods"?

63
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,352
Like coffee mugs,

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,395
air fresheners,

65
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,438
tiepins, and so on.

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,358
They sure make a lot of things.

67
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,403
You must be so busy
working for a company like that.

68
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,446
Well, work is usually like that.

69
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,324
Our company tends to do anything
that will make a profit.

70
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,326
Anyway, why did you call me?

71
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,828
What Chinese characters

72
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,454
is your name derived from?

73
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,541
That's random. Why do you want to know?

74
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,834
I realized

75
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,170
that I don't know much about you

76
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,883
while you know the schools I went to, the
company I work at, and even my hobbies.

77
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,595
Well, we're not actually dating.

78
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,140
Why do you need to know?

79
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,808
My grandfather could ask about it.

80
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:13,980
Well…

81
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,361
"Geum" means "iron"
and "hui" means "happiness."

82
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,989
So she's going to keep lying to me?

83
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,534
You could have asked me
these things over the phone.

84
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,911
You hate wasting your time.

85
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,829
I do.

86
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,539
Shall we go, then?

87
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,333
What?

88
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,340
Did he really call me all the way to Ilsan
just to ask me that?

89
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,884
Wait…

90
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,136
Mr. Cha.

91
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,263
Schedule a meeting at two
with Food Product Development Team One.

92
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,850
Yes. There's no need to waste time.

93
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,980
Where do you work?

94
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,607
-If it's on the way, I can--
-No!

95
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,858
I can go by myself.

96
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,943
Then, I should get going. Goodbye!

97
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,709
Older customers are reacting favorably

98
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,753
because the main ingredient
is white kimchi.

99
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,671
My mother especially liked it.

100
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,757
She is a very picky eater, but seeing…

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,134
I'll draw more attention
if I go in right now.

102
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,594
Ms. Shin, you're here!

103
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,721
Ms. Shin is here.

104
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,268
You're late, Ms. Shin.

105
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,939
What are you doing? Come in.

106
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,026
Right.

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,910
Why are you so late?

108
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,704
He's been waiting
because he has something to say to you.

109
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,000
-What are you doing?
-Me? What do you need to say to me, sir?

110
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,419
I want you to re-do the ravioli, Ms. Shin.

111
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,421
Wait, why…

112
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,341
We got the highest ratings
at the tasting event--

113
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,634
The cost is too expensive.

114
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,803
Lower it by 20 percent.

115
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,390
If you lower it by 20 percent,
the quality of the product will…

116
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,227
Isn't it your job to lower the price
and improve the quality?

117
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,188
I thought that's what I pay you for.

118
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,399
Isn't that right, Ms. Shin?

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,235
-I--
-Don't you get what I'm saying?

120
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,154
As the developer of this product,

121
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,448
lower the price, keep the quality high,

122
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,743
balance the nutrition perfectly,
and make it commercially successful!

123
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,080
Do you understand?

124
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,209
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,019
What do you mean, remake the ravioli?

126
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,646
As Ms. Yeo said,
it was rated the highest at the tasting.

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,649
I'm the president of this company.
Is another reason necessary?

128
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,694
Well, it's very unlike you, sir.

129
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,781
And you also seem to be
treating Ms. Shin very emotionally.

130
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,866
Mr. Cha.

131
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,578
Do you really not realize
who Shin Ha-ri is?

132
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,789
Who would she be?
Shin Ha-ri is Shin Ha-ri.

133
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,082
That Shin Ha-ri is…

134
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,087
Shin Geum-hui.

135
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,214
What?

136
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,051
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,387
-Is that really true?
-Yes.

138
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,931
I've already confirmed it.

139
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,890
Wait.

140
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,850
Just wait a second.

141
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,352
How is…

142
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,647
So what are you going to do now?

143
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,773
What do you think?

144
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm going to take my time
to make her realize…

145
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,200
just how big of a mistake

146
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,994
she's made.

147
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,456
PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

148
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,806
Again.

149
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,448
Again.

150
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,540
Again.

151
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,299
Again!

152
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,149
Again.

153
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,528
Again.

154
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:21,912
Again!

155
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,789
Mr. Kang!

156
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,757
Please give me detailed feedback
on how you want it redone, sir!

157
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,056
I want you to redo it
until it's to my liking.

158
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,352
What do you…

159
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,408
You're going to make the white kimchi
all over again, now?

160
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,745
Yes.

161
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm going to make the kimchi
and take some time to think it over.

162
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,378
What a pity, really.

163
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,921
She's working so hard.

164
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,883
Hello.

165
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,926
-Hey.
-Oh, hello.

166
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,885
-Here.
-Thank you.

167
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,221
Chef Lee, what brings you here?

168
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,057
I have a meeting
with the marketing team, so I dropped by.

169
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,601
What are you doing, Ha-ri?
You're making kimchi?

170
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,062
Well…

171
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,611
Go ahead, eat!

172
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,779
Yes.

173
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,905
Please help yourselves.

174
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,492
It's fine. Sit down.

175
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,662
Everyone, relax, okay?
Take a seat, come on.

176
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,248
That's it. My goodness.

177
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,250
Hello, President Kang!

178
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,128
Chairman!

179
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,007
Why are they acting like that?

180
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,427
You must be working them to the bone.

181
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,387
They rushed out when they saw you.

182
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,513
It's not that.

183
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,516
They're acting that way
because you're here all of a sudden.

184
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,518
-Totally unannounced.
-Come on.

185
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,811
So what if I called?

186
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,855
All of the executives
would've come running.

187
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,150
I just didn't want
something annoying to happen.

188
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,110
That's why I came without calling.

189
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,530
Hey!

190
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,282
There's a new product!

191
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,199
Yes.

192
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,286
The vegetarian jjajang and
creme brûlée ready for trial production,

193
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,620
and the ravioli is…

194
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,165
undergoing some fine-tuning.

195
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,041
That one started last, right?

196
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,335
Sounds like they're not making
a lot of progress.

197
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,172
No. There was an unexpected problem.

198
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,548
What problem?

199
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,428
Shin Ha-ri!

200
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,429
Ha-ri!

201
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,974
That's the girl who made me
fall on my bum, right?

202
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,519
She looks just fine here,

203
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,772
so why did she go around
with her face covered like a ghost?

204
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,900
I guess because of all the lies.

205
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,611
What? What did you say?

206
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,571
Hey, what do you mean?

207
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,239
-He said he's hungry.
-Is that so?

208
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,908
-Bring him some food then.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,534
Considering the way she acts,

210
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,204
that ravioli doesn't seem that good.

211
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,422
It looks like the food
is to your liking, sir.

212
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,966
Yes, it is.

213
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,471
Is the preparation for the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony going smoothly?

214
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,058
Yes, sir. We decided to have it
at our hotel, like last year,

215
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,228
and Mr. Yu Jae-seok
will be the moderator since you're a fan.

216
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,897
Really? Man, I really do like him.

217
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,525
What's his alter ego these days?

218
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,906
I feel bad
that you're making the ravioli again.

219
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,451
No, the taste isn't the issue.
The problem is the price.

220
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,788
It's what all researchers do.
Don't worry about it.

221
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,207
Aren't you sick of it?
Let's eat out somewhere good.

222
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,502
It's fine. Let's eat here.
I want to see the reaction to our product.

223
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,464
But not many people are here.

224
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,384
That's weird.
This place is usually packed.

225
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,855
Min-woo, do you want to eat out?

226
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,275
-You said you didn't want to.
-As you said,

227
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,569
now that I'm smelling the ravioli,

228
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,571
I suddenly don't want it anymore.

229
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,155
Let's eat out.

230
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,409
-Okay.
-Is Ms. Geum-hui busy nowadays?

231
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,245
What's wrong? Are you all right?

232
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,538
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

233
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,457
So now you dare

234
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,210
to date someone else openly at work?

235
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
Are you listening to me?

236
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,007
What are you looking at?

237
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,259
Why are you asking about Ms. Shin?

238
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,970
I just want to see her again.

239
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,306
It's fun being with her.

240
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,727
Tae-moo, set a date
and clear your schedule,

241
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,312
so we can all see each other.

242
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,357
Sure, I'll set something up
as soon as possible

243
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,862
What's wrong? Are you okay?

244
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,113
Yes, sir. I'm all right.

245
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,957
What? You want me to attend
the Founding Anniversary Ceremony?

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,876
Yes.

247
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,754
My grandfather wants us to meet together.

248
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,797
And that's the only day I can make time.

249
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,636
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can attend that day.

250
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,889
Why? It's a Saturday,
so you don't have work, do you?

251
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,187
Well, that day just happens to be
my close friend's wedding.

252
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,980
-Show me the invitation.
-What?

253
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,232
I'll send them flowers
and congratulatory money

254
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,193
since you won't be able to go.

255
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,156
Oh, right!

256
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,661
Now I remember. The wedding is next week.

257
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,290
My family is holding
ancestral rites that day.

258
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,627
Isn't that usually done at night?
The ceremony will be done before then.

259
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,712
Actually…

260
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,843
Our company isn't doing so well right now.

261
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,181
What do you mean

262
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,058
it isn't doing well?

263
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:22,147
Our company is actually only a step away
from going bankrupt.

264
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,360
So all of the employees are working
overtime every day due to this emergency.

265
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:31,573
So I think it'll be really hard for me to
attend the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

266
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,288
Is that so?

267
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,873
Then there's no other choice.

268
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,379
You'll have to pay the penalty fee.

269
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,343
The penalty fee?

270
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
What's this?

271
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,021
It's not much,
but use it to pay the penalty fee.

272
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,106
It's all I have.

273
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,576
It really isn't much.

274
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,078
This won't even make a dent.

275
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,913
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,207
But I don't have
a lot of money nowadays either.

277
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,543
It's really tough
to live on just your salary.

278
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,754
Rent, utility bills,
daily living expenses.

279
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,173
And why are maintenance fees so expensive?

280
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,844
You think I have time to listen
to a rich girl complain about her life?

281
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,888
What do I do?

282
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,767
If I go to the ceremony like this
and somebody recognizes me,

283
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,185
it's completely over for me.

284
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,857
Hey, calm down.

285
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,068
But how would they recognize you?

286
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,737
Geum-hui and Ha-ri
are two totally different people.

287
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,531
-I bet nobody will recognize you.
-Do you think so?

288
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,632
What? Her company's going bankrupt?

289
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,928
So now she's lying
about a company's bankruptcy?

290
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,013
My goodness.

291
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,143
Are you hungry? Should I order some food?

292
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,686
It's fine.

293
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,067
Why are there so many packages?

294
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,568
Just leave them.

295
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,321
CHA SUNG-HOON

296
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,699
JIN YOUNG-SEO

297
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,578
Jin Young-Seo?

298
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,420
Is this the Jin Young-seo that I know?

299
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,507
Well…

300
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,094
I missed the right time
to tell you about it.

301
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,848
But yes. The one who moved in next door,
Jin Young-seo.

302
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,270
Did we seriously
have to drink at your place?

303
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,689
What if we run into Mr. Cha?

304
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,066
That's why we're taking the stairs.

305
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,235
There's no reason for you to be so scared.

306
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,695
-Who are you?
-Ha-ri?

307
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,864
You're Shin Geum-hui.

308
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,826
He thinks that Geum-hui is my friend.
It's okay, let's go.

309
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,244
Really?

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,793
God, this is so stressful.

311
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,838
Should I just get him
a studio he can clean?

312
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,470
Mr. Cha?

313
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,021
What are you doing here?

314
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,398
Your packages were delivered to my unit.

315
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,151
What? Why would my packages
get delivered to your place?

316
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,361
Did the delivery man make a mistake?

317
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
No, you did. Look at the address!

318
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,781
JIN YOUNG-SEO
UNIT 603

319
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,575
You're right.

320
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,410
Put in the correct address next time.

321
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,078
Sorry.

322
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,338
Do you have a guest over?

323
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,672
-I'm almost--
-Do you want--

324
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,840
It's really delicious.

325
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,010
Didn't I tell you not to do this?
Don't cross the line!

326
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,931
This is just ridiculous.

327
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,935
Everyone makes mistakes!
Why did he have to make such a big fuss?

328
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,313
I know. At work, people always say
that he's very polite and nice.

329
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,649
But he seemed totally different today.

330
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,986
I can't believe that I called
a guy who's that touchy and petty

331
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,863
"the man of my dreams."

332
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,990
You just watch.

333
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:47,579
Mr. Cha, I'll draw all those lines
you want so badly.

334
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,000
You didn't mean it when you said
you'd bring Shin Geum…

335
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:57,089
I mean, Shin Ha-ri to the Founding
Anniversary Ceremony, right?

336
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,258
I'm really going to bring her.

337
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,387
I feel bad for Ms. Shin.

338
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,472
What?

339
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,851
Do you really think that comment
is appropriate in this situation?

340
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,021
-Are you taking Ms. Shin's side right now?
-I'm not.

341
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,274
But you're the one who suggested it

342
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,276
when you knew she was
a stand-in for someone else.

343
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,236
And you even made it sound like a threat.

344
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,365
Also, I'm sure she had to hide
that she worked for our company.

345
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,867
So I think this might be a bit much.

346
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,082
So what are you saying?
That I'm in the wrong?

347
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,625
Well, that's not what I meant.

348
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,837
I'm just saying maybe
you can just forgive her now.

349
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,506
As an employee,
Ms. Shin doesn't have any issues.

350
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,507
She does.

351
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,467
She's good at her job--

352
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,385
Good at her job?

353
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,347
She had her crush of seven years
work for the company she works at.

354
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,473
Anyway!

355
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,227
She's dragging
all of her personal issues into her work.

356
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,066
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Well…

357
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,694
You just seem to lose your calm

358
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,322
when Ms. Shin is involved.

359
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,828
I guess nobody else
has made me so angry before.

360
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,668
Just watch. I'll make her take off

361
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,464
that despicable mask
with her own hands and beg me for mercy.

362
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,098
I don't want to go to work.

363
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,895
What's this?

364
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,523
You just left it over there
so I set it up for you.

365
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,734
I thought you forgot about it
after buying it.

366
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,614
I didn't buy it. It was
from a guy who lives on the sixth floor.

367
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,573
Really?

368
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,825
Why didn't you unwrap it then?

369
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,827
He gave it to me for no reason,

370
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,746
and he was kind of hitting on me.

371
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,875
I stole the hearts of all the men
in the neighborhood as soon as I moved in.

372
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,668
Still, isn't it pretty?

373
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,629
Yes, I guess so.

374
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,548
Good morning.

375
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,803
I'm not having a good morning.

376
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,929
Pardon?

377
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,934
Remember the Bucket List Fish
renewal report that you submitted?

378
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,977
Check it again.

379
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,105
Apparently, it has an issue.

380
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,691
No way. I checked really thoroughly
before I submitted it.

381
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,445
Are you sure you checked thoroughly?

382
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,365
You didn't just rush through it
because of the ravioli?

383
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,952
No! I pulled an all-nighter
double-checking it before I turned it in.

384
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,080
You work so hard,

385
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,375
which is why a mere senior researcher
like you got the Mega Hit Award!

386
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,419
What…

387
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,423
Ms. Shin, you were chosen
as the recipient of the Mega Hit Award.

388
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,676
-Congratulations!
-Really?

389
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,511
Wait, Ms. Yeo, really?

390
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,847
Yes. I heard it with my own ears.

391
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,940
Oh, my, that got me dizzy.

392
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,567
I'm dizzy.

393
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,778
Lucky you, Ms. Shin.

394
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,947
You'll get an award
from President Kang himself

395
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,158
at the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

396
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,952
Right? I'll get an award
from President Kang himself

397
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,745
at the Founding Anniversary Ceremony…

398
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,707
What?

399
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,624
The award.

400
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,334
For you.

401
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,044
What?

402
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,137
Ms. Shin, are you that happy
about the award?

403
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,555
Of course, she's happy.

404
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,141
Laugh all you want, Ms. Shin!

405
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,065
How is this situation real?

406
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,443
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF
THE FOUNDING OF GO FOOD

407
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,741
So I'll go to the Founding Anniversary
Ceremony with Mr. Kang…

408
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,079
Yes! I did it!

409
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,250
…and get an award from Mr. Kang too.

410
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,503
Sung-hoon, you should move
and start looking for your other half too.

411
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,797
I need to stop giving work to Mr. Cha.

412
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,300
-Where's Ms. Shin?
-Where did Ms. Geum-hui go?

413
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,015
I have to be in one place as two people!

414
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,228
Catching two birds with one stone!

415
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,147
Maybe that doesn't apply.

416
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,235
What am I supposed to do?

417
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,823
Okay, there's only one solution.

418
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,245
I have to attend as Geum-hui
because of the penalty fee,

419
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,082
so the employee Shin Ha-ri
won't be able to go.

420
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,420
HOW TO GET OUT OF WORK EVENTS

421
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,463
GUIDELINE FOR OFFICE WORKERS

422
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,635
Subtly buildup my excuse in advance
so they'll believe that I can't go.

423
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,845
Gosh. Are you getting a cold?

424
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,892
Be persistent with the plan
that I've started.

425
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,229
Oh, I don't really have an appetite.
You all should go without me.

426
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:08,358
Lastly, if I show them that I really
want to attend the event,

427
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,402
nobody will suspect me.

428
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,028
It has to work!

429
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,283
Well, then. I should get going.

430
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,635
-Did you do as I said?
-Yes, sir.

431
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,055
No matter hard she tries,
she won't be able to escape the trap

432
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,266
that I've set up for her.

433
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,852
Whether it's Shin Geum-hui or Shin Ha-ri.

434
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,110
Flowers never get old. It's so pretty.

435
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,112
-Honey, read it, quick!
-Okay.

436
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,156
"Hello."

437
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,617
"Your daughter,
Senior Researcher Shin Ha-ri,

438
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,245
has been chosen as the recipient of
the Mega Hit Award."

439
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,039
What's the Mega Hit Award?

440
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,666
It means she made
a product that was a huge hit.

441
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,753
Like the Bucket List Fish!
That one was pretty popular.

442
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,254
Right.

443
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,172
Quickly.

444
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,133
-Then what?
-"Ms. Shin's family is invited

445
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,052
-to this honorable event
-Go on.

446
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,636
-and we would love…
-Come on.

447
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,014
They never invited
our family members before this.

448
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,266
Why are they suddenly doing this?

449
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,268
He called us distinguished guests!

450
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,526
So many people are here.

451
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,612
Is Ms. Shin still not here?

452
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,489
-I haven't seen her.
-Me neither.

453
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,573
There's Chairman Kang.

454
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,284
Ms. Geum-hui, do you like to fish?

455
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,411
Well, yes. Because my parents like it.

456
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,831
Really? You like fishing?

457
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,874
I guess so.

458
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,381
-The award ceremony is starting soon, sir.
-All right.

459
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,013
Let's see, where's our Ha-ri?

460
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,348
Excuse me.

461
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,892
-Do you mind if I use the toilet?
-Go ahead.

462
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,326
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

463
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,953
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

464
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,496
Wait a minute!

465
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,125
Are you

466
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,709
perhaps…

467
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,420
Ha-ri?

468
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,587
Ha-ri?

469
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,673
You're Ha-ri, right?

470
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,216
Ha-ri.

471
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,762
Ha-ri? Ha-ri.

472
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,847
No, that's not me.

473
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,182
Ha-ri, why do you look like this?

474
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,893
You're Shin Ha-ri, right?

475
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,022
Shin Ha-ri!

476
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,611
I'm not Ha-ri.

477
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,946
Come here!

478
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,574
What?

479
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,755
Shin Geum-hui is actually

480
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,382
Shin Ha-ri?

481
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,052
Get this woman out of here, now!

482
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,056
I'm a victim, too!

483
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,436
How could I have known
that the president of my company

484
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,396
would show up to that blind date?

485
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,775
No!

486
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,780
But don't you smell
something burning somewhere?

487
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,994
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:55,293
I'm sorry, sorry…

489
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,466
Ms. Shin.

490
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,177
Ms. Shin.

491
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,845
Ms. Shin.

492
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,896
-Hello, sir.
-Did you have a good nap?

493
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,147
Well, I…

494
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,525
-Where's the ravioli for me to try today?
-Here.

495
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,485
It's hot!

496
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,278
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

497
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,489
Be careful.

498
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,742
When did this get so burnt?

499
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,869
Do it again.

500
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,181
Do you smell something burning…

501
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,310
If she knows she's done wrong,
she should just tell me the truth and beg!

502
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,564
It's hot!

503
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,274
-Are you okay?
-It's hot.

504
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,775
Be careful.

505
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,154
How could an experienced researcher
be so careless?

506
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,740
Wait.

507
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,743
Why am I worried about that woman?

508
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,833
Look at him. It's because he likes her.

509
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,168
BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI

510
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,088
You call this a report?

511
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,549
Do it again. Again!

512
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,802
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

513
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,346
He's so petty.

514
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,433
Messing with Geum-hui for no reason.

515
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,565
SPARKLING MANGO BUBBLES

516
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,566
Wait, that's…

517
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,527
That's Chairman Park's product.

518
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,322
Red mango flavor.

519
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,325
Shin Geum-hui.

520
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,702
They're so alike.

521
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,998
Is it a new product?

522
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,043
It does look good.

523
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,586
Damn it.

524
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,547
They should have used our product.

525
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,386
This should be delicious.

526
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,476
This place is really popular
in the neighborhood.

527
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,186
Today's finally the day!

528
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,855
-Did anybody come alone?
-Me!

529
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,565
-You can come in first.
-Really?

530
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,027
Excuse me.

531
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,366
You can sit next to the man over there
who also came alone.

532
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,909
-Sure.
-Excuse me.

533
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,504
No.

534
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,841
I waited in line to have food here. Yes.

535
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,721
There's the header!

536
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,848
The goalkeeper blocked it.

537
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,935
-Excuse me.
-The ball hasn't cleared far.

538
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,188
I'm sorry I keep running into you.

539
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,776
But I don't think I can help it
since we live in the same neighborhood.

540
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,611
And we can't keep avoiding each other.

541
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,154
Yes, that's fine with me too.

542
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,114
Please eat.

543
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,993
I'll be careful to not cross the line
as neighbors, though.

544
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,301
It's fine as long as
we don't cross this line, right?

545
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,639
Excuse me.

546
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,641
Be careful, it's hot.

547
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,934
Thank you.

548
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,815
I finally get to eat this.

549
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,031
Oh, I'm sorry.

550
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,158
What?

551
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,828
The steam from my food
went over the line onto your side.

552
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,871
Sorry.

553
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,831
Come back here.

554
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,632
Here's your drink.

555
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,967
Thank you.

556
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,304
The bottle opener is over there.

557
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,725
I'm sorry, but I can't cross the line
over to his side.

558
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,061
-Could you get it for me, please?
-The line?

559
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,395
It's all right.

560
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,315
Go ahead, use it.

561
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:33,029
We promised to not cross the line.

562
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,365
I got it.

563
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,799
-Don't you have to flip these over?
-Thank you.

564
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,175
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

565
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,469
They always put this in front of me.

566
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,474
I really like these spicy marinated crabs.

567
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,434
These are the reason why I come here.

568
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,145
But isn't it so fishy?
Just eat it all by yourself.

569
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,063
Sure.

570
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,857
Mr. Gye, you must really hate
marinated crabs.

571
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,692
You always give them to Ms. Yeo.

572
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:18,157
So, now we have two people on our team
who received the Mega Hit Award.

573
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,325
Here.

574
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,662
Let's say cheers with just
the Mega Hit Award recipients, shall we?

575
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,414
Thank you.

576
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,299
Did you not receive one, Mr. Gye?

577
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,259
-Yes.
-Yes.

578
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,344
If he did, he would've been promoted.

579
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,221
Most of our peers are department heads.

580
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,515
Really?

581
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,309
Finally, the mystery is solved!

582
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,105
I really didn't know.

583
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:54,443
-One more bottle here, please.
-Sure.

584
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,780
Aren't you drinking
too much today, Ms. Shin?

585
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:03,077
You can get a bit drunk
on days like these.

586
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,371
Thank you.

587
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,498
Ms. Shin?

588
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,668
You've been working
very hard recently, right?

589
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,713
But that's over now.

590
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,922
Really?

591
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,010
I think it's just starting.

592
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:26,851
Since you got the award, you've basically
gotten an express ticket to a promotion.

593
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,729
Can't you tell by looking at me?

594
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,525
Of course. I know very well.

595
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,614
You also got an express ticket to becoming
an unmarried old woman, right?

596
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,074
Damn it.

597
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,494
Mr. Gye, why did you get
an express ticket to becoming

598
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,040
an unmarried old man
when you never even got an award?

599
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,251
Is it just me?

600
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,796
Ms. Kim has been coming after me tonight.

601
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,256
What?

602
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,219
It's all because she takes after you.

603
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,804
Why are you being so petty?

604
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,724
Do you have to be so jealous
about Ha-ri getting an award?

605
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,269
Jealous? Who's being jealous?

606
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,732
That Mega Hit Award,
it's not even a really big award.

607
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,900
Right.

608
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,319
It's not

609
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,613
a big award.

610
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,406
It is a big award.

611
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,409
Even Mr. Gye has never gotten it.

612
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,745
Right?

613
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,584
I don't think I can eat anymore.
I'm already full from Ms. Kim's insults.

614
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,170
You're giving me too much.

615
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,129
Fine!

616
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,757
I've never gotten the Mega Hit Award.

617
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,718
So I'm dying of jealousy
because of Ms. Shin. Happy now?

618
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,054
Did I do something?

619
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:49,225
Then, Mr. Gye,

620
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,686
do you want to receive the award
instead of me?

621
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,275
I just really don't want it.

622
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,069
I'll give it to you instead.

623
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,906
You can accept it instead of me, Mr. Gye!

624
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,206
I can deal with Ms. Yeo
insulting me to my face,

625
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,584
and Ms. Kim insulting me
in a more roundabout way,

626
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,630
but I really can't handle
Ms. Shin attacking me like that.

627
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,967
All of you are so mean!

628
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,261
Are you crying?

629
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,345
Yes!

630
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,015
Don't cry.

631
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,478
-It's making me sad, too.
-Why are you doing that?

632
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,148
-My jaw's dislocated.
-Don't cry on a day like this.

633
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,317
My jaw, my jaw hurts.

634
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,860
-Stop crying!
-Don't cry.

635
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,902
Stop it!

636
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,738
Ms. Shin, don't cry!

637
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,457
What is it at this hour?

638
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,042
SHIN GEUM-HUI

639
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,087
Hello.

640
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,048
Mr. Kang.

641
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,760
How much is the penalty fee?

642
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,928
You know,

643
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,850
I really don't think that I can attend

644
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,728
the Founding Anniversary Ceremony.

645
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,188
But…

646
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,816
about the penalty fee…

647
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,402
I really don't have the means

648
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,946
to pay for it.

649
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,033
It sounds like you're drunk.
Let's talk later.

650
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,494
I'm not drunk.

651
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,081
I…

652
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,668
I really have a good reason why…

653
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,381
Hey, you!

654
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,548
"Hey, you"?

655
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,884
Did you just say that to me?

656
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,177
No, not you.

657
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,390
There are some high schoolers over there
smoking in this neighborhood.

658
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,266
One second.

659
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,395
Hey!

660
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,856
You can't smoke over there.
You're even wearing your school uniforms.

661
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,608
Put it out, quickly.

662
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,320
Come on. Put it out.

663
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,533
Don't throw… Hey!

664
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,660
Why did you throw away the butts there?

665
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,329
Aren't you going to pick it up?
Come back and pick it up.

666
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,666
Hey, I said, pick it up…

667
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,543
Hello? What…

668
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:21,961
Hello?

669
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,720
The person you have called is unavailable.

670
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,493
Excuse me.

671
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,204
-She's about this tall, and her hair--
-We haven't.

672
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,319
Excuse me.

673
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,947
Sorry.

674
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,957
Where is she?

675
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,714
Ms. Shin.

676
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,383
Ms. Shin.

677
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,928
Ms. Shin…

678
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,976
Ms. Shin.

679
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,605
Ms. Shin, wake up. Are you all right?

680
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,357
Ms. Shin!

681
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,734
What?

682
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,611
Mr. Kang.

683
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,782
What?

684
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,661
How did you know to come all the way here?

685
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,294
Are you the real Kang Tae-moo?

686
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,301
Just how much have you had to drink?

687
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,391
Just a bit.

688
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,730
Snap out of it. You need to go home.

689
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,858
It's cold.

690
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,739
By the way, Mr. Kang.

691
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,075
This…

692
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,828
is a dream, right?

693
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:03,956
What?

694
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,752
If this isn't a dream…

695
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,883
there's no way you would
come running to take care of me…

696
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,263
like this.

697
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,225
That's right.

698
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:33,402
Since this is a dream,

699
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,406
can I tell you a secret?

700
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,496
What is it?

701
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,796
I'm…

702
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,925
Shin Ha-ri.

703
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,514
Shin Ha-ri

704
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,352
is Shin Geum-hui.

705
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,315
It feels so good to let it out.

706
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,195
I'm sorry for everything.

707
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,575
Sorry.

708
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,175
Shin Ha-ri!

709
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,344
Hey, where are you?

710
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,394
Look at you! Why are you sleeping here?

711
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,437
Damn it, why are you hitting me?

712
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,439
Hey, get up, quick. Let's go home.

713
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,358
Let's go.

714
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,569
-Look at you.
-When did you get here?

715
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,655
I've been looking for you all this time.

716
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,427
If this isn't a dream…

717
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,766
there's no way you would
come running to take care of me…

718
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,687
like this.

719
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,815
You just seem to lose your calm

720
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,025
when Ms. Shin is involved.

721
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,823
It makes no sense.

722
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,451
I'm treating something fake

723
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,703
as if it's real.

724
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,092
Get up, Ha-ri.

725
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,972
Come on, get up!
You're going to be late again.

726
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,141
Stop it.

727
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,687
How did I get home yesterday?

728
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,148
Gosh, look at you. Don't you remember?

729
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:20,861
You were sleeping at the playground.
Ha-min carried you back home.

730
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,905
Why are you going around drinking so much?

731
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,073
My team…

732
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,161
My team wanted
to congratulate me on my award.

733
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,748
The next time you get an award,
you might actually die.

734
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,750
Snap out of it, and come eat breakfast.

735
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,753
You need to go to work. Come out.

736
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,754
Okay.

737
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,052
I remember

738
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,056
getting into a taxi to go home last night.

739
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,153
Did you get home okay?
Reply when you see this text.

740
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,613
Did you get home okay?

741
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,408
Mr. Kang also sent me a text.
What did he say?

742
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,751
Hello.

743
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:22,589
What did you mean by your text?
I'm having a hard time understanding it.

744
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,091
I meant exactly what I said.

745
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,385
As of today, you're fired,
Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

746
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,057
I mean, what exactly
do you mean by "fired"?

747
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,186
It means that we'll never
have to see each other again.

748
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,021
I'm hanging up now.

749
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,151
Wait, hello?

750
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,656
Just like that?

751
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,451
Wait.

752
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,537
Then…

753
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,623
that means that I don't have to

754
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,667
worry so much anymore.

755
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,384
Did you dye your hair?

756
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,096
Good morning!

757
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,055
Yes.

758
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,057
Not a good morning.

759
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,475
It's not good at all for me.

760
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,228
What? Why? Did something bad happen?

761
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,146
What?

762
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,107
Don't you remember
what you said to me yesterday?

763
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,109
That's not important right now.

764
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,363
Ms. Shin, you don't have to keep working
on the ravioli anymore.

765
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,032
What? Why?

766
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,534
-They're going with the original version.
-What?

767
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,369
I heard it from Mr. Cha.

768
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,289
I don't know why
but President Kang said so.

769
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,375
He put her through hell only to say that?

770
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,837
Well, all of that work just proves
the ravioli I made the first time

771
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,255
was the best, right?

772
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:46,923
It's all right.

773
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:55,349
She was depressed yesterday,
and today she's happy?

774
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,226
She's gone crazy.

775
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,813
She was put through the mill
just to end up like that.

776
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,072
Sir.

777
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,200
Have you decided to forgive Ms. Shin?

778
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,535
Yes.

779
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,580
I realized that I was investing
too much time into something

780
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,290
that's insignificant.

781
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,417
But why a business trip all of a sudden?

782
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,544
There's no way
I have feelings for Shin Ha-ri.

783
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,715
My brain's just confused
because I saw her so often recently.

784
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,386
This will pass
if I don't see her for a few days.

785
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,889
NEW YORK

786
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,993
What made you like me so much, Mr. Kang?

787
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,335
What are you sorry about?

788
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,756
Are you sorry for being so petty

789
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,341
and messing with me
because it hurt your pride

790
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,218
when I'm not even interested in you?

791
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,774
It's my first time watching
the fireworks at Han River!

792
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,237
Just admit it already.

793
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,327
You didn't want
to admit your feelings for me,

794
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,912
so you came this far.

795
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,164
But you kept thinking of me.

796
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,166
Right?

797
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,667
Right?

798
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,438
I thought we'd finally
get to see your president

799
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,315
who's supposed to be so good-looking.

800
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,900
But we didn't even get a glimpse.

801
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,693
Well, he's so busy.

802
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:57,405
Ms. Han, so what if he's handsome?
He has a rotten personality.

803
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,575
-What?
-He bullied her into remaking the ravioli.

804
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,785
I see.

805
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,412
-But besides that, may I eat first?
-Go ahead.

806
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,294
-Why?
-What is this?

807
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,421
Right. This is a bit spicy for you, right?

808
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,840
It is spicy,

809
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,926
but it's sweet and savory too.
I really like it.

810
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,261
Right?

811
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,012
It's addictive.

812
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,723
You'll keep thinking about it
once you've had it.

813
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,560
I'm going to take the award upstairs.

814
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,494
Very pretty.

815
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,043
I thought I would be relieved.

816
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,264
Ms. Shin, somebody keeps calling you.

817
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,724
You're right.

818
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,475
I don't know this number.

819
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,187
Hello?

820
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,773
This is Ms. Shin Geum-hui's phone, right?

821
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,025
Yes, this is Shin Geum…

822
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,027
hui?

823
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,946
Wait, who is this?

824
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,200
I'm Tae-moo's grandfather.

825
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,160
What?

826
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,539
How did you get my number?

827
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,963
It's been a while since I saw you,
so let's have dinner together.

828
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,634
I'll send you the address,
so meet me there.

829
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,344
Okay?

830
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,470
Let's go home now.

831
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,639
-Yes, let's all go home.
-Okay.

832
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,475
Good work, everyone.

833
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,060
-Yes.
-Have a nice night!

834
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,603
I really did a lot of good work.

835
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,356
-It's only right that we go home.
-Bye, everyone.

836
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,607
FOOD PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM 1

837
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,571
Didn't he take care of things at home
when he fired me?

838
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,949
It's not like I can just ignore this.

839
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:05,992
Damn it.

840
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,543
SHIN HA-RI

841
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,059
CHAIRMAN

842
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,023
Hello?

843
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,869
Go buy us drinks. Your treat.

844
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,829
Wait.

845
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,290
Didn't he say that he'd go
on a business trip with Kang Tae-moo?

846
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,925
I don't think he's home.

847
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,053
Will he not be back tonight?

848
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,393
Young-seo.

849
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,062
You're crossing the line again.

850
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,064
Let's not cross the line. Let's not…

851
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,442
Oh, no!

852
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,779
Did it break?

853
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,823
It did.

854
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,326
This is so annoying.

855
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,542
What is this?

856
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,423
What's this?

857
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,846
This is actually
something I designed myself.

858
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,891
It's better to put it in the bedroom
instead of the living room.

859
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,318
Yes, I have the evidence.
I'm going to the police station now.

860
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,070
Young-seo.

861
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,617
Where are you going?
I've been calling after you.

862
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,243
Were you?

863
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,370
I must not have heard.

864
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,092
I see.

865
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,552
Are you all right?

866
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,389
Why do you have the lamp?

867
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,602
It broke because I dropped it.

868
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,187
I'm going to fix it. Give it here.

869
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,525
I'll fix it for you.

870
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,945
It's okay, I'll do it. Give it back.

871
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,073
-Let go of it.
-Damn it, I said I'll fix it!

872
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,283
-It's fine! What are you doing?
-Let go of it.

873
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,035
What are you doing?

874
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,580
It looks like
that belongs to Ms. Jin, so why…

875
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,335
Ms. Jin, are you all right?

876
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,711
Help me.

877
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:07,465
He secretly filmed videos of me!
Please catch him!

878
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,466
Quick!

879
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,435
Stop right there!

880
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,727
What are you doing? Damn it!

881
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,448
Grandpa wants to have dinner,
so come if you can.

882
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,158
-Why did you beat him up?
-I didn't!

883
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,701
Just follow us, okay?

884
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,828
I don't think I can.

885
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,288
Where are you? It's so noisy.

886
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,916
I'm at the police station.

887
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,250
Why the police station?

888
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,878
What?

889
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,561
What are you doing here?

890
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,146
Your grandfather asked for me.

891
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:49,234
I know I was fired,
but I couldn't just ignore him, so…

892
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,402
-Didn't your friend call you?
-My friend?

893
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,905
-I mean Ms. Jin Young-seo.
-What about Young-seo?

894
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,534
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

895
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,495
Wait.

896
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:02,830
What?

897
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,499
What are you doing?

898
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,875
Let's go, Ms. Shin Ha-ri.

899
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,338
What did you just call me?

900
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,382
You messed with someone
you should've never messed with.

901
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,510
To confess your feelings
without the proper buildup….

902
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,179
All the things you did to me
since you found out that I'm Shin Geum-hui

903
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,348
was to fire me, right?

904
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,684
What I'm saying is…

905
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,685
Why haven't you gone inside yet?

906
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,564
Do you want to start seeing each other
with marriage in mind?

907
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:14,235
