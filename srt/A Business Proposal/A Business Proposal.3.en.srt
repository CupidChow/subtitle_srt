EPISODE 3

2
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:01,978
Sorry.

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,114
-What are you doing here?
-Dad.

4
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,032
"Dad"?

5
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,785
-Running an errand for mom.
-Really? Let's go inside.

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,623
It's cold. Let's go in.

7
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,458
They're gone.

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,628
Mr. Kang. Get up, Mr.--

9
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,713
Come on. Mr. Kang!

10
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,340
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

11
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,424
Mr. Kang!

12
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,842
Mr. Kang.

13
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,681
This contract between "A" and "B"
aims to set the terms

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,935
of the simulated romantic relationship
between both parties

15
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,813
and the requested meetings
with the grandfather of "A".

16
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,234
In the case of a breach of contract,

17
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,821
the penalty shall be 100 times
the contract amount… 100 times?

18
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,031
But that's just ridiculous!

19
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,617
I was so dizzy
that I had to clear my entire schedule.

20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,870
I lost an important contract.
Do you know how much that cost me?

21
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,580
Still, this isn't right!

22
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,126
Someone ordered a chicken from
your place, but you failed to deliver it.

23
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,711
-What would happen to its reputation?
-That's…

24
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,131
I'll just make it up--

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,174
There's no "next time" in this world.

26
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,844
You've lost trust.
You can't put a price on that.

27
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,930
But still, this isn't right.

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,390
Just accept my offer.

29
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,143
Then I won't sue for damages,

30
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,770
and I'll still pay you what I promised.

31
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,152
Mr. Cha? Contact legal and tell them
to proceed with the lawsuit right away.

32
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,696
No, I'll do it! Fine.

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,907
You're very impatient.

34
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,215
I've summarized
some things you need to know

35
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,717
to carry out this contract.

36
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,137
You need to memorize these things.

37
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,890
"Born in 1993, blood type B."

38
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,268
"Went to Hyunil private school
from elementary to high school."

39
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,395
"After graduating early, he was
admitted to Harvard at the age of 18."

40
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,022
At the age of 18?

41
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,608
BORN IN 1993
BLOOD TYPE B

42
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,985
"He graduated summa cum laude
from Harvard…"

43
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,030
"Thomas…"

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,157
How do you read that?

45
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,328
-What?
-It's a thing.

46
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,705
Oh, okay.

47
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,000
Wow, you were a track and field
athlete in college?

48
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,588
Wow, you got good grades and
were an athlete too? That's impressive.

49
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,382
My only flaw is that there's nothing
I'm not good at.

50
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,844
All the projects I've headed
at the company were all successful too.

51
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,555
A JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE
NEWEST FREEZER TECHNOLOGY

52
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,058
I see.

53
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,603
What's that?

54
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,606
"Fell in love while studying abroad
in New York."

55
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,024
-New York?
-Yes.

56
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,985
Since Mr. Kang has been in New York
for the past two years,

57
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,820
this backstory seems the most natural.

58
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,697
But I didn't study in New York.

59
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,076
To address that, we've put together
a backstory for you too.

60
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,707
DAD: TYPICAL LAWYER, MOM: TYPICAL DOCTOR,
HA-MIN: TYPICAL MED STUDENT

61
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,085
Typical?

62
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,879
This is a typical family?

63
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:19,008
Your family needs to seem
acceptable to Chairman Kang, so…

64
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,098
He'd faint if I told him
that my family runs a local chicken shop.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,851
Anyway, the meeting with the chairman
is next Sunday.

66
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,938
Be sure to memorize the backstory
we've put together for you by then.

67
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,064
Okay.

68
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,444
I won't tolerate any mistakes,
do you understand?

69
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,242
SHIN GEUM-HUI

70
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,954
Shin Geum-hui,
you went to a really good school.

71
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,289
Why are you watching this?

72
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,748
Leave it.

73
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,583
Why can't you do anything by yourself?

74
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,793
I told you to leave it…

75
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,671
And if you're poor,
you should know your place in society.

76
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,880
The framework of this…

77
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,055
Graduated from Hyunil elementary, middle,
and high school. Went to Harvard, and…

78
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,726
TOP 20 GLOBAL LEADERS
SELECTED BY TIMES MAGAZINE

79
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,270
Geum-hui, you sure snagged yourself
a pretty impressive boyfriend.

80
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,440
-Geum-hui. Shin Geum-hui!
-Yeah?

81
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,066
Oh, Dad?

82
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,776
What are you daydreaming about?

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,489
Wow, you're getting really immersed
in your new identity, Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

84
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,453
Is this really worth all this effort?

85
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,122
What can I do?

86
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,459
Otherwise, I have to pay him
100 times the contract amount.

87
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,835
100 times?

88
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,296
100 times, my ass.

89
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,216
Did Ha-ri get spooked
by some absurd lie again?

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,968
He was going to press charges.

91
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,762
He would have found out my real name

92
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,014
and the fact that I work for his company.

93
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,391
Then what would happen? I'd get fired and…

94
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,811
Look, this is the best I can do.

95
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,401
So how's the studying coming along
on your fake boyfriend?

96
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,362
The more I learn,
the more unbelievable he seems.

97
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,199
Not only was he was born with
a diamond spoon in his mouth,

98
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,743
but he's also smart
and good at sports. Plus, he's hot.

99
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,913
But his parents passed away in
an accident when he was young.

100
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,542
Hey, I heard about that.

101
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,045
That's why there are no relatives
in any of the subsidiaries.

102
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,255
-Really? Why?
-Don't even get me started.

103
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,512
Rumor had it that someone was behind
the accident that killed his parents.

104
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,429
Really?

105
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,266
I mean, I have no idea
if that's the truth or not.

106
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,853
But apparently, Chairman Kang fired
all his blood relatives to protect him.

107
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,402
Yes!

108
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,245
What is it this time?

109
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,582
-Hello?
-Where are you right now?

110
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,293
Where else would I be at this hour?
Of course, I'm at home.

111
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,211
What is it?

112
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,467
I thought it would be best to discuss
this in a private space.

113
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,594
Oh, okay.

114
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,513
Did you memorize everything?

115
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,597
Yes.

116
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,767
Graduated from Hyunil schools.
Got into Harvard in 2010.

117
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,310
That's my grandson!

118
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,688
Joined go food after graduation.

119
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,358
After the success of Woorigo series
of bone broth, you were promoted quickly

120
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,528
and abruptly went to the New York
branch. As for your hobbies--

121
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,737
Enough!

122
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,489
What are you doing?

123
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,869
I heard that the chairman
was very thorough,

124
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,746
so I memorized
your entire profile just in case.

125
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,790
Do you think he'll ask you to recite it?

126
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,126
Still, I'm impressed, Ms. Shin.

127
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,296
You can't lose if you do it by the book.

128
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,424
Ask me anything. I'll get it right.

129
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,550
Is that so?

130
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,137
Then, if my grandfather asked to see you
on Saturday, two weeks from now,

131
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,891
what would be the correct way to respond?

132
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:02,773
Well, there's no real reason to say no
if your grandfather is asking to see me.

133
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,067
-So shouldn't I just say, sure?
-Wrong!

134
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,321
-"No" is the right answer.
-Why?

135
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,865
That day is our one-year anniversary.

136
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,867
Don't couples usually

137
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,204
spend time together on days like that?

138
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,417
-Are you sure you studied properly?
-But that was a trick question.

139
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,003
That's why simple memorization
won't always work.

140
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,131
Let me ask you something too, then.

141
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,345
What was I wearing when we first met?

142
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,347
-How could I possibly know that?
-Wrong!

143
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,559
Of course, you should remember!
After all, it was the first day we met.

144
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,943
On the day we first met,
it was raining in New York.

145
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,280
Just so you know, I looked up
the actual weather that day in New York.

146
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,831
His clothes look expensive.

147
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,792
What if he asks me
to pay for the dry cleaning?

148
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,669
Are you Korean?

149
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,879
Yes.

150
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
You too?

151
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,801
Falling in love just like that?

152
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,094
That's too unlikely.

153
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,308
Why? I think your grandfather
will be completely fooled

154
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,977
with the details
about the weather and everything.

155
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,062
I don't like rainy days.

156
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,814
Let's change the date instead.

157
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,490
You really don't have to drop me off.

158
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,992
It's late. Just accept the ride.

159
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,996
Yes, it wouldn't be right to let
a woman go home alone at this hour.

160
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,997
Okay.

161
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,417
Thank you so much.

162
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,743
We must be pretty close by now.

163
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,120
What? We still have a bit more to go.

164
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,040
I guess I was wrong,

165
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,795
That hurt.

166
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,645
I'll see you this weekend, then.

167
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,118
About Ms. Shin, isn't there something
oddly endearing about her?

168
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,829
Is being overly emotional
and easily distracted endearing?

169
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,173
Why are you smiling?

170
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,091
It's nothing.

171
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,106
Go on a blind date next week.

172
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,778
Are you pretending you don't know?
Or do you really not know?

173
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,281
Have you not heard
anything about my blind dates?

174
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,282
I've heard.

175
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,534
Yet you still want me to go on
blind dates?

176
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,662
That's why I looked internationally
instead of domestically.

177
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,788
Dad!

178
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,459
Do you want the rumors that I'm crazy
to reach international waters too?

179
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,461
I don't want to be set up with anyone!

180
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,671
You can't only do
the things you want to do.

181
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,716
As my heiress, you have responsibilities--

182
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,802
So you want me to have
an arranged marriage just like you?

183
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,638
You weren't happy,
and that's why you divorced.

184
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,682
Why do you want me
to go down the same path?

185
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,017
We…

186
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:53,063
-That was because your mom was eccentric.
-I'm just as eccentric as mom is.

187
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,025
I won't get married if I'm not in love.

188
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,319
So stop meddling in my life.

189
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,155
You insolent…

190
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,450
If you plan on acting however you please,
then move out!

191
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,035
Fine, I will.

192
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,829
I know you're famous for not
taking back anything you say.

193
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,915
So I'll do exactly as you ordered.

194
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,791
Hey, you…

195
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,005
Wait!

196
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,548
Wait.

197
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,429
I won't stop you from living on your own.

198
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,431
-But…
-But what?

199
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,017
-Leave my credit card behind.
-What?

200
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,896
Do you not know what it means
to be truly independent?

201
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,192
True independence is
living off the money you earn yourself.

202
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,711
What are you going to do
now that you have to eat your meals alone?

203
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,381
Taking away the credit card is
such a petty move.

204
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,054
In just three years, our dumplings now
make up the largest share

205
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,556
within the domestic market.

206
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,268
Furthermore, we are on the verge
of reaching a global sales revenue

207
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,479
of a trillion won, with the US
sales revenue being 400 billion won.

208
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,399
Let's have a round of applause!

209
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,650
Everyone, stop!

210
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,529
Our overseas market share
hasn't caught up with China's yet,

211
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,656
and you think it's time to clap?

212
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,284
I'm sorry, sir.

213
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,785
Have you set up a countermeasure?

214
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,288
Pardon? A countermeasure?

215
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,040
Well, that's…

216
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,334
I mean, a countermeasure--

217
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,087
If you're just going to read off
what your subordinates wrote for you,

218
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,506
you don't need to attend
these meetings from now on.

219
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,342
Now, let's move onto the next topic.

220
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,762
The Food Product Development Division's
"A Collaboration With the Chef".

221
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,890
Food Product Development Team 3…

222
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,810
will be under the direction
of Chef Jang Michelle.

223
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,562
-Michelle?
-That famous chef?

224
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,397
The super famous French chef?

225
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,691
How is Team 1 progressing on this?

226
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:02,985
Well…

227
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,823
We were developing an Italian family-style
meal with Chef Park Chun, but…

228
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,784
CHEF PARK CHUN'S BULLYING SCANDAL
ALL ACTIVITIES HALTED

229
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,121
This chef was just getting famous
but he turned out to be a bully?

230
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,789
I knew something was off about him

231
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,875
when he crushed garlic with his fists.

232
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,753
But then what about the dish
that we were working on?

233
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,630
Well, that's off the table now.

234
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,592
-How did it go?
-How do you think?

235
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,511
I got yelled at for not looking
into the chef's private life.

236
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,222
I told them that we would
look for another chef.

237
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,559
-Actually, I've already found a few.
-Yeah.

238
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,311
This chef is famous for his seafood.

239
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,228
CHEF HA JAE-WON

240
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,146
CHEF LEE JONG-JAE

241
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,107
This chef had a lot of TV exposure,
so he's already well-known.

242
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,737
But everyone in the industry
knows that we're looking

243
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,448
for a replacement for Chef Park.
Will it be okay?

244
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,202
Oh, Ms. Shin.

245
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,871
How about Chef Lee Min-woo?

246
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,247
-Min-woo?
-Yeah.

247
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,125
He's new, and his food is good.
Wouldn't he be a good fit?

248
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,169
Of course. That's why I recommended him.

249
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,629
Is he clean though?

250
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,716
He looks like a womanizer. What if
he causes a scandal after we hire him?

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,427
Don't bad-mouth an innocent guy
when you have no other alternatives.

252
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,179
I'm not bad-mouthing him.

253
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,766
He's just popular with girls.

254
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,979
Didn't you see him
completely reject Hye-ji?

255
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,271
You're right.

256
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,358
Judging by how he rejected me,
I don't think we'll have a problem.

257
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,361
Plus, he's super handsome,
and his food is great too!

258
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,738
I think we have a real shot at winning!

259
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,865
That's what I'm saying.

260
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,910
Get things ready so we can submit
a recommendation tomorrow.

261
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

262
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:49,008
You know, I even like
the name of your future wife.

263
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,718
Shin Geum-hui.

264
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,680
She has the same name as the
main character from my favorite TV show.

265
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,807
Let me hear it first.

266
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,189
Gwang-bok and Geum-hui
are finally together!

267
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,274
BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI

268
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,788
What kind of show makes the characters
get together after just one kiss?

269
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,290
This show is the worst.

270
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,375
Don't watch things like this.

271
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,045
Hey, what do you mean it's the worst?

272
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,382
Listen here, this show is hitting 27%
in viewership.

273
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,385
You just need to get into it.

274
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,060
Hey.

275
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,193
-Can you focus on the garnish?
-Okay.

276
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,320
-Wow, this is so good.
-Hey!

277
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,697
Have you been starving?
You should eat more slowly.

278
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,533
I haven't eaten all day because
I was looking for apartments at lunch.

279
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,994
Seriously, why did you move out?

280
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,538
Do you even have money
to get your own place?

281
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,583
You all seem to think that
I've been living off of my dad's money.

282
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,877
But I've saved up my paychecks.

283
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,588
Oh, sure. I'm sure you've saved a lot…

284
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,633
Min-woo, what about the
white kimchi ravioli?

285
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,010
I just called it ravioli,

286
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,347
but I made it with whatever I had at hand.
It's not even on the menu.

287
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,390
No. I think it'll make a perfect product.

288
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,684
A Korean-style ravioli.

289
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,229
-It's new.
-I don't know. Do you think it'll work?

290
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,856
Hey, don't you trust my taste buds?

291
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,235
I like your food for a reason, you know.
Go and make some, quick.

292
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,444
Okay.

293
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,037
"I like your food."

294
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,207
"And, I like you too."

295
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,547
I guess you don't want to
sleep over at my place tonight?

296
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,844
"I feel like sleeping out
on the streets tonight!"

297
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,721
-I'm sorry.
-Right?

298
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,639
Go eat.

299
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,186
What kind of security deposit
is this expensive?

300
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,398
This place doesn't even look like
it's half as big as my bedroom.

301
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,860
I thought you said you saved all your
paychecks without spending a cent.

302
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,528
So you were exaggerating.

303
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,073
On top of rent,
I also need to buy furniture,

304
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,450
and my living expenses
will be pretty high too.

305
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,368
Oh, that's right.

306
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,373
So I was thinking.
Should I just live with you?

307
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,791
In this room?

308
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,921
It was just a thought.
I'm going to get my own place!

309
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,673
You're a mean girl.

310
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,815
RECOMMENDATION
CHEF LEE MIN-WOO

311
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,620
It's so loud.

312
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,998
Turn off that alarm.

313
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,419
"Turn off the alarm"?
Get up. You're going to be late.

314
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,630
Ha-ri?

315
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,049
You fell asleep like this?
Your back will hurt.

316
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:22,429
Ha-ri, get up! Wake up!
Get up, you need to go to work.

317
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,639
What time is it?

318
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,765
What time do you think?

319
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,226
Oh, my God!

320
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,353
I haven't finished this! What do I do?

321
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,021
Get up and eat something first.

322
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,522
What? Food?

323
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,316
Right, I need to eat.

324
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,152
When did I fall asleep?
Wait, the recommendation…

325
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,155
Wait, I think I got to the part
about social media…

326
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,450
-Ms. Yeo.
-Yes?

327
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,828
I made the profile for Chef Lee
that you requested,

328
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,373
along with a proposal
for our collaboration.

329
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,459
Goodness, did you really finish
all of this in one day?

330
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,670
I had some ideas
from the last recommendation,

331
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,338
so it didn't take me very long.

332
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,844
White kimchi ravioli?

333
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,348
I wanted to cater to Korean taste buds

334
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,310
by using white kimchi for the filling.

335
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,855
Well, if it's dumplings,
then it can be mass-produced for sure.

336
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,859
What's this?

337
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,070
I thought President Kang
and other directors

338
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,406
might not know a lot about
Min-woo or his cooking,

339
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,742
so I compiled a list of reviews
for his dishes from social media.

340
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,537
THE RAVIOLI IS THE BEST!

341
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,539
IT'S QUITE GOOD, AND THE CHEF'S HANDSOME

342
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,749
Wow, he's really popular with women.

343
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,584
Yes. I think that will be an advantage

344
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,754
when we're marketing the products to
customers in their 20s and 30s.

345
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,715
But white kimchi ravioli?

346
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,341
Don't you think it's a bit risky?

347
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,510
I actually put some thought into that too.

348
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,345
We can just change the filling.

349
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,557
Like meat dumplings or kimchi dumplings.

350
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,101
The filling uses ricotta cheese as a base,

351
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,396
but there's an Italian version
using Italian sausages as well, and…

352
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,818
I can't. How am I supposed
to give a presentation to the president?

353
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,819
Why can't you?

354
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,655
You just need to do what you did
in front of me a moment ago.

355
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,075
It'd be better if you gave
the presentation, Ms. Yeo…

356
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,661
I've never had Chef Lee's ravioli,

357
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:14,249
and above all, I can't explain things
as well as you do.

358
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,543
-Let's go.
-Please, just wait.

359
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,170
She's right, Ms. Shin.

360
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,131
Director Go got yelled at so much
yesterday for making a mistake

361
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,509
while reading off of the papers that
a subordinate wrote for him.

362
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,096
Then you give the presentation, Mr. Gye.

363
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,265
Don't you know that Mr. Gye
has stage fright?

364
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,100
-You need to do it, Ms. Shin.
-One second.

365
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,810
I'm already feeling nervous.

366
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,688
This is a great opportunity
to get President Kang's attention.

367
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,524
It's because I shouldn't be
grabbing his attention right now.

368
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,737
Ms. Shin! Don't let me get embarrassed
in front of everyone and let's go!

369
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,988
Let's go!

370
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,199
Yeah, okay. Bye.

371
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,116
Wait!

372
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,161
A COLLABORATION WITH THE CHEF
CHEF RECOMMENDATIONS

373
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,287
Development Team 1,

374
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,081
is the chef list ready?

375
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,916
Actually…

376
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,420
Ms. Shin was supposed
to present for our team.

377
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,963
Why, is there a problem?

378
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,965
Well, that's…

379
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,601
I'm sorry for being late.

380
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,688
Hello, my name is Shin Ha-ri, from
Food Product Development Team 1.

381
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,024
The chef we're recommending--

382
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,359
You're going to present like this?

383
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,614
-Sir?
-Remove your mask. It's hard to hear you.

384
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,117
The mask…

385
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,708
What am I going to do?

386
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,524
I actually have a cold.

387
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,401
Just keep it on then.

388
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,365
Yes, sir.

389
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:18,331
The chef that we are recommending
is Chef Lee Min-woo of M Kitchen.

390
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,625
And the main menu is white kimchi ravioli.

391
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,588
The reason we are recommending this
chef is because of his genre of cooking…

392
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,091
Look, this place is in the middle of Seoul
and close to subway stations.

393
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,384
It's a great location.

394
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,888
So all these appliances come
with the apartment, right?

395
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,265
Of course, they come with the apartment!

396
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,767
There's a room too…

397
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,060
It's big.

398
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,104
In my 20 years working as a realtor,

399
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,815
I've never met anyone
as easy to please as you, miss.

400
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,483
I'm kind of like that.

401
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,611
Let's go down and write out the contract.

402
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,570
Sure.

403
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,113
The elevator's here.

404
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,040
Printing out the ingredient analysis
took so long that I'm late.

405
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,251
I need to hurry up and tell Min-woo!

406
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,382
Huh? I thought it was closing time.

407
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,551
Are there still customers?

408
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,435
Come on.

409
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:25,523
You can't just do that all of a sudden.
Look, I spilled this everywhere!

410
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,454
Ha-ri.

411
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,625
It's been a while, Ha-ri.

412
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,962
Yeah. It's good to see you, Yoo-ra.

413
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,130
You're here for work, right?

414
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,799
Oh, should I let you guys talk?

415
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,509
Oh, no, it's okay.

416
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,220
No, we can just talk later. It's fine.

417
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,013
-Bye.
-Wait…

418
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:20,370
Sorry. Were you shocked?
I was going to tell you before, but…

419
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,666
You've only had eyes on Yoo-ra
all this time.

420
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,261
But I still wanted to stay by your side
even just as a friend.

421
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,849
Because I thought that maybe you'd
look at me the same way one day.

422
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,600
That you might notice

423
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,477
how much I like you.

424
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,397
Yoo-ra wants to break up.

425
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,441
I really thought that.

426
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,912
That's my bus.

427
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,335
Sorry!

428
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,230
ARCHAEOPTERYX

429
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,107
Hello?

430
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,442
Ms. Shin.

431
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,444
Ms. Shin?

432
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:39,949
Oh, my.

433
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,871
Here you go.

434
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,290
ARCHAEOPTERYX

435
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,875
Thank you.

436
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,712
It must've hurt. Be careful.

437
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,802
It does hurt.

438
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,934
I thought it wouldn't,

439
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,482
but it hurts.

440
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,112
It hurts so much.

441
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,108
I wonder what happened.

442
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,622
Ninety-nine…

443
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,207
One hundred…

444
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,713
Nobody will be able to tell
that I was crying now, right?

445
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,923
All right.

446
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,092
Wig…

447
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,428
Oh, makeup.

448
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,101
A DAY TO SKETCH

449
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,189
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HA-RI
FROM MIN-WOO

450
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,611
This show is today?

451
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,990
Why are you so spooked?
Mom says to come eat.

452
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,618
No, I need to go out.
I'm meeting someone today.

453
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,329
Hey! I like this group too.

454
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,247
This show is today.

455
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,000
If you're not going to go,
can I have this?

456
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,428
RECENT CALLS
ARCHAEOPTERYX

457
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,554
What?

458
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,266
I never talked to him yesterday.

459
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,392
What is this?

460
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,603
No way. Last night…

461
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,693
-Hi.
-Get in.

462
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,321
-You drove here yourself?
-This is a personal affair.

463
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,839
Did you call me yesterday?

464
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,258
I didn't know, but I saw
I had a call from you last night.

465
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,262
I'd called about today, but I hung up
because I couldn't hear anything. Why?

466
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,806
Nothing.

467
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,645
The weather is really nice today!

468
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,280
Maybe I should've taken
something to calm my nerves.

469
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,658
Are you nervous?
Didn't you say you've got this?

470
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,287
Mr. Cha said that your grandfather
is a really scary and strict person.

471
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,290
If he realizes that we're lying to him…

472
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,460
If you're scared, then while we're inside,
try to love me for real.

473
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,256
What?

474
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,174
Let's go.

475
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,011
Okay.

476
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,849
We're here.

477
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,100
Hey.

478
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:41,149
Ms. Shin Geum-hui!
You're as beautiful as I imagined.

479
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,529
Not her. Her.

480
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,156
What?

481
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,867
Oh, my.

482
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,202
Nice to meet you.

483
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,495
Yes, hello.

484
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:10,970
You said that you majored
in art in New York?

485
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,430
Oh, yes, sir.

486
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,683
I suppose that's why you seem so unique.

487
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,606
Since I was meeting the chairman,

488
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,901
I put on a lot of makeup so I wouldn't
get busted, but was it overkill?

489
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,032
Try this dish, sir.

490
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,326
They say potatoes are
good for hypertension.

491
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,662
Tae-moo told me about your hypertension.

492
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,413
I have diabetes, too.

493
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,125
Some bland vegetables like these
are probably better

494
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,630
than anything that's been cooked to be
all sweet and salty, right?

495
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,968
Ah, indeed. Eating habits are important,

496
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,303
but it's even better to combine it
with exercise.

497
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,639
I heard that you like hiking, right?

498
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,640
Yes, I do.

499
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,642
Do you like hiking as well, Ms. Shin?

500
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,727
Yes, I like it a lot!

501
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,479
Tae-moo, do you remember?

502
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,815
On Mount Brunni in Switzerland,

503
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,276
we enjoyed the stars together all night.
It was beautiful.

504
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,653
-Ms. Shin.
-Yes.

505
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,614
Do you love Tae-moo?

506
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,788
Of course!
I'm dating him because I love him.

507
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,333
Then why did you break up?

508
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,169
That's…

509
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,216
Grandfather. You can't just ask something
like that so directly--

510
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,553
I'm asking because it's something
that needs to be asked, you rascal.

511
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,762
Come on, answer me.

512
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,348
Well…

513
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,477
I thought that he cared about
work more than he did about me.

514
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,856
Tae-moo is someone who knows nothing
besides work.

515
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:49,277
That won't change in the future, either.
Are you okay with that?

516
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,404
Because you'll keep fighting about it.

517
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,114
Don't worry.

518
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,907
When we talked things over this time,

519
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:59,162
I decided I would understand that Tae-moo
prioritizes work over everything else.

520
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,621
He was so crazy about his work

521
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,958
that I ignored all his calls
after telling him "let's break up."

522
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,129
But he canceled an important meeting
he had scheduled and ran over to see me.

523
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,464
This boy

524
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,467
really skipped a meeting to go see you?

525
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,468
Yes.

526
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,306
On top of that, you know how
Tae-moo hates the rain, right?

527
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,684
It was raining that day,
and yet he still came.

528
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,812
Is that true, Tae-moo?

529
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,903
Let's eat first and discuss that later.
The food's getting cold.

530
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,863
What? Oh, right.

531
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,700
-Really?
-Yes.

532
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,206
The password is
written on top of the router.

533
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,832
Oh, okay. Thank you.

534
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,421
-Well, then.
-Thank you so much.

535
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,257
-Your sofa is here.
-Yes, I'm coming!

536
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,847
-Hello.
-Hello. The sofa's here! One moment.

537
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,224
Where should we put it?

538
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,976
I'm going to place it in the living room.

539
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,895
-Please be careful.
-Did you order Jajangmyeon?

540
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,106
Yes. Everyone seems
to have come all at once.

541
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,484
Could you wait with the food
for a moment so the sofa can go in first?

542
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:15,446
-Sure thing.
-Oh, the sofa, can go right here.

543
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,572
Okay.

544
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,451
It looks like someone finally
moved in next door.

545
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,787
-I have a package for you.
-Yes.

546
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,999
-Hello.
-Hello.

547
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,042
Thank you.

548
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,254
Could you please be
a bit more careful with the sofa?

549
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,839
I paid a lot of money for that.

550
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,383
-Package for you!
-Yes, please put it in front of the door.

551
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,884
Okay.

552
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,427
Careful.

553
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,265
-Oh, I need to pay, right?
-That will be 6,000 won.

554
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,350
Looks like my new neighbor's loud.

555
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,310
-Thanks.
-One second, I can--

556
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,728
-It's all right.
-Oh. Okay.

557
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,564
Enjoy your meal. It's fine.

558
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,531
I've been looking for you forever!

559
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,118
It was so awkward being with
your grandfather by myself, I was dying.

560
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,911
Hey, didn't I do well just now?

561
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,997
I don't think he liked me
very much at first,

562
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,207
but once I talked to him
about the rainy day,

563
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,876
he started getting into my story--

564
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,252
Why did you bring that up?

565
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,129
What do you mean?

566
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,463
That I ran to see you

567
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,799
on a rainy day.

568
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,843
You said that you don't like the rain.

569
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,928
So I added some truth to make
the story more realistic.

570
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,723
You ran to your lover
even though you hate the rain.

571
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,475
-How romantic is that?
-You must be mistaken.

572
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,687
But our relationship is
simply a contractual exchange of money.

573
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,022
Yes, right.

574
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,482
So don't act like
we're anything actually real.

575
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,736
Just answer his questions and don't
add any of your useless comments.

576
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,653
Got it?

577
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,948
Okay.

578
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,200
Ms. Shin.

579
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,410
Yes, sir.

580
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,663
Do you, by any chance,

581
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,999
like steamed buns?

582
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,168
Grandfather, today is--

583
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,128
I wasn't asking you.

584
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,505
Ms. Shin, do you like them?

585
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,675
Steamed buns…

586
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,511
Yes, I like steamed buns.

587
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:07,433
Then let's go eat
some steamed buns for dessert.

588
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,477
Let's take my car from here.

589
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,107
Damn steamed buns.

590
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,279
What did rain ever do to him?
Why is he being so touchy?

591
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,490
Wait for me, Tae-moo!

592
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,992
SUNRISE REALTOR
IBO CONVENIENCE STORE

593
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,164
Chairman Kang, hello!

594
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,458
Have you been well?

595
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,043
Of course, all thanks to you.

596
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,002
Let's go in.

597
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,128
After you.

598
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,339
We came all the way to Anheung
for steamed buns?

599
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,050
Don't complain.
You brought this on yourself.

600
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,762
Hey, what did I do that was so bad?

601
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,057
I just answered his questions
like you told me to.

602
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,853
What? Did I say something wrong?

603
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,231
I just did my best to do well…

604
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:02,071
-What are you suddenly doing?
-Your grandfather is watching.

605
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,447
Let's go, quickly.

606
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,449
Let's go, Tae-moo.

607
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,451
Here, eat.

608
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,577
Okay.

609
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,579
Let's see.

610
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,335
That's tasty.

611
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,964
They really are.

612
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,968
The bread is fermented really well.
The red bean filling is soft, too.

613
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,137
It was definitely worth the trip out here!

614
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,809
Hey, you got some red bean on your teeth.

615
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,019
My teeth? Oh, my!

616
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,187
What were the conditions?

617
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,273
Yes.

618
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,274
Have a drink.

619
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,275
Oh, yes, sir.

620
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,694
There we go.

621
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,778
Thank you.

622
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,451
That's it.

623
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,165
I apologize for today.

624
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,458
What do you mean?

625
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,710
For acting so stiff when I first saw you.

626
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:03,841
My first impression of the way
you were dressed wasn't the best.

627
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,344
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,179
It's all right, I understand.

629
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,390
I'm surprised
every time I look at myself, too.

630
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,850
Oh, and…

631
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,393
thank you.

632
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,520
Thanks for what?

633
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,481
Just for everything.

634
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:24,528
Anyway, it looks like Tae-moo
really cares about you, Ms. Shin.

635
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,239
Please keep taking good care of him.

636
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:28,991
Sure.

637
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,534
All right.

638
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,415
Oh, my.

639
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,211
-Are you all right, Ms. Shin?
-Oh, my. Yes. I'll pick those up.

640
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,344
-Oh, thank you.
-Here you go.

641
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,679
My goodness.

642
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,099
A DAY TO SKETCH

643
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,936
Let's go back to Seoul.
I have some business to take care of.

644
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,354
Business to take care of?

645
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,649
It's because you always act like that

646
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,861
that Ms. Shin can't even ask you
about things like this.

647
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,279
What did I…

648
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,448
-What are those?
-They're concert tickets.

649
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,619
Seeing as how they're for today,
she must have bought them to go with you.

650
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,787
Right, Ms. Shin?

651
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,748
-What?
-Get going right away!

652
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,376
Come on!

653
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,044
Here, take it!

654
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,170
Let's go, come on.

655
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,755
That little…

656
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,773
This is so nice.

657
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,902
I'm completely broke
after buying this sofa, though.

658
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,447
Should I have bought a cheaper one?

659
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:54,994
No.

660
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,706
This is a gift to myself to celebrate
my first time moving out on my own.

661
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,207
Good job, Young-seo.

662
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,588
It feels so good!

663
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,133
I'm so hungry.

664
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,510
Is moving always this hard?

665
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,847
Okay.

666
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,267
Is there a draft coming in from somewhere?

667
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,564
What?

668
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,030
Cockroach!

669
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,157
I hate cockroaches!

670
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,703
I hate them so much!

671
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,920
What's going on?

672
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,839
Sorry, there's a cockroach in my house.

673
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,969
You're…

674
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,722
Ms. Jin, what are you doing here…

675
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,560
Oh, well, it's a long story.

676
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,105
I'm sorry, but…

677
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,859
could I ask you for a favor?

678
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,864
It's inside that paper cup.

679
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,659
Right.

680
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,000
Sorry. I'm okay with everything else,
but I'm just really scared of bugs.

681
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,712
Sure.

682
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,985
Will it really die if you just
spray the outside like that?

683
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,363
I'm not sure. Don't you think it's dead
by now if I've sprayed this much?

684
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,573
Do you have another can?

685
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,033
Are you scared of bugs?

686
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,161
No, it's not that.
They just gross me out, that's all.

687
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,247
Isn't that the same thing?

688
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,083
-Oh, my God!
-That scared me.

689
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,087
I'm all right, but are you?

690
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,007
Yeah.

691
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,259
I'll finish it off. Get behind me.

692
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,945
He's using so much of the spray.

693
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,289
I flushed it down the toilet,
so there's no need to worry.

694
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,458
Thank you for helping me.

695
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,293
It was nothing.

696
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,461
Goodbye, then.

697
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,712
Wait.

698
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,593
Meeting like this as neighbors
is kind of fate,

699
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,262
so let's be friends
and get to know each other.

700
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,769
I'm sorry, but I don't think that'll work.

701
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,521
What do you…

702
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,315
You put Mr. Kang in a difficult position

703
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,526
by sending somebody else on the blind date
to fill in for you.

704
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:20,282
So I just don't think it would be right
for me to get to know you personally.

705
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,254
Wow.

706
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,841
Did I really just get rejected
as a neighbor too?

707
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,551
ART CENTER

708
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,769
I said we could go by ourselves but he
had to drop us off in front of the venue…

709
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,229
I know you too well.

710
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:54,817
It's so obvious you would pretend to go
then go back to work.

711
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,820
I want to watch the two of you
head inside.

712
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,494
Bye.

713
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,041
Let's go in then come back out
when your grandfather's gone.

714
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,670
Go ahead.

715
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,505
Goodbye.

716
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,134
He'll probably stay right in front
of the building until the concert starts.

717
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,510
Just give up.

718
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:07,055
You opened your eyes

719
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,351
As the light started to shine

720
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:17,316
You're like a gift that was prepared

721
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,152
Just for me

722
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:26,700
All of the small things
Just seem to get bigger

723
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:32,539
This moment
Where even my plain, everyday life

724
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:39,630
Becomes special too

725
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,051
A DAY TO SKETCH

726
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,221
We're the ballad duo, Melomance.
Thank you for coming.

727
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,139
Hello, everyone.

728
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,599
MELOMANCE IS OUR GIFT
OUR EVERYTHING, MELOMANCE

729
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,646
As a special event for our audience
members today,

730
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,815
we've taken song requests alongside
their special stories.

731
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,317
They do those things too!

732
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,784
"I've been a fan of yours
for a long time."

733
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:12,829
"I bought tickets for today's show and
gave them to a friend for her birthday."

734
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,001
"We've been good friends
for seven whole years."

735
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,421
"She even bought me drinks
and comforted me

736
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,550
when I broke up with my girlfriend
and when I had to go to the army."

737
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,426
"But she doesn't have a boyfriend yet."

738
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,013
"I'm hoping that she'll go to the concert
with her boyfriend."

739
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,641
"I ask that you gift her
with your amazing song."

740
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,311
Row B, seats 42 and 43! Are you here?

741
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,822
You came with a gentleman today!

742
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,532
-Oh, no, I…
-He's hot!

743
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,368
No…

744
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,454
I guess your friend's wish has come true!

745
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,665
I'm sure he'll be happy.

746
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,001
Congratulations to his friend
of seven years

747
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,961
for coming here today with a gentleman.

748
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,006
-Thank you.
-We'll sing "Love, Maybe,"

749
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,924
as requested.

750
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:23,233
My days are filled with daydreams

751
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,154
About all the things
That I want to do with you

752
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:33,452
When I see you happy

753
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:38,123
All I can do is smile

754
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:42,502
Everything you do makes my heart flutter

755
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,798
And I keep on spending
More nights wide awake

756
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,760
Thinking of all the little things you do

757
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,595
Do you know this song?

758
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,431
Sure. I really like this song.

759
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,142
Really? This one isn't that popular yet.

760
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,062
-Hey, sing it for me some time.
-What?

761
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,563
You're good at singing.

762
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,316
I was totally impressed
at the orientation.

763
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,777
Sure.

764
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,159
-This stop is Seoun University.
-Min-woo…

765
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,871
The next stop is Donggyo Arts High School.

766
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:37,724
I spend more and more days

767
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:43,230
Thinking of all the things
I want to do with you

768
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:49,277
This must be love

769
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:54,533
You'd get sick of me
If we spent all of our days together

770
00:49:54,616 --> 00:50:00,455
Even when I turn around
You're all I can see

771
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,918
This must be love

772
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,672
Thank you, goodbye!

773
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,458
Watch where you're going.

774
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,667
Thanks.

775
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,797
I'll wash this and give it back to you.

776
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,550
Do you usually cry so easily?

777
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,761
You bawled yesterday too.

778
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,471
But you said you didn't hear--

779
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,598
It seemed like
you didn't want me to know, so…

780
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,480
Thank you for today. For everything.

781
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,483
For pretending you didn't notice
that I cried yesterday

782
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:14,988
and for coming to the concert with me,
which I would have gone to all by myself.

783
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,740
Not only that.

784
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,243
I almost looked like
a really pitiful person

785
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,537
because you cried like that
during the concert.

786
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,998
What are you talking about?

787
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,667
The women next to me were
talking about it pretty loudly.

788
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,295
That I was just your friend's replacement.

789
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,341
I'm sorry.

790
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,470
No need to be sorry.

791
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,890
I mean, it's not like
I'm your real boyfriend.

792
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,812
Did you really have a crush on him
for seven years?

793
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,190
Was it really that noticeable?

794
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,568
Isn't it obvious when you add up
your friend's message and your crying?

795
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,405
Anyway, I think you got
your closure today.

796
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,617
Yeah.

797
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,079
I'm going to accept that I got rejected
and end it, clean and simple.

798
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:11,002
That friend of mine got back together
with his ex-girlfriend.

799
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,090
I don't regret it, though.

800
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,968
I was really happy

801
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,929
for those seven years.

802
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:29,396
Someone like you who can't tolerate
wasting time can't understand that, right?

803
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,442
Well, it's not always that way.

804
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,236
What?

805
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,657
There are some things that get results
with a short amount of time,

806
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,035
and other things where you risk the
losses and stay in it for the long run.

807
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,706
It's difficult to decide how good or bad
something is just by how long it takes.

808
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,503
Why are you laughing?
There's nothing funny about that.

809
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,297
No, it's…

810
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,050
It's funny that you're comparing things
to your job even in a situation like this.

811
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,762
My apologies. I've never tried
to comfort anyone before.

812
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,225
That was comforting enough.

813
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,480
And I'm sorry about this afternoon.

814
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:19,362
I was feeling a little down so I overdid
things a bit so it wouldn't be so obvious.

815
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,741
I think that's why I said
some things I shouldn't have said.

816
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,620
No, I think I was being
a bit sensitive as well.

817
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,082
But where are we going right now?

818
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,377
I was just following you.

819
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,172
But I was following you.

820
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,054
THE BEST COMBINATION
TTEOKBOKKI, FRIED VEGGIES, SUNDAE

821
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:50,852
Can I have two tteokbokki, one sundae,
and a small fried veggie medley?

822
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,395
Do you want hard-boiled eggs?

823
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,022
No, I'm good.

824
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,025
Why? I can afford to buy us a snack.
Eat all you want.

825
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,611
No way!

826
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,366
You're not going to say a line
from a TV show where the rich guy says,

827
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,242
"I've never tried tteokbokki."

828
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,744
What do you take me for?

829
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,664
"Deliciously Spicy Tteokbokki"
is one of our products.

830
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,665
I came up with that.

831
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,542
I've been
to all the famous tteokbokki places

832
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,628
all around the country for that project.

833
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,299
-Here you go.
-That looks delicious.

834
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,342
Thank you.

835
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,057
Excuse me.

836
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,773
Hey. I'm still outside.

837
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,650
Dinner?

838
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,111
I think I'm going to eat out.

839
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,946
Watch out!

840
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,241
Ms. Shin! Watch out!

841
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,419
Are you all right, Ms. Shin?

842
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,170
Ow, that hurts.

843
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,469
Put this on it.

844
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,432
Thank you.

845
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,106
Aren't you cold? Let me know if you are.

846
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,818
Mr. Kang.

847
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,780
Could I maybe make a small suggestion?

848
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,907
Sure. What is it?

849
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,453
Instead of a fake relationship like this,

850
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,621
why don't you try a real one?

851
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:38,126
You might think it's a waste of time
to be in a relationship right now,

852
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,088
but if you think long-term,
it might be more efficient.

853
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,549
You know, you could even get married.

854
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,552
-Married?
-Yes.

855
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:52,182
Being in a fake relationship with me
means there isn't really a future.

856
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,601
So maybe this is
an even bigger waste of time.

857
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,147
I think the taxi is here.

858
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,733
Well, then. I'm off.

859
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,821
Thank you again for today.

860
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,406
Get home safely.

861
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,204
I'll give you this in return.

862
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,207
I got it as a gift at the concert.

863
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,667
I don't know what it is,

864
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,504
but apparently, it'll cheer you up
when you're feeling down.

865
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,255
Bye!

866
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,311
Wow.

867
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,402
ARCHAEOPTERYX

868
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:50,406
Today was very inefficient,
but it was fun. Archaeopteryx.

869
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,793
TALK TO ME WHEN YOU'RE FEELING DOWN.
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

870
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,296
Talk to me when you're feeling down.
I'll be there for you.

871
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,593
Be in a real relationship

872
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,429
instead of a fake one?

873
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,525
What do you guys think?

874
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,533
What am I doing?

875
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,956
-What is it?
-What? What's going on?

876
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,416
What happened?

877
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,419
I don't know. Maybe she threw a fit
while sleeping or something?

878
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,178
What am I going to do?

879
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,307
What's wrong with your face?
You scared me.

880
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,226
You think it looks bad too, right?

881
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,730
My goodness. I knew
the bruise would only get bigger.

882
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,399
Who plays catch on the streets at night?

883
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,694
You should've found out who they were
so I could teach them a lesson.

884
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,155
It's not like they did it on purpose.
It's okay.

885
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,074
-Look at this.
-Hey, Ha-ri, you look just like that.

886
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,080
Do you want to die?

887
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,916
Okay, let's rub it a little bit, okay?

888
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,710
No, it's too late.
Just make me a fried egg with that.

889
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,004
-Okay.
-Just fry the egg.

890
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,964
Can you go to work looking like that?

891
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,009
I have to go.
It's not like I'm dying from this.

892
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,305
What are you doing? Give it to me.

893
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,099
-Get some gloves and finish cleaning.
-Get lost.

894
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,647
Wait, no way.

895
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,442
There's no way Mr. Kang would recognize me
by my bruise, right?

896
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,039
I almost didn't make it in time.

897
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,672
Will this be enough to cover the bruise?

898
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,604
-I realized
-It's President Kang!

899
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,356
that I don't know anything
about Shin Geum-hui.

900
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,817
She's that employee, right? Shin Ha-ri!

901
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,819
He looks a bit coldhearted…

902
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,279
Use this.

903
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,864
…but he has a considerate side too.

904
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,658
You and this supposedly fake relationship…

905
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,535
Have you fallen for him?

906
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:29,542
