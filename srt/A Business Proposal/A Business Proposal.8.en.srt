EPISODE 8

2
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,105
Can I consider this

3
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,443
as a positive response to
me asking you out?

4
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,446
No!

5
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,074
No, that's not it, sir.

6
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,366
-What?
-What?

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,451
This is…

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,037
a mistake. It was a mistake.

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,205
What?

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,165
A mistake?

11
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,249
No, I mean…

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,005
I think I went crazy for a bit there.
Why did I…

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,925
Can we pretend that never happened?

14
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,842
Let's…

15
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,385
See you tomorrow.

16
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,770
Ha-ri, what did you just do?

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,687
Wait!

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,068
You're just leaving like this?

19
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,403
-I--
-Ha-ri.

20
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,907
We've all been looking for you.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,242
Oh, really?

22
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,619
Let's go, then.

23
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,839
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

24
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,199
She kisses me first, then what? A mistake?

25
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,493
She's a pro, isn't she?

26
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,381
I wish I had leave days left to use.

27
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,970
How am I supposed to see him again?

28
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,412
Hello.

29
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,205
What's this?

30
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,625
-Gosh.
-What are you all looking at?

31
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,420
There's our best worker.

32
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,504
What?

33
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,429
YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE CUTTING BOARD!

34
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,224
SUDDENLY IT'S LIKE THE MOVIE PSYCHO?

35
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,308
THANKFULLY, IT WASN'T SERIOUS

36
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,269
No, this isn't blood. I accidentally
pressed on the sauce bottle.

37
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,437
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,315
Our company never puts artificial
coloring in our sauces.

39
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,026
So it doesn't stain and comes right out.

40
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,277
You can't even tell.

41
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,820
I think it's good.

42
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,115
What is this? This is so embarrassing.

43
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,910
Why? They love you
in the comments, too. Look.

44
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,495
She's worth a hundred employees.

45
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,289
If her boss is really watching,
he should give her a bonus.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,502
Ms. Shin. If you actually get a bonus,
don't just keep it for yourself, okay?

47
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,091
Mr. Gye, could you please stop eating

48
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,384
and get back to work?

49
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,302
You're chewing so loudly!

50
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,390
Don't be like that. I was just hungry.

51
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,476
Right. As I told you yesterday,

52
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,646
each of you should come up
with five product ideas

53
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,606
for the dumplings that will be exported.

54
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,277
And don't just come up with a list
for the sake of it, understand?

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay, then!

56
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,466
The person you have called can not come…

57
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,634
Really now?

58
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,429
She's going to dodge my calls?

59
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,522
Sir, it's ready.

60
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,988
I'll take the picture now.

61
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:22,947
Wait.

62
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,207
Okay, I'll take the picture now.

63
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,086
DONATION FOR THE TREATMENT
OF RARE CANCERS

64
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,425
I should thank you
for letting me be a part of this.

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,509
Is that so?

66
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,179
I'll see you another time, then.

67
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,058
President Kang.

68
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,771
Director Jin Chae-rim
from Marine Art Museum.

69
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,399
Look at you.

70
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,614
It's been a while, Director Jin.

71
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,200
I last saw you when you opened
your museum three years ago.

72
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,828
Maybe it's because
of your time in New York,

73
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,789
but you've become even more handsome.

74
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,250
Is that so?

75
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,502
Figures.

76
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,423
You're perfect inside and out.

77
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,759
Of course, you want someone
better than Young-seo.

78
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,929
It's all right.

79
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,639
Young-seo may be my niece,

80
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,601
but objectively speaking,
you're too good for Young-seo.

81
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,853
Sir.

82
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,317
I'm sorry, but I have somewhere to be.

83
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,444
Sure. I'll see you next time.

84
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,618
DONATION FOR THE TREATMENT
OF RARE CANCERS

85
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,537
What a shame.

86
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,331
He's always so handsome.

87
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,591
Yes, my daughter?

88
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,930
I want to quit my job.
Can you get me a position at the museum?

89
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,477
If you quit, then Young-seo
will snatch up your position right away.

90
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,235
I don't want that, but…

91
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,032
You'll ask Grandpa
to make me the managing director?

92
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,748
I'm still out for a meeting,
but how about dinner tonight?

93
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,503
Sure. I'll see you at home later.

94
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,381
Yes.

95
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,142
You're done for the day.
Would you like to go home?

96
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,519
No, I have plans, so I'll get going.

97
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,770
Where are you going?

98
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,689
-I can--
-Let me have my privacy.

99
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,275
I'll drive myself there. You can go home.

100
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,028
-What?
-It's time for you to clock out.

101
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm doing something nice for you.
Enjoy your evening.

102
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,451
Enjoy your dinner.

103
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,042
You're all grown up now, Sung-hoon.

104
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,680
Don't we need to talk?

105
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,767
Talk?

106
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,564
The thing that happened yesterday?
Weren't we already done talking about it?

107
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,649
Done?

108
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,775
Says who?

109
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,195
I told you to just pretend
that it never happened.

110
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,364
So you're just going to say

111
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,325
that it was a simple mistake
after kissing me first?

112
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,660
You've been dodging my calls too!

113
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,953
I mean, the kiss…

114
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,582
That was because

115
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,503
we were standing so close together.

116
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,590
And we just bumped into each other,
like a fender-bender.

117
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,925
A fender-bender?

118
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,554
Are my lips some kind of a column
for you to crash into?

119
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,015
Well, that's not what I was trying to say.

120
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,102
So, what happened yesterday was a mistake

121
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,895
you made simply out of lust.

122
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,523
And you have no feelings for me?

123
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,316
What do you mean, lust?

124
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,861
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

125
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,030
A mistake or not,

126
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,907
you're the one who started it.

127
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,784
So you should make up for it, right?

128
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,122
Right, that…

129
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,457
I'll do what I can

130
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,670
to take responsibility and pay you back.

131
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,798
Very well.

132
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,344
Buy me dinner to pay me back
for kissing me.

133
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,972
What?

134
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,933
How can you ask a commoner
to buy you something this expensive?

135
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,144
You said that you would make up for it.

136
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,187
To be honest, that kiss…

137
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,527
I didn't do that by myself.
You kissed me back.

138
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,321
Like a total player.

139
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,741
All skilled and whatnot…

140
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,535
So you're not the only one at fault?

141
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
Correct.

142
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,707
Then let me take care of you
for the rest of your life,

143
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,833
as a man to a woman.

144
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,088
That's not what we're talking about.

145
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,300
I told you that I have feelings for you.

146
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,053
How could I stay still
when the woman I liked

147
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,847
started kissing me so aggressively?

148
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,682
I mean…

149
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,018
That's…

150
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,896
Then pay me back in another way.

151
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,856
What other way?

152
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,942
I prefer to pay people back with
exactly what I received from them.

153
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,444
An eye for an eye

154
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,612
and a kiss for a kiss.

155
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,865
Fine. I'll pay for the food.

156
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,994
But you can eat by yourself.
I'll just skip this meal.

157
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,998
Here is your amuse-bouche.

158
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,060
Chef Lee, could you smile more naturally?

159
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,062
Sure.

160
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
He must be nervous.

161
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,441
-Should we take a quick break, then?
-Sure.

162
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,820
What are you doing?

163
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,196
You didn't even ask me.

164
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,697
Other people would love it.

165
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,282
Why are you complaining?

166
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,620
Why are you like this to me lately?

167
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,538
What do you mean?

168
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,581
You've been like that ever since Sokcho

169
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,582
as if you're angry.

170
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,962
I'm just stressed out because of work.

171
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,549
Chef Lee.

172
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,052
You looked great on video
and you look great in these pictures, too.

173
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,887
You watched those?

174
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,264
-Thank you.
-Sure.

175
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,933
By the way, when that researcher
from go food

176
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,519
talked about food coloring
after spilling that sauce,

177
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,812
that was scripted, right?

178
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,441
-That was probably--
-No. That was totally unscripted.

179
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,819
Ha-ri isn't quick enough
to act out something like that.

180
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,362
She's really innocent, you know.

181
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,491
…on your table.

182
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,244
Have a delicious day with go food!

183
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,998
THEY LOOK GOOD TOGETHER
THEY HAVE TO BE DATING

184
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,791
IF THEY AREN'T, THEY SHOULD!

185
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,590
What is it?
Is the food not to your liking?

186
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,259
No, that's not it.

187
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,973
I just can't enjoy the food when I think
about my credit card bill next month.

188
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,232
Chef, what's all this?

189
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,401
We'd like you
to taste-test our newest menu.

190
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,487
You're asking your customers
to do your work?

191
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,781
Your palate is much more refined
than mine, sir.

192
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,452
You're a regular at our restaurant.
Please do this for me.

193
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,786
I understand.

194
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,205
Thank you, President Kang.

195
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,588
I need to go to the bathroom.

197
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,304
Ha-ri!

198
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,847
Have you always been like this?

199
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,559
What are you doing? Snap out of it,
please! Why…

200
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,769
Why…

201
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,605
Until that day when the waters

202
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,693
Of the East Sea run dry
And Mount Baekdusan is worn away

203
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,222
You play the piano too?

204
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,807
Have you forgotten already?

205
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,809
I told you, I'm good at everything.

206
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,897
Do you play the piano for every woman
that you meet?

207
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,817
I don't have to answer that
since we're not in a relationship.

208
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
If you want to hear the answer,
go out with me.

209
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,198
I'll grab the check.

210
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,033
Could you bring us the check, please?

211
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,868
Our coats and wallets too.

212
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,455
Here you are.

213
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,916
Would it be possible
to pay in six installments?

214
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,000
He already paid.

215
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,085
He did?

216
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,964
Have a good night.

217
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,048
Wait.

218
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:09,969
Why did you do that?

219
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,553
I needed to pay.

220
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,014
I thought about it,

221
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,934
and I didn't want you
to pay back for the kiss with this.

222
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,562
I want something bigger,
so brace yourself.

223
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,773
But…

224
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,276
What more expensive meal do you want then?

225
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,277
Or…

226
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,115
pay me back with something else.

227
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,659
Forget it.

228
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,370
You already paid,
so it can't be helped, but…

229
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,167
Fine. I'll buy you
a more expensive meal next time.

230
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,752
I'll be looking forward to it.

231
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,754
What should we eat next time?

232
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
Steak?

233
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,924
Omakase?

234
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,052
Careful.

235
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,054
No peeking.

236
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay.

237
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,807
Turn left here.

238
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,352
Ta-da!

239
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,817
Did you do this all by yourself?

240
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,821
There may be some things I don't do,
but there's nothing I can't do.

241
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,490
I looked up some recipes online.
It was easy.

242
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,076
But you must have been tired
after work. How did you…

243
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,244
It's okay.

244
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,080
Come on. Have a seat and try the food.

245
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,465
Let's dig in, then.

246
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,195
How is it?

247
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,323
It's delicious.

248
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,242
Come on. You don't sound like
you mean that.

249
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,786
Come on, be honest.

250
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,750
It's good.

251
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,423
Things can only improve
if a customer gives good feedback.

252
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,301
Honestly, how is it?

253
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,894
If I'm being honest,
all the food is a bit salty.

254
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,065
Other than that, it's okay?

255
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,819
Well, as for these clams,
I'm tasting some sand.

256
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,738
As for the pork belly,
it smells a bit fishy.

257
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,865
It probably wasn't defrosted properly.

258
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,742
The vegetables are overcooked.

259
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,702
And the rice is a bit undercooked.

260
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,913
As for the rest, I need to try…

261
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,708
I think they'll be delicious.

262
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,585
What's there left to taste?

263
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,379
The water?

264
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,381
The water must taste delicious.

265
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,799
I'm sorry. I…

266
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,554
I'm used to giving honest feedback,
due to the nature of my job.

267
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,307
I'm going to the bathroom.

268
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,441
He really wasn't holding back, was he?

269
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,862
Is he my boyfriend
or a Michelin guide judge?

270
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,784
CLAMS, PORK BELLY, VEGETABLES, RICE

271
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,743
What?

272
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,662
You're dating Secretary Cha?

273
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,748
When did you two start dating?

274
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,960
More importantly,
you are persistent after all, Young-seo.

275
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,963
Congratulations
on putting an end to your crush.

276
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,341
I don't know if I should be congratulated.

277
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,387
Why? You finally got your boyfriend.
What else is there to congratulate?

278
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,806
-He didn't like it.
-What?

279
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,726
I cooked someone dinner
for the first time in my life.

280
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,019
Right, yes.

281
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,687
But he said it was salty.

282
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,941
If your girlfriend cooks for you,
shouldn't you clear all the plates

283
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,610
even if it tastes like saltwater?

284
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,029
No, you might die then.

285
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,531
That President Kang is annoying too.

286
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,283
What about President Kang?

287
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,994
I was watching a movie
with Sung-hoon yesterday.

288
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,039
We were having a good time
until President Kang called him.

289
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,499
He was out for over 30 minutes
taking that call.

290
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,960
Even a president shouldn't do that!

291
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,254
It's not like he did that on purpose.

292
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,714
He didn't know you two were on a date.

293
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,840
What is this?

294
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,092
This is suspicious.

295
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,094
Are you two a thing now?

296
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,763
It's not like that.

297
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,849
No. You're really suspicious right now.

298
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,476
You ate at work, right?

299
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,478
You ate with Kang Tae-moo, didn't you?

300
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,396
You were on a date with him. Right?

301
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,815
No. It wasn't a date. We just ate…

302
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,486
See? I was right.

303
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,655
If you ate together, that's a date.

304
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,407
No, it wasn't like that. I…

305
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,246
There was a little situation,
so I ate with him to apologize.

306
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,123
Why? Is he nagging at you again
because of work?

307
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,041
What?

308
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,752
Kang Tae-moo is being so mean.

309
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,213
If he likes you,
he should be nicer to you.

310
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,215
Is he a pervert?

311
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,841
What?

312
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,386
I think he is a pervert. Watch out.

313
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,304
No…

314
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,098
What?

315
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,891
What?

316
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,184
They broke up already?

317
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,354
You were so excited thinking
about Tae-moo getting married this year.

318
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,064
Whatever.

319
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,899
Are you sure they didn't break up

320
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,486
because you were acting
like a nosy grandfather?

321
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,447
Do you think I'm some old-fashioned,
condescending person?

322
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,993
I treated Ms. Shin Geum-hui really well.

323
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,954
It's obvious.
You know his personality, right?

324
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,331
Hey, if you want Tae-moo to get married,

325
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,750
just don't do anything.

326
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,876
-Yes.
-Okay?

327
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,128
What?

328
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,047
You bastards, you don't know anything.

329
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,257
-See, my--
-Oh my.

330
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,216
Chairman Kang!

331
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,176
Have you been well?

332
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,140
Hello.

333
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,100
Director Jin.

334
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,728
How have you been?

335
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,408
Chicken yesterday.

336
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,118
Chicken today.

337
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,161
Chicken tomorrow!

338
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,872
It's all chicken!

339
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,457
Honey!

340
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,793
I'm coming!

341
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,300
-Can you put it up here?
-Sure.

342
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,387
Why did you come down already?
I thought you worked all night yesterday.

343
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,183
You said we have a big group
coming in today. I should help.

344
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,770
It's fine. We can do it.

345
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,774
What's wrong, Dad? Is it your stomach?

346
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,693
I knew this would happen

347
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,738
when I saw you stuffing your face
with beef tartare yesterday.

348
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,865
Do you need to go to the hospital?

349
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,534
It's fine.

350
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:54,372
I'll be okay once I go to the bathroom
a couple of times.

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,374
Go to the bathroom then.

352
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,382
He shouldn't have eaten so much.

353
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,010
He overate just because
he was in a good mood.

354
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,472
HIKING ROUTE

355
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,433
We're at the wrong place, right?

356
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,894
We're at the right place.

357
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,362
I thought you wanted to
take a walk somewhere nice,

358
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,655
but this is a mountain.

359
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,991
I thought you really needed exercise,
so here we are.

360
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,661
Come on, I'm tired already.

361
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,829
You're always tired

362
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,957
because you're always sitting at your desk
or lying on the couch.

363
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,083
Exercise with me now.

364
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,960
How about later?

365
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,336
I'm wearing the wrong shoes.

366
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,130
I prepared for that, too.

367
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,798
What?

368
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,967
Prepare what?

369
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,765
It's a perfect fit.

370
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,517
Let's go.

371
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,856
The weather's so nice.

372
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,987
He may be my boyfriend,
but he's a piece of work.

373
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,198
Why did he call me out of the blue
on a weekend?

374
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,825
How annoying.

375
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,336
Ms. Shin.

376
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,303
Why did you ask to see me here?

377
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,930
What do you think?
I wanted to get payback for that kiss.

378
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,893
I don't think there's a good place
to eat around here.

379
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,144
Forget about eating.

380
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,563
Spend the day with me today as payment.

381
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,231
What?

382
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,735
You said I shouldn't make
a commoner pay for an expensive meal.

383
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,030
So I'll buy your time instead.

384
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,364
My…

385
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,534
Time?

386
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,494
Wait.

387
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,204
Let's take a break.

388
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,792
My legs hurt.

389
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,881
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

390
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,889
You were right. I'm really out of shape.

391
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,975
How are you not tired?

392
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,102
Come here with me whenever you have time.

393
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,646
I climb this mountain often
because it's my favorite.

394
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,606
Often?

395
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,614
Who did you climb
this mountain with so often?

396
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,283
An ex-girlfriend?

397
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,867
No, with President Kang.

398
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,955
You go hiking with your boss?

399
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,792
You're not being forced into it
or anything, right?

400
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,751
What?

401
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,046
When you think about it, President Kang
only thinks about himself.

402
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,216
I can tell by the way he treats you,
and Ha-ri, too.

403
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,509
What do you mean?

404
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,596
He told Ha-ri to pay him back
for something again.

405
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,640
Ha-ri's face looked so tired.

406
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,685
What a petty guy.

407
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,812
That's not the type of person he is.

408
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,440
You shouldn't bad-mouth others
like that, Young-seo.

409
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,401
What do you mean?

410
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,945
It's true that Mr. Kang
was being mean to Ha-ri.

411
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,905
-What I'm saying is--
-I mean,

412
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,992
when he found out Ha-ri was Geum-hui,
he should have been a man

413
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,287
and asked her, "Explain what happened."
Like a normal person.

414
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,913
But he didn't ask her anything.

415
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,042
He just made her really anxious
and was a jerk to her at work.

416
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,710
Wasn't that a power trip?

417
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,378
Power trip?

418
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,840
He had the right to be angry
since he had been fooled.

419
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,927
Besides, you shouldn't be talking
like that. You're at fault too.

420
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,138
What?

421
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,725
If you hadn't sent Ms. Shin in your place,
something like this wouldn't have--

422
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,770
This is just ridiculous.

423
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,229
What do you mean?

424
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,024
If you're my boyfriend,

425
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:34,194
then you should be thankful
that I didn't go on that blind date.

426
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,738
Do you think it makes sense
for you to be scolding me

427
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,365
for not going on a blind date?

428
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,658
Young-seo, just calm down.

429
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,035
Let's be more logical--

430
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,286
How can I?

431
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,622
What's a boyfriend for?

432
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,584
Isn't a boyfriend supposed to be
on your side no matter what?

433
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,836
I cooked for you,
but you said it was too salty.

434
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,506
You couldn't focus on the movie
because of work.

435
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,840
And even now, look!

436
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,218
You're taking
Kang Tae-moo's side and not mine.

437
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,012
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,639
I didn't mean it like that.

439
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,558
Don't be mad. Let's just
climb all the way up.

440
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,769
Climb all the way up?

441
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,479
No!

442
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:14,359
Why don't you climb this damn mountain
with Kang Tae-moo?

443
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,278
Come on, Young-seo!

444
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,196
Young-seo!

445
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,084
Here.

446
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,170
I'm hungry. Do you want to go eat?

447
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,088
I'll buy.

448
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,923
It's fine.

449
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,884
Spend just your time on me.
I'll spend the money.

450
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,308
No, I can't do that. I'm here
to pay you back. What do you want to eat?

451
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,440
Well, there is something
that I want to eat.

452
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,363
Will this really be enough?

453
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,657
What?

454
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,119
Seeing as you wanted to come

455
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,705
all the way to this deserted place
to get this,

456
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,291
this must be some insanely good corn dog.

457
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,959
Right?

458
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,427
It's just a normal corn dog.

459
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,014
You should have gotten
something more filling then.

460
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,643
Did someone tell you you had to get
a corn dog if you go to an amusement park?

461
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,979
You do seem like someone
who's never been here.

462
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,150
I ate this

463
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,611
with my parents when I was seven.

464
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,239
This hot dog tasted so good back then.

465
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,036
Whenever I think of it,
I come to eat it by myself sometimes.

466
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,295
You must have been really happy back then.

467
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,342
You know, when you eat food
that you had in the past,

468
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,178
you recall all of the happy memories
from back then,

469
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,430
and it tastes even better.

470
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,516
For me,

471
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,351
gimbap is like that.

472
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,603
Maybe it's because of field trips.

473
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,231
That hamburger from back then
was like that, too. Right.

474
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,485
You're different, Ms. Shin.

475
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,863
When I bring up my parents,

476
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,075
most people look like
they don't know what to say

477
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,118
and say that they're sorry.

478
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,331
So I never got to talk about this

479
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,709
despite it being
one of the fondest memories I have.

480
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,710
Even to my grandpa.

481
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,631
But, sometimes…

482
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,134
I want to talk to someone

483
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,512
about my parents.

484
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,891
Thank you

485
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,811
for letting me talk about it like this.

486
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,363
Yes, why?

487
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,824
What?

488
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,161
If he likes Kang Tae-moo so much,
why doesn't he just date him instead?

489
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,538
Why is he dating me then?

490
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,164
Unbelievable.

491
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,338
What is this place?

492
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,675
I don't think I took this path.

493
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,554
Come on.

494
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,890
Young-seo!

495
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,727
I knew we went faster
when we were climbing up.

496
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,771
How could you leave like that
when you don't know the way?

497
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,315
Where are we?

498
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,650
I don't know.

499
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,028
We should have gone left back there.

500
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,071
But you went right.

501
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,866
Are you blaming me again?

502
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,078
You sure are good at making me mad.
You really have a talent for it!

503
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,707
Stop following me if you're just
going to keep making me mad.

504
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,085
I'll be fine walking by myself.

505
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,670
Young-seo.

506
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,505
Young-seo!

507
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,633
Are you all right?

508
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,718
-Let me see. Let me see!
-Don't touch it.

509
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,346
Does it hurt a lot?

510
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,144
Get on my back.

511
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,689
You're going to climb down
with me on your back?

512
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,651
That's crazy. No way. It's too dangerous.

513
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,570
I don't say what I don't mean.
I'll make it work, so get on.

514
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,658
I'm heavy though.

515
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,333
Hold on just a bit more.

516
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,399
How's your ankle? Is it feeling better?

517
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,027
Why aren't you saying anything?

518
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,696
Are you still mad at me?

519
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,077
I'll try my best to make sure
to never upset you like that again.

520
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,537
Just forgive me this once--

521
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,039
Do you know

522
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,250
how sexy you look right now?

523
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,547
-What?
-I stopped being angry a while ago.

524
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,925
I was complaining the entire time,

525
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,887
but you didn't say a word
carrying me down all this way.

526
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,474
I guess you're a tough guy.

527
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
I think I just fell for you again.

528
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,399
Young-seo.

529
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,862
Okay, we need to go home quickly

530
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,115
and spend a steamy night together.

531
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,422
-Let's go to the hospital first.
-No, let's go home.

532
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,008
Let's go to the hospital first, and then…

533
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,259
And then?

534
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,177
Come on, get on.

535
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,012
Go to the hospital, and then?

536
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,766
Then let's go home, yes?

537
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,309
Let's go to the hospital first.

538
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,688
Young-seo, you lied about
being hurt, right?

539
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,609
I'm here to see patient Han Mi-mo.

540
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,027
-One moment.
-Okay.

541
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,156
Mom!

542
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,200
Ha-ri.

543
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,869
Are you okay? Are you badly hurt?
Let me see.

544
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:43,748
No, it's just a light burn.
They said I don't need to worry about it.

545
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,958
But the problem is…

546
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,841
Dad!

547
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,510
What happened?

548
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,637
Ha-min said you were the one who got hurt.

549
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,600
Apparently, it was acute appendicitis.

550
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,644
He just came out of emergency surgery.

551
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,729
Then why are you staying here?

552
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,397
They said there was no empty bed,

553
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,483
so I asked them to tell us
if one freed up.

554
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,779
-Dad.
-Honey.

555
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,239
Honey.

556
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,490
Mi-mo.

557
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,826
Is your arm okay?

558
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,078
You're worried about that right now?

559
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,330
You didn't know
that your appendix was ruptured?

560
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,333
Why did you have to act so tough
and carry me to the hospital?

561
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,668
What if you hurt your back?

562
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,839
I was worried that your pearly skin

563
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,216
would become scarred.

564
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,385
Oh, my.

565
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,345
-Mr. Shin Joong-hae.
-Yes.

566
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,139
Your room is ready. You can move now.

567
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,682
There's an open spot in a room?

568
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,725
No. We were told to
move him to a VIP room.

569
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,436
-A VIP room?
-Who said that?

570
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,982
There he comes.

571
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,486
Hello.

572
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,946
Who…

573
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:02,535
-I'm the pre--
-He's in the same team as me at work.

574
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,954
He's my supervisor. Yes.

575
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,541
A supervisor from work?

576
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,961
But Ms. Yeo is a woman.

577
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,882
-You must be Mr. Gye!
-What?

578
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,135
Right! Yes. He's Mr. Gye Bin.

579
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,013
Mr. Gye, these are my parents.
Please introduce yourself.

580
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,974
Mr. Gye.

581
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,608
Yes, hello. I'm Gye Bin.

582
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,493
It's okay.

583
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,624
Gosh, this bed is even better
than a hotel bed.

584
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,877
I wish that I could rest
somewhere like this for a couple of days.

585
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,378
Mom.

586
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,589
What? Did I say something wrong?

587
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,592
See, it's a lot bigger
than our master bedroom.

588
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,094
Mr. Gye, you shouldn't have.

589
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,263
We owe you for doing this.

590
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,725
You didn't have to do all this for us.

591
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,603
It's nothing. I happen to know
someone at this hospital.

592
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,021
Don't feel uncomfortable.

593
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,815
But I heard Mr. Gye

594
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,652
was in his mid-40s.

595
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,987
You look really young for your age!

596
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,367
Yes, I hear that often.

597
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,035
Mom, come on--

598
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,203
Why?

599
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,707
Mr. Gye, you must be really tired.
Why don't you go on home?

600
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,793
-That's a good idea.
-Right? Yes.

601
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,212
Hey! Where are your manners?

602
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,838
He still did us a huge favor.

603
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,508
Please sit. Have something to drink. Sit.

604
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,594
Come on.

605
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,179
Here, have some honey water.

606
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,847
-Oh, honey water.
-Yes.

607
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,975
You must be tired working on the weekend

608
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,685
when you should be

609
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,146
getting some rest.

610
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,231
Work?

611
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,067
Ha-ri said that she was heading out

612
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,111
to go to work today.

613
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:07,159
Mr. Gye, did you forget already?
We worked overtime today.

614
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,665
Right.

615
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,666
-Yes.
-We worked overtime.

616
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,043
-Yes, overtime.
-We're very busy at work.

617
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,421
-Yes.
-I heard that your new president

618
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,672
was handed the position.

619
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,259
You have no idea how much
Ha-ri ran her mouth off,

620
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,846
saying her workload increased so much
after the president changed.

621
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,389
-Mom!
-That bastard.

622
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,308
When did I say that?

623
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,976
The day before yesterday, you--

624
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,437
Shin Ha-ri, you…

625
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,564
I'm sorry.

626
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,236
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

627
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,405
It's fine. It's nothing.

628
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,324
It isn't nothing. You're bleeding.

629
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,118
Go put on some ointment
while I clean up here.

630
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,494
It's in Ha-ri's room.

631
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,197
An employment contract?

632
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,741
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

633
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,286
So they weren't actually…

634
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,498
in a relationship?

635
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,211
He knows about us.
There's no need to be shy.

636
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,421
Right?

637
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,803
Thank you for today.

638
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,889
And I'm sorry for what happened
at the hospital.

639
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,058
I didn't mean for that to happen.

640
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,017
Don't be sorry.

641
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,436
A mean boss deserves that much.

642
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,437
No, I--

643
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,856
Pay me back for the kiss
like you were supposed to.

644
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,066
What do you mean--

645
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,111
It's unfair. I didn't know
that you bad-mouthed me.

646
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,113
I even gave you a discount!

647
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,115
How is that fair?

648
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,783
I'm a mean boss, remember?

649
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,286
If you don't have the money,

650
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,747
pay it back with a kiss.

651
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,042
How's that?

652
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,922
Hey, Min-woo!

653
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,466
What do you think you're doing?

654
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,051
I could ask you the same thing.

655
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,011
Stop hanging around Ha-ri

656
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,389
and get lost.

657
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,348
What?

658
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,434
I should be saying that.

659
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,685
Stop it, Mr. Kang!

660
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,271
What are you doing?

661
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,110
Go home. I'll see you at work tomorrow.

662
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,751
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

663
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,297
How did you get this?

664
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,258
Were you forced into a contract
relationship because of money?

665
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,177
Did he threaten you?

666
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,763
That bastard.

667
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,933
Why didn't you tell me?

668
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,185
If you had told me--

669
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,311
Why should I

670
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,522
have told you about this?

671
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,152
-What?
-I don't think it's any of your business

672
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,948
whether I'm in a fake relationship
with him or not.

673
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,909
-Ha-ri.
-I stopped you two

674
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,328
because I was worried someone would see it

675
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,206
and it might be released in the news.

676
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,668
When you see President Kang again,
you need to give him a formal apology.

677
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,218
I know you're doing this because you're
worried about me as a friend. I know.

678
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,720
But didn't I tell you?

679
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,680
I can take care of myself.

680
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,182
Are you saying that…

681
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,101
you actually like Kang Tae-moo?

682
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,979
He's just using you--

683
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,648
Don't talk about him like that.

684
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,152
He doesn't deserve it.

685
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,782
You know perfectly well it won't work out

686
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,117
between you two.

687
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,584
It's getting late.

688
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,461
I need to get going.

689
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,392
That wasn't what I was trying to do.

690
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,144
Stop it, Mr. Kang!

691
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,605
What are you doing?

692
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,740
MR. KANG, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER

693
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:02,037
I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE MIN-WOO'S SIDE.
IT'S JUST THAT THERE WAS A POLICE CAR…

694
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,206
You know perfectly well it won't work out

695
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,625
between you two.

696
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,745
HA-RI

697
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,496
Thank you for today.

698
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,458
I'll pay you back for the hospital bill
as soon as I get paid.

699
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,587
SHIN HA-RI

700
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,561
Let's get going, quick.

701
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,729
Let's go.

702
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,773
Isn't that heavy?

703
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,775
-Hello.
-Take your shoes off.

704
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,319
That's so annoying.

705
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,487
-Hello.
-Hello.

706
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,739
-Hello.
-Hello.

707
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,115
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.

708
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,869
I'LL PAY YOU BACK THE HOSPITAL BILL
AS SOON AS I GET PAID.

709
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,749
Whatever. This is for the best.

710
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,584
FOOD PRODUCT RESEARCH TEAM FIELD DAY

711
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,252
Yes, I'm in the parking lot.

712
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,962
Sung-hoon.

713
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,719
What are you doing here?

714
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,430
I was out on business,
and there was a good bagel place.

715
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,807
Share it with your team.

716
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,350
You really didn't have to.

717
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,686
But thank you so much.

718
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,521
If you're thankful, then here.

719
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,107
-Right here?
-Yes.

720
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,154
See you later.

721
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,239
Safe driving.

722
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,323
I'll text you.

723
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,300
Sir.

724
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,225
I'm sorry for not
telling you earlier, sir.

725
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,895
What on earth happened?

726
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,356
We ran into each other once,

727
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,900
and I fell for her then.

728
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,986
Then why didn't you tell me?

729
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,782
I didn't know where to start,
since you, Ms. Jin, and Ms. Shin

730
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,660
are all tangled up
in this situation together.

731
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,955
I thought you and I were…

732
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,541
It's fine.

733
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,418
The more I talk, the pettier I sound.

734
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,507
-Thank you.
-Sure thing, sir.

735
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:10,309
The president of a company should be
more diligent than his employees.

736
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,811
Why are you so late for work?

737
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,273
What brings you here?

738
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,026
Gosh, this smells really good.

739
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,614
If you had something so good,
you should have brought me some too.

740
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,574
But you kept it to yourself?

741
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,743
Don't beat around the bush
and just say it.

742
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,827
I'm telling you this

743
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,871
as your grandfather

744
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,249
and as the founder of this company.

745
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,293
So…

746
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,588
you better not say no to me.

747
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,840
Go on a blind date…

748
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,052
today.

749
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,809
VICTORY IS IN OUR GRASP!
DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT TEAM

750
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,896
Why are you just standing there?

751
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,206
Okay!

752
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,511
Time out!

753
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,428
What happened?

754
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,722
Ms. Shin, are you okay?

755
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,432
-Yes.
-Ms. Shin, are you okay?

756
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,850
-Yes.
-What?

757
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,727
A stretcher, quick!

758
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,688
Stop overreacting.

759
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,483
Does it hurt a lot? Oh, my.

760
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,027
-Some pain relief spray will do.
-Really?

761
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,613
-Well, go back to your spots.
-Yes, ma'am.

762
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,906
Okay. Try to stand up.

763
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,491
We have an important announcement.

764
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,619
A special prize
will be given to the MVP this year.

765
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,081
The MVP researcher who gets the best score
in today's sports competition

766
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:00,002
will get the special opportunity
to have dinner

767
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,129
one-on-one with President Kang!

768
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,842
One-on-one?

769
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,638
Man, look at that.

770
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,447
Are you really

771
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,241
going to go on that blind date?

772
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,745
A blind date?

773
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,998
Seven o'clock.
The Japanese restaurant at Koryo Hotel.

774
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,458
Your date

775
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,628
is Director Jo Yu-jeong of Marine Group.

776
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,379
Director Jo Yu-jeong?

777
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,965
That's Ms. Jin Young-seo's cousin.
How could--

778
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,925
They contacted me first.

779
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,263
They said that they thought Tae-moo
would be a good match for Director Jo.

780
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,142
-What?
-I'm a bit worried

781
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,727
how Chairman Jin will react,

782
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:03,398
but his younger sister,
Jin Chae-rim, is just as powerful.

783
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,734
She'll be

784
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,237
a good asset to you.

785
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:16,953
President Kang.

786
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,038
What can I do

787
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,123
other than follow the Chairman's wishes?

788
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,585
Does that mean that you're going to
give up Ms. Shin?

789
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,718
Oh, my.

790
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,178
That must hurt a lot.

791
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:39,559
A one-on-one dinner with President Kang?

792
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,145
That's amazing.
Dinner with President Kang!

793
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,191
Right? I'm going to work extra hard today
to become the MVP.

794
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,819
Says who? I'm going to be the MVP.

795
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,278
No, it's going to be me.

796
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,823
President Kang sure is popular.

797
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,838
No!

798
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,923
No? Not here? It's not there?

799
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:10,841
What?

800
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:11,925
Here.

801
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,848
You can do it. Yes, you can do it.

802
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,683
Hui-gyu.

803
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,977
-Yes?
-You have to do well

804
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,229
in Ms. Shin's place, okay?

805
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,399
Well, I'm not that confident, but--

806
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,443
Come on!

807
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,112
We have to get the MVP title!

808
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,448
Look at your eyes. Where are you looking?

809
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,866
Look a bit fiercer.

810
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,618
Yes, that's right.
A meeting with President Kang.

811
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,163
That'll lead to a promotion for sure.

812
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,205
Yes, sir.

813
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,206
Right.

814
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,541
Wait!

815
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,195
Move.

816
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,780
I'm going to do it.

817
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,408
-Yes, you go and look fierce, okay?
-Yes, sir.

818
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,701
Wait a second.

819
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,161
Will you be okay, Ms. Shin?

820
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,998
It's fine. It's do or die, right?

821
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,501
I like that spirit. Let's go!

822
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,377
Yes, let's do it!

823
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,295
Yes!

824
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,671
Let's go cheer Ha-ri on!

825
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,089
Let's go!

826
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,800
Okay, good luck.

827
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,343
One, two, three.

828
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,552
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

829
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:57,489
OPPOSING TEAM, HA-RI'S TEAM

830
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,585
Right! Dodge to the right.
To the right! Yes!

831
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:11,753
Hey! Dodge!

832
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,549
Ms. Shin, look at my sign. My sign!

833
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,676
You need to look at my sign, Ms. Shin.

834
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,178
Spin, spin!

835
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,888
Right, that's it! Good job!

836
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,683
Catch! Get the ball!

837
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,687
Ms. Shin is really going for it.

838
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,641
Team White wins!

839
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,486
Today's MVP is researcher Shin Ha-ri
from Food Product Development Team 1!

840
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:19,988
Congratulations.

841
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,414
FOOD PRODUCT RESEARCH TEAM FIELD DAY

842
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,500
To our MVP, Ms. Shin!

843
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,336
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

844
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,379
-Good job.
-Congratulations

845
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,381
Great work.

846
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,181
That was impressive.
How did you become the MVP with that arm?

847
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,896
You're really lucky this year.
The Mega Hit Award and the MVP?

848
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,105
Treat us to a meal.

849
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,524
Of course! I'll treat you all really well!

850
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,319
By the way, where's President Kang?

851
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,403
I haven't seen him.

852
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,571
Didn't you hear?

853
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,198
-He can't make it today.
-What?

854
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,034
-Why?
-He's going on a blind date

855
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,994
at Koryo Hotel today, at seven.

856
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,705
A blind date?

857
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,124
What about the woman in the picture?

858
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,461
Do you think he's the same as us?
They don't marry the people they date.

859
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,130
Are they living
in the Joseon dynasty or something?

860
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,299
I'm disappointed in President Kang.

861
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:46,950
Mr. Kang Tae-moo?

862
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,828
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-I reek of alcohol

863
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,455
Get home safe!

864
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,623
I'll see you tomorrow.

865
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,587
The bus is here!
Ms. Shin, I'm going to head home then!

866
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,131
-Okay. Get home safe!
-Bye!

867
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,678
Hello.

868
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,061
ME AND YOU?
A BOOK FOR THOSE HIDING YOUR FEELINGS

869
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,778
And I won't give up.

870
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,656
If you reject me,
I'll ask you out again and again.

871
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,200
Until you finally like me back.

872
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,871
What happened to that?

873
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,165
No.

874
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,668
I think I went crazy for a bit there.
Why did I…

875
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,420
Can we pretend that never happened?

876
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,337
Let's…

877
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,173
See you tomorrow.

878
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,343
I mean,

879
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,804
I have no right.

880
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,602
I have feelings for you.

881
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,938
Thank you,
for letting me talk about it like this.

882
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,908
Taxi!

883
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,992
Here.

884
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,837
Sir, I'm sorry, but could you
drive a bit faster?

885
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,297
I'm sorry.

886
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,721
SHIN HA-RI

887
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,434
Hello?

888
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,061
Get out of there, now.

889
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,147
Do you even know where I am
to tell me that?

890
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,775
What do you mean, where?
You're at Koryo Hotel.

891
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,692
What?

892
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,736
How could you do something like that?

893
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,322
You made me fall for you

894
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,116
and now you're going on a blind date?

895
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:56,496
You know, I was waiting
for your text all day,

896
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,414
wondering when you would come by.

897
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,876
I was going crazy thinking about you
eating dinner with another woman.

898
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,419
How can you do that?

899
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,046
I don't know anymore.

900
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,174
From now on, I'm not going to care
about what other people think

901
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,343
and just think about the two of us.

902
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,220
So…

903
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,056
don't go on that blind date, Mr. Kang.

904
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,936
Why aren't you saying anything?

905
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,522
You don't even want
to talk to me now, is that it?

906
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,565
No.

907
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,025
I just like that…

908
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,570
you're acting jealous.

909
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,657
Why would I go on a blind date
with another woman?

910
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,660
Did you think that lowly of me?

911
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,997
But I heard that you're going
on a blind date today--

912
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,707
I'm in front of your house.

913
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,793
I was going to ask you out again today.

914
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,588
Good thing I came.

915
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,818
The traffic…

916
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,578
Excuse me, I'll get off here.

917
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,474
Ms. Shin.

918
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,354
If you come any closer,
I'm never going to let you go again.

919
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,658
You won't say
this is a mistake too, right?

920
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,954
I'll pay you back for that kiss

921
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,039
with another kiss.

922
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:20,366
