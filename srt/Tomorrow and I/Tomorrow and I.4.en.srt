THIS SERIES IS SET IN A FICTITIOUS FUTURE

00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,416

00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,916
[female newsreader] Happy New Year.
It's a time for new beginnings,

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,833
but there is no end in sight

11
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:20,333
for the continuous rain
that has lasted over two years.

12
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,375
This situation is mirrored
across the entire globe.

13
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,375
[male newsreader] It's been raining
nonstop now for 784 days,

14
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,250
12 hours, 54 minutes, and 22 seconds.

18
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,000
Twenty-five.

19
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,333
This phenomenon
has been dubbed the rain-pocalypse.

20
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,916
[news theme plays]

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,958
[woman] The scientific community
have not been able to find

22
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,375
a plausible explanation
for this phenomenon.

23
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,208
- [man] Rising sea levels.
- [woman] Wildfires.

24
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,666
- [man] Garbage crisis.
- [woman] Melting glaciers. Air pollution.

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,791
- [man] Unprecedented weather.
- [woman] Methane and carbon dioxide.

26
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,000
Following major floods beginning in 2029,

27
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,791
cities were raised higher above sea level

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,500
and drainage tunnels
were built across the country.

31
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,958
[male newsreader] Over two decades
have passed

32
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,041
since citizens were forced
to evacuate to the elevated city.

33
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,500
The lower city has been left
as a drainage zone.

34
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,958
This has allowed for successful management
of the excess water.

35
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,083
You call this successful?

36
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,250
[music stops]

37
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,958
[male newsreader] Some think the world
will flood, and that we'll all drown,

38
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,458
but how has that turned out?

39
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,333
It's just a bit of drain water.

40
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:41,083
Bangkok, the city
that lives underwater, huh?

41
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,000
Humans have always adapted
to their environment.

42
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,625
Why are you sitting out in the rain?
How often do you change your underwear?

43
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,250

We have it way too easy here.

48
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,125
I'm actually very thankful for the rain.

49
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:09,708
I mean, think about…
everything the rain gives us.

50
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,333
Um…

51
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,333
I just wish people could open their minds.

52
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,041
Happiness is about changing your mindset.

53
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,375
You make it sound easy.

54
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,583
It is easy.

55
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,000
Easy, my ass!

56
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,541
You wouldn't last a day down here.
You dumb ass.

57
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,833
Shut up, douchebag!

has been increasing

"For the temperature
to rise by one degree,

64
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,916
it used to take as long as 13 years."
[sniffles]

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,583
"In the last five years,
this has greatly increased."

"Since the year 2045,

Come and empty this bucket.
It's full already.

- You do it.
- You do it.

81

And, Paween, you come here and help.

"The sudden and unexpected
temperature change

who question if humans can adapt."

"And they predict that we will face
a major catastrophe in the future."

that the world is getting warmer?

What are they talking about?
It's always raining.

It might not feel hot, but this rain…

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,958
it's caused by global warming.

93
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,583
I know. It was just a joke.

94
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,250
Why did the hand go to school?

95
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,416

Hello, Mrs. Toi.

179
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,125
Is my mother back?

[Mook] Crypto, why weren't you
at school today?

183
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:04,291
Oh, yeah, I didn't go today.
Actually, I haven't gone for a few days.

184
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,666
[Mook] Oh, have you been sick?

185
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,208
A lot of kids
have been getting sick lately.

186
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,583
No, my uniform was wet,

187
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,375
and the teacher said, "Go home
and come back when they're dry."

I'm afraid I have bad news

A new variant of the dengue virus

The virus has claimed more than 50 lives.

Children under 10 are at the highest risk

Symptoms include skin inflammation,
throat infection, and irritation.

214
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,625
Ah! what was that?

215

Hey! Hey, Mook, get out of here. Oh!

Why'd you have to ruin my luck?

226
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,833
Ah! You jinxed it. Seriously, go away!

227
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,791
- All right, pick one.
- Hey, meow.

Hey, Neon, thank you
for saving me just in time.

Stay out of that alley.

246
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:02,208
It's not a good place for kids, okay?
Go home. It's getting dark.

247
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,916
Yes, sir!

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,958
We're gonna clean up the streets.
And if we can't beat 'em, we'll join 'em.

Oh, where? Show me.

- On the seam.
- I can patch it up.

261
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,291
Although I think I'm out of pink thread.

262
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,791
I don't mind, any color is okay.

Hmm. All right.

You've lost a lot of weight, Pakarang.

269
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,666
Mom, that's Kalapangha, not me.

270
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,875
Can't you tell your daughter
from your granddaughter?

271
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,666
It's not my fault.
Someone must have adjusted my glasses.

272
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,541
What the hell! Do you know how difficult
it is to get them right?

273

Yeah! Show her
what you've been doing, son.

00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,166
All of Bangkok's garbage collectors
have been replaced with robots.

350
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,041
Those robots work all day and all night.

351
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,875
They can even go underwater.

352
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,541
Maybe you should take diving lessons.

353
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,583
- I-- I-- I'm just kidding.
- It's not very funny.

354
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,916
I've heard that in the flooded districts,

355
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,291
boat taxis are in very high demand.

356
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,791
Listen, I'll start working two shifts,
all right? We'll be okay.

357
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,583
- [Pakarang] But you'll be exhausted.
- [Pang's dad] We need the money.

358
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,250
Who knows how long it'll be
before this place is submerged.

[news theme plays]

360
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,000
Hey, breaking news.

361
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,500
- Huh?
- Hm? Huh?

362
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,625
Good evening.

363
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,291
[Pakarang sighs] These hologram TVs
are terrible.

364
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,000
You can see straight
through it to the back.

365
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,833
It's the best you can get second hand.

366
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,541
[man over TV] We cross now to the IUN.

367
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:41,250
Various language options are available
through your television. Thanks.

368
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,958
Greetings, world citizens.

369
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,500
Today, the IUN has an announcement.

370
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,041
What is about to be announced
is another important step for humanity.

371
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,458
[speaking in Japanese]

372
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,416
We are excited to announce

373
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,750
that after years of research,
we've made a breakthrough.

374
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,583
What do you think it could be?

375
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,291
Do you think the scientists
have figured out the cause of the rain,

376
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,250
and they've found a solution for it?
That's fantastic!

377
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,916
They'll say it's a new normal,
a new way of living, for the eighth time.

378
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,791
Shut up, Mr. Sua.

379
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,375
- But I'm right.
- We'll see.

380
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,375
Through a collaboration
between the world's top scientists,

381
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,375
we have done it.

382
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,166
We have developed the technology

383
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,875
to survive
our planet's changing conditions.

384
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,666
[tense, dramatic music plays]

385
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

386
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,333
let me present our salvation,

387
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,541
the AquaVac Vaccine.

388
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,833
[dramatic sting]

389
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,041
This is a blessing from the heavens.

390
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,416
It looks as if my prayers
have finally been answered.

391
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,333
The vaccine is a blend
of several antivirals

392
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,625
and protects against waterborne disease.

393
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,708
We have isolated
the genes of the giant squid.

394
00:20:54,791 --> 00:21:00,083
A species with a complex brain
that can survive on land and underwater.

395
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,958
These were combined
with the genes of tardigrades.

396
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,875
An organism that can survive outer space,

397
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:11,083
high levels of radiation,
subzero temperatures, and starvation.

398
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,083
With this solution,
no matter what happens in the future,

399
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,958
we have a way forward.

400
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,000
And we will survive.

401
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
[hopeful, epic music plays]

402
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,958
- We will survive! We're gonna be ok!
- Yeah!

403
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,625
[all cheering]

404
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,833

[series of dramatic music stings playing]

408
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,333
The vaccine can cause
some minor side effects,

409
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,750
particularly, around the chin
and the face.

410
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,041
However, we can assure you

411
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,333
that these effects
are not harmful to your health in any way.

412
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,833
We will not go quietly into the night.

413
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,333
We will not vanish without a fight.

414
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,791
We're gonna live on.

415
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,000
We're gonna evolve and survive.

416
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,291
Today we celebrate our Independence Day!

417
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,083

This has just come in.

421
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,625
At a press conference,

422
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,916
the public health minister
has said the food and drug administration

423
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,750
will not approve the vaccine.

424
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,125
We shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.

425
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,125
This is not ready for human trials.

426
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,666
We still don't know if it works,
or what's in it.

427
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,833
You wanna be a guinea pig?

428
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:56,166
This vaccine goes against everything
we stand for as a country.

429
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,833
[sighing]

430
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,000
Now, let's hear from the person

431
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,750
whose opinion the public
cares about the most,

432
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,333
and that's Big Tang, our prime minister.

433
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,416
[sniffles]

434
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,666
Apparently, some of you aren't satisfied
with being human.

435
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,916
You'd rather be a monster.

436
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,500
If that's what you want,
then go ahead, but count me out, okay?

437
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,458
Yeah? Trust me on this, all right?

438
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,083
[female reporter] What is your plan
moving forward?

439
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,166
I just told you my plan.

440
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,333
I disagree with him on most issues.

441
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,458
But this time I think, he might be right.

442
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,583
Do you really want the vaccine?

443
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,916
If it turns you into a squid?
Huh, who would want that?

444
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,333
But it's been rainin' for two
or three years continuously.

445
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,875
If it was gonna stop,
it'd have stopped by now.

446
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,750
This vaccine is our only hope.

447
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,125
Get it If you want, I won't be.

448
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,208
It's our choice, isn't it?
They can't make us take it.

449
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,958
We have rights, don't we?

450
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:54,083
We can't just blindly follow
the Americans.

451
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,166
As far as I'm concerned,
they can't be trusted.

452
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,625
America isn't your dad.

453
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,916
The IUN isn't your mom.

454
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,291
Stop following Westerners. I have an idea.

455
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,541
I'm working on a solution that's gonna
help everybody equally. Uh-huh?

456
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,250
I have a different solution. All right?

457
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,500
We'll construct glass domes

458
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,458
that will cover the cities
and be completely rainproof.

is a chicken farm?

We'll probably all drown
before we get the vaccine.

Those damn pipes
just keep on dumping water on us.

And where the hell are the authorities?

What are they doing about it?

470
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:47,666
When the vaccine's finally ready,
they'll give it to the rich people first.

471

The elites and their skyscrapers.

472
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,166
You know what I think?

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,916
We'll be long dead
before the government acts.

- Vivian!

- Yeah.
- Right. I'm going to speak my mind.

477

- Uh, mmm.
- All of us are stuck here.

478
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:07,750
Because we can't afford to live
in a high rise above the water level.

- Khlong Toei.

Why did they do
so much damage to the world?

503
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,250
They destroyed the planet
and left nothing for their children.

Chill out. Stop worrying.

508

The grown-ups are going to figure it out.

509
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,666
So, just focus on studying.

when the world could flood tomorrow?

We're just children.
There's nothing we can do.

you have to forget it.

[school bell ringing]

526
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,166

Kalapangha?

532
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,958
Kalapangha?

533
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,375
[man] Kalapangha?

534
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:36,375
Um… anyone seen Kalapangha?

535
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:40,083
Here. Miss Kalapangha is right here.
Uh… Number 456.

536
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:44,291
Uh, hang on. Is that what you're wearing?
Hey, wardrobe, over here.

537
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,750
Get her something to wear.

538
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,833
- Oh, that dress is beautiful.
- [man] Hmm…

539
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,541
I want it.

540
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:56,833
Hey, come on. Tell her you want
that dress. Go on, tell her.

541
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,250
[gentle music playing]

542
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,958
[Pang] Wow.

543
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,500
[Mook] Wow. Take a look.
They look amazing.

544
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,458
Give it everything you've got.

545
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,291
You have to sing like there's no tomorrow.

546
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,750
That might be a bit too real.

547
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,458
Then… How's this?

548
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,500
You could pretend to be…

549
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:27,083
super crazy, or pretend to be super cool.

550
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,916
Or pretend you have a superpower!

551
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,791
Don't be silly.

552
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,958
Ah, well, what about…

553
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,416
What about we try…

554
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,291
Hm?

555
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,041
Having you here with me is enough.

556
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,958
[gentle, nostalgic music playing]

557
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,041
Hmm.

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,958
Number 456. The stage is ready.

559
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,125
Okay.

560
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,416
You can do it, Pang!

561
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:09,500
[male host] Next up,
is contestant number 456.

562
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,333
Welcome to the stage, Kalapangha!

563
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,083
[man] Why is she dressed
in a shabby school uniform?

564
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
[gentle, piano music playing]

565
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,666
[singing in Thai]

566
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,666
Pang! Whoo!

567
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
[continues to sing]

568
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,750
[music fades]

569
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,666
[Mook] Pang.

570
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,500
You really do have a superpower.

571
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,083
Your voice can stop the rain.

572
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,625
[rain pattering very gently]

573
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,458
[rain slashing down then stops]

574
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,166
[resumes singing in Thai]

575
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,166
[audience applauding]

576
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,291
KEEP SMILING EVEN IN TOUGH TIMES

577
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,916
Aww!

578
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,375
Oh, my God! Pang, you're amazing!!

579
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,125
[screams]

580
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,958
She looks like an angel or a princess.

581
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,000
Gorgeous.

582
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,458
That was amazing.

583
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,958
Can I ask you a question?

584
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,083
If you end up winning,

585
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,875
what will you do with the prize money?

586
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,125
Can you tell us?

587
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,333
If I win,

588
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:09,125
I'd use the money…
to buy my mom and dad a house.

589
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,875
The house that we live in…

590
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,875
will soon be underwater.

591
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,666
[man] Your house will be underwater?

592
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,500
Which part of town are you from?

593
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:28,125
We live in Neo Khlong Toei district.

594
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,833
[woman] I thought
that area had been evacuated.

595
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,083
Why are there people still living there?

596
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,583
A lot of people are still living there.

597
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,250
[gentle, somber music playing]

598
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,458
If I win this competition,

599
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:50,291
I'll use some of the money
to buy Aqua Vaccines,

600
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:53,666
and give them
to everyone in our community.

601
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,958
A lot of people who live there are sick.

602
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,250
Including…

603
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:08,791
Mook.

604
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,750
She's my closest friend.

605
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,041
[applause]

606
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,625
Uh! Oh!

607
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,541
It's heartbreaking.

608
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,666
You're a fighter.

609
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,833
[applause continues]

610
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:23,875
You have courage.

611
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,416
- [Toi] Wow.
- Oh! I'm gonna cry.

612
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,458
Oh! Pakarang, you must be so proud!

613
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:38,333
You have such a wonderful daughter.
I really mean it.

614
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,875
Yeah. Mm.

615
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:42,833
Pang!

616
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,541
You can come out now. Don't be shy.

617
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,375
[chuckles]

618
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,166
- [Pakarang] Yeah!
- [man] Give her a round of applause!

619
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,750
Come on. Let's hear it for Pang.

620
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:58,791
Well done.

621
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,166
[Pakarang] Come here. Listen.

622
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,125
I'm so proud of you, okay?

623
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,291
It's not about winning or getting a prize.
All right?

624
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,666
Pang, you won all of our hearts.

625
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,708
[laughs] Yeah, that's right!

626
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,458
If anyone wants to book her,
please, come and see me.

627
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:21,166
- Here we go.
- [Mook] Or you can book me instead.

628
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,083
Aww, how sweet.

629
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,750
I can't sing like her,

630
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,416
but I've got more style!

631
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,000
- [upbeat music plays]
- [vocalizing]

632
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,541
- [thunder roaring]
- [screams]

633
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:37,000
- She was just a flash in the pan, I guess.
- Your singing spooked me.

634
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,291
Hey!

635
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,583
Everyone, take a look at this.

636
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,625
The clip of Pang's gone viral.

637
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,041
Really? Show me.

638
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:49,375
[Pang] A lot of people have gotten sick,
and soon…

639
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,750
my whole neighborhood
will be completely submerged.

640
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,541
[bleeps notifications]

641
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,416
[electronic, upbeat music playing]

642
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,541
WHAT A HEAVENLY VOICE.
WHERE HAS SHE BEEN HIDING?

643
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:04,916
If Pang didn't have me as her best friend,
Pang, the heavenly voice, wouldn't exist.

644
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,333
TOP VOICE THAT STOPS THE RAIN

645
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:09,000
[female reporter] Kalapangha Mekratree's
viral clip

646
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,958
has earned her the title
The Voice of the Slum,

647
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,500
her message has sent
shockwaves through society.

648
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,958
"It's raining everywhere,
but not everyone gets wet."

649
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:20,375
Where do our taxes go?
Are they spent on blocking the drains?

650
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,500
They don't care about us.

651
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,125
We've lost so many people,
and they tell us it's our fault.

652
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,083
ASSHOLES

653
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,291
GREAT WORK.

654
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,791
Pang! You did it!

655
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,666
[electronic upbeat music raises]

656
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:38,958
[reporter] People are rallying to pressure
the government into taking action.

657
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,500
Think you can do better?
Come on, show me then.

658
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm the prime minister,
not a miracle worker.

659
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:45,708
- Hey, shithead.
- [music stops]

660
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:46,875
[laughter]

661
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:51,000
We will begin construction
of the glass dome immediately.

662
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,750
To cover the district of Neo Khlong Toei.

663
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,041
The first of its kind.

664
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,166
AS SMART AS

665
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:04,291
[female reporter] But it seems
the majority would prefer

666
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,833
the vaccine over the glass domes.

667
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:07,916
One thing at a time.

668
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,958
Why such a rush? Ooh.

669
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:15,250
[female reporter] Pang's angelic voice
is resonating all around the country.

670
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,291
- Pang is the best!
- [woman] Yeah. She's great.

671
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:22,875
We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!
We're all gonna die! [screams]

672
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:25,291
And whose fault is climate change?

673
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,208
Own up.

674
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,791
All of you are responsible. That's right.

675
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,666
It's easy to complain
about the world getting hotter.

676
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,458
How do you expect me to solve it?

677
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,458
- All of us are responsible.
- Why do I have to do everything?

678
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,416
I feel so sad for this generation.

679
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,250
You know who's really responsible, right?

680
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,166
- The government.
- Huh?

681
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,000
Think about it this way.

682
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:53,333
For every coal power plant
approved by the government,

683
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:59,250
we need to plant a million trees
to neutralize its carbon footprint.

684
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:02,291
Politicians always blame the public.

685
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:06,333
They make the decisions,
but they want us to take responsibility.

686
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,125
I'm sorry,
but it's your own doing, isn't it?

687
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:13,041
Why is he blaming us
for something like this?

688
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:21,333
GRADE 2 CLASS 4

689
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,625
[screaming in excitement]

690
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,041
The prime minister's coming to our school!

691
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:30,083
Yay!

692
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:36,375
He is coming to plant some Alternanthera
for our community. Yay!

693
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,083
Miss. Is it edible?
The Alternanthera plant?

694
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,833
[chuckling] You must be hungry.
I'll explain.

695
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:51,250
It is said that Alternanthera
facilitates thermoregulation of the body.

696
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:56,625
In other words,
it helps to cool down your blood.

697
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,291
I'm already cold-blooded.

698
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,958
- [sharp metal whoosh]
- Hm!

699
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:08,416
This is the revolutionary vision
of your prime minister that will save us!

700
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:17,083
And now, I have selected one student
to welcome the prime minister here.

701
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,291
And that is…

702
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,541
Kalapangha!

703
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,416
[applauding, cheering]

704
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,625
Kalapangha! Congratulations!

705
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,458
You know what that means?

706
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,875
You're a celebrity.
The prime minister knows who you are!

707
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:41,083
Aren't you happy? Why aren't you smiling?

708
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:43,958
And he is coming here because of you.

709
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,208
[cheering]

710
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,958
Yeah, Pang, you're the best!

711
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,041
[breaths in sharply] On the day,

712
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,875
all of you will dress properly.

713
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,541
A musty uniform will not be tolerated!

714
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,375
That's right.
I can smell you all from here.

715
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,833
[thunder roaring]

716
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,458
[rain pattering]

717
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,625
[Pang] I can't sleep.

718
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,291
[Mook] You need to get some sleep.

719
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,291
You're singing in front
of the prime minister tomorrow.

720
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,833
[Pang] I'm nervous.

721
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,583
Don't worry.
Everyone thinks you're an angel.

722
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:28,750
Know that?

723
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:32,000
An angel who shines
her light on this neighborhood.

724
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,250
You know what?

725
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,458
I heard they're going
to build a statue of you.

726
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:42,000
What? That's ridiculous!

727
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,125
But if they did,

728
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,208
you'd have to be in it

729
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:49,583
because you're the one
who gave me the courage to sing.

730
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,666
[gentle, inspirational music playing]

731
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,750
You and me make quite a pair.

732
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,083
Now that I'm famous,

733
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,208
all these people are following me.

734
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:07,625
Some of them say
they want to donate money.

735
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,208
But I'm really not sure
if I should accept.

736
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:14,041
Just take it, all right.
What's the problem?

737
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,750
Think of it as helping them out.

738
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,583
Huh? How is that helping?

739
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,458
You're helping them do good deeds.

740
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,958
Our struggles

741
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,375
allow for rich people to do good.

742
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,375
The right thing to do is let them.

743
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:32,416
Um, you should share the money with me.

744
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,625
It's the right thing to do.

745
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,875
- You know?
- I see.

746
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,333
So it all comes back to you, does it?

747
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
- [chuckles]
- [whimsical music plays]

748
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:43,750
[scratching]

749
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,750
It's so itchy.

750
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,708
Hey, you need to see a doctor.

751
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,666
They look like they're getting worse.

752
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,208
Don't worry, okay? It's just an itch.

753
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,208
It's nothing serious.

754
00:42:58,458 --> 00:42:59,916
- Uhh…
- [cat meows]

755
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:03,125
Huh? I thought you were dead.

756
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,333
You're a tough one, aren't you?

757
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,083
You've gotten much bigger
since the last time I last saw you.

758
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:10,875
What should I call you?

759
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,708
- Lisa, maybe?
- What about Ya-ya?

760
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,708
Ah, come here, kitty.

761
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,166
[loud roar]

762
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,166
[scream]

763
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,375
It's a piranha cat!

764
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,458
- [screaming]
- [menacing music playing]

765
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,625
Huh? Since when do cats know how to swim?

766
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,500
That's a piranha cat!

767
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,791
Come on!

768
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,458
[music peaks, fades]

769
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,208
[time clicking]

770
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,250
[rain pattering]

771
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:43,916
[wood creaking]

772
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,125
Listen to me, Neon.

773
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,750
You're not listening to me.

774
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:51,708
Ooh.

775
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,000
You've got it wrong.

776
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,125
Thanks for the water, Neon.

777
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,750
I'm really thirsty.

778
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,375
[thudding]

779
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,625
[cracking]

780
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,875
[cracking continues]

781
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,791
It's ballooning.

782
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,625
Everyone, wake up!

783
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,083
It's ballooning.

784
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,291
Wake up. Everyone, wake up.

785
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,250
Mom, look.

786
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:38,625
Why are you shouting? What is it?

787
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,166
[clanking, crackling]

788
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,875
Hey, hey! Everyone. Wake up!

789
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,916
Wake up! The house is flooding.

790
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,416
- Wake up, Tuang.
- [moans]

791
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,000
[dramatic music playing]

792
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,500
[grunts] Hurry, we have to go!

793
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,583
Hey, its not so bad.

794
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,000
At least the bed's above the water.

795
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,916
[chuckles] Good night.

796
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,708
Hey. What the hell do you mean
it's not so bad?

797
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,958
Come on, we need to get our stuff.

798
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,875
- [grunts]
- [Pang's grandma] Hey!

799
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,625
Has anyone seen my glasses?

800
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:16,583
- Why can I never find them…
- Gran, they're here.

801
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:19,125
- So you're the one who took them! Ooh.
- Seriously?

802
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:20,625
[Tuang sighs]

803
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,708
Hey, it's flooding! It's flooding!

804
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:27,541
Kalapangha, you have to wake up.
It's flooding.

805
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,458
Help me!

806
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:31,541
- We need to pack up our stuff.
- Hey! It's flooding. It's flooding!

807
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,250
- My things are floating.
- Mook, wake up.

808
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,958
Just a minute, Neon.

809
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,875
It's the great flood.

810
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,375
[thunder roaring loudly]

811
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,333
Everyone! Everyone, grab your stuff.

812
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,291
We've got to get out!

813
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,583
Hey!

814
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,625
Stop packing your homework.

815
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:49,625
Grab your stuff and get out.
It's flooding.

816
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,416
Get your stuff. It's flooding!

817
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,583
- Grab your stuff. Let's go.
- Hey, Idiot!

818
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,166
It isn't the time for praying!

819
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,500
- [gong strike]
- [scoffs]

820
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,291
That's what you think.

821
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,083
I'll have you know

822
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:06,083
this amulet here has the power
to protect us with its magic.

823
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:09,458
This amulet can protect us from anything.

824
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,250
- Fire or flood.
- Oi!

825
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,208
My dad was wearing this when--

826
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,291
- [loud splash]
- [Thai song plays briefly]

827
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,291
[music stops]

828
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,750
You damn idiot! [screams in frustration]

829
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:20,791
[sighs]

830
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:24,416
- We need to hurry. The roof is collapsing!
- [Tuang] What the heck is going on?

831
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,833
- [Tuang] What are you doing?
- Mom, what are you doing?

832
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,750
Hey, come take a look at this.
The floor's wobbling, just here.

833
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,916
- Pang. Wait. Be careful.
- Careful.

834
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,791
[Pang] What's going on?
Yeah, it's wobbling.

835
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,416
[Puang] Hey, watch out!

836
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,041
[all screaming]

837
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,958
Granny Careful, Granny. Come here!

838
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,875
- [Tuang] Cockroaches!
- Get away from there!

839
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,458
[clamoring]

840
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:48,625
[Pang] Dad!

841
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,291
- [all screaming]
- [cracking, banging]

842
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,125
[dramatic music playing]

843
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,125
Get off! Get off! Get off me!

844
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,750
[mice squeaking]

845
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,291
[Pakarang] Come here, honey.

846
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:07,791
[music peaks, fades]

847
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:11,875
[silence]

848
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,166
[mice squeaking]

849
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,208
[scream]

850
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,166
[rock music playing]

851
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,916
This is Thailand
where anything can happen!

852
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,541
Ahh, hey!

853
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:40,708
[music stops]

854
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,458
[all screaming]

855
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,208
Hey, did you see that? Hey, look, look!

856
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:50,791
I'm reporting from Neo Khlong Toei
which was hit by heavy rain last night.

857
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:54,750
As you can see, there is no indication
that this was once a neighborhood.

858
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,541
Despite the rising water levels,

859
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,166
the government still hasn't confirmed
they are importing the vaccine.

860
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,000
[coughing]

861
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,958
[somber, gentle music playing]

862
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,958
I couldn't save those dogs and cats.

863
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:14,666
[sobbing]

864
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:26,291
- [Pang] Do you feel better, Pruek?
- No rats. No rats.

865
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,583
There are no rats here, Pruek.

866
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,166
Hey, I haven't seen your parents
in a while. Where have they gone?

867
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,250
They've gone back for more stuff.

868
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,416
They went back there?

869
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,083
Oh! The water's already washed
it all away.

870
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,083
There's nothing back there.
Everything we owned is gone.

871
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,375
Unlike this one over here.

872
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:50,041
How far had that sign drifted
before you managed to grab it?

873
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,666
Hey, come on!

874
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,000
This sign, right here,

875
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:57,416
represents the beating heart
of everyone in our community.

876
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,666
It's part of what binds
all of us together.

877
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,250
Fortunately, I don't have any belongings.

878
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:07,125
There is nothing left for me to lose.

879
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,000
I've lost all of my possessions.

880
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,250
And I don't even have a boyfriend.

881
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:13,916
- Hey, Mook,
- Hm?

882
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,291
Who are you talking to?

883
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,458
Oh. To my audience.

884
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,333
You've lost it.

885
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,250

Hey!

888
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,916
A terrorist drone.

889
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,833
Wait, what genre are we in?

890
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,833
Is this sci-fi or drama?

891
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:42,208
Never mind.
Mooktasha Romanoff has got this.

892
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,875
- Bang bang bang!

Alpha A. This is Alpha B. Do you copy?
The target has been found.

896
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,125
Chick, chick, bang, bang, bang, bang!

897
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,416
- What's happening?
- [man] We've got her, sir.

898
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,250
- [grandma] Hey!
- [Mook] Hey, hey, Pang!

899
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,666
- Let go of my granddaughter! Hey!
- Hey, Pang!

900
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,083
Pang!

901
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:08,375
[grandma] Where are you taking her?
Come back! Where are you going?

902
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:10,083
[tense music playing]

903
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,666
Men in suits,
presumed to be government employees,

904
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,250
have just arrived
and taken a young girl into custody.

905
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,500
The girl is Kalapangha,
who has been making headlines recently.

906
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,208
- We're watching this unfold live.
- [man] Hey! Honey?

907
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,958
Honey. Look at the camera.

908
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:28,916
- Look over here.
- [woman] Please, answer some questions?

909
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,916
- This way, please?
- You've just lost your house.

910
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
[woman] How do you feel?

911
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,791
[crying]

912
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,541

[continues to cry]

915
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,541
Turn the lights off.

916
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:15,208

[Tang] I'm here to help you.

923
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,625

933
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,416
It's okay. You're safe now.

934
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,250
Mmm?

935
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,791
[dramatic, eerie music plays]

936
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:46,750
Hey!

- [screams]
- [silence]

941
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,166
Sorry. My hand slipped.

942
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,416
- [screams]
- [Tang] Huh?

943
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,375
Oh!

944
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:08,916
Mm?

- [dramatic music plays]
- [Mook screams]

949
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,916
It's the AquaVac!

950
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,708
It's not what it looks like.

951
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:26,791
It isn't what you think.

952
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,583
Don't jump to conclusions.

953
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,500
These are…

954
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,000
They're tumors.

955
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:37,833
Ever heard of skin tags?

956
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:42,416
You start to get them as you get older.
They're perfectly natural, okay?

957
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,291
- Understand?
- [woman] Yeah, right! Screw you!

958
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,541
We've had enough of your crap.

959
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,833
You're a liar and a fraud.

960
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,583
[tense music playing]

961
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,000
[girl] Kick his ass!

962
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:04,458
The incident prompted an investigation,
which revealed the prime minister,

963
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,500
along with several
high ranking civil servants,

964
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:11,125
had stockpiled the vaccine
for their own use,

965
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:14,250
so why was it reserved for the select few?

966
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,750
The answer is obvious.

967
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,875
The cost of the vaccine is prohibitive,

968
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:21,375
and our government lacked funds
to order enough of the vaccine

969
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,416
to supply the entirety of the country.

970
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,916
Faced with the shortage,
they began a disinformation campaign,

971
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,875
claiming that the vaccine
did not meet medical standards.

972
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:34,875
Those-- Those sons of… bitches!
