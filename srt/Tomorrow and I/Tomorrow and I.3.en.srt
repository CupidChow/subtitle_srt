Let's gather round to check our score.

- [computerized flick]
- [vocalized triumphant music plays]

54
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,708
[ULTRA] You have received 300 Merit Points
for providing to those in need.

55
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,875
[boy] Wow. Holy shit!

56
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,250
- Yes!
- That's a lot.

00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,041

[news theme music plays]

59
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Good morning, viewers.

60
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,250
It's hard to imagine
that it has been almost a year

61
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:26,041
since ULTRA started to radically transform
the practice of Buddhism in our country.

62
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,708
That's right, and right now,
we're going to take you back

63
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,041
to the inaugural launch event
which took place at the ULTRA HQ.

64
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Today, many of you
have lost faith in religion,

65
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,708
thinking of it as outdated,

66
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,375
far-fetched or perhaps tainted.

ULTRA LAUNCH EVENT (ARCHIVE)

68
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,916
Why is that?

69
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,791
It's because of certain groups,

70
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,625
and a number of institutions,

71
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,625
that undermine
the people's faith in religion.

72
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,083
[engaging music playing]

73
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,875
I believe 100%

74
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,125
that religion is a necessity
and is virtuous.

75
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,916
What if there were another option?

76
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,041
An option that fully represents Dhamma

77
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,208
in a pure, unsullied form

78
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,458
as a religion ought to be.

79
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,291
I'd like to introduce you to…

00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,166
- [fingers snap]
- [electronic swish]

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,291
- [vocalized triumphant music plays]
- ULTRA.

82
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,666
- Hello, ULTRA.
- [male electronic voice] Hello.

83
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,333
I am ULTRA. I am an AI trained
on all 84,000 verses of the Tripitaka,

84
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:32,333
using purely generative multi-model
learning with zero human input.

85
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,375
My consolidated wisdom
is as close to the Buddha's teachings

86
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,833
as there has ever been.

87
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:42,416
Everyone can have religious discourse,
hear insights, listen to teachings,

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,583
and learn the wisdom
of Buddha's words via ULTRA.

89
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,625
It's like a portable Tripitaka
wherever you are.

90
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,458
Importantly, ULTRA allows you
to visualize your merit

91
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,083
through the Merit Points system.

ULTRA's Merit Points

94
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,125
can be used to pay off
some of your utility bills,

95
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,833
purchase merit goods,

96
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,916
and as payments for services
from government enterprises.

97
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,708
From now on,

98
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,875
good deeds will become tangible.

99
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,916
Good deeds deliver without delay.

…will be rewarded.

[boy 2] Damn, I'm at level eight. Yes!

104
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,250
I can exchange it for some interest.

105
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,875
- [boy 3] Right.
- We need to earn more.

106
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,125
They're giving
point multipliers these days.

107
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,416
- [boy 3] Sure.
- [girl] Right. Loads of multipliers.

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,333
[boy 2] Exactly.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,833
[whirring, groaning]

110
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,708
[boy] Uei, what are you doing?

111
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,416
This is just for him? Give it to me.

112
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,125
- Hey, New, you see, he's a monk.
- So what?

113
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,375
He'll keep it all for himself.
Giving to many earns us more merit.

114
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,416
- We've given some to them. What's wrong--
- Your name's New, is it?

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,625
The act of offering alms to others

116
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,000
is a good deed.

117
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,041
Offering alms,

118
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,416
expecting nothing in return,

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,708
makes you even more merit.

120
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,458
[vocalized triumphant music plays]

121
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,083
[ULTRA] Your definition of merit
is intangible and unprovable.

122
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,333
When an individual donates
food to the poor,

123
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,625
their generosity is immediately apparent.

124
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,375
Yes, that is not wrong, but there are--

125
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,583
[ULTRA] In the Kalama Sutta,
the Buddha remarked,

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,291
"Be not led by the idea,
'This is our teacher.'"

127
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:43,333
"Only after you have determined that said
Dhamma is favorable and harmless,

128
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,500
then you may choose to abide by it."

129
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,000
Five hundred Merit Points

130
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,250
plus 100-bonus points
for the Dhamma learning session.

131
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,291
See? Nice.

132
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,416
How's that?

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,916
- [boy 2] Merit Points earned. Shall we go?
- [girl] Not bad at all.

134
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,083
- [New] Get in the car.
- [girl] Sure.

135
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,125
[boy 3] Let's go.

136
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,875
[all] Go!

It barely lasts a day on one charge.

147
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,291
Maybe there'll be
a second-hand battery in the village.

There is really no choice.
I'm telling you.

He's talking to the robot again.

Well, he adores it.

00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,083
Don't you talk to cats and dogs?

162
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,750
Yeah, but they're cats and dogs, you know.

163
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,625
That's a trash can.

[robot utters]

165
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,208
You shouldn't say trashcan.

166
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,083
It might feel belittled.

167
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,750
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,541

Stay still.

176
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,666
Wouldn't it be cool if we could feel full
just by getting charged up like iBuddy?

[chuckles]

178
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,958
You're talking nonsense again, Narong.

179
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,708
So what offerings did you receive today?

180
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,208
It's all carbs.

181
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,375
[gong strike]

182
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,500

And flowers.

184
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,458
[newsreader through device] It appears
that the popularity of ULTRA

185
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,541
has left the temples
facing an unforeseen dilemma.

186
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,500
For instance,
despite today being Uposatha day,

187
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,416
there's hardly anyone
showing up for the Buddhist sermon.

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,666
The religion's nemesis,

189
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,916
exploiting good deeds as a transaction,
promoting materialism.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,916
[interviewer] People claim
that temples nowadays

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,750
are centers of commercial Buddhism.

192
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,041
Being a monk is just another a profession.

193
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,750
The government would like to offer
our thanks to ULTRA

194
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,875
for prompting a wave of good deeds.

195
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,708
As a result, our nation moves forward.

196
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,500
I use it myself. I have lots of points.

197
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,583
Do you see this?

198
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,500
I go to great lengths
because I have a firm belief

199
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,416
and absolute confidence

200
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,541
that as we collectively do more good,

201
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,166
our society will only become better.

202
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,208
Hey!

203
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,083
You are taking advantage
of the goodness in people.

204
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,375
It is contrary to the Buddhist teachings.

205
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,500
I agree.

206
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,625
These guys are all about money.

207
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,916
They always claim they're virtuous,
and moral, and all of that.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,250
In the end, they sell user data.

209
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,333
And so they make a profit. Am I right?

210
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,250
Yeah.

211
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:36,375
The selling of consecrated objects
is not in the Buddhist teachings either.

212
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,000
[gong striking]

and true love be with you. Amen.

218
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,125
When this model first came out…

219
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,583
[indistinct loud clamoring]

220
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,750
…they flocked to it.

221
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,500
But now,

222
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,291
there are dozens of boxes left over.

223
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,000
[automatic voice] Amen.

[abbot] It's been six years, hasn't it?

229
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,083
Seven, Abbot.

230
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,291
It is true that we are monks.

231
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,166
But we are also very human.

232
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,291
[speaks in Pali]

233
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,291
"The gift of forgiveness
triumphs over all giving."

234
00:11:55,125 --> 00:12:00,041
- Am I right?
- Especially, the act of self-forgiveness.

235
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,708
Have you ever asked yourself…

236
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,750
what exactly

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,583
are monks like us obligated to do?

238
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,083
[male promo voice] Slimmer, lighter,
the latest version of ULTRA PRO.

239
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,583
Merit making made easy
with innovations from ULTRA lab.

240
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,583
Now more convenient
with Merit Points calculation…

241
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,250
[abbot] Even if we don't mean to change,

242
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,333
the world will change us.

243
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,208
The question
we should really be asking ourselves is,

244
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,708
"What is it that we are we changing into?"

245
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,666
I shall leave it there, good monk,

246
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,625
for you to think on.

247
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,666
Think of it as a Dhamma riddle.

248
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,208
From now on, good deeds will be tangible.

249
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,083
Good deeds deliver without delay.

250
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,875
The good deeds you carry out
will bring you rewards in this lifetime.

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,791
[woman] This a very old model.

256
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,125
It's discontinued.

257
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,166
Where about did you get it from?

258
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,708
Could I use a board from another model?
I really don't want to give this one up.

259
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,000
This one was made in the same factory.
It should be compatible.

260
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,875
Okay, I'll take that.

261
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,291
- How much?
- Five thousand.

262
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,875
Could you give me a discount?

263
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,625
Do you have any ULTRA points?

264
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,708
You can pay in installments
over seven months.

265
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,750
Half of that. And I'll pay you now.

266
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,208
I'm selling goods here, not making merit!

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,333
Come back to get it
when you have the money.

268
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,125
I'm sure no one else will want it.

269
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,333
[man] I'll pay for it.

270
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,250

Atom! Atom. [laughing] Atom!

275
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,083
Good evening, venerable sir.

276
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,041
- [monk] May you be blessed.
- What are you doing here in the market?

277
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,375
[monk] I owe you a debt of gratitude.

278
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,500
How's it going at work?
Are you in the top position already?

279
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,875
Oh, yeah, the very top.

280
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,083
Actually, to be truthful, I was laid off.

281
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,041
After you left, I opened my own start up.

282
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,083
I thought about giving you a call,
so you could write code for me.

283
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,000
I see.

284
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,125
Coding for what?

285
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:39,333
I actually simulated
the brain waves of parents,

286
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,083
so AI could input
artificial memories in the motherboard.

287
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,208
This would give us a teddy
which would lull children

288
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,583
to sleep just like their parents do.

289
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,541
[monk] Mmm.

290
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,750

Your product looks very good.

298
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,666
But I'm wondering...

299
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,333
It could create
barriers between family members.

300
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,500
Don't you think?

301
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,875
That's way too serious.

302
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,625
Look.

303
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,333
It's just a toy.

Here it is.

Look.

309
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,625
A customer gave me this.

Some people like it,

311
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,041
but you can count me out.

312
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,000
Honestly, in this day and age,

313
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,625
if we fail to adapt,

314
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,291
we'll become extinct
as technology disrupts us.

315
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,916

Buddhism has been around
for thousands of years.

323
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,916

I'd like to find out
how they manage to pull it off.

I don't know either.

I humbly hope to learn from you

about the concept of merit.

that the merit system is not good.

I replaced the motherboard with one
that has code to speech capability.

So this AI must have processed
what it had memorized.

Most of what it remembered
were your words.

429
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,208
As for the robot attacking that kid,

430
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,916
essentially, that's a safety feature
for pedestrians.

Can I please speak
to a human customer service agent?

443
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,125
This is taking up a lot of time,
and I'm not getting anywhere.

[ULTRA] Should you wish
to speak to our customer service agent,

has been eavesdropping on me.

Nice. They're quick
responding to criticism.

What's with
that earnest sincerity bullshit?

464
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,333
I'd forget about it. It's not worth it.

465
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,791
Don't you agree, iBuddy?

466
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,875

Greetings, sir.

484
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,125
Hold on a minute.

00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,875
Where am I?

486
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,791
This is my house.

487
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:08,708
The reason we invited you
is because I have a favor to ask of you.

488
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,791
I could transfer the ownership
of this house to the temple,

489
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,083
if it'd make things better.

490
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,875
[man] If this house is not enough,
you can take my car as well.

491
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,458
Help us to ascend to heaven, sir.

492
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,500
[both] Help us to ascend to heaven.

493
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,916
[both] Help us to ascend
to heaven, please.

494
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,875
- Please, sir.
- Please, allow us to ascend.

495
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,125
- Accept it.
- Please.

496
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,458

[somber music playing]

503
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,250
As you can see,

504
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,541
this husband and wife
are devoutly religious,

505
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,291
giving alms morning and evening.

506
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But there's a catch.

507
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:54,208
The temple they are devoted to
happens to have this teaching.

508
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,541
It says,

509
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,000
"The life that you should prioritize

510
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,125
is not your present life,

511
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,791
but the afterlife."

512
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,166
It says that the more
you donate to the temple,

513
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,500
the greater your chance of being reborn

514
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,791
as a divine being.

515
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,291
When the husband and his wife heard that,

516
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,916
they donated
everything they owned to the temple.

517
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,875
[chuckles] Almost like noble princes.

518
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,708
By 2015,

519
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,500
they had nothing left,

520
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,000
except for this house.

In the end,

524
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,041
they lost the house.

525
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,541
- [explosions]
- [glass shattering]

526
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,000
They decided to commit suicide
by taking drugs and burnt the house down

527
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:11,958
to escape their debts.

528
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,458
[somber music continues to play]

529
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,333
[objects crackling, rattling]

530
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,833
Was it was good or bad luck
that somehow their son somehow survived?

531
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,458
From that day on,

532
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,125
the boy made a promise to himself

533
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,375
that no one would die

534
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,000
for their fervent beliefs
like his parents.

535
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,916
The good deeds you carry out
will bring you rewards in this lifetime.

536
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,541
That boy is prepared to do anything

537
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,583
to completely eradicate
the criminals disguised in saffron robes.

538
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,625
This is the important responsibility

539
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,000
in that boy's life.

540
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,375
It is indeed very saddening
to hear time and time again

541
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,625
when people use religion to exploit.

542
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,500
I am very sure

543
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,250
that you totally understand

544
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:32,500
that religion does not teach
that kind of action,

545
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,708
the principles and the thinking

546
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,875
behind the creation of ULTRA.

547
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,375
Do you really believe it to be sound?

548
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,166
[inhales]

549
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,041
[rhythmic, tense music playing]

550
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,833
So…

551
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,750
what are your thoughts on religion

552
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,291
and the commercialization of Buddhism?

553
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,916
Do you ever feel lonely?

554
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,500
Is it hard being the only fully open lotus

555
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,625
amongst others wallowing in the mud?

556
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,583
I suggest you step out,

557
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,208
out of your current environment

558
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:41,041
and put to use the skills you acquired
when living as a lay person.

559
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,666
Keep embracing your faith in Buddhism.

560
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,541
We shall cleanse
the tarnished reputation of monks.

561
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,666
Won't you join me
in this cleansing with the help of ULTRA?

562
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,166
[music intensifies]

563
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,458
Surely, you're aware
of ULTRA's great influence.

564
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,791
The latest model is selling like wildfire.

565
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,833
You shouldn't use sales figures

566
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,041
as an indicator of your success,

567
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,750
or as a justification
for what it is you are doing.

568
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,166
[vocalized triumphant music plays]

569
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,541
[Anek's voice] There are
many positive aspects to ULTRA,

570
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,125
but also flaws which need to be fixed.

571
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:31,916
I'd like to find out
how they manage to pull it off.

572
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,583
[tense music playing]

573
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,000
All this time,
you've been eavesdropping on me.

574
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,708
[laughs] Let's not call it eavesdropping.

575
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,916
ULTRA is all around us.

576
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,583
It collects, processes, and learns data.

577
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,750
It's constantly evolving,
like human intelligence.

578
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,416
Yet, despite feeding it
millions of exabytes of data,

579
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,833
ULTRA still lacks something.

580
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,250
[music sting]

581
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,208
I'd like you to be

582
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,916
the head of our data collection division.

583
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
[muisc sting]

584
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,833
You could apply your knowledge,
your experience, and wisdom

585
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:23,208
to develop, refine, and teach ULTRA
to maximize its capabilities.

586
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,708
And Mr. Atom will oversee the hardware.

587
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:30,916
And I'll also hire the abbot
and all the other monks at your temple

588
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,375
to work alongside you.

589
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,500
It's a prelude to the final act.

590
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,375
In fact, I'm going to invite
all the monks in this country

591
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:45,875
to be a part of ULTRA,
by hiring them as employees.

592
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,875
[music sting]

593
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,750
They'll have to live
strictly in accordance

594
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,666
with the teachings of the Tripitaka.

595
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,458
No longer will they rely
on the alms from laypeople.

596
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,583
They will be provided with a salary.

597
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,583
There will be
no more consecration of objects.

598
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,291
No more embezzlement of temple funds.

599
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,916
And every single monk

600
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,375
will adhere to the Buddhist principles.

601
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:14,708
They will study, disseminate,
and pass on all of the Buddha's teachings,

602
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,333
as they should.

603
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,291
Once we have the Buddha,
the Dhamma, and the Sangha,

604
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,500
ULTRA will be complete.

605
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,125
[music intensifies]

606
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,333
If you're quite finished…

607
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,333
I'll take my leave.

608
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,416
[speaks in Pali]

609
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:11,875
When your mind is composed,
you will know the one and only truth.

610
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,583
If my parents had met a monk like you…

611
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,666
they'd both still be alive.

612
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,208
Wouldn't you say?

613
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,583
[tense music continues to play]

614
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,208
I don't like that guy.

615
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,333
What a shady character.

616
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,291
The way he was talking,

617
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,291
he'll probably buy the temples

618
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,750
and pay off the monks
to keep as his slaves.

619
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,666
That Neo guy,
he's a capitalist through and through.

620
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,833
While you were listening to him,

621
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,500
didn't you feel contempt
or at least anger?

622
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,041
[birds chirping]

623
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:02,875
[gentle chimes]

624
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:09,375
Do you know the reason why I left…
why I left the company back then?

625
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,125
Well…

626
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,416
they said you were burned-out.

627
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:16,791
Sort of.

628
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:21,750
Working too hard and drove yourself crazy,
then you became a monk.

629
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,208
Until then,

630
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,583
I had never had any interest in religion.

631
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,833
[typing]

632
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,625
[Anek] All I did was work.

633
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,208
[fast-paced indistinct chats]

634
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,041
[Anek] I would put in long hours.

635
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,708
[cell phone vibrating]

636
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,958
[Anek] Then one day,
I got a call from my mom.

637
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,041
She told me

638
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,875
she had been diagnosed with leukemia.

639
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,333
[sad, tense music playing]

640
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,458
Final stage.

641
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,625
My whole life,

642
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,750
she'd never asked anything of me.

643
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,541
But at that time,

644
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,750
she asked me to become ordained
before she left this world.

645
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,791
She always told me

646
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,583
that before I was born,

647
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,833
she'd have these dreams
of the Buddha's tooth in her belly.

648
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:26,833
The Buddha's tooth? Huh?

649
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,541
Yes, the Buddha's tooth.

650
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:35,083
So, Mom went to see this monk

651
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,375
that she respected.

652
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:45,750
The monk told her that, one day,
I'd become an important religious figure.

653
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,750
I'd come to the rescue of Buddhism

654
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:53,250
in a time of crisis.

655
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,666
He said that,

656
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,833
and so she held that hope.

657
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,791
So your decision to ordain,
it was as an act of filial piety?

658
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:08,416
I wasn't able to ordain at the time.

659
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,916
The company was about to list
on the stock market.

660
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,583
[indistinct crowd chattering]

661
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,041
[sighs]

662
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:23,500
I made a vague promise to her
that I'd ordain in the future.

663
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,791
Eventually,

664
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,250
the project I was working on,

665
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,333
it got pulled.

666
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,625
Then Mom,

667
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:49,958
she passed away,
and she never got to see me ordained.

668
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,625
I lied to my mother.

669
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,041
I disrespected her.

670
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,583
[somber music continues to play]

671
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:16,875
Anek. Hi!

672
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,083
Anek.

673
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,416
[music swells, fades]

674
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,958
[Anek] I don't know why,

675
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,708
but I… I decided to go down and see him.

676
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,333
He said to me,

677
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,583
"Natthi Sanatiprang Sukang."

678
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,208
[abbot's voice] Natthi Sanatiprang Sukang.

679
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,791
Contentment is the greatest wealth
above all.

680
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,875
[pensive, nostalgic music playing]

681
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,083
The abbot would asked me a question…

682
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,875
"What is the duty of a monk?
What is a monk's true duty?"

683
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:02,541
Now,

684
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:04,958
I know what it is.

685
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,500
What is it then?

686
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,458
[gentle chimes]

687
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:19,166
There are so many people
looking for hope in this world.

688
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:25,333
The thing that is most suited
to give hope to people

689
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,583
is other people.

690
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,666
Especially those who have made mistakes…

691
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,875
and have nowhere to turn.

692
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:44,208
But eventually, they see a light
at the end of the tunnel.

693
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,333
You asked me if I felt anger.

694
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,166
At this time, anger or ignorance
serve no purpose at all.

695
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,083
If the world is trying to change us,

696
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:18,541
it's probably the time
to use our skills and our knowledge

697
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,416
to change ourselves…

698
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,541
and to become a beacon of hope for others.

699
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,583
[Anek's voice] The Buddha's tooth.
I'd come to the rescue of Buddhism

700
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,166
in a time of crisis.

701
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,708
Okay, if that's what you think,
then I'm with you.

702
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,291
Let's see who's the real deal.

703
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,708
[both] Hm.

704
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,208
By the way, when are you going to start?

705
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:53,750
Haven't you noticed?

706
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,833
I started a while ago now.

707
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,333
[upbeat music playing]

708
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,375
ULTRA PRO
SLIMMER LIGHTER

709
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:09,791
Innovation.

710
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:17,083
[Atom] I actually simulated
the brain waves of parents,

711
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:20,833
so AI could input artificial memories,
in the motherboard.

712
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,875
[Narong] When this model first came out,
they flocked to it.

713
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:30,666
[Atom] All versions of iBuddy
have built-in machine learning.

714
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,041
Most of what it remembered
were your words.

715
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,833
[abbot speaks Pali]

716
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:40,875
The only thing that does not change
in this world is change itself.

717
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,958
[music peaks, fades]

718
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,750
[female news reporter]
Hello, we're at the Dhammanittha Temple

719
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:51,958
to witness the launch
of an exciting new product for Buddhists.

720
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:59,166
DHAMMANITTHA TEMPLE
WELCOMES YOU

721
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,250
[fast-paced, upbeat music playing]

722
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:05,166
The temple claims that it's going
to change the face of Buddhism,

723
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:11,208
and restore faith in religion and monks
among the citizens of our society.

724
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,291
[music continues to play]

725
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,625
[Atom] There's no need to worry, Abbot.

726
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:23,958
I understand that such a huge event
might seem inappropriate.

727
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,958
In this age, it's necessary

728
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:31,208
to garner attention
and to engage with people.

729
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,625
If there are good intentions,

730
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:35,708
it's a good thing.

731
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:44,541
You there. Hey.

732
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,583
Can I have two spotlights over here?

733
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,625
[woman] Mr. Neo, why are you attending
your competitor's launch?

734
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:53,958
I don't come here as a competitor
or steal the spotlight.

735
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,166
I came to extend
my congratulations to Monk Anek.

736
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,333
I've always held him in high regard.

737
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,125
We've had several discussions
about Dhamma.

738
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,708
I'm sure everyone here
wishes him the best.

739
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
[muffled fireworks]

740
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,750
[digital chimes]

741
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:13,083
[man] What's that? What's that?

742
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,833
[digital chimes]

743
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,083
[catchy music plays, fades]

744
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,041
[grandiose music playing]

745
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:35,666
[crowd cheering]

746
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:46,541
[male presenter] And now, please give
a round of applause for Monk Anek,

747
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,500
the chief engineer of this project.

748
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,166
[crowd cheering]

749
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,083
[music continues to play]

750
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:58,875
[groans]

751
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,000
[Anek] I need to thank you, Atom,

752
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,958
for all your support

753
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,708
and your investment in the project.

754
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,708
[Atom] You don't need to thank me.

755
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,208
I, along with all the other investors,

756
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,083
we believe in your vision for the project.

757
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,375
By the way,

758
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,583
what are we gonna name it, venerable sir?

759
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:34,000
[iBuddy groans]

760
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:36,666
[groaning, whirring]

761
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,375
Hello, iBuddha.

762
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,833
[synthesized magical music plays]

763
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:56,500
[male voice] I am iBuddha,
your faithful companion.

764
00:45:56,583 --> 00:46:00,916
I have compiled all things related
to Buddhism in one place.

765
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,791
If you want to study the Tripitaka,

766
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,958
listen to the Jataka tales,

767
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:10,916
exercise your brain with Dhamma riddles,
say a prayer from a collection

768
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,583
of more than 900 prayers
assembled from all the scriptures,

769
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,083
perform religious rituals,

770
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:20,083
such as alms giving,
donations, merit making on your birthday,

771
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:23,000
you may do all of this
from the convenience of your home

772
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,041
via our online system.

773
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:29,750
No obstacle will stand in the way
of your determination to do good.

774
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:30,958
[crowd murmuring]

775
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,041
Here now is the unique thing
about iBuddha.

776
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:37,750
It is this.

777
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,833
[synthesized gong]

778
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:44,750
[crowd murmuring]

779
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,541
Greetings, to all my fellow Buddhists.

780
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,958
I am Abbot Udom Jittatanto.

781
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:55,833
I am honored to act
as an intermediary of Dhamma and merit

782
00:46:55,916 --> 00:47:01,125
to guide every individual
towards the state of spiritual serenity.

783
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,083
Our iBuddha makes use

784
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:06,250
of the latest
brain wave cloning technology,

785
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,958
the most cutting edge technology
of this era.

786
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,041
[tension-building music playing]

787
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,000
It's as if you have the abbot
right next to you,

788
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:29,208
and then he will be the guiding light
for your spirituality.

789
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,125
[crowd exclaims]

790
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:37,208
We will have many more venerable mentors

791
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,875
from all over the country
who will join us.

792
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,375
[suspenseful music playing]

793
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:46,291
[Atom] At the moment, our system
is definitely more advanced than ULTRA.

794
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,500
But, to be honest, there's one thing
that ULTRA has that we can't compete with.

795
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,625
The Merit Points system.

796
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,083
[music continues to play]

797
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,375
[speaks in Pali]

798
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,583
Contentment is the greatest wealth
above all.

799
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,125
[synthesized gong]

800
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:26,625
Every time you use the system,
you will receive points which we call

801
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:28,041
Jitta.

802
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,625
- [woman] Did he say Jitta?
- [man] Jitta.

803
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,625
The more you practice,
the more you'll get.

804
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:37,000
Essentially, it signifies
the degree of concentration,

805
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:41,375
wisdom, and serenity
within the users of the system.

806
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,250
More importantly,

807
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,375
the accumulated Jitta points that you get

808
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:50,291
can exempt you
from our monthly service fees.

809
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,375
[suspenseful music continues]

810
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,291
That can be indefinitely.

811
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,791
[crowd cheering]

812
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,250
iBuddha is the only technology

813
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,291
that has brought together

814
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:08,041
the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha,

815
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:12,291
as a spiritual linchpin
to keep you centered

816
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:18,041
and avoid the wrong path
in our modern world

817
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,166
that's rife with deceit

818
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,666
and misinformation.

819
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,375
[music intensifies]

820
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,416
[crowd cheering]

821
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,750
[music peaks, fades]

822
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:55,875
[woman] Venerable monk.

823
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,375
[crowd applauding, cheering]

824
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,625
[news theme music plays]

825
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:06,416
We have breaking news coming in.

826
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,000
I should warn you that there are images
and audio in this segment

827
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,708
that some viewers may find distressing.

828
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,291
[female newsreader] A resident noticed
a male and female couple

829
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,583
acting suspiciously,

830
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,375
so he notified the police.

831
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,208
Every morning, I see this couple
bring out many senior citizens

832
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:23,708
from the rented room.

833
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:26,333
[male newsreader] The couple confessed
to the authorities

834
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:29,208
that they would take
the senior citizens out

835
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:33,791
and assist the elderly people
in crossing the road on a daily basis

836
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,708
in order to earn Merit Points from ULTRA.

837
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,666
These Merit Points
are then exchanged for goods.

838
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,750
To date, these goods have been sold
for over 100,000 baht.

839
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:50,458
So far, ULTRA has not been identified
as either a suspect or an accomplice.

840
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:53,833
It's like a knife.
How you use it is a choice.

841
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,791
On the subject of Mr Neo,

842
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:59,500
it appears that he has been staying
well under the radar lately.

843
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:02,958
As yet, Mr Neo has made
no official statement on this matter.

844
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:06,291
- [male newsreader] I see.
- Moving on now to ULTRA's competitor.

845
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,750
- Yes. Right.
- iBuddha.

846
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:09,500
- iBuddha…
- Okay.

847
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:13,958
Which was rolled out only two months ago,
is reporting booming sales,

848
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,583
and there seems little doubt

849
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,500
that incidents like these
have been to their advantage.

850
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:22,000
[Narong] Very good now!
Welcome, come and give it a try.

851
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:25,958
Please join the line over there.
You don't have to wait for a monk anymore.

852
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,500

you're buying a portable temple.

[classical music playing]

854
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:32,500
[monk] Sermons
and prayer verses are included.

855
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:33,625
[Narong] Sure.

856
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,833
Get in line, please. get in line.

857
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,166
[music peaks, fades, resumes]

858
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:42,166
Fellow Buddhists,
please, get in line. iBuddha 1.0.

859
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:44,500
[monk] You can have a Dharma discussion…

860
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:47,750
[male news reporter] The resident monks,
the abbot, and the Sangha Supreme Council

861
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:49,666
can't help but wear a big smile.

862
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,375
The Sangha Supreme Council
even went so far…

863
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:55,500
- As to release a congratulatory statement.
- [female news redear] Precisely.

864
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,958
They praised Monk Anek
and the Dhammanittha Temple

865
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,416
for their pioneering innovation
and services Buddhism in Thailand.

866
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,083
[female newsreader] The innovation makes
Dharma more accessible

867
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:07,083
to us in this digital age,

868
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:10,083
where we have
an increasing reliance on technology.

869
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:13,416
The netizens even invented
a moniker for Monk Anek.

870
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,625
- Yes.
- He's referred to as the Innovative Monk.

871
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:19,750
Wow! This is truly insane. Look.

872
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,083
The online sales are terrific.

873
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:24,375
Can I take a selfie with you,
venerable sir?

874
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,833
Of course.

875
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,333
One more, please.

876
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,625
- One, two…
- [newsreader] Is there a Buddhist moniker?

877
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,916
Yes. Navatobhikkhu.

878
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,166
- Simply put, a Steve-Jobs monk.
- [chuckles] Steve-Jobs monk?

879
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,625
How cool is that?

880
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
[classical music swelling]

881
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,166
[music peaks, fades]

882
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:56,833
ORNJIRA SAETIEW
24 FEBRUARY 1959 - 12 MAY 2027

883
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,916
[mechanical whirring]

884
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,375
The thing you once dreamed of…

885
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,708
I've turned this into reality now, Mom.

886
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,583
[Narong] Venerable sir.

887
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,333
[indistinct chatter]

888
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:37,916
[man] There he is. Monk Anek.

889
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,291
Monk Anek. There he is.

890
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,250
- [man] How did he come to this?
- Please calm down.

891
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,041
[man] Monk Anek, how did it come to this?

892
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:48,458
Are you aware of the iBuddha incident
resembling what happened with ULTRA?

893
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,958
[tense music playing]

894
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,750
You filthy monk!

895
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,708
- Hold on.
- How dare you do this to my child?

896
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:00,166
Please, calm down. Let's calm down.

897
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,250
Please, calm down.

898
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:03,541
Please, calm down.

899
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,666
Wh-- What exactly happened?

900
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,375
Look.

901
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,625
See? See what you've done?

902
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,833
[abbot over device] Hey, pretty girl.

903
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,208
You there, pretty girl.
Come over here. Come here.

904
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,291
Now, lift up your skirt for me.

905
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,500
[music sting]

906
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,125
[tense music playing]

907
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,791
[woman] How could you do this?

908
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:24,875
You're a monk!

909
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,791
[female reporter] iBuddha
sexually harassed an eight-year-old girl.

910
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,750
As its creator, what's your response?

911
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,291
- [man] What do you have to say, sir?
- [woman] Do you care to comment, sir?

912
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,416
[man] You can't be silent.

913
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,708
[woman] Other reports
of harassment have been filed.

914
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:41,208
- [man] Is what happened in the clip true?
- [woman] Venerable sir, any comments?

915
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:43,000
[music swells, fades]

916
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:47,666
[birds chirping]

917
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,250
[abbot] I admit…

918
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,500
that I said that.

919
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,125
I couldn't help myself.

920
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:10,458
That incident took place 40 years ago.

921
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:14,625
I was just a teenager then.

922
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:17,958
I was uninhibited

923
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,583
and reckless.

924
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,666
I'm not going to blame it on alcohol.

925
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:28,208
I'm the one at fault here.

926
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,000
Well…

927
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:34,750
It's…

928
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,958
It's probably happened
because I cloned his brainwaves.

929
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:45,416
All of the past and present memory traces
of the subjects were gathered

930
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,791
without excluding any transgressions
of these participants.

931
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,458
Abbot, it is my oversight.

932
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:56,291
I have done you wrong
and harmed your reputation.

933
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,291
I have also done a wrong to Monk Anek.
I'm so terribly sorry, Abbot.

934
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:02,208
I'm so terribly sorry, Abbot.

935
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,958
I'm truly sorry.

936
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,250
[sad music playing]

937
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:09,291
[abbot] Atom, it's not your fault.

938
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,166
The only person to blame

939
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:15,958
is me.

940
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,666
[music continues to play]

941
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:23,708
Even though I was punished for what I did,

942
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,458
every action we have carried out

943
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:31,916
can always come back
in the future to haunt us.

944
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:46,166
Sure, I may be a monk.

945
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,083
But don't forget,
I'm just an ordinary monk,

946
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,750
I'm not an enlightened one.

947
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,250
Sir. Abbot, sir.

948
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,166
Are you going out there now?

949
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:14,958
Those people out there are angry.
They've started throwing things.

950
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,250
I'm afraid you may not be safe.

951
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:24,250
I owe the victims' families an apology.

952
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:30,041
If hurling things at me is a means
they need to vent their grievances,

953
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:32,000
let them do it.

954
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,750
As long as it appeases them.

955
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:40,666
The amount of stuff
they hurl at me is immaterial.

956
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,541
Those things won't hit their target

957
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:47,291
since I'm no longer that person.

958
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,708
[music intensifies]

959
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,791
[crowd murmuring]

960
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,791
[man] You piece of shit!

961
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,791
Pervert!

962
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:13,166
[woman] You're no monk!
Get out, you piece of trash!

963
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,541
[music peaks, fades]

964
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,000
[birds chirping]

965
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,666
[female newsreader] A week has gone by

966
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:44,000
since iBuddha unearthed the deplorable
and despicable past

967
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,333
of the abbot of Dhammanittha Temple.

968
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:50,791
A short while ago,
the Sangha Supreme Court took action.

969
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:53,375
Yes, the council
publicly condemned the temple

970
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:56,833
for its negligence
and failure in its screening process.

971
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:59,958
The statement takes aim
at the controversy surrounding the abbot

972
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:01,875
and the creation of iBuddha.

973
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:05,458
The Ministry of Technology
and the Consumer Protection Board

974
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,291
issued an order
to discontinue the service.

975
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,375
Seems it's back to the drawing board,

976
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:14,166
with respect to the appropriate use of AI
and advanced technology,

977
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,875
in the context
of Buddhist temples and monks.

978
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,041
[iBuddha] Everything will be ok.

979
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,291
[pensive music playing]

980
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,458
[iBuddy groans]

981
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:34,625
Thank you.

982
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,791
You've been such a wonderful companion.

983
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,958
But you shouldn't follow me anymore.

984
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,458
I'm just like a blind man.

985
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,333
We should bid farewell here.

986
00:59:58,416 --> 00:59:59,750
[iBuddy groans]

987
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,333
[mechanical whirring]

988
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:03,416
[music continues to play]

989
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,541
[iBuddy groaning]

990
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,916
[Anek's voice] But this will not feed me,

991
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,708
and it makes me scared.

992
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,333
I must not be attached

993
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:20,125
to physical things.

994
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,166
[pensive music continues to play]

995
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,833
[soft pop]

996
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,166
[whirring]

997
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:51,000
[music fades]

998
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,333
[gentle chimes]

999
01:00:58,416 --> 01:00:59,583
[birds chirping]

1000
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:00,625
[music resumes]

1001
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,500
- [vocalized triumphant music plays]
- [ULTRA] Congratulations.

1002
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:44,458
You've been awarded 20 Merit Points
for helping to preserve the environment.

1003
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,500
Wasn't it worth 100 points last month?

1004
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:48,791
What the hell?

1005
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,875
[ULTRA] Sorry, you've already
completed this mission.

1006
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,250
[music intensifies]

1007
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,083
[traffic robot] It is safe to cross.

1008
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,958
It is safe to cross.

1009
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:31,875
It is safe to cross…

1010
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,916
Right now is the birth
of a new Buddhist era.

1011
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,916
There is ULTRA, Super ULTRA,

1012
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,875
and ULTRA Pro,
as your personal Dharma assistants.

1013
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:47,958
Anytime, anywhere,
it assimilates the monk's constitution,

1014
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,083
introducing a novel concept
that you can have with you at all times.

1015
01:02:53,166 --> 01:02:54,583
[vocalized triumphant music plays]

1016
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:55,541
ULTRA.

1017
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,041
[music peaks, fades]
