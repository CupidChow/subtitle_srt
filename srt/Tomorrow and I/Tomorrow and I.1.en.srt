TOMORROW AND I

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,791
THIS SERIES IS SET IN A FICTITIOUS FUTURE

6
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,125
AND IT HAS BEEN CREATED SOLELY
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES

[female AI voice]
Engage the heart charging mechanism.

15
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,375
Launch the heart charging protocol.

16
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,125
Prepared energy awaiting transmission
to the synthetic heart.

00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,833
[thumping]

18
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,916
[AI] Successful transmission of energy.

[woman sighs] Hey, Nont.

23
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,875
Come here. Listen, I have good news.

24
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,750
[breathes in] Nont, I was actually right!

25
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:55,291
A low gravitational force enables
the cardiomyocytes to form into a heart

26
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,666
better than on earth.

27
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,250
[breathes in] Once I've carried out
a proteomic analysis

28
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,291
and get a full picture
of the underlying mechanism,

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,291
we'll be able to 3D print actual hearts.

30
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,208
No longer will there be
donor waiting lists.

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,500
When I get back to Earth,

32
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,708
I'll hurl these hearts
back at those old dinosaurs

33
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,750
who said my work
will never come to anything.

34
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,958
I'll make them hang their heads in shame.

35
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,125
That sounds good. I'm with you.

36
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,875
[chuckles]

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,875
Oh, now that you can print
hearts on demand,

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
don't forget this old heart of mine.

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,125
Okay?

40
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,333

Aww!

47
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,791
Sure, go on and pet him.

48
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,291
You've been trying to pet him
for three years, but you can't.

49
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,875
I can imagine.

50

51
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,083
[woman] Do you miss your mom? Hey?

52
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,500
[mimicking Harvey] Oh, I miss you so much.

53
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,291
Please, come back soon.
I've got a gift for you.

54
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,291
What?

55
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,916
[Nont] Here we are. Aw!

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,375
[chuckles]

57
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,083
[Nont] Harvey bought it, you know?

58
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,833
Oh, yes, he knows what his mom likes.

59
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,041
He often complains

60
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,791
that he feels bad for his mom
missing out on her favorite snack.

61
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,708
Because ISA forbids it in space.

62
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,916
They say that if you bite into it,
it will turn into--

63
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,375
Turn into what, Harvey?

64
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,000
Aw! Woof.

65
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:37,208
Into nanoparticles that can clog up
the engine of the spaceship.

66
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,958
Aww!

67
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,125
[dog whining]

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,875
Oh, funny!

69
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,791
Watch it.

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,458
[Nont chuckling]

71
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,041
Nont.

72
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,083
Thank you.

73
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,416
For what? For the snack?

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Not that.

75
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,416
I'm serious.

76
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,458
Well…

77
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,083
for letting me come out here
to follow my dream.

78
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,166
[pensive music playing]

79
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,791
There's no one else in this world,

80
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,500
other than you,
who would just let me be myself.

81
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,375
Also…

82
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,791
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,791
Hey!

84
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,833
Why are you sorry?

85
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,708
You're back in 10 days, aren't you?

86
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,541
Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,875
When I'm back,
I'm going to make everything up to you.

88
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,750
I'll be all yours,

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,666
yours and only yours.

90
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,250
Pinky promise?

91
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,500
Our pinkies don't touch.

92
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
Use your imagination.

93
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,291
- [woman] I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

94
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,250
Yeah. Bye.

00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,958

[female newsreader]
No one expected this

103
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:29,875
to be the final voyage for the astronaut
Doctor Kanitthapada Sompong Na Dara,

104
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,750
known as Dr Noon,
the first female Thai astronaut.

105
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,791
[male newsreader]
The International Space Agency said

106
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,166
that as the space shuttle
was re entering the earth's atmosphere,

107
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,333
a fire broke out in the air supply system,

108
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,541
which led to the premature depletion
of the oxygen supplies

109
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,791
for the astronauts prior to landing.

110
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,750
[sad, nostalgic music playing]

111
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,416
[female newsreader] Doctor Noon's body
has been preserved using cryonics

112
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,583
in preparation
for 100-day-long funeral rites,

113
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,583
before cremation is carried out
in accordance with Buddhist practices.

114
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,291
Her husband, Mr. Nont, has just come out.
Let's hear what he has to say.

115
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,083
[newsreader] Who do you think
should take responsibility for this?

116
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,291
- [reporter 1] Do you miss her?
- [reporter 2] Why will you do that?

117
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,041
- [reporter 3] Why didn't you stop her?
- [reporter 4] Did you ever try?

118
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,750
Why didn't you stop her going to space?

119
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,833
- [reporter 4] Any comments?
- How do you feel? Anything to say?

120
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,958
[reporter 6] Did you?

121
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,791
- [man] Mr. Nont, why did you not stop her?
- [woman] Any comment?

122
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,208
[man] Mr. Nont, you're not saying
anything. Can we get a comment?

123
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,125
Mr. Nont, a comment, please.

124
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,791
[woman] Are you okay?

125
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,041
[man] Mr. Nont. Mr. Nont!

126
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,333

TWO MONTHS LATER

132
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,666
[gentle, nostalgic music playing]

133
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,041
[Nont] Do you like this picture?

134
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,166
I noticed you've been staring at it.

135
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,166
Uh…

136
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,083
this is my design.

137
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,583
Oh.

138
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,000
I see.

139
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,875
I'm kind of curious why you designed it

140
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,833
in this way.

141
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,583
If you look at the others,

142
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,666
virtually all of them are ultra modern.

143
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,708
[Nont chuckles]

144
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,500
- This is different.
- [man] So I put it here.

145
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,500
Is there a concept behind it?

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
[Nont] Um…

147
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,416
To be honest, there's not much to it.

148
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,291
I was reflecting on…

149
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,500
the feelings of the people
who will live on the moon.

150
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,500
How lonely they will be.

151
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,375
They'll be homesick,
missing life on Earth.

152
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,916
So I thought of a house design

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,916
where they'll feel less homesick
when they live there.

154
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,541
I guess.

155
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,250
[gentle piano music playing]

156
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,416
To tell you the truth,
there's not much to it.

157
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,041
It was for my thesis.

158
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,000
[clicks tongue] I just went
with my feelings.

159
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,083
In reality,
I doubt it could be constructed.

160
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,416
I guess.

161
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,875
It sounds crazy, doesn't it?

162
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,416
Not really.

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,375
In fact, ISA has plans to establish
permanent human residences on the moon.

164
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,250
In fact, they've been surveying
and planning for several years.

165
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,416
And the human factor
is considered one of the top priorities.

166
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,916
Because when humans go there,
the place should feel like home to them.

167
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,750
The home you envisioned
might seem a little out there.

168
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,916
My opinion is that it hits
the brief for a human habitat,

169
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,958
for those who actually go
to live on the moon.

170
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,791
[chuckles]

171
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,291
I'm nerdy.

172
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,166
I don't think so.

173
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,750
- [chuckles]
- [sighs]

174
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,333
Mmm… Well,

175
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,458
if I ever

176
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,875
get to live on the moon one day,

177
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,916
I'd like

178
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,541
to have a house that's cozy like that.

179
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,625
A real home to live in,

180
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,375
just like the one you designed.

181
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,250
[Nont] Mm. [chuckles]

182
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,083
Oh, gosh.

183
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,750
So, was your professor critical of you?

184
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,791
[chuckles] The other works
are all quite serious.

185
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,708
What do you think?

186
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,500
As you can see,
they placed my piece at the rear.

187
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,291
[chuckles]

188
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,041
Oh!

189
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,041
I'm Nont.

190
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,958
Architecture major.

191
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:26,958
I see.

192
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:28,958
I'm Noon,

193
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,416
med student.

194
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,416
I see.

195
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,541
That old rundown building.

196
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,000
[music continues to play]

197
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,875
- Yeah.
- [both chuckle]

198
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,291
- [persistent beeping]
- [muffled explosion]

199
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,291
[silence]

200
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,416
[gentle, somber music playing]

201
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,791
[sighs]

202
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,375
[computerized whir]

203
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,250
[bleep notifications play]

204
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,125
[crowd applauding, cheering]

205
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,541
[somber music playing]

206
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,541
[Nont] Let's grow old together.

207
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,125
I'll take care of you.

208
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,875
[Nont panting]

209
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,791
- Noon.
- What?

210
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,250
[Nont] Let's take a break.

211
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,750
- I'm tired.
- [Noon] Come on you're so lame.

212
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,208
- Man up.
- [Nont] Ah, give me a break. [chuckles]

213
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,333
- Come on.
- [Nont] Ah!

214
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,333
- [Noon] Let's go. Hurry up.
- You have no mercy.

215
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,458
[Noon] Come on.
It's good for your heart. Keep going.

216
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,791
- [Nont] Oh gosh.
- [Noon] Let's go. Move it.

217
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,625
- Are you okay?
- [Nont] We can try the treadmill.

218
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,208
- We got a double-yolk egg.
- [Nont] Let me see.

219
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,958
Mmm, looks appetizing,
but we eat fried eggs a lot.

220
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,458
I'm getting sick of them.
I'm craving some other round things.

221
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,625
Aren't you, Busty?

222
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,208
Other round things?
How about we have this?

223
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,166
- Noon.
- Yes.

224
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,875
- [Nont] Your friend's here.
- Who is it?

225
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,166
[gasps] Aww!

226
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,291
[Nont] Hey! [chuckles]

227
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,833
- Daddy deserves a reward. Give him a kiss.
- [Nont] No way. No kiss. No, go away.

228
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,708
[Noon] Kiss him. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.
[chuckles]

229
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,125
- Harvey! Good boy.
- [Nont] What? Harvey?

230
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,083
[Noon] Harvey.

231
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,833
- [Nont] You've named him?
- Yes.

232
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,291
- [Nont] That was fast.
- How cute.

233
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,333
[notification bleep]

234
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,750
[music continues to play]

235
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,875
[Noon] Gosh.

236
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,916
But if I go…

237
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,541
we won't get to see
each other for three years.

238
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,125
If I stay out all the way out there,

239
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,791
you'll be all alone.

240
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,083
It's not fair on you
to have to wait for me.

241
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,875
I'm not going.

242
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,791
But Noon you can't be serious.

243
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,708
ISA reached out to you personally.

244
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,125
This is a rare opportunity.

245
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,333
You should go.

246
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,291
I know you want to.

247
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,541
Hm?

248
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,250
If you don't pursue your dream,

249
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,291
I'll be unhappy as well.

250
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,541
Just go.

251
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,250
When you return,

252
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
we'll still have the rest of our lives.

253
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,625
It's only three years.

254
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,000
We'll be fine.

255
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,666
[sobbing]

256
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,708
[Noon sobbing]

257
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,541
[crying]

258
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,208
Harvey.

259
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,833
[Nont] Harvey is now in a better place.

260
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,375
[Noon sobbing]

261
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,000
[Noon crying inconsolably]

262
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,000
[dog whining]

263
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,791
[somber music playing]

264
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,208
[rewinding notification]

265
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,916
[Nont] I'll buy you a new one.
Harvey is now in a better place.

266
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,708
[Noon continues to sob]

267
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,791
[Nont] Harvey is now in a better place.

268
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,916
[tape stops]

269
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:10,083
[female voice over PA] Welcome
to Sheep Happens, where cloning is caring.

270
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,500
Using ingenious AI technology

271
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,875
to control the CRISPR
gene editing process.

272
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,708
A technology owned by Sheep Happens.

273
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,833
We can, in this way, assure

274
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,666
that your beloved pets
will come back to life

275
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,041
with 100% of their original memories.

276
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,416
- [man] Hey there. Do you remember me?
- [man 2] Welcome back.

277
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,208
Any problems, bring it back here, anytime.

278
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,458
[man] Tank, do you remember
your daddy, Tank?

279
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,708
[man 2] How you doing?

280
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,416
[whirring]

281
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,000
[woman] Nont?

282
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,583
Are you here to get Harvey vaccinated?

283
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,666
How are you coping?

284
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,791
Are you feeling better?

285
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,791
I came today

286
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,333
to ask you for a favor.

287
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,791
What is it?

288
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,958
[electronic swish]

289
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,625
[footsteps approaching]

290
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:31,250
[woman] Excuse me, Dr. Vee,
the Siamese cat-cloning trial has failed.

291
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,166
[Vee] How could it?

292
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,416
- [footsteps receding]
- [electronic swish]

293
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,625
I want you to clone Noon.

294
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,125
[tense music playing]

295
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,416
Nont.

296
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,458
This isn't something to joke about.

297
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,666
I'm not joking, Vee.

298
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,708
I mean it.

299
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,791
You do know
that human cloning is illegal, right?

300
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,041
I do know that, but--

301
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,583
How much would it cost
to make a clone of Noon?

302
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,041
- Just give me the number.
- Noon. Noon, Noon, Noon.

303
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,000
Get a grip.

304
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,625
Look. I can understand how upset you are

305
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,416
because you just lost Noon.

306
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,875
But how could you be certain that Noon
would agree to what you're suggesting.

307
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,458
I'm sure she'd be okay with it.

308
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,416
Her research focused
on printing 3D hearts.

309
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,666
Her view was
that human body parts are replaceable.

310
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,791
You know that.

311
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,083
Did you see the news?

312
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:50,000
On the news, everyone was grieving
the loss of her talent.

313
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,208
What she was working on, if it succeeds,
could help so many millions of people.

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,708
What reason would anyone have
not to bring Noon back?

315
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,916
You're a scientist, just like her.

316
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,000
You understand, don't you?

317
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,541
Didn't you tell Noon?

318
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,875
That you didn't want to stop
at dog and cat cloning?

319
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,791
[music continues to play]

320
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,250
I can't help you with this.

321
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,458
[music fading]

322
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,375
[sighs deeply]

323
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,750
You still remember Noon's question…
about the doctor and the criminal?

324
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,791
My answer remains the same.

325
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,416
As I gave her that day.

326
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,333
[sighs]

327
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,583
[Noon] Imagine you're a surgeon…

328
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,375
about to treat another doctor,

329
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,250
and they've had
a congestion heart failure.

330
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,375
This doctor is a genius,

331
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:41,916
well-liked and has saved countless lives.

332
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,208
There's only one viable
treatment option for this doctor,

333
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:50,708
which is an emergency heart transplant

334
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,833
to be done right away.

335
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,416
But at the same time, it just so happens

336
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,916
that a suspected murderer
is shot by police and sent to you.

337
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:04,000
His heart would take
if it was to be transplanted

338
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,500
directly into the doctor.

339
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,708
What would you do?

340
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,083
Who's inclined to save the doctor?

341
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,583
Show of hands.

342
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,083
[crowd murmuring softly]

343
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,958
You, sir, what do you say?

344
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,625
Where do you stand?

345
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:38,500
Well… that doctor is a lovely,
and a hero, like you are as well.

346
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,833
So helping the doctor is a no-brainer.

347
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,166
[audience laughs softly]

348
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,500
Don't get mad. It's a joke.

349
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,583
Um… I'd probably want to save the doctor.

350
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:56,875
Because they are obviously more capable
and knowledgeable than I am.

351
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,500
If you save the doctor,

352
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,958
they could continue to live on

353
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,208
and then make the world better.

354
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,458
[audience applauding]

355
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,666
Okay, right?

356
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:13,291
In fact, this conundrum
is actually a classic one.

357
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,666
No answer is fully wrong or fully right.

358
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:22,333
Wouldn't it be better
not to have to decide

359
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,708
which one to save?

360
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,833
[crowd murmuring]

361
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,916
3D organ printing…

362
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
[music sting]

363
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,833
…is an idea conceived
to tackle this very issue.

364
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:36,833
[crowd gasping]

365
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,250
The 3D-printed heart
is made from the patients own cells,

366
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:45,875
which means, one,
a donor is not necessary.

367
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,000
The patient's not
waiting for a donor to die.

368
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,708
Two, we know for sure

369
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:55,250
that the created heart
will be compatible with the patient

370
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,625
and will not be rejected,

371
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,291
because it's grown from their own body.

372
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,125
Organ printing is not an original idea.

373
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,458
But no one has, as yet, succeeded.

374
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,333
This is because when we print an organ,

375
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:14,000
The gravity of earth
presses down on the cells

376
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,208
causing them to grow in a flat shape.

377
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,958
Because of this,
they are unable to assemble into 3D.

378
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:23,250
And now, after a five-year study,

379
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:27,458
we are able to test
the bioprinter in outer space,

380
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,583
to test if these organs can be created,

381
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,833
then how we successfully make
it work back on earth.

382
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:40,958
I must honestly say
I am very excited about our discoveries.

383
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:45,000
And this time,
our hard work will be a success.

384
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,041
This journey

385
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,375
will give humanity
breakthroughs and glimpses

386
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,125
into an entirely new world.

387
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,250
I trust that.

388
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,791
[audience applauding, cheering]

389
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,000
[somber music playing]

390
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,083
[Noon] You want
the cloning to work, don't you?

391
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,333
Keep at it.

392
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,083
[Vee] It's so difficult.

393
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,375
Hey. If I can pull it off,

394
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,833
I'm going to make
ten clones of Ryan Reynolds.

395
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,875
As if the clone would be into you.

396
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:38,708
I can modify his genes
to make him attracted to me.

397
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,166
[both chuckle]

398
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,000
Get back to work.

399
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,375
Hurry. Dream big, and make it happen.

400
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,125
Vee.

401
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,875
If that criminal could save the doctor…

402
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,916
then I would want to be that criminal.

403
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,333
Do you get what I'm saying?

404
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,666
I might know the procedure.

405
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,458
But I've never cloned a human being.

406
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,625
I cannot guarantee that it'll work, Nont.

407
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,666
Hm.

408
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,458
[upbeat, tense music playing]

409
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,166
[chimes]

410
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,458
[Nont] Hello, Mom.

411
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:45,791
[Vee] Noon's family had her body
cryogenically preserved, right?

412
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,583
[Nont] That's right.

413
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,000
[Vee] You need to get
her parent's permission

414
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,041
to transfer her body to our lab.

415
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,000
That way, we'll be able
to extract her brain.

416
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:56,916
Her brain?

417
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,291
We're talking about memories

418
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,291
before we start cloning her.

419
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,791
We need to get hold
of the memories in her brain.

420
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,916
This is so we can transfer
the data to the clone

421
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,708
and bring the old Noon back.

422
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,458
[tense music continues to play]

423
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,500
That's absurd.

424
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,208
Do you even know what you're saying?

425
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,083
Yes, I know, sir.

426
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,750
I know that cloning is presently illegal.

427
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,291
But Noon's expertise

428
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,583
could help millions of people.

429
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,375
Don't you feel it's a waste?

430
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,458
Last year, a lab overseas

431
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,875
attempted human cloning.

432
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,958
- It produced something hideous.
- [Noon] I'm aware of that.

433
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,541
But there's also a chance it will succeed.
You know that.

434
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,791
What if it fails, Nont?

435
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,125
How many dogs had to die
to successfully create one clone.

436
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,541
[breathes in]

437
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,416
Then we'll try again.

438
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,041
And again, if necessary.

439
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:09,500
[Noon's father] What?

440
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,291
You'll kill Noon over and over.

441
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:17,250
- She's not a guinea pig. She's my--
- No, that's not my intention, sir.

442
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,666
Noon is in a better place now.

443
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,333
She's paid back all her karma.

444
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,791
Just let her go.

445
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,458
But, ma'am, I think…

446
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,583
that isn't a consideration.

447
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,125
We should consider
your crazy cloning notion.

448
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,166
Her soul is on a journey
to a higher realm,

449
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,916
a better place.

450
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:46,666
Why would you want to drag her
back here to suffer?

451
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,750
Did having
a world-class scientist for a daughter

452
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,458
make you any less blinded by religion.

453
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,541
[Noon's father] Listen.

454
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:05,791
Watch what you say.

455
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,458
- Blinded nonsense.
- What's ascending to a higher realm?

456
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,916
What is heaven and hell?

457
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,625
Do they even exist?

458
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:17,416
Is there even any proof?
What century are we living in?

459
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,333
- Nont.
- Those are the beliefs…

460
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,416
- That make you blind to reason.
- [loud bang]

461
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,458
- You've gone too far.
- I don't think I have, sir.

462
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,708
- What will become of her work.
- I said no, and I meant it.

463
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,458
What about Noon's dreams?
They're real too.

464
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:35,375
More real than what you're saying.
Why don't you want to bring her back?

465
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:36,291
Stop arguing.

466
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,500
You have no say
when it comes to my daughter.

467
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,708
I do! I'm her goddamn husband.

468
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,916
[Noon's mother in shaky voice]
Nont, if you really love her…

469
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,791
please, let her go.

470
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,708
I beg you.

471
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,125
[Nont panting]

472
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,208
Do you think I don't love her?

473
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,875
Are you sure it's me who doesn't?

474

00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:43,083
- To Ratana Hospital.
- [electronic male voice] Received.

[high-tension music playing]

480
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,208
[Nont] I'd like to request
that my wife's body be transferred.

481
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,208
I'm relocating to another province.
I'd like the body there for the funeral.

482
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,291
I'm sorry, sir.

483
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:19,250
- It's out of office hours. We're closed.
- You're closed?

484
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:23,250
Isn't it only 7 p.m.?
Don't you normally close at 8?

485
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,333
We closed early today.

486

[Nont sighs]

487
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,125
Um, but I'm leaving here tomorrow.

488
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,083
Can you help me out?

489
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,708
I'm sorry, sir,
all of our staff have gone home.

490
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:38,250
- Can I pop in quickly to see my wife then?
- You can't.

491
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,083
Not even for a brief visit,
say 5 or 10 minutes?

Hey. You fucking with me?

00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,916
You keep saying no to all my questions!

496
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,416
Are you married?

497
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:54,041
Imagine it was your wife who was dead.
How would you feel?

498
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,166
- Security get in here!
- Hey, come on!

499
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,125
Hands off!

500
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:01,958
Don't touch me.

501
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,625
All right. All right.

502
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,083
I apologize. I'm sorry.

503
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:08,125
I just lost my head a bit.
I want to go in there. I want to see my--

504
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,416
- You should leave.
- Hey!

505
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:11,666
I said I'm sorry.

506
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,083
What more do you want?

507
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,000
What the fuck are you staring at?
I said sorry. Now let me in!

508
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,500
How much do you want?
You tell me. I'll wire it to you.

509
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,208
Go on. How much do you want? Huh?

510
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,291
- How much?
- Let's go.

511
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,833
- Who the fuck are you?
- Come on.

512
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,916
- Damn it! Let go of me!
- I said come with us.

513
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,833
]Nont] Shit.

514
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,958
I'm only asking
that you let me in briefly to see my wife.

515
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,250
- You'd better watch your back! Let go.
- Come on.

516
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,875
[Nont] Fucking let go of me!

517
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,291
Let go of me!

518
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,208
I'm a customer.
Is this how you treat your customers?

519

[grunts]

520
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,375
If you keep this up,
we will call the police.

521
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,625
Go right ahead.

522
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,666
[man over phone] Mr Nont
showed up here demanding to see Dr Noon

523
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,791
as you predicted.

524
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,416
The guy sure is stubborn.

525
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,291
Next time, I don't think I'll be able
to turn him away using the same excuse.

526
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,750
[Noon's father] I've decided
we'll no longer keep the body 100 days.

527
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,916
Tomorrow, I'm going to move
the body to the temple

528
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,291
and proceed with the cremation.

529
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,291
[man] Yes, Sir.

This vaccine is a new one from America.

Everyone wants it.
It's not cheap, you know?

536
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,375
I don't want an injection.

537
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:32,916
You don't know what they'll put into you.
They fill you with bacteria.

538
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:36,291
And if I die, how will you manage?

539
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,833
You'll be okay, Mom.
This is the way things are.

540
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:42,250
You've been on Tiktok again.
You need to put your cell away.

541
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:47,750
You turned yourself into a monster. Fine.
Go and get jabbed, but no jab for me.

[Vee] I told you to get
permission from her family,

00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,750
Not-- Not for you to…

582
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,541
Did you ever think what would happen
if you got caught?

583
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,583
You said it yourself…

584
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,083
that we needed her brain.

585
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,041
Do you really think what I just did…

586
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,833
was it easy to pull off?

You do what you have to do.

589
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,458
I'll take care of the rest.

590
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,166
You don't need to worry.

591
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,083
I'm not worried for myself.
I'm more worried about you.

592
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,750
If I didn't do it today…

593
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,125
it would never stop haunting me.

594
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,583
I beg you.

595
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:31,791

And that'll be it.

602
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:08,875
The brain of a dead person
is extremely fragile.

603
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:12,166
Every attempt to extract
the detail of the memories

604
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,041
can cause irreparable damage
to the neurons.

605
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,583
Because of this inherent danger,
we only have one shot at this.

606

- Hm.

Conflicts?

630
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,291
The AI is trying
to categorize the memories.

631
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,958
When it detects an inconsistency,
it sends out a notification.

632
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:45,083
For example, Noon worked as a doctor,
as well as an astronaut.

633
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,958
The AI is trying to judge
to whether both memories are accurate.

634
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:52,916
Our job is to confirm that both are true.

635
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:02,958
We don't normally come across this
when we work with a pet's brain.

636
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:07,541
With a human brain,
we have a complex memory system.

00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:11,416
Does that mean

638
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,083
we have to be on standby
to verify the information?

639
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,000
Correct.

[male voice] Hello.

716
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,375
I'm Nont.

What's up, Vee?

720
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:54,958
I'm on my way.

721
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,333
What happened, Vee?

722
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:58,958
Why have you stopped?

00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,458

Warning. Information incoherent.

727
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,583
What's this?

728
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:15,208
Noon was reading
about sex reassignment surgery.

729
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,416
What's so strange?

730
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:20,500
She wanted to be a doctor.

731
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:27,041
Well, this episode took place
about 13 years ago when she was 19.

732
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,125
Just keep watching, and you'll understand.

[giggles]

738
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,916
- It needs styling, though.
- Hm.

739
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,625
I can't believe you did it.

740
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,958
You're too much, really.

741
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,166
Come on.

742
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,958
Everyone goes through this in their teens.

743
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:56,875
Isn't it normal?

744
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,875
What you're seeing in her brain

745
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:05,875
is something carefully tucked away
in her deep memory.

746
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,291
The red dots, you can see all over,

747
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,666
are a clear indicator that these feelings
don't just come and go.

748
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:15,875
They represent
her core beliefs and her true self.

749
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,958
How can you tell
that the system hasn't misinterpreted it?

[Nont sighs]

753
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:43,583
[Vee] Piecing together her memory
fragments is like solving a jigsaw puzzle.

754
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:47,708
The AI tries to identify
the problematic pieces,

755
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,958
Then it protects them
and does a work around

756
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,666
to build a memory duplicate
faithful to hers.

757
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:57,000
This clearly shows
that there's no error in the assembly.

758
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:59,041
There are two underlying images here.

I (MR. / MRS. / MISS)

00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:24,083
[Noon] I've decided I'm going to tell Mom.

761
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,083
Mom.

Mom, please say something.

764

You understand me, don't you?

765
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,958
[girl] Just put it on.
You don't have to wear it for long!

766
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,875
- Please, Noon…
- [doors open]

767
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:54,833
Or--

768
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:01,041
You will wear this dress.

769
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:04,583
[Noon] I don't want
to wear that dress, Dad.

770
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,625
Dad, please, don't hurt her.

[Noon's father] All I want is
for my daughter to be a normal girl,

772
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:18,916
not a freak like this.

773
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,458
Why?

774
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,250
Didn't I raise you well?

775
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:29,833
Dad.

You can be anything

Can you do this one thing for me?

[in a broken voice] Can I have
my daughter back? My little girl.

[Vee] Noon's obsession with science

792
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,375
was a healing distraction

793
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,416
as she focused on her new goal.

794
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:41,333

[Vee] Are you really not going
to date Tor?

You spend all day in this lab?

797
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,083
You should live a little.

798
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,500
So what? I like working.

799
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,416
I can't be bothered with other stuff.

800
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,875
You want the cloning to work, don't you?

00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,208
Keep at it.

Hm.

00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,791
You shouldn't have to just because of dad.

At least…

807
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,875

Why do I feel like I've been deceived?

822
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:30,791

[sobbing]

829
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:35,000
I was reflecting on the feelings
of those people who will live on the moon.

830
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,583
How lonely they'll be.

831
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:38,541
So I thought of a house design

832
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,541
where they'll feel less homesick
when they live there.

833
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,458
Well,

834
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:48,791
if I ever get to live on the moon one day,

835
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,583
I'd like

836
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:54,333
to have a house that's cozy like that.

837
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,625
A real home to live in.

838
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,166
Just like the one you designed.

839
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:07,125
[pensive music playing]

840
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:11,000
[Vee] Didn't you say
that you loved her and missed her?

841
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,208
You were even willing to risk your life.

842
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:16,916
Why have you suddenly started
questioning her love for you?

843
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,250
Thinking Noon had deceived you.

844
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,416
I don't believe she did.

845
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,583
So, be honest with me.

846
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:37,000
What's so good about Noon?
How did he win you over?

847
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:40,625
Well, it is time to settle down.

848
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,333
You serious?

849
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,208
Don't be silly.
Tell me the truth. I want to know.

850
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:48,208
Hm…

851
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,375
Well… when I'm with him,

852
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:53,166
he doesn't expect anything of me.

853
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,625
He makes me feel at ease,

854
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:58,333
and I can just be myself.

855
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:01,708
[chuckles softly]

856
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,250
This may sound simplistic.

857
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,375
But I'm genuinely at ease.

858
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,291
[Vee] She was just born different.

859
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,083
Simply swapping one chromosome,

860
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,333
from an X to a Y,

861
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,083
would make her a man
like she'd always wanted.

862
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,750
People who are born

863
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:26,833
with body dysphoria

864
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:29,500
they have struggles.

865
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,666
It's as if…

866
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,041
they're without a home.

[gentle, pensive music playing]

868
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,708
[Vee] She was looking for someone…

869
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,541
who felt like home to her.

870
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:59,041
You were just that person.

871
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:03,583
The guy who wanted
to build a wood cabin on the moon.

872
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,375
The one she always talked about.

873
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,708
[Noon's sister] You won't be living
in misery for the rest of your life?

874
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,083
I won't.

875
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,500
Being with Nont I know I'll be happy.

876
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,708

Listen to me carefully.

888
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,375
The police are here to arrest me.

889
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,583
Wait. What are you talking about?

890
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:28,125
I don't have much time.

891
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,000
Listen carefully.

892
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,458
Stop cloning her.

893
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:36,958
I understand.

894
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,041
[panting]

895
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:45,000
Stop cloning her.

896
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,083
As I want her to be.

897
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,625
[gasps]

898
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,625
I want you to clone her…

899
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,250
the way that she wanted to be.

900
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,166
You can do that.

901
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,500
[somber music playing]

902
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:11,791
[Nont exhales]

903
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:15,666
You said you just change
X to Y chromosomes.

904
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:20,791
Yeah, that's right, just change X to Y.

905
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,666
[breathing shakily]

906
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,916
Please, relay this message to Noon.

907
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,708
[breathes in]

908
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:46,625
Tell her to be herself.

909
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,000
[sobbing]

910
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,250
Go be yourself, Noon.

911
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,791
I love you, Noon.

912
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,583
[man] Freeze. Don't move!

913
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,375
[man 2] Get up!

914
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
[Nont] This is as far
as I'm allowed to go.

915
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,916
I hope your journey from here…

916
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,791
is full of wonder and joy.

917
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,625
May you accomplish
all that you set out to achieve.

918
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:57,333
[upbeat pop music playing]

919
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,375
[exhales]

920
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:33,000
Allow me…

921
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,458
to use the name Nont.

922
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,750
[somber music playing]

923
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,000
How are you doing?

924
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,500
Are you adjusting all right?

925
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:56,958
And…

926
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:00,000
how have you been spending time?

927
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,250
Does anyone know?

928
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:03,083
- That you're…
- Slow down, Nont.

929
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:07,000
How do you expect me
to answer all these questions?

930
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,416
[exhales]

931
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,791
Right now,
I'm back doing research on heart printing.

932
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:32,750
And also, ISA has provided funding.

933
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:38,416
So I'm considering
branching out into other organ research.

934
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:40,916
Ah.

935
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,000
Is that space research?

936
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:47,666
We're now able to clone humans.
Why go to space just to print organs?

937
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,083
If your body is a house,

938
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,250
your organs are like the decor.

939
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,416
If a chair is broken,

940
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,291
then you make a new chair.

941
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,958
You don't need a new house.

942
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,166
Um… did ISA do a background check on you?

943
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,250
Mm.

944
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,583
I told them the truth.

945
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,000
- Uh?
- Well…

946
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:16,958
It's ISA.

947
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:20,666
If you're going to work for them,
they're going to screen you.

948
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,291
So I decided to be honest.

949
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:28,875
They've already taken care
of my new identity and all the paperwork.

950
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:30,916
Hm.

951
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,541
I'm very glad.

952
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,375
That they understood.

953
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,083
They're progressive,

954
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,666
though they had one condition.

955
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:48,708
I had to join the first lunar
colonization program.

956
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,375
I leave in three months.

957
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,500
Another spaceship.

958
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:11,666
Aren't you afraid?

959
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,375
[snorts]

960
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,708
[Nont sobbing] Go be yourself, Noon.

961
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:45,458
I love you, Noon.

962
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:52,000
[Noon's clone] Someone once said
that fear will kill our ability

963
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,625
to make new discoveries.

964
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,666
Whereas courage

965
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:59,208
will make sure we are remembered
long after we have departed this world.

966
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,916
I'm grateful for your courage, Nont.

967
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,041
In the future,

968
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:16,000
if you do something for someone else,

969
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,625
make sure you consult them.

970
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:21,791
You can put yourself first sometimes.

971
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:23,750
Whoa!

972
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,375
Your punch has gotten stronger.

973
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,458
[both chuckle]

974
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:34,708
You mentioned…

975
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,916
permanent lunar colonization.

976
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:48,541
Does that mean…

977
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,375
we'll never get to see each other again.

978
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:03,666
We can always enjoy
a video call if we're lonely.

979
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,375
Or perhaps you can save up
for a trip to the moon.

980
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:13,541
Or if not…

981
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,833
we'll see each other in memories.

982
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,416
[upbeat, rock music playing]

983
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:21,958
[Noon] Thank you.

984
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,375
There's no one else in this world,

985
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,666
other than you,
who would just let me be myself.

[music fading]

988
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,083
So this is what having…

989
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,708
a family is about.

990

[music ends]

991
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,958
[interviewer] Doctor Nont,
what do you have to say

992
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:22,791
about the organ printing project
you've been running the last five years?

993
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:26,833
[Noon's clone] The last five years
have proven to be quite successful.

994
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:31,333
We now have the capability
to print hearts, kidneys, and spleens.

995
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:36,125
At present, we're transitioning
to even more complex organs,

996
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,166
such as, an eye, for instance.

997
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,166
That is indeed wonderful news.

998
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,541
But this has come at the cost
of you having to relocate to the moon.

999
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:48,625
How's it been living there for so long?

1000
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:53,166
Do you miss your life on Earth?
Do you miss your home?

1001
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:01,291
Doctor Nont.

1002
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:03,583
Doctor Nont?

1003
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:05,666
Uh, the signal.

1004
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,750
Do I miss my home?

1005
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,166
I do miss it sometimes.

1006
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:21,666
Someone taught me
that as long as you have love,

1007
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,708
and understanding,

1008
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,375
any place could be your home.

[somber music playing]

1010
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,833
[interviewer] Wow, that's quite a quote.

1011
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,541
[Vee] I'm really happy for Noon.

1012
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:43,541
[interviewer] I wonder
who that special person is.

1013
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:46,041
She's finally managed to fulfil her dream.

1014
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:47,541
Hm.

1015
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:52,416
What Noon does is helpful
to a great deal of people.

1016
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:57,291
But there's no place

1017
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,333
for black sheep in this world.

1018
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,333
Some day, Nont.

1019
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,208
Someday.

1020
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:11,708
Hm.

1021
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,416
Let's go. Keep running. Come on.

1022
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,541
Don't ask me to join you next time.
I'm exhausted.

1023
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:19,875
Oh, come on, Vee.

1024
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,791
Even though our body parts
are replaceable,

1025
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:25,708
we still need to take care of ourselves.

1026
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,416
Let's go.
Less time in the lab, more exercise.

1027
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,041
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Go, go!

1028
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:33,500
I know Noon sent you a new arm.
I think I like the old one better.

1029
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,125

1030
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:37,750

just order one, Arnie.
