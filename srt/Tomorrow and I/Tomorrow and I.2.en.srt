Gamalore City has now opened.

but I'm very curious.

38
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,958
Tell me, why Paradise X?

39
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,500
- You really need to ask?
- Mm.

40
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,583
But it's obvious, isn't it?
Paradise, means heavenly.

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,958
I'm not sure you're following me.
[chuckles]

42
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,041
- That's ok.
- Hmm.

43
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,333
Let me explain.

44
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,541
When I say heavenly, right…

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,791
Do you know what I mean?

46
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,083
Well, have you ever gone to heaven?

[whimsical tune plays]

00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,833

- You mean… intimacy?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

50
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,000
[TV host] Oh… okay.

51
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,125
I mean a kind of pleasure
that's unearthly.

52
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:55,083
All our products provide our customers
with other worldly pleasures.

53
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,958
What would you call that
other than paradise.

54
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,166
Huh?

55
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,916
Okay. Uh… that's all we have time for.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,416
Thank you, Jessica Harthihill,
CEO of Paradise X,

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,000
the start-up projected
to be our country's next unicorn.

58
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,416
Excuse me.
Did you even listen to what I said?

59
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,750
I heard exactly what you said.

60
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,125
[Jess scoffs]

61
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,916
I just wonder

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,250
why someone with your education

63
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,666
isn't doing something
more beneficial for our country.

64
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:32,958
Hm.

65
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,750
I think you'll have
better luck with your pitch elsewhere.

66
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,333
Because at right wing,

67
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,958
if we're going to invest in a project,

68
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,541
it needs to align with our moral values.

[movie tape buzzing]

70
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,958
Mr. Chairman, are you ready?

71
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,166
I'm more than ready, Miss Jess.

Ah!

Hey!

86
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,500
Careful with that.

87
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:05,833
We wouldn't want me to blow
my load immediately, would we? [chuckles]

88
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,583
There's no need to worry.

89
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,291
I can prevent premature ejaculation.

Are you kidding me? Oh…

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,666
Take your time, Chairman.

92
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,166
We'll talk more later.

93
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,541

your transformative innovation.

That's good to hear.

98
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,708
Oh, Mr. Chairman.

99
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,416
I've had one of those models
delivered to your residence.

100
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,833
I hope that you remember
my generosity this Monday.

101
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,583
Don't you worry.

[car engine starts]

103
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,458
[woman] Be careful
dealing with these people.

104
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,291
They'll say anything
to get what they want.

105
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,875
You should always try to get
an agreement in writing.

[Jess] The U.S. exports military robots.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Germany exports medical robots.

111
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,958
So I started thinking, what can we do?

112
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,250
What is it we do best?

113
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,708
Hence, the sex robots.

114
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:44,291
Yeah, and who knows sex
better than a native of Gamalore?

115
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,250
Mm.

116
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,583
I'm told that you finished
high school at the age of 12.

117
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,583
And you graduated MTT

118
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,791
as the youngest person
on record to receive a degree.

119
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,833
Two degrees.

120
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,833
- What's that?
- I graduated with two degrees.

121
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,000
My mom likes to joke
that when I was two days old,

122
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,333
I started writing down lottery numbers.

123
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,583
[chuckles]

124
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,250
- You were a child prodigy, it seems.
- [chuckles]

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,750
- Speaking of your mom…
- Yeah.

126
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:17,333
Uh, I'm told that, is this correct,
that your mother was a…

127
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,250
- That she was a sex worker?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,291
People knew me
as the call-girl's daughter.

129
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,833
And how did that make you feel?

130
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,500
Are you asking if I was embarrassed by it?

131
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,333
Not at all. I was proud of it.

132
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,500
A lot of my school friends
grew up just like I did.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,458
My mother worked hard to provide for us
and manage to afford a good education.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,041
Without her, Jessica Harthihill,

135
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,125
graduate of MTT,

136
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,083
the CEO of Paradise X, wouldn't exist.

137
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,458
Previous governments and politicians,

138
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,000
who have made attempts to…

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,583
to legalize prostitution…

140
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,125
But no one has passed legislation.
What are your thoughts on the matter?

141
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,208
This country won't even admit
that we have a sex industry.

142
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,291
My business supplies
what our customers ask for.

143

[upbeat music playing]

144
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,666
How will your sex robots compete
with the Japanese models?

145
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,166
With the spirit of Gamalore.

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,666
[camera shutters click]

147
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,958
I've spent over a decade
gathering the data.

148
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,583
We've researched every variable
of customer satisfaction.

149
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,750
The data were used
to construct a generative AI,

150
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,375
capable of learning
and responding to the needs of the user,

151
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,208
as well as any human can.

152
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,666
Factors we considered
included sexual position.

153
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,750
- [music continues]
- [gentle bleeping]

Little details like word choice
and body language.

156
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,833
Expressions and techniques.

157
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,458
- [all moaning in pleasure]
- Oh, yeah, just like that!

158
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,041
- No, no, no, no!
- Oh… yes!

159
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,291
[laughs]

160
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,083
Why don't we try level five?

161
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,708
- [woman] Huh?
- I want you to feel this one.

162
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,375
Sure, Miss Jessica.

163
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll tap into my fondest memories

164
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,083
from back when the G.I.s
were stationed on our shores.

165
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,250
- I used to orgasm in five minutes.
- Okay. [chuckles]

166
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,375
If you want me to get to that level,

167
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,375
you gotta be hung like a horse! [giggles]

168
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,375
[neighing]

169
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:49,000
It sounds to me like you've had
sex with a horse! [laughs]

170
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,333
- Hey, Nuchy.
- What is it?

171
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,416
- You can act like you're a proper lady.
- I am a proper lady!

172
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,958
But I've seen you working
your hand and your mouth.

173
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:01,166
- [all moaning] Oh, oh, no, no, no!
- No. Don't stop now!

174
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,166
But it hasn't all been plain sailing.

175
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,708
We can't make them look
exactly like a human.

176
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:14,041
But what we lack, we make up with spirit.

177
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,666
You're already starting to feel it.

178
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,041
Am I right?

179
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,375
[music sting]

180
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,625
[clears throat]

181
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,333
Uh…

182
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,208
Aren't you concerned that your sex robots

183
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,083
will take jobs from human sex workers?

184
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:38,208
[chuckles] But, Mr. Q, we don't have
prostitution in this country.

185
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,666
There's no need to fear
our sex robots taking jobs.

186
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,416
It's a product like many others
with updates to firmware.

187
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
We need to add functions, new tricks,
new positions to our sex robots.

188
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,666
And who could be better
at training sex robots

189
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,750
than the professionals.

190
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,291
I'd like to welcome our new employees
from all around the country.

191
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,041
Welcome to Paradise!

192
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
[cheering, applauding]

193
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,625
[rock music playing]

194
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,791
Let's show the world!

195
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,750
That we have dignity!

196
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,500
The times of insulting us,

197
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,166
degrading us, and questioning our worth,

198
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,125
are over.

199
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,000
This is the dawn of a new age.

200
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,875
Join me in changing
this country for the better.

201
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,750
- [music rising]
- [cheering]

202
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,333
[phone ringing to the rhythm of music]

203
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,625
[Jess] Nobody will be out of work.

204
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,250
They'll be making more money.

205
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:55,166
They' ll have social security
and all of the benefits

206
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,916
that the government won't provide.

207
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,625
[music continues]

208
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,083
We are the genuine article.

209
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,291
Let's work together

210
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,500
to bring more pleasure to the world.

211
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,750
[music peaks, fades]

212
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,791
[slurping noisily]

00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,375
[mechanical whirring, slurping]

214
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,333
No, not like that.

215
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,166
You need to be more deliberate.

216
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,000
[slurping noisily]

217
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,833
Switch up your speed.

218
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,500
If it goes at that speed,
it won't work, Kendo.

219
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,875
Uh, got it. [chuckles]

220
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,375
Hm-mm. Okay.

221
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,458
[bleeping notifications]

222
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,958
[mechanical whirring, slurping]

223
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,333
Your reputation
is well-earned, Lady Suzie.

224
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,750
Mm. Fantastic!

225
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,458
[Lady Suzie] Ah, hello, Miss Jess!

226
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,583
Good to see you.

227
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,375
[Lady Suzie] You're just in time.

228
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,833
We were just about to do
a test run on Model V.

229
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,125
[Jess' assistant] Ooh!

230
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,583
Witt.

231
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,041
Wanna try it?

232
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,541
It's finally happening.

233
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,708
Of course, Miss Jess.

234
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,625
[Jess] Hm.

235
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,916
[Jess' assistant gasps]

236
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,583
[chuckles]

237
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,625
[girls squealing]

238
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,750
Hey!

239
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,416
Pay attention. Hm?

240
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,458
Kendo, show me what you got.

241
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,458
[mechanical whirring]

242
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,541
Oh! Put your back into it. Yeah!

243
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,500
Pay attention.

244
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,791
[bleeping notifications]

245
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,083

247
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,750
[mechanical slurping]

248
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,083
[bleeping]

249
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,541
[whirring]

250
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,500
Uh… [sighs]

251
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,416
Stop. This is not what we discussed.

252
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,500
She's supposed
to climb on top and grind on his dick.

253
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,166
- Understand?
- Mm. Yep, I'm on it.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,041
Slower.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,291
Work those hips.

256
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,625
Speed up.

257
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,291
- Keep going.
- Mm?

258
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,833
Lady Suzie, that's it. Tell him. Tell him.

259
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,791
The grinding will give him a boner,
but she has to keep up the grinding.

260
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,791
Press down on him harder.

261
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,583
[mechanical whirring]

262
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,000
[gasps] His heart rate! It's increasing.

263
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,625
We need to adjust the robot sensors
to get a reading from the arms.

264
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,833
The arms have a lot of sweat glands.

265
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,375
- Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah.
- They'll give a good read.

266
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,708
All right, back to it.

267
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,333
More sensual. Rub his arm gently.

268
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,875
- [Jess' assistant] Mmm.
- Yeah.

269
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,208
That's it, just like that.

270
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,291
- Uh. Keep a steady rhythm.
- Ah.

271
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,208
Push down work those hips.

272
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,083
- Hey, you're into it. You wanna keep her?
- [Lady Suzie] Harder. Faster.

273
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,083
Don't stop.

274
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,625
[Jess' assistant] He's close.

275
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:25,208
Miss Jessica, there is
this one little trick I wanna try.

276
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:29,750
Trust me, [chuckles]
…it'll be the piss of resistance.

277
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,250
Piece de resistance?

278
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,166
[music sting]

279
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,208
Uh… that's what I meant. That's it.

280
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,250
- You wanna see it?
- Do it. Yeah, go ahead.

281
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,041
[drumroll]

282
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,875
- [whimsical music playing]
- Hm. Whoa! Damn!

283
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,000
[gasping]

284
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,375
Oh shit!

285
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,250
[mechanical whirring]

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,500
[cheering]

287
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,583
[music continues to play]

289
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,166
Ooh! [laughs]

290
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,458
[exclaims in surprise, chuckles]

291
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,500
Whoa!

292
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,875
[music fades]

293
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,125
- [Jess' assistant laughs]
- [Witt] Wow!

294
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,625
It can do more than that.

295
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,125
I have prepared a surprise
for our customers.

296
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,958
- [gasps]
- Guaranteed to satisfy.

297
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:17,958
Do it, Kendo.

298
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,583
[beeping notifications]

299
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,875

[all exclaiming in surprise]

302
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,625
Ooh!

303
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,541
Ooh!

304
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,041
- [Lady Suzie] Oh, fuck. Wow.
- [Jess' assistant laughs]

305
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,166
Ah! Yes.

306
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,916
- [waves crashing gently]
- [birds chirping]

307
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,333
[ambient music playing]

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,625
[male newsreader] Today, the Minister
of Arts and Modern Lifestyles Control

309
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,125
spoke of her concerns
regarding Jessica Harthihill,

310
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,416
CEO of Paradise X.

311
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,166
Who has advocated
for investment in sex robots.

312
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,333
[woman] It's an insult to all women,
and it won't be tolerated.

313
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,791
We're currently attempting
to pass legislation

314
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,625
that will outlaw sex acts
between humans and robots.

315
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't turn it off. It's amusing.

316
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,291
Baby, they're a bunch of fossils.

317
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,166
Don't let them get to you.

318
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,083
All right?

319
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,375
Hey, take a look at this.

320
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,000
This is the self-driving car I mentioned.
It costs 80 million.

321
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,708
Look. It's totally worth it.

322
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,083
Can I get one for my birthday?

323
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,750
Since the Progressives
first legalized sex robots,

324
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:01,166
our beautiful culture
has been infected with perversity.

325
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,833
[newsreader] Ms. Gemina,
what does the government think of--

326
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,958
Don't look at that.

327
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,791
See this one? Jazzy red.
Your favorite color.

328
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,958
She's nuts.

329
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,333
I pay my taxes,
and I generate income for this country.

330
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,875
What the hell do they want?

331
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,875
When will we be rid of these dinosaurs?

332
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:24,541
Look. [sighs] Don't let it stress you out.
Who cares what they think?

333
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,375
Sex work is a crime,

334
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,125
so I created those robots as a substitute.

335
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,250
[footsteps approaching]

336
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,708
[grunts]

337
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,791
What's that look for?

338
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,625
Well, the right wing corporation
declined the investment opportunity.

339
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,000
They said it doesn't match their values.

340
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,250
The chairman expressed
his gratitude for the prototype.

341
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,791
He wants to keep it as a souvenir.

342
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,833
Hypocrites. All of them.

343
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,625
Hippo what?

344
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,791
Hip--

345
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,041
Hippo babies.

346
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,041
Hippo kids.

347
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,500
Natasha.

348
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,416
Recall the robots we sent
to High Summit Corp and to T Prestige.

349
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,166
Yes, Miss Jess.
I'll get on to it right away.

350
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,333
The ministry's one thing,

351
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,333
but we've been refused
by how many private investors?

352
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,541
On the bright side,

353
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,750
there's a six-month waiting list
on our Model IV.

354
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,875
We've had pre-orders from customers
all around the world.

355
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,083
Yeah, we don't need anyone else.

356
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,750
- Take the company public.
- What's the point in that?

357
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,958
We could go global,

358
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,708
but this country
will keep digging its heels in.

359
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,541
[Natasha] Uh… Um…

360
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,333
Uh… Miss Jess…

361
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,416
The show, Damn Hot Topic,
has contacted us.

362
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,333
Say again?

363
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,208
Damn Ho--

364
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,916
Natasha, properly.

365
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,791
Damn Hot Topic.

366
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,125
They want you on as a guest,

367
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,708
to have a debate with… Gemina.

368
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,458
Tell them I'm in.

369
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,791
But, Jess, they're trying to shame you.

370
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,958
- Let them. I don't care.
- Ignore them, Jess.

371
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,166
We just have to keep doing
what we're doing.

372
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,166
Witt, it's not just about money.

373
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,583
I want to see real change.

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,958
But this country
isn't interested in change.

375
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,375
Let it go, Jess.

376
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,791
You need to focus
on launching the complex.

377
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,500
[sighs] Don't stress. Okay?

378
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,250
How about you and I have a little fun?

379
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,708
Go and play with the robot.

380
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,541
But it's got nothing on you.

381
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,625
You need to chill out.

382
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,541
[smooching]

383
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,625
Cut it out!

384
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,625
You just want me to buy you a car.

385
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,125
Didn't I just get you one?

386
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,833
[Witt] I don't like seeing you stressed.
I don't care about the car.

387
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,291
[soul music playing]

388
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,083
[thunder crashes]

389
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,625

[breathing shakily]

[gentle, nostalgic music playing]

395
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,583
[male voice] This is Robert, 35 years old.

396
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,500
An office worker
who always does his assigned job

397
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,916
to the best of his ability.

398
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,458
Despite never being
an employee of the month,

399
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,208
Robert has never taken any sick
or personal leave during his time here.

400
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,541
[lights clunking off]

401
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,958
He has also done as much
overtime work as possible.

402
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,208
With this lifestyle,

403
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,708
he doesn't have time for a relationship.

404
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,833
Yeah, yeah, I've been on a few dates.

405
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,791
I've been working
at TRM for about ten years,

406
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,583
and I haven't made any…

407
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,708
I've just never found the right one.

408
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,791
[melodic music playing]

409
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,875
[grunting]

410
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,875
Dickhead!

411
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,375
[male voice] What type of the girl
that you like?

412
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,125
I… I like Asian girls.

413
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,458
Yeah, they're beautiful.

414
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,416
[music continues]

415
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,583
[music fades]

416
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,916
[panting softly]

417
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,958
[male voice] Do you like your life?

418
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,291
[static]

419
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,583
[incoming-call alert]

420
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,500
- [female voice] You are the lucky winner.
- [cheering]

421
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,125
You are the lucky winner.

422
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,083
[upbeat music playing]

423
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,583
Gamalore City?

424
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,125
Yes, I'm going to Gamalore City.

425
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,208
Have a nice trip.

426
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,500
[music peaks, fades]

427
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,000
[female voice] Enjoy Gamalore.

428
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,750
[electronic, upbeat music playing]

429
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:11,250
Hello, and welcome everyone
to Damn Hot Topic.

430
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:15,000
Today, we're discussing
the controversy around sex robots.

431
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:19,166
It's a sensitive issue
that continues to divide our society.

432
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,083
Please give a warm welcome
to our two guests.

433
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:26,458
Joining me today is CEO of Paradise X,

434
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,541
Jessica Harthihill.

435
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,958
- Welcome!
- Great to be here.

436
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,041
Thanks for joining us.

437
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,250
My second guest is
a government representative.

438
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:39,125
She's the Minister of Arts
and Modern Lifestyles Control,

439
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,666
Ms. Gemina Lakeville.

440
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,416
- Thanks for being here.
- Thank you.

441
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,625
All right, let's get straight into it.

442
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:49,000
Um, Miss Jess, what can you tell us
about this project of yours?

443
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,625
Firstly, thanks for inviting me.

444
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,000
Our project is Paradise X
the Pleasure Oasis.

445
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,125
An entertainment complex for adults

446
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,291
and Gamalore City's
latest tourist attraction.

447
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,208
Oh!

448
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,541
Hmm.

449
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:06,041
This project is very ambitious, isn't it?

450
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,375
Now, I'm sure everyone knows
what you mean by entertainment,

451
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:13,750
but tell us, what do you mean
when you say it's for adults?

452
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,291
The viewers aren't stupid, Mr. Smith.

453
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,500
[music sting]

454
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,541
Tell you what,
why don't we take a look at some feedback

455
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,166
we've received
from our first group of customers,

456
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,083
which will make it clear
what our purpose is

457
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,208
and the positive contribution
we're making to society.

458
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:30,166
[soft drumroll]

459
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,666
Hello, everyone.

460
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,166
My name is Ton, and I'm a sex addict.

461
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,416
[rock and roll music plays]

462
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,791
My brain is addicted, uh,
to the chemicals released during sex,

463
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,583
the endorphins,
which means I'm unable to resist sex.

464
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,166
And this has caused some issues at home.

465
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,375
I've been to see psychiatrists,
but that hasn't helped.

466
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,958
Only the sex robots,
at Paradise X The Pleasure Oasis,

467
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,041
were able to help me with my addiction.

468
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,000
[rock and roll music continues]

469
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,916
My problem is I can't be open
about my sexuality with my family.

470
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:16,000
Paradise X offers private access
for those who prefer anonymity.

471
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,166
You can have sex with whoever you want.

472
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,041
[music continues]

473
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,125
- [slap]
- [grunts]

474
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,166
It's perverted.

475
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,166
It's depraved,
and that's what makes it great! [giggles]

476
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,291
This is a place
where I can really let loose,

477
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,541
where it's safe to be yourself.

478
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,458
You don't have to worry
about being judged. [laughs]

479
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:46,291
Paradise X The Pleasure Oasis,
you know, gives me "true love".

480
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,708
[woman moans in pleasure]

481
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:53,083
The robots here know me
better than any human.

482
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,708
It's only temporary,

483
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,250
but it's more than enough
for someone like me,

484
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,000
who doesn't have a lot of options.

485
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,458
I love it here.

486
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,791
I love Gamalore.

487
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,625
[music peaks, fades]

488
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,875
[woman moaning in pleasure]

489
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,375
Oh, wow, that's amazing.

490
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,791
Very eye catching.

491
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,041
So, as we saw just now,

492
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:17,333
a man was able to treat
his sex addiction at your complex,

493
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,833
so this project
is really doing a lot of good.

494
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,916
- That's right, Mr. Smith.
- Right.

495
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,875
That's why it's disappointing
there are people

496
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,416
who still think it's indecent.

497
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,000
We need to accept this is one
of the strengths of our nation.

498
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,708
- [Smith] Mmm.
- It's our country's main economic driver.

499
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,750
Your commercial is misleading.

500
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,166
And it does not meet ethical standards.

501
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,916
Was this commercial screened
by the appropriate authorities

502
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,416
before it went to air?

503
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,250
Are we living in the Stone Age?

504
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,958
- Hm.
- Mr. Smith, I'd like to clarify something.

505
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,708
For me, personally,
this is more than a business venture.

506
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,916
I want to see societal change.

507
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,541
You can't deny
sex is a natural part of life.

508
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,458
- [Smith] Hm.
- It's time to end the stigma.

509
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:08,000
I think it's time
that we solved these issues in society.

510
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:08,916
[Smith] Mmm.

511
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,208
You're essentially opening a brothel.

512
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,416
And that is a crime.

513
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,458
[Smith] Oh.

514
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,708
Is it a brothel?

515
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,208
If Paradise X
The Pleasure Oasis is illegal,

516
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,708
you'll have to shut down

517
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:25,000
every electrical appliance store
in the country.

518
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:35,208
Your robots don't have feelings.
Your customers can do anything they want.

519
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,250
They can even engage in violence.

520
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:41,083
How can you be certain
that users of your robots

521
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:44,583
won't develop violent behaviors
towards women and children?

522
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,291
[tense music playing]

523
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,833
Hmm, that's a very interesting question.

524
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,500
What are your thoughts, Miss Jessica?

525
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,000
Let me ask you a question.

526
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Has Dr. Fabian, your husband,
shown you what he's learned?

527
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,208
He's tried out every model that we have.

528
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:22,000
I expected that you'd try to use this
to divert attention from the real issue.

529
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,750
Rather than focus on my personal life,

530
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:28,041
why don't you respond
to the question I asked you

531
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,958
concerning the social implications?

532
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,666
I'm waiting.

533
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,250
[tense music continues]

534
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,333
You've already seen the benefits
this project will have for society.

535
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:42,250
There are multiple studies
that support what I'm saying.

536
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,333
The availability of sex robots
reduces rape cases.

537
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,083
That's irrelevant.

538
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,041
I wasn't talking about rape.

539
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,958
What I'm saying is,

540
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:56,541
your products could encourage
violent tendencies

541
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,500
that would affect actual people.

542
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,625
Has anyone died?

543
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,458
Should we wait until someone dies?

544
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,791
We need to take precautionary measures.

545
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,208
Have you no sense of responsibility?

546
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:09,166
How long will you keep standing
in the way of progress?

547
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,041
I'm not standing in the way of progress.

548
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,791
But let's be clear
what we mean by progress.

549
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,291
We need to think carefully…

550
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,375
- About the moral implications for society…
- You keep coming back to morals.

551
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,166
- And we never discussed the real issues.
- [Gemina laughs]

552
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,916
That's why this country
can't move forward.

553
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,208
Progress. Your only focus is sex.
Sorry, but that's not progress.

554
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:30,500
- Would you prefer nothing changes?
- Why don't we take a moment to discuss.

555

[music sting]

563
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:42,875
Sorry. Are you hurt?

564
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,583
Can you do it harder? I like it.

565
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:54,041
Give it to me. I like it.

566
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,541
[moaning in pleasure]

567
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,958
Again. Do it again.

[slap]

569
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,750
Yeah, yeah, again.

I've been a naughty girl!

571
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:13,125
Again. Slap me. [screams]
Do it again. Again.

581
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:38,750
Shall we continue?

582
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:43,208
[moaning in pleasure] I want more.
I love it.

583
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Slap me again.

584
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,041
Do it again. Slap me! [moans in pleasure]

585
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,666
Do it again.

586
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,041

- [man 2] Ready on three.

590
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,875
[man] Further left.

591
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:15,000
- Stop. Back to the right.
- [man 2] Move it back.

592
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,375
[man] A bit more. Stop.

593
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,250
- Miss Jess.
- Yes?

594
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:20,041
Would you like to wait inside?

595
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,875
We're still working, but it's okay.

596
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,000
It'll be done on time.

597
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,125
Thanks, but I'd like to be here for it.

598
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,500
[man 2] Okay, lift it.

599
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,625
We're nearly there, everyone.

600
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:35,875
Thank you, all, for your hard work
in creating a new chapter for our country.

601
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,333
[chuckles]

602
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,291
- Go on.
- Oh, sure.

603
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,041
We're about to put up the sign.

604
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,708
- Do you wanna watch?
- Hmm.

605
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,791
- All right.
- Okay.

606
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,375

Let's go inside now, come on.

618
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,041
Miss Jess.

619
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,208
- [man] Miss Jess.
- Please stop. Don't go out there.

620
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,166
- Miss Jess.
- Wait a second. It's dangerous.

621

[man] She's right.

622
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,125
Whore! You rot in jail!

623
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,708
Get out! Get out of here.

624
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,250
Goddamn slut!

625
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,458
[Natasha] Miss Jess, wait!

626
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:54,708
Miss Jess, please don't do this.
It's dangerous out there.

627
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,000
[male protester] Bitch!

628
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,541
Listen. We will not use violence.

629
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,375
I'm going to talk to them. Move.

630
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,625
[male protester] Get out of our country!

631
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,541

632
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,833

You whore!

633
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,083

Everyone, please just listen.

637
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,583
Shut it down immediately.

638
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,000
The public did not agree
to having your business in our backyards.

639
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,125
[crowd] Yeah.

640
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,750
[male protester] The majority
of people oppose it.

641
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,791
[crowd] Yeah.

642
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,875
It goes against the moral values
of our nation.

643
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:32,916
[crowd] Yeah.

644
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,458
Multiple studies have shown
what this will do to our society.

645
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:41,208
If people become obsessed with robots,

646
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,041
it will be the end of human relationships.

647
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:44,958
[crowd] Yeah.

648
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,666
- You're preventing babies being conceived!
- [crowd] Yeah.

649
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,958
You are leading us to extinction!

[crowd] Yeah!

651
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,208
You dirty whore, you bitch!

652
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,375
Get out, bitch!

653
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,041
Please, just listen.

654
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,416
- I got something to say and you'll listen…
- [Jess] Please, listen.

655
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,916
[male protester] Get out!

656
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,916
This project is far too important.

657
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,500
We are not going to shut it down.

658
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,250
You can't reason with this bitch.

659
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,416
- [crowd] Yeah!
- You dirty slut.

660
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,458
Can you please just listen?

661
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:17,416
No way!

662
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,166
You can't do this to our country.

663
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,166
[male protester] You fucking bitch!

664
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,083
Fuck you!

[objects crashing]

666
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,333
Violence is not the answer.

667
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,708
Shut up!

668
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,583
I'm doing this for all of you.

669
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,041
[male protester] Get out!

670
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,916
I'm trying to change
our country for the better.

671
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,791
We don't want change.
We love our country.Go to hell!

672
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:44,375
If you don't like it here,
go back to America, bitch.

673
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,291
Who are you to come along
and try to change my country?

674
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,708
Who do you think you are?

00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,125
Just get some sleep.

712
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,208
You're all wound up.

713
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,583
I had a nightmare.

714
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:29,791
Can you hold me?

715
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
[sighs]

716
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,500
It's late, Jess. I'm not in the mood.

717
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,833
You haven't held me in ages.

718
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,416
[Witt scoffs, grunts]

719
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,750
- [car engine revving softly]
- [video games bleeps]

720
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:01,083
[Witt] Take that.
Got you. Yeah, that's right.

721
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,250
You're mine.

722
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,250
What? I'm gonna nail you.

723
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,166
Nailed.

724
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,375
Nailed.

725
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,000
Nailed.

726
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,458
- Come here.
- Witt. Shh.

727
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:11,083
[phone ringing]

728
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:12,666
Hello?

729
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,958
Have you made an appointment?

730
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,041
Good.

731
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,833
What about the product? Is it ready?

732
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,291
Okay, thank you.

733
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,750
I thought we were shopping
for my birthday present.

734
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:30,708
What are you doing?

735
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,375
Taking charge.

736
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,958
[upbeat music playing]

737
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,000
This envelope contains all of the revenue

738
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:54,708
from Paradise X
from its soft opening up to today.

739
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:58,666
I've decided to allocate
a portion of our profit…

740
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:00,833
to your company.

741
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:07,833
As a way of saying thank you
for smoothing the way for my business.

742
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,500
You've been most helpful.

743
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,458
[music continues]

744
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:17,375
If you're interested,
maybe we can discuss…

745
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,666
the potential possibility of…

746
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,208
future co-investment.

747
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,916
Or explore other opportunities
for business development.

748
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:38,875
All I'm asking for is your help
securing a business license.

749
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,541
Would you do that for me?

750
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,500
[man] I admire you.

751
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:48,041
You're very proactive
in pursuing your goals.

752
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,000
You're a ruthless female CEO.

753
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,375
But the truth is,

754
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,375
the others you've approached
are small time.

755
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,250
I'm on another level.

756
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:02,875
And your offer…

757
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:06,333
[scoffs] …are you trying
to insult my honor?

758
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,208
Listen,

759
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,625
I wouldn't dare insult your honor.

760
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:16,875
I've organized a platinum membership
as a show of my esteem for you.

761
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,375
I've also had one of our latest models

762
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,083
sent to you as a gift
because I'd like to invite you to--

763
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:29,500
What the hell am I gonna do with a robot?

764
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,625
I prefer real women.

765
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:40,541
[unzipping]

766
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:45,458
Crawl over here.

767
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:54,000
- Um, I think--
- Crawl! Do you want that license or not?

768
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:57,916
Listen.

769
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:01,541
- Why don't I--
- I think I've made myself clear.

770
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:03,833
Crawl over.

771
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,083
[shouts] Now!

772
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,708
You're desperate for it, aren't you?

773
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,333
[tense music playing]

774
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:20,750
If you want it,

775
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:24,041
come and get it before I change my mind.

776
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,041
[music intensifies]

777
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,666
[music peaks, fades]

778
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,041
Lick it.

779
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,666
I know you love power.

780
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,791
[somber music playing]

781
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,875
[phone ringing]

782
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,416
[Natasha] Miss Jess, the public response
to our launch hasn't improved,

783
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
and our business license
hasn't been issued yet either.

784
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:32,416
So are you positive that the business men
you approached will really help us out?

785
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:36,750
And, Miss Jess, there's something else.

786
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:39,541
I haven't been able to contact Mr. Witt.

787
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,125
I sent someone around to the house.

788
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:45,375
His clothes
and all his belongings are gone.

789
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,416
[beep]

790
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,458
- [music swells]
- [inaudible scream]

791
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:54,666
[loud shatter]

792
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,041
[music fades]

793
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:01,541
[sniffles]

794
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,083
[somber music playing]

795
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,416
[door knocking]

796
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,333
[woman] Jess?

797
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:42,791
Jess.

798
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,375
Can you open the door, honey?

799
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,291
- Jess.
- Coming.

800
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,375
[woman] What's taking so long?

801
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:51,375
[Jess] I'm coming.

802
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,458
Welcome!

803
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,375
Get on the bed.

804
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,083
Straight to the bed.

805
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,166
Go, go, go!

806
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,208
[somber music continues]

807
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:20,916
[breathes heavily]

808
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,083
[music fading]

809
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,375
We have a very special guest
with us today.

810
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,791
Let's hear it for Witt Hustler!

811
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:45,083
[Witt] Hey, what's up, everybody?
What's up, everybody?

812
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:48,458
Hey, it's Witt Hustler over here, man.

813
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,583
- Oh, oh, ugh.
- What's up man?

814
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,375
You've got something to share with us.

815
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:56,875
Why don't you start
by introducing yourself.

816
00:50:56,958 --> 00:51:01,583
Tell us a bit about who you are,
and what brought you here today?

817
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:03,833
- Cool. So a lot of you know me already.
- Uh-huh.

818
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:06,291
I'm a former Mr. Multiverse,
which is like…

819
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,958
- Multiverse?
- A contest for hot guys.

820
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,250
From what I understand,

821
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:13,125
you were born and raised
in Gamalore City, is that right?

822
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,666
Yep. Uh…

823
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,708
I've always said
you've got to back yourself.

824
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:18,625
Know what I mean?

825
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,291
'Cause if I don't keep going,
then how the fuck am I gonna eat?

826
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,166
- Mmm.
- Back in the day…

827
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,333
- I was a B-boy. You know what a B-boy is?
- I do.

828
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,750
I was on Running Street.

829
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:28,666
Back then…

830
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,291
- I used to get drunk, all the time.
- All right, let's get back to the point.

831
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,708
The reason we invited him
onto the show today

832
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,833
was, um, we understand that our guest,

833
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:39,750
Mr. Witt Hustler,

834
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,166
is the boyfriend of Miss Jessica.

835
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,500
Have I got that right?

836
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,541
Uh, ex-boyfriend. We recently broke up.

837
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:50,291
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

838
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,416
Well, the thing was,

839
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,750
Jess has changed a lot.

840
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:58,583
Like, she's manic
and totally, like, obsessed with work.

841
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,583
- I was over it.
- Hmm.

842
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:02,083
But I want to be clear.

843
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:04,166
- I didn't think we'd end up dating.
- Oh!

844
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,750
I follow her on social media
'cause she's hot.

845
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,666
So I messaged her
thinking maybe we'd hook up.

846
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,416
I never thought a girl like Jess
would go for me. Know what I mean?

847
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,583
I do, yeah.

848
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:18,125
Why would such a gorgeous,
elegant woman choose to date you?

849
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,500
Wanna know?

850
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,416
[Smith] What? Oh!

851
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:25,291
Big dick get them bitches begging, baby.

852
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,541
Know what they call me? Torpedo tongue.

853
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,583
Okay, okay.

854
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:31,125
- Do you get it? Do you get it?
- Yeah, I get it. I get it!

855
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:35,958
All right, Witt, I wanna ask you
something about Miss Jessica.

856
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,458
Yeah? What…

857
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:41,791
What is your stance on uh…

858
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,750
What do you think
about Miss Jessica's business?

859
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,208
- Hm.
- The sex robots.

860
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,333
Well…

861
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:52,291
with Jessica, there are a lot of people
who look up to her.

862
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:54,250
- She's a powerful woman.
- Hmm.

863
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,333
But she also has a hidden side.

864
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:57,458
The hidden side?

865
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,708
She's not a good person. It's just PR.

866
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,708
- And today I'm going to rip off the mask.
- Oh.

867
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,375
- [doors opens]
- [Smith] You're saying…

868
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:09,708
- That Miss Jessica's keeping secrets…
- The legal team here to see you.

869
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,375
- [Witt] That's right…
- Miss Jessica.

870
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,375
Don't worry about this, okay?

871
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,583
- My team is putting a stop to this.
- Why?!

872
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:18,208
- [Smith] What is she hiding?
- Who asked for that?

873
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,291
Call your team off.

874
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,750
Let him speak.

875
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,416
Let's hear what he has to say.

876
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,916
Let's go straight for the jugular.

877
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:31,000
Tell us something
that has never been made public.

878
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,291
- You sure I can say it?
- Go ahead. Don't leave anything out.

879
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,166
- I'm going to say it.
- So, say it!

880
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,375
Oh, he needs a drink!

881
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,791
[tense music playing]

882
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,958
[Smith] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

883
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,333
So… here it is.

884
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:49,333
The thing about Jess,

885
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,500
she has a fetish.

886
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,208
[laughs]

887
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,750
[music intensifies]

888
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:57,375
Jess loves it when I…

889
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,833
Uh…

890
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,708
She loves when I piss on her.

891
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:04,208
- Ugh!
- I was shocked at first.

892
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,708
- [Natasha] What the hell?
- [Witt] That's some weird shit.

893
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,458
- It gets messy too.
- My god!

894
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,291
[Smith] Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

895
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,083
I think we're getting
a little too personal.

896
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,875
Let's focus
on the business side of things.

897
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:18,666
Sex robots have become a hot commodity.

898
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,458
What is your opinion
on Miss Jessica's business?

899
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:24,541
Hm. See, the thing about this is,

900
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:25,958
I have a lot to say,

901
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,416
but I not allowed.

902
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,083
They made sure I couldn't.

903
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,666
When I look at myself in the mirror,

904
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,041
I think, "Witt, just do the right thing."

905
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:38,375
"Just say it out loud, man.
Come on. Please say it. Just say it."

906
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:41,166
- [Smith] Oh, What do you mean?
- [Witt] Listen.

907
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:46,125
The sex robots
that got sent out to those big wigs.

908
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,750
They have hidden cameras.

909
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,416
- What?
- They have cameras.

910
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,083
They have cameras in their eyes,
and they're recording.

911
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,291
Hidden cameras.

912
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,375
[dramatic, distorted sting]

913
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,041
[Witt] I've seen it.
I'm telling the truth.

914
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:06,125
Politicians
and important people like that,

915
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,791
they're spying on all sorts of people.

916
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:09,708
My God!

917
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:13,583
So are you telling us

918
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:17,583
that customer privacy is being violated?

919
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:21,583
If this were a movie, it'd make
a pretty good plot twist, don't you think?

920
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:22,583
It's pretty dark.

921
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:24,625
[Smith] Is that true?

922
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:26,791
[Witt] I didn't mention names.

923
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,625
- [Natasha] How could he say that?
- Get out!

924
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,500
- I don't know shit.
- All of you, get out.

925
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,125
These are very serious allegations.

926
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,083
[music swelling]

927
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,666
- [music fades]
- [phone ringing]

928
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,958
[phone keeps ringing in the distance]

929
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:00,416
PRESIDENT TIM

930
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,708
[phone keeps ringing]

931
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:06,916
Miss Jessica Harthihill has made
a statement responding to allegations

932
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,500
made by her ex-boyfriend.

933
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:11,625
My company, values privacy above all.

934
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:16,625
Our current pre-orders
will take a year to fulfil.

935
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,583
Why would I risk everything?

936
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,708
What would I gain?

937
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:25,000
I'd like to assure all
of our Paradise X customers,

938
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,625
these allegations
are completely unfounded.

939
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,375
That's all. Thanks for your time.

940
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:33,375
[reporter] Has Mr. Witt been spreading
lies? Are you planning to sue him?

941
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,666
Why bother?

942
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:36,750
He isn't worth it.

943
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,583
[reporter] About the news,
how is it going?

944
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,875
[tense music playing]

945
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,208
TYCOON KAI

946
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,375
[Jess over phone] Hello, Mr. Chairman.

947
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,625
Hello, Minister.

948
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,250
- Hello, General.
- [Jess off phone] That's right.

949
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,166
Nothing for you to be concerned about.

950
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,791
- Hello, sir…
- I appreciate you returning my call.

951
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:05,833
Hello, Minister.

952
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,500
- How are you?
- I've been trying to reach you for weeks.

953
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,083
But you haven't responded.

954
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:14,250
I hope that you can assist.

955
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:20,875
[music fades]

956
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:22,875
[Natasha] The tide is starting to turn.

957
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,375
You can rest easy now, Miss Jess.

958
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,583
[click]

959
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:31,333
[man] There are pros and cons
to the argument.

960
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:34,666
What Miss Jessica is proposing
is outside the box.

961
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,166
But we do need reform around prostitution.

962
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:42,000
If the proposal lacks substance,
the public will dismiss it.

963
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:46,166
But this could be our opportunity
to tackle this problem.

964
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,625
[Natasha giggles, cheers]

965
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:48,875
So the businessman,

966
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:52,208
who previously rejected
your fundraising proposal,

967
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:56,166
they've called us back
and expressed they're now ready

968
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,083
to show us the money.

969
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,250
How did the launch event go?

970
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,250
[Natasha] Without a hitch.

971
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:07,583
This is what they call
the calm after the storm.

972
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,250
[gasps] Oh!

973
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,250
Actually… we have Witt to thank. [scoffs]

974
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,583
What a plot twist. Hm.

975
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,208
You can go now.

976
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:20,625
Okay then. Uh, I am so pumped about this!

977
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,291
[doors opens, shuts]

978
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,791
[Witt] Where is my thank you?

979
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,583
Seriously, that was a genius move.

980
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,250
I didn't believe
that it'd actually work in the beginning.

981
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,083
But we scared those big wigs shitless.

982
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:42,000
Holy hell! Funniest shit ever.

983
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,833
You should keep a low profile.

984
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,791
You can't be seen.

985
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:49,041
No problem. I get it.

986
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:52,125
[Witt sighs]

987
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,125
- Witt.
- What's up?

988
00:58:59,041 --> 00:58:59,875
Thanks, Witt.

989
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,291
I'm a good actor, aren't I?

990
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,250
Didnt I tell you
that stupid punk outfit would sell it?

991
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,083
The piss thing was a bit much.

992
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,041
Hey, it worked.

993
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,375
Hmm?

994
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,875
- [Witt] How about…
- What?

995
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:21,041
We try it out tonight. You might like it.

996
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,291
[Jess] The piss thing? No way.

997
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,500
You can stop stressing now.

998
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:27,833
We did it.

999
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,000
Let it go.

1000
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:30,625
[gentle music playing]

1001
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,625
No, we haven't won yet.

1002
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:36,750
[exhales] We have more fights ahead of us.

1003
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,583
Forget that, Jess.

1004
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,666
No more stressing. What's the point?

1005
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,250
Hug me.

1006
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:49,958
Just a hug?

1007
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:51,875
Nothing else?

1008
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,833
What else can you do?

1009
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:00,708
[music continues]

1010
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,875
[romantic, hopeful music playing]

1011
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,500
[young Jess] Do you have a dream, Witt?

1012
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,000
Like a dream job or something?

1013
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:19,625
Mm, I guess.

1014
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:23,750
When I grow up, I wanna be a movie star.

1015
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:27,625
I want to see a poster
of myself at the Gamalore Theatre.

1016
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:31,833
I'll have a cigar and a gun in each hand!

1017
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,083
Pew-pew! [chuckles] Like that.

1018
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:38,541
How about you?

1019
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,583
What do you wanna be when you grow up?

1020
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,375
[young Jess] I don't know.

1021
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,833
Anything, as long as it takes
me far away from here.

1022
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,291
I'll never come back.

1023
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,541
But if you leave, I'll be lonely.

1024
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,375
- So come with me.
- Hmm?

1025
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,791
I don't know if I can.

1026
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,291
This place is all I know.

1027
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,166
It'll be okay, though.

1028
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,500
Even if you can't leave,
I'll always take care of you.

1029
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:19,541
[music continues to play]

1030
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:51,666
[music turning dramatic]

1031
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,083
- [music fades]
- [gasps]

1032
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,416
- Sorry. So--. I'm sorry.
- What the fuck?

1033
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,750
Witt, don't!

1034
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:04,291
- I'm sorry. Jess, I'm sorry.
- [grunts, pants]

1035
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,625
I'm so sorry, Jess.

1036
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,666
[Jess panting]

1037
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,375
[dramatic music playing]

1038
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,458
- [door opens]
- [Witt panting]

1039
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:32,250
[Witt] I'm sorry.

1040
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:39,208
I'm sorry.

1041
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,166
[Jess] Hm.

1042
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:44,083
[tense, dramatic music plays]

1043
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:04,041
ONE HOUR BEFORE THE LAUNCH EVENT
OF PARADISE X THE PLEASURE OASIS

[classical music playing]

1045
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,000
[woman] Jess?

1046
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,666
You have to believe in yourself.

1047
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,708
[muffled sound]

1048
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:59,083
[tense, dramatic music playing]

1049
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:24,083
[sniffles]

1050
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,833
[sobbing gently]

1051
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:14,375
[woman] You've given it
everything you've got.

1052
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,541
I'm so proud of you.

1053
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:27,625
The work that you're doing
is helping so many people.

1054
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:32,375
This is bigger than just our family.

1055
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:05,916
I'm sorry.

1056
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:08,583
[sobbing]

1057
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,416
I'm so sorry.

1058
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:14,000
You have to fight.

1059
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,958
You'll get better soon.

1060
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,625
I'm not going to get better.

1061
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,750
Live a full life.

1062
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,583
