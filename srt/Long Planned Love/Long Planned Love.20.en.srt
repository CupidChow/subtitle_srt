Jian Cheng said

41
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,190
that Meng Tang asked me to tell you

42
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,550
to contact her as soon as possible,

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,630
and make it clear.

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,810
Otherwise, dragging it out

45
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,590
will affect you
starting a new relationship.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
And also,

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
stop hiding out in the clubhouse.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,310
It's bad for business.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,550
Zhou,

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,720
you're doing this on purpose.

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,800
You're being way too petty.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,310
We are brothers.

53
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,430
If I'm miserable,

54
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,730
you don't want to be fine either.

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,690
(Meng Tang)
Tomorrow,

56
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,100
let's meet up.

57
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,700
(You've withdrawn a message.)

58
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,500
(Meng Tang)

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
No need to withdraw it.

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,430
I already read it.

61
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,310
See you tomorrow.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,430
Do you even like Meng Tang?

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,840
To me, Meng Tang

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,560
is a pretty strange presence.

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,430
She often stirs me up inside,

66
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,280
but never to the point of heartbreak.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
So,

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,310
I probably don't love her?

69
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,570
Then give her a clean break

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
and free yourself too.

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,160
Why do you ask me to meet here?

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,130
I want to grab lunch with you.

73
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,800
And also

74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
with Mi Shan.

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,840
- I'm thinking
- Meng Tang,

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,140
I just saw a kid selling flowers.

77
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,790
(Lin Ye, Meng Tang's junior)
He looked so pitiful.

78
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,270
So I bought them all.

79
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,270
Coincidentally, I run into you here.

80
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,830
That's quite a coincidence, huh?

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,430
Yeah, it's coincidental.

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,830
(A peacock spreading tail feathers!)

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,950
Can I invite you to dinner?

84
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,950
You just said

85
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,510
you're having lunch with Mi Shan,

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
right?

87
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,470
Sure, I'm free.

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,710
I won't eat with Mi Shan.

89
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,060
Just you and me.

90
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,970
After all, I'm your fiancé.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
We haven't had a meal together in ages.

92
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
Fiancé?

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,460
No way.

94
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,390
You're really Meng Tang's fiancé?

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

96
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,270
Even it's true,

97
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,880
you two will split sooner or later.

98
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,310
I'm around her every day,

99
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,720
but I've never seen you call her,

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,490
nor have I seen you pick her up
from work.

101
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,830
What's the use

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,100
of having a fiancé like you?

103
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,400
That hurts.

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,690
I'll handle it myself.

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
You deserve it.

106
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,810
Look at what he's done to me.

107
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,190
Have I ever been treated
like this before?

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,070
Meng Tang.

109
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,730
I just feel that guy isn't good enough,

110
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,300
strutting around like a pretty peacock.

111
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,330
And he talks way too much.

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
He's not right for you.

113
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,100
I'm worried you'll get fooled.

114
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,470
Qin Zhuo.

115
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
I…

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,540
(Mi Shan)

117
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,820
(Mi Shan)

118
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,980
(Zhang)

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Speak.

120
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,750
I lost track of Su Yun.

121
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,510
Wait there for me.

122
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,350
I'm on my way.

123
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,790
Thanks,

124
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Qin Zhuo.

125
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,820
You helped me lose the last point.

126
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,840
My guy just called me.

127
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,040
He said Su Yun seemed
to be tailing Jian Cheng.

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,160
But he lost her.

129
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,630
I called Su Yun and her agent.

130
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,470
No one answered.

131
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,390
Su Yun?

132
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,510
That woman's name is Jian Cheng.

133
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,070
She's the daughter of Changsheng Group.

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,310
Jian Cheng.

135
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,310
Glad you're OK.

136
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,000
You're married?

137
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Mm.

138
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,630
From the look on your face,

139
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,750
you two must be doing pretty well.

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,870
Yeah, we are.

141
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,720
Actually,

142
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,390
I came back this time for someone.

143
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,080
(I'm just the wife of a president.)

144
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,870
(Even I know how to protect my privacy.)

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,990
(You're a big name
in the entertainment industry.)

146
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,880
(And yet you openly share secrets
with others.)

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Someone

148
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,960
I thought I'd marry.

149
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,150
Over these years,

150
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,080
many people guessed
I had a financial backer.

151
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
I never responded to any of it.

152
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,750
Because they weren't wrong.

153
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,080
Behind me,

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,630
there has always been a man.

155
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,630
(Am I even supposed to hear this?)

156
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,230
Actually,

157
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,840
as a public figure like you,

158
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
it's better not

159
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,150
to reveal too much of your own secrets.

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,200
We made a promise.

161
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,390
I'd step away from the industry at 30

162
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,230
and

163
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,200
he'd wait for me until I turn 30.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,120
This time I came back,

165
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,660
just to celebrate his birthday with him.

166
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,360
I thought the day had finally come.

167
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,510
But guess what?

168
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,390
He had a huge surprise for me.

169
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,240
He got married.

170
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,750
He actually got married.

171
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,230
Today,

172
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
thanks for listening to me

173
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,480
and for giving me a ride back.

174
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,590
It's nothing.

175
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,190
Actually,

176
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,970
I've been following that movie
you and Director Mei are working on.

177
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,200
I really hope

178
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,890
you have a great collaboration
this time.

179
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,350
Mm.

180
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,550
Alright, I'll head back now.

181
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,120
Good thing it wasn't a scammer.

182
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,700
(Calls from Zhou Tingyan)

183
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,390
Oops, I got carried away by gossip.

184
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,110
- Hey, pretty.
- What are you trying to do?

185
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,000
What are you doing?

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,910
Come hang out with me.

187
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,320
Stay back.

188
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,080
- No, stay back.
- Come on.

189
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,370
Let go of me.

190
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,550
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,340
Stop hitting me.

192
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,910
Is this the police?

193
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm at Unit 2, Building 17,
Fortune Community.

194
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,270
There's someone harassing me.

195
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,120
Jian Cheng.

196
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,110
Stop hitting.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
Keep the wound away from water.

198
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
Get plenty of rest.

199
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,270
I truly apologize.

200
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,750
It's me who kept talking with you.

201
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,510
If I'd gone back and left earlier,

202
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,870
this thing wouldn't have happened.

203
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
It's not your fault.

204
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,610
Well,

205
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,510
I'm really fine.

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
By the way,

207
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,600
about what I told you today,

208
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,890
can you keep it just between us?

209
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
Yeah.

210
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,260
Don't mention it to your family either.

211
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,870
I'm worried...

212
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,120
I get it.

213
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,390
It's your personal matter.

214
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,630
I promise I won't tell anyone.

215
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,150
Alright, alright.

217
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,020
I'm really sorry.

218
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,360
It's OK.

219
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,200
Alright, alright.

220
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,000
(I definitely can't reveal the secret,)

221
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,510
(but I must tell Zhou Tingyan)

222
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,940
(about the grievance I've suffered.)

223
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,590
Hello?

224
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,360
Zhou Tingyan,

225
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,150
someone's giving me trouble.

226
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,150
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

227
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,990
Yeah.

228
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,510
Su Yun specially took leave
to come back this time.

229
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,000
(Zhang Zhen, Su Yun's agent)
Director Mei was already unhappy.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Now she's hurt her face too.

231
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,870
Miss Jian,

232
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,610
I'm not being unreasonable here.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,270
Now she ruined her face

234
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,230
to save you.

235
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,750
If Director Mei really gets upset,

236
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,270
she may lose this chance.

237
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,000
Luckily, it's not a deep injury.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
To put it bluntly,

239
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
if it left a scar,

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,670
you'd be ending her career.

241
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,480
That's enough.

242
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,200
This isn't Jian Cheng's fault.

243
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,910
No one wanted this to happen.

244
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,750
Stop talking.

245
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,390
You're always like this,

246
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,870
always standing for others.

247
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,270
What about that injury on your face?

248
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,890
How will you explain it to Director Mei?

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
As for Director Mei,

250
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,290
I might be able to handle it.

251
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,840
Just focus on getting better.

252
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,270
Don't worry about anything else.

253
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,380
Who do you think you are?

254
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,200
You're still relying on...

255
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,320
Jian Cheng.

256
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,750
Zhou Tingyan.

257
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,510
What took you so long?

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
Sorry.

259
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm late.

260
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you hurt anywhere?

261
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,950
My hand hurts.
