17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,220
Zhou Tingyan, who is that woman?

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,380
I saw you smile at her.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,020
She's a client from Qianyi Group.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,620
I can't just keep a straight face
with her.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,740
What do you think of her?

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,900
She

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,670
has quite a personality.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,580
(Personality?)

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,780
Zhou Lu said

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,420
it's lunch break now.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,430
Yeah.

28
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,980
Zhou Tingyan,

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,340
do you like that woman just now?

30
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,620
She's Qin Zhuo's...

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
Zhou Tingyan,

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,480
would you divorce me
because of a major client?

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,820
Of course not, she's Qin Zhuo's...

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,420
Can I bring you lunch again tomorrow?

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,900
Sure.

36
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,420
Then focus on your work.

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,340
I stop bothering you.

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,260
I wait for you at home.

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,780
Yeah.

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
Jian Cheng.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,460
This is the company.

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,300
Have you no shame?

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,540
No.

44
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Don't come here again.

45
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,900
Everyone feels awkward when you show up.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,940
Alright then.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,860
I'll bring your wife along next time.

48
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,020
Uncle,

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,480
ask Jian Cheng not come
to the company anymore.

50
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,100
When she's here,

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,420
we all feel uncomfortable.

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,300
You're the one who cheated.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,100
And you're the one with bad character.

54
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,220
So the awkwardness is on you.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll have her come to the company
more often.

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,500
If you can accept,

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,400
then just bear with it.

58
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,110
If you can't,

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,660
then keep it to yourself.

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,360
So, did you get any answers?

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,380
Zhou Tingyan said he's not going
to divorce me.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
From what I can tell,

63
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,220
even if he's a bit curious
about that woman,

64
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,420
it's not much.

65
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
That's all?

66
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,020
Some things are better left

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,100
without digging too deeply.

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,750
It's better to let things slide.

69
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,960
Right now,

70
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,710
I try my best to keep him.

71
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,140
If I can,

72
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,360
I'll make a good life with him.

73
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,100
If I can't,

74
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,780
then I'll let him go.

75
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,380
I'm going. See you.

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,220
Zhou Lu likes Jian Cheng?

77
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,740
Since you know it,

78
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,100
why did you ask him for advice?

79
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,420
You're so bad.

80
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,990
Zhou Lu's always had more chances
than me.

81
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,700
But he's overthinking it.

82
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,110
If I had known it
before we got the certificates,

83
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,740
I might have stepped aside.

84
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,260
They're about the same age.

85
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,880
Zhou Lu's feelings for her
are as strong as mine.

86
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,460
I might have even helped Zhou Lu,

87
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,160
so that he could take good care
of Jian Cheng.

88
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,740
But now, I'm married to Jian Cheng.

89
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,180
It's too late.

90
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,740
The only thing I can do now

91
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,620
is to act like none of this
ever happened.

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,620
From the day Jian Cheng and I
went public,

93
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,740
Zhou Lu has been watching me closely.

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,540
He wanted to test my feelings
for Jian Cheng.

95
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,380
And I made my intentions clear to him.

96
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,700
I did it this way,

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,100
to show him I'm committed.

98
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,620
I heard Jian Hongyun asked you
for the Amusement Park Project.

99
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,100
He truly had that idea.

100
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,500
But before that,

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,660
I sent Changsheng a huge gift.

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,900
Let's see if they can handle it.

103
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,700
What kind of gift?

104
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,100
You'll find out soon.

106

Yeah.

142
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,740
She went to the company today
to bring lunch to my uncle.

143

I've got nothing to do at home.

144

No.

146
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,890
If you go to the company,

147
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,890
it's gonna be awkward for everyone.

148
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,900
Better not go.

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,300

150
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,220
What about Jian Cheng?

151
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,620
She's known you since childhood
for over 20 years,

152
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,860
got engaged to you, then called it off.

153
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,240
She married your uncle right after.

154
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,060
She goes to the company every day.

155
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,900
Isn't that awkward?

156
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,820
You don't let me go.

157
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,550
Is it really because of Jian Cheng

158
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,330
or because you think I'll embarrass you?

159
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,750
You're really sharp-tongued today.

160
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,230
I wasn't planning to quit this early.

161
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,060
I was thinking I'd quit

162
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,980
after getting pregnant.

163
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,560
Whatever I do at home now,
your mom finds fault.

164
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,980
My mom's not entirely wrong.

165
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,140
It's not like I can't support you.

166
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,900
Why not just relax and be Mrs. Zhou?

167
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,980
But look at Jian Cheng...

168
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,820
Enough!

169
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,500

but you insisted on coming.

Why can't I come?

Jian Cheng can be here, but I can't?

176
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,130
Are you regretting it?

177
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,620
Stop making a scene.

178
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,180
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling.

179
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,420
Look at your attitude.

180
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,340
Can you even drive?

181
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,220
Why is it you?

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,980
I knew it.

183
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,900
Even parked here, my car still gets hit.

184
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,140
It turns out you.

185
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,220
Yufeng.

186
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,660
What's wrong?

187
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,100
My stomach hurts badly.

188
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,740
(I'm not losing it yet.)

189
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,280
(She's trying to play the victim again.)

190
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,020
My stomach really hurts.

191
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,990
Alright, I'll take you
to the hospital first.

192
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,740
Hello?

193
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,950
Zhou Tingyan, someone's giving me
a hard time.

194
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,060
Where are you?

195
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,580
By the roadside near the company.

196
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,090
Zhou Tingyan, my car got hit.

197
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,500
The car is insignificant.

198
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,820
Are you hurt?

199
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,260
Stay there. I'll be right over.

200
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,260
You don't have to.

201
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,860
I'm not hurt.

202
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,260
I'll be back right away.

203
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,340
Don't worry about me.

204
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,500
Just focus on your work.

205
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,090
Stay right there.

206
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,940
Don't go anywhere.

207
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,380
Alright then.

208
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,660
I'll wait here for you.

209
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,060
Zhou Tingyan.

210
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,330
Didn't you say you weren't hurt?

211
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,940
See? No bleeding, it's not serious.

212
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,470
What exactly happened?

213
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,620
It was Zhou Yufeng and Jiang Yawei.

214
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,740
It seems they didn't see it.

215
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,980
They drove straight into my car.

216
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
They did it on purpose?

217
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,220
I don't think so.

218
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,660
The pregnant woman's fine physically.

219
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,260
She just needs to rest and recover.

220
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Make sure she isn't stressed again.

221
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
Pregnant?

222
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,980
I'm pregnant?

223
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,980
Yeah, over two months along.

224
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,980
You need strict bed rest after this.

225
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,500
No more mishaps from now on.

226
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,660
OK, thank you, doctor.

227
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,340
You're going to be a mom,

228
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,260
so you need to think more
about the child.

229
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,780
You can't argue with me
like you did today anymore.

230
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,980
If Jian Cheng's car
hadn't stopped there,

231
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,440
we wouldn't have rear-ended it.

232
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,740
And there'd be no risk to the pregnancy.

233
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,100
Either way,

234
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,900
we finally have a child of our own.

235
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,550
Take good care of yourself.

236
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,900
The baby's so fragile

237
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,250
and can't take any stress.

238
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,060
I see.

239
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,020
I'll go tell Mom and Dad.

240
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,540
Yeah.

241
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,120
(My mother-in-law's so eager
to have a grandchild.)

242
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,880
(She'll make sure this baby is safe.)

243
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,480
- (Just keep Jian Cheng away.)
- Hello?

244
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,220
Dad, Mom,

245
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,860
Yawei's finally pregnant.

246
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,260
(My good days have finally come.)

247
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,820
Yeah.

248
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,890
What would you like to eat later?

249
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,140
I'll ask Mom to bring it over.

250
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,300
Yeah.

251
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,380
(Oh gosh!)

252
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,670
(They really are everywhere.)

253
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,620
Jian Cheng,

254
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm pregnant.

255
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,900
It's Yufeng's kid.

256
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,780
No need to deliberately emphasize it.

257
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,900
If it weren't Zhou Yufeng's kid,

258
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,320
then it'd be a real problem.

259
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,260
You're really good at joking.

260
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,380
You should hurry up too.

261
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,980
After all, Uncle Zhou isn't that young
anymore.

262
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,220
He's probably hoping to have a kid soon.

263
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,500
A man hits his prime at 30.

264
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,140
He's still young.

265
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,140
We can do it seven times one night.

266
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,380
How many times for you two?

267
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,990
Why do you come to the hospital?

268
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,220
Can't you see?

269
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,620
So you not only have to pay
for my car repairs,

270
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
but also for my medical expenses.

271
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,740
Add me back on WeChat.

272
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,770
Tell me the amount.
I'll transfer it to you.

273
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,620
(Oh, she starts to panic.)

274
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,700
Alright.

275
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,960
Keep in touch, Yufeng.

276
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,060
