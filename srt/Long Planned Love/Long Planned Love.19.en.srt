How did I end up raising someone
like you?

In front of so many people,

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,600
you put on that touching sibling act.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,790
How can we hold our head up after this?

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,790
How am I supposed to survive
in this circle?

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
Dad,

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
I'll take care of this.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,590
Take care of it?

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,640
How?

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,950
By marrying the Wang Family's daughter

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,680
to cover up your covert affair?

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,150
Dad.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,640
Oh,

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,790
that's so heavy.

31
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,310
Oh, everyone's here.

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,070
Wait, not quite.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,350
Jian Wenqian's not here.

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,750
Jian,

35
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,510
where's your most capable daughter?

36
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,920
Why doesn't she come see you?

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,640
Ms. Mei,

38
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,040
where's your sweetest little darling?

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,510
You're already sick.

40
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,390
She doesn't even stay home
to keep you company?

41
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,430
Jian Cheng,

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,640
I heard from Wenqian

43
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,200
that you told Mom to go over.

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,950
Why did you do that?

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,590
You've thrown the whole house
into chaos.

46
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,680
What can you gain from this?

47
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,400
It's truly a shame.

48
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,480
Jian Youhui,

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,760
the reason why I've always yielded
to you

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
is that Grandma said

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,050
she has high hopes for you

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,880
and she wants you
to carry Changsheng Group.

53
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,120
But now,

54
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,190
Jian Wenqian is set on destroying you.

55
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,080
So I can't hold back anymore.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
If someone's going to bring you down,

57
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,310
better it be me.

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,680
You did that on purpose

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,030
last night, didn't you?

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,470
Yeah.

61
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,680
So what if it was on purpose?

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,630
Did I

63
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,240
hold Jian Wenqian's head

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,550
and force her to kiss Jian Youhui?

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,960
Cheng,

66
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,800
aren't you classmates
with Wang Niannian?

67
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,580
How about you go have a word with her?

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,560
She absolutely can't let this slip out.

69
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,560
Obviously.

70
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,470
If news about Jian Youhui
and Jian Wenqian gets out,

71
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,590
I'll be humiliated too.

72
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,800
You know the Zhou Family well.

73
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,900
If they find out

74
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,610
something like this happened
in my family,

75
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,240
I'd never be able
to hold my head high again.

76
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,960
Wang Niannian

77
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
swore on her late mother's name

78
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
that she would never breathe a word.

79
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Alright, alright.

80
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,030
I gave her five million to keep quiet.

81
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,410
Remember to get me reimbursed.

82
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,590
Money, money, money.

83
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,190
You only care about money.

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,710
She's the dignified daughter
of the Wang Family.

85
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,190
Why did she need hush money?

86
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,210
I'm the daughter of the Jian Family.

87
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,630
I still ask for money for everything

88
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,800
as of I'm obsessed with money.

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,710
Who would complain
about having too much?

90
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,050
You!

91
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,990
She asks for five million,
then just give her it.

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,620
- Exactly.
- Any car you casually give to Wenqian

93
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,870
is worth more than five million.

94
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,030
Give Cheng what she wants.

95
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,280
Cheng, what should we do now?

96
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,270
How about

97
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,590
we sent her abroad?

98
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,190
Out of sight, out of mind.

99
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,470
After a few years,

100
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,710
maybe no one will even remember this.

101
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,240
Dad, Wenqian

102
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
is a young woman.

103
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,270
Being alone overseas isn't safe.

104
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,520
When I was 18,

105
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,870
you sent me away for five years.

106
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,470
Even a teenage lunatic like me could go.

107
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,630
She's a sound-minded woman
in her thirties.

108
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,520
Why can't she go?

109
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,590
You really treasure Jian Wenqian,

110
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,470
Jian Youhui?

111
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,590
Hello.

112
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,680
The number you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,750
(Alright, Jian Youhui,)

114
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,630
(even you don't help me.)

115
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,800
If my life's about to fall apart,

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,070
then let it all fall apart.

117
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
Jian Cheng,

118
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,600
if I'm miserable,

119
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,720
you're not having it easy either.

120
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,230
Miss Su,

121
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,990
Director Mei's film isn't even
finished yet.

122
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,910
Why come back suddenly?

123
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,720
Something urgent?

124
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,910
Yeah.

125
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,660
(Su Yun, Award-winning actress)
A very important person

126
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
is having a birthday.

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Who is that person?

128
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
Sorry.

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,610
The person you're calling…

130
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,590
Tang.

131
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,720
Cheng.

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,850
Su Yun's back in the country.

133
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,720
Did you see the news?

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,870
Yeah,

135
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,750
I did.

136
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,870
She's all over the Trending Topic list.

137
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,870
Director Mei generally doesn't allow
taking leave from shooting.

138
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,750
Su Yun's got some guts.

139
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,920
Looks like

140
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,600
that the person

141
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,920
must be pretty important.

142
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
What a coincidence.

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,920
Over here,

144
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,800
someone's celebrating a birthday today.

145
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,940
And he's very important, too.

146
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm setting up

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,920
a candlelight dinner for him.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
No public display of affection.

149
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Well,

150
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Zhou Tingyan's birthday parties
in the past,

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,750
honestly,

152
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,000
were always pretty dull.

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,350
Still, he celebrated it every year.

154
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,080
He suddenly doesn't celebrate it
this year.

155
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,110
Hey,

156
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Cheng,

157
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,680
don't tell me it's because of you.

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,660
I won't hold the birthday party
this time.

159
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,380
Since Jian Cheng never celebrates it,

160
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,400
me neither.

161
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,680
I follow her.

162
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Seriously?

163
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,680
Just enjoy it quietly.

164
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,680
(Let me snap a photo and send it
to Zhou Tingyan.)

165
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,860
(Honey)

166
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,750
Honey,

167
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,670
you look great.

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,870
Come home early tonight.

169
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,710
OK.

170
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,990
(Zhou)
My wife arranged these flowers for me.

171
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Nice, right?

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,630
Show off your love,

173
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,480
break up fast.

174
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,620
(Unknown number)

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Hello?

176
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
This is Su Yun.

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
You go back.

178
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I want to see him.

179
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
I want him to tell me in person

180
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
that he's married.

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,790
I've waited for him all these years.

182
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
All I want is just one word from him.

183
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,050
Is that too much?

184
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,150
Su Yun,

185
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,920
for so many years, Zhou

186
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,630
has always treated you like his sister.

187
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,880
Pestering him like this
isn't helping anyone.

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Qin Zhuo,

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
if I mention my brother,

190
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,430
he will agree to see me.

191
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,450
The reason why I don't mention him

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,870
is that I don't want to remind him

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,120
of the chain he still carries.

194
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Hello?

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,800
Su Yun's at the clubhouse.

196
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,750
Tell her to go back where she came from.

197
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,860
She mentioned that person.

198
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
Cheng.

199
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,150
Cheng.

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Cheng.

201
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
Cheng.

202
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,950
Tingyan,

203
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,790
go.

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
Let's go together.

205
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,360
Let's go together.

206
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,270
Hang in there.

207
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,270
Tingyan...

208
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Tingyan...

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
- Tingyan...
- Let's go together.

210
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,560
- Tingyan...
- Let's go together.

211
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
Tingyan, listen to me.

212
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,910
Tingyan,

213
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,310
I'm entrusting my sister

214
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,920
to you.

215
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,680
Take good care of her.

216
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Take good care of her.

217
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,470
Cheng.

218
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,400
Cheng.

219
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,400
Cheng.

220
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Pan,

221
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,600
do you think

222
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,590
I'll get beaten up later?

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,550
Yeah, I'd say so.

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,870
Then I'm going first.

225
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,390
Cover for me.

226
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Mr. Qin,

227
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,790
maybe you should stay and handle it.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can't outrun trouble forever.

229
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,630
You're built pretty tough.

230
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,480
Help me take the hit later.

231
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm not great at taking hits either.

232
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
When Mr. Zhou loses his cool,

233
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,030
only Mrs. Zhou can calm him down.

234
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,790
How about I call Mrs. Zhou?

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,440
Are you trying to get me killed?

236
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,870
So,

237
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,200
Pan Yu was telling the truth.

238
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,270
You're already married?

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,750
Yeah, I'm married.

240
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,910
Married?!

241
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,600
You're married?!

242
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,110
How could you...

243
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,200
How could you get married?

244
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,440
How could you marry someone else?

245
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,390
Didn't you say you'd wait for me?

246
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,350
Zhou Tingyan,

247
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,200
you said you'd always wait for me.

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
When did I ever say I'd wait?

249
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,390
I previously said

250
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,390
that my wish

251
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,690
is to leave the entertainment industry
at 30

252
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,030
and get married at 30.

253
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,150
You said you'd wait till I turn 30.

254
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,320
If I remember it right,

255
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,940
I only promised to protect you
in the industry until 30,

256
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,790
ensuring everything goes smoothly.

257
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,190
If you want to marry,
I'll prepare the dowry.

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,270
When did I ever say I'd wait for you?

259
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,790
And I never said I'd marry you.

260
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,730
- But I...
- Su Yun,

261
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,030
from the very start,
I made my stance clear.

262
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm just taking your brother's place
to take care of you.

263
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Other than that,

264
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,510
there's nothing between us.

265
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,710
Oh,

266
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,900
he didn't even give you a proper look.

267
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,720
Mr. Qin, pray for heaven's blessing.

268
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,630
He's rushing home to see his wife.

269
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,840
I guess he's got time to deal with me.

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
Zhou Tingyan

271
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,240
is deeply in love with his wife?

272
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,350
Truly in love.

273
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,680
Su Yun,

274
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,590
Zhou has treated you well
all these years.

275
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,150
He spent half his life paying off debts.

276
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,390
Now, he has finally

277
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,910
managed to live the life
he wanted

278
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,734
and marry the woman
who he wants to marry.

279
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,000
Can you just not disturb him anymore?

280
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,200
Compared to that woman,

281
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,200
I really don't stand a chance at all?

282
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,390
Not even the slightest.

283
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,550
I want to meet his wife.

284
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,840
I want to know

285
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,120
