What happened?

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
She talked back to you again?

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,920
It's all because of you.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
Look at yourself.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,520
That bracelet.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,430
You gave it to her.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,880
But why bring me up?

24
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,400
Feels like that cheeky girl
tricked me again.

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,190
Dad.

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,760
Just now, Cheng

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,680
asked me something.

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,190
What?

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
She said

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,400
she can't figure it out.

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,590
Why, after Wenqian

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
came here,

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,040
we all changed.

34
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,820
She said

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,760
she hasn't done anything unforgivable.

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
Then why did we

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,710
suddenly stop caring about her?

38
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,500
Dad.

39
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,920
I was just by the door

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,020
watching Cheng walk farther away,

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,500
like we drifting apart.

42
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,620
I was just thinking

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,380
she's right.

44
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,340
I used to care for her the most.

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,540
You and Mom were busy.

46
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,520
I was the one looking after her.

47
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,820
Why?

48
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,340
Why did I suddenly stop caring for her?

49
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,180
I don't know why.

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,630
It just hit me in my heart.

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,260
It felt so heavy.

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,820
Really heavy.

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,900
It's all on me.

54
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,840
What happened back then

55
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,260
is all my fault.

56
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm the one who made this home

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,060
turn out so messed up.

58
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,140
I hurt you and Mom.

59
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,900
I hurt Cheng too

60
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,180
and myself as well.

61
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Sometimes I wonder,

62
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,980
what if you hadn't

63
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,060
brought Wenqian here?

64
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,700
You could've made it up differently.

65
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,340
You shouldn't have brought her here.

66
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,620
Stop overthinking it.

67
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,260
That's all in the past now.

68
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,780
No one's going to bring it up.

69
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,660
Mr. Wu, I heard

70
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,900
you joined Changsheng
after graduation.

71
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,820
And you've stayed for ten years.

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,280
Yes.

73
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,670
I'd like to ask you about someone.

74
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,340
Who?

75
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,820
Zhao Jun.

76
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,980
(Wu Sen, Business Manager of Changsheng)
Zhao Jun?

77
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,700
He's Jian Wenqian's biological father.

78
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,980
Zhao Jun was the Production Manager
at Changsheng

79
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,020
and my former leader.

80
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,290
He passed away many years ago.

81
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,700
He passed away?

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,540
What happened?

83
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,700
That year, he went to
Warehouse 2 to check inventory.

84
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,680
Somehow,

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,820
the wiring short-circuited.

86
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,260
It triggered a fire.

87
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,020
He was trapped inside for too long.

88
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,420
They couldn't save him.

89
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,260
The company covered up the incident.

90
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,670
No one was allowed to talk about it.

91
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,820
Later, Jian Hongyun
adopted Zhao Jun's daughter.

92
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,540
Why?

93
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,140
They were college classmates.

94
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,740
They shared a dorm room, bunk beds.

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,540
They were close back then.

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,420
After Jian Hongyun
took over the family business,

97
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,260
he hired Zhao Jun immediately.

98
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,220
Given how close they were,

99
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,660
he adopting Zhao Jun's daughter

100
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,380
makes perfect sense.

101
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,500
You were asking about Zhao Jun.

102
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,640
Is something going on?

103
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,380
Mr. Wu,

104
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,380
I'd like to ask for

105
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,500
your help with something.

106
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,250
Mr. Wu,

107
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,860
what did President Zhou want from you?

108
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,980
Go ahead.

109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,940
First thing,

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,260
find some old acquaintances from back then

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,940
and check the real cause
of the fire at Warehouse 2.

112
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,420
Second, look into

113
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,580
what happened
after Zhao Jun's wife remarried,

114
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,140
which was after Wenqian
joined the Jian Family.

115
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,920
Will you take this on?

116
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,660
Of course.

117
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,300
Zhao Jun's death was heavily covered up.

118
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,740
Now his daughter's the second-in-command
at Changsheng.

119
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,380
That is pretty strange indeed.

120
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,140
This bracelet

121
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,060
looks nice, right?

122
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,380
Yeah.

123
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,380
Jian told me today,

124
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,420
he was going to give it to me.

125
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,620
But Jian Youhui...

126
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,740
Youhui actually said,

127
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
don't give it to me.

128
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,900
He asked Jian

129
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,820
to keep it for Jian Wenqian.

130
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,380
He said,

131
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,380
I don't even like it.

132
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,140
Can you believe that?

133
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
And then

134
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,500
they still expect me to support

135
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,380
their so-called romance

136
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,700
by complaining about Wang.

137
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,020
I mean,

138
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,940
he's got some nerve.

139
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,740
So weird.

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,340
Back then,

141
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,950
my brother

142
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,180
knows exactly what I like

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,370
and what I don't like.

144
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,860
Now tell me,

145
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,500
how could he forget everything?

146
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,460
Cheng.

147
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,300
I feel like

148
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,180
you've changed somehow.

149
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,340
Yeah.

150
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,140
Lately, I think I've been

151
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,700
looking better and better.

152
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,860
Every morning when I look in the mirror,

153
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,940
I'm almost moved to tears by my beauty.

154
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,620
That's not what I mean.

155
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,860
I'm talking about

156
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,060
how you handle situations.

157
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,540
The way you solve problems

158
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,540
has changed.

159
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,420
You've grown more mature

160
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,740
and less impulsive.

161
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,260
Mm-hmm.

162
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,340
Because

163
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,060
Zhou Tingyan doesn't like me
getting into fights.

164
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,260
He said,

165
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,980
if I start fighting,

166
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,140
I'd end up hurt.

167
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,980
If I get hurt,

168
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,300
he'd feel bad for me too.

169
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,300
So,

170
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,100
from now on,

171
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,340
I need to

172
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,420
win people over with kindness.

173
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,820
I'm going to be

174
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,940
a graceful and classy Mrs. Zhou.

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,620
Zhou Tingyan.

176
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,540
Why're you so careless?

177
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,620
What if you fall?

178
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,740
- I...
- Zhou Tingyan.

179
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,180
Hey, listen to me.

180
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,780
That Jian Youhui

181
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,940
is just so messed up.

182
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,180
Can't even handle his own mess.

183
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,860
He doesn't like Wang Niannian.

184
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,660
So he asks Cheng

185
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,940
to make a scene in public.

186
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
Is Cheng's face worth nothing?

187
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,420
If word gets out,

188
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,940
how many will shame Cheng

189
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,940
or blame her for ruining Youhui's match?

190
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,300
Wouldn't that be so unfair to Cheng?

191
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,580
Meng Tang,

192
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,540
thank you for today.

193
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,300
The driver will take you home.

194
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,020
Uh-huh.

195
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,660
Zhou Tingyan.

196
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm here.

197
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,060
I'm here.

198
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,100
Zhou Tingyan.

199
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Zhou Tingyan.

200
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm right here.

201
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,860
Zhou Tingyan.

202
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,140
Can you

203
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,620
not be so nice to me?

204
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,020
Why?

205
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,620
Because Tang said

206
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,740
you might have a bit of a thing for me.

207
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,380
Even if you do like me,

208
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,060
please don't be this good to me.

209
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,700
They

210
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,820
used to really care about me.

211
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,980
But one day,

212
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,460
suddenly,

213
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,620
they just stopped caring.

214
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,100
I'm afraid...

215
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,580
I'm afraid

216
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,500
that one day you'll be like that too

217
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,620
and suddenly stop being good to me.

218
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,500
I won't.

219
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,980
I won't.

220
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,340
I won't.

221
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,340
I won't.

222
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,260
I won't.

223
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,380
I never will.

224
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,340
I never will.

225
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,580
(Qin Zhuo)

226
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,060
(We can close in on Changsheng now.)

227
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,800
(Changsheng suspected of project corruption)

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,020
(Homeowners' rights violated)

229
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,580
If this isn't handled well,

230
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,660
I can't keep my position at Changsheng.

231
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,220
I know what value I have
in the Jian Family.

232
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,020
Don't you still have Jian Youhui?

233
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,260
Jian Youhui is far from the best choice.

234
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,300
Oh, right.

235
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,300
That source.

236
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,340
Give him a little warning.

237
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,020
(Inbox: whistleblower;
Changsheng PR; local reporter)

238
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,960
(Next day)
The manager took kickbacks,

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,900
passed off shoddy goods,

240
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,740
and cut corners.

241
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,140
(Happy Daily)
How will Changsheng handle this?

242
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,980
The manager of Shenghui's new project

243
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,540
failed to bribe our reporter

244
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,740
and resorted to violence.

245
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Was this also condoned by Changsheng HQ?

246
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,620
Please answer.

247
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,630
We need you to respond.

248
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,490
Please answer.

249
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,380
HQ is holding an emergency meeting.

250
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,980
We will make sure all property owners

251
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,140
and everyone concerned...

252
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,180
Sorry, the person you calling

253
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,340
is busy making money.

254
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,340
Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

255
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,540
Send one even if it's not.

256
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,610
Thanks.

257
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,760
Hey.

258
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,740
Cheng?

259
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,620
I remember,

260
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,380
Qianyi had a partnership with the TV Station.

261
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,260
Now things have blown up like this.

262
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,500
Your dad means to

263
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,860
have Tingyan talk to the TV Station execs.

264
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,380
Ask them to reason with that reporter.

265
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,260
If even Jian couldn't handle it,

266
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,740
the reporter must be tough to deal with.

267
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,610
Why would Tingyan help him?

268
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,340
Yes.

269
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,340
You married Zhou Tingyan,

270
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,490
but don't forget,

271
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,850
you still carry the Jian name.

272
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,460
Now the Jian Family is in trouble,

273
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,780
you should be stepping up to help.

274
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,860
Why?

275
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,340
You only come to me when there's trouble.

276
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,580
Jian Cheng,

277
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,380
how does trouble at Changsheng
benefit you?

278
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,380
We're still your family.

279
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,780
Without your family's support,

280
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,860
how long will you shine
in the Zhou Family?

281
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,100
Zhou Tingyan.

282
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,460
Mm.

283
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,740
You've treated me the best.

284
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,860
She hung up on me.

285
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,220
You've never once hung up first.

286
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,660
You always wait for me to hang up.

287
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,220
Do you want more shares in Changsheng?

288
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,380
Tingyan.

289
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,620
If something happens to Changsheng,

290
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,500
it won't be good for Cheng either.

291
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,580
Don't you agree?

292
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,660
At 9 am tomorrow,

293
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,860
you and Jian Youhui come meet me
at Qianyi.

294
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,580
