Qin Zhuo,

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,280
your apology to me doesn't really help.

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,520
After all, this injury of mine

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,140
wasn't caused by you.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,990
Mrs. Zhou,

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,910
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,960
Ms. Mi,

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,950
don't feel too wronged.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,760
If you hadn't shown me those photos,

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,190
I wouldn't have acted.

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,690
We wouldn't be in this mess.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,590
When did I ever show you photos?

29
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,550
You...

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,310
That's suspicious.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,120
She really did show me.

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,510
The place you hit me has cameras.

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
I saw it.

34
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,200
I know I've got nothing to hide.

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,000
If you've got nothing to hide,

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,070
show me the footage.

37
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,710
Qin Zhuo.

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,960
Mm.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,870
Tang said

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,840
she trusts you completely.

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,560
She said

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
you'd never cheat while engaged.

43
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,310
You don't seem like

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,120
a playboy.

45
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,630
So,

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
did you actually kiss Mi Shan?

47
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,550
No, I didn't.

48
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,680
No kiss at all.

49
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,990
So,

50
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,400
that photo was edited then?

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,470
I thought it looked fake.

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Ms. Mi.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,400
You and I

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
kind of met through a clash.

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,150
I'm actually a photographer.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
If you need photo edits again,

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
just call me.

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,430
I'll give you a 0.01% discount.

59
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,340
Mr. Zhou, Cheng's wound must stay dry.

60
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,470
Take good care of her.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
What about you?

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,190
I'm fine, don't worry.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,240
Leaving with her or with me?

64
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,080
I've still got something to do.

65
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,710
- I'll talk to her...
- Whatever.

66
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,550
You go...

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Qin Zhuo.

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,590
I'll deal with you.

69

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Go to bed first.

72
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,560
We'll pack up tomorrow.

73
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,400
Alright?

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,220
Zhou Tingyan, promise me this now.

75
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,420
And you can do anything

76
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,580
when we're back home.

77
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,420
Sir.

78
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,060
Get the toiletries ready for her.

79
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,060
Prepare her bath.

80
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,320
(So he really does want to...)

81
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,940
Alright.

82
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,740
We're home.

83
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,880

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,180

152
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,140

The five minutes I meant

160
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,340
was to give you the ring
