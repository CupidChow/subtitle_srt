Son,

00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,590
she is the partner I found for you.

Stay back. Get away from me.

- Why aren't you eating?
- I'm not.

Eat, I'm telling you to eat.

- Eat.

You've been taken advantage of now.

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,430

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,000
it'd be better if you hadn't come back.

37
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,950
At least others could feel sorry for them,

38
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,760

in middle age.

39
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,710

40

No.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,280

are you and Mr. Zhou in a relationship?

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Back then,

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
my brother died

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
in the same car accident with Mr. Zhou.

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,910

104
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,430
did lent me a helping hand.

105
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,830
(Happy Daily)
But

106
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,430
there's no romance between us,

107
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,750
just a sibling bond.

108
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,160
I came back this time for his birthday

109
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,630
only as his little sister.

110
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,920
As for

111
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,390
why I never came to Jiangyu before,

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,360
it's because my brother died
in this city.

113
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
I held a grudge against it.

114
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,670
Who are you?

115
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,190
Jian Wenqian,

116
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,240
about the Jian Cheng kidnapping case
5 years ago,

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
please come with us

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,600
for investigation.

119
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,430
Dad, I want to turn myself in.

120
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,600
What are you doing?

121
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,000
Wenqian never even mentioned that.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,170
Why put yourself through this?

123
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,150
Everything started

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
because of me.

125
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,150
In my whole life,

126
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,680
I've never really decided anything.

127
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,560
So this time,

128
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,390
no matter how it ends,

129
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
I want to face it on my own.

130
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,790
Dad,

131
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
if Mom asks about me,

132
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,560
just tell her I'm on a work trip abroad.

133
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,530
Say I'll be away for a few years.

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
She overdosed on medication,

135
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
which caused a miscarriage.

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
Her body is very weak now.

137
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
She needs proper care.

138
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
And watch her emotional state.

139
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Thank you, doctor.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Didn't you say you'd take good care of her?

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,160
She said she doesn't want those meds.

142
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
Why are you still forcing her?

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,510
How would I know
she's in such poor health?

144
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,870
Back then, I took the same prescription.

145
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,880
That's how I had you.

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Why can't she keep the baby like I could?

147
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,800
If you ask me,

148
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,600
she partied too much before.

149
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
It wore her body out.

150
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,390
Now she's too weak.

151
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,160
That's why she lost the baby.

152
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,390
It's not my fault.

153
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,230
Mom.

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Zhou Yufeng.

155
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Yawei.

156
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,080
Don't move around.

157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
You need complete rest now.

158
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
Zhou Yufeng.

159
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,570
Our baby's gone.

160
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,870
It was your mom who caused it.

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,390
What do you mean I caused it?

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,760
It was your weak health.

163
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,000
Rural people tend to be frailer.

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
Can't handle delicate matters.

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Wasting my medicine is one thing.

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,600
You even caused the loss of my grandson.

167
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,390
I'm too kind to hold it against you.

168
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,240
Mom.

169
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,350
Stop talking.

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,150
Yawei needs peace.

171
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,600
Can you head back first?

172
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,390
Yawei.

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,790
I know you're heartbroken.

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
But Mom meant well from the start.

175
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,200
You can't put all the blame on her.

176
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,960
Zhou Yufeng.

177
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Why didn't you listen to me?

178
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,550
If you had told your mom back then,

179
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,200
she wouldn't have forced me.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,030
Our child wouldn't have been gone.

181
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,000
Zhou Yufeng.

182
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,750
You're also the one to blame.

183
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
Yawei.

184
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,030
You're very weak right now.

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,120
Try to rest for now.

186
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,790
We'll talk about everything else later.

187
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
As for having children,

188
