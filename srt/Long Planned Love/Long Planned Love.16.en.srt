17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,150
Zhou Lu, are you crazy?

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,560
I asked Qin Yingzhi.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,710
She's that big client from Qianyi.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,560
Why act like you don't know her?

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,800
You know well

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,150
Cheng has no trust in men right now.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,800
You used to be the one she trusted most.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,260
I told you to confess,
but you didn't dare.

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,410
But Zhou Lu, Cheng is doing well now.

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,120
And Zhou Tingyan is a great match for her.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,150
You... get what I'm saying?

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,690
You think I'm trying to split them up?

29
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,100
Uncle Zhou wants to pursue Cheng,

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,430
but he feels she has no feelings for him.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,760
So he came to me.

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,150
I suggested to him to

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,230
make Cheng feel insecure.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,150
What kind of lousy idea is that?

35
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,870
You can't use cheating as a tactic.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,480
The crazy part is Zhou Tingyan bought it.

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,350
Half and half, I'd say.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,400
What do you mean?

39
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,350
He believed half of it.

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
Which proves he really does like Cheng

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,430
and shows

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
he's pretty decent.

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,150
Can you talk like a normal person?

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
In plain words,

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
Tang,

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,710
no matter what choice Cheng makes,

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,710
I'll never do anything that hurts her.

48
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,430
Still not getting it.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,190
This is what you don't get.

50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,710
I stayed up way too late at Qin Zhuo's.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Couldn't get up early.

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,910
Mr. Qin, even the young
need to take it slow.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Go to the clubhouse.

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Meng Tang,

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
I ran into Mi Shan at the door.

56
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,870
Does that matter?

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,240
Of course it matters.

58
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,090
Hers is being renovated,

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
so I lent her my empty place.

60
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,550
Besides, I said

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,250
I won't start a new relationship

62
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,520
before the engagement ends.

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
So,

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
is the engagement holding you back?

65
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,270
Is that right?

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,310
That's not what I meant.

67
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,550
You know,

68
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,730
why did Cheng love Zhou Yufeng
for so long,

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,430
yet let go overnight?

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,000
It wasn't just one night.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,430
Cheng gave him many chances.

72
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,960
Guess how many?

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,150
A hundred times.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
She was unwilling to accept it.

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,430
That boy who used to be all about her

76
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,560
suddenly changed.

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,590
So she gave him a hundred chances
to hurt her,

78
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,960
forcing herself to let go.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
Even when she lost hope,

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,150
she kept telling herself to wait a bit

81
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,750
until 100 points were all deducted.

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
I'm not as strong-willed as Cheng.

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,310
I still love you even now.

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,840
But I do have my pride.

85
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,830
So my perfect score is only ten.

86
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,230
And right now,

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,430
you're down to just one point.

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,310
That last point is easy to take away.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Once it's gone,

90
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,000
my obsession

91
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,920
and my refusal to let go

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,070
will all disappear.

93
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,160
I'll go talk to your parents

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,880
to end the engagement.

95
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,160
Who's that?

96
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,710
A scam call.

97
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,740
(Zhou)

98
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,630
I'm in a bad mood.

99
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,110
Keep me company.

100
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,430
I'm actually feeling great.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,840
Don't get in my way.

102
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,600
Tang and Qin Zhuo
are at odds like this now.

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,720
What are we supposed to do?

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,270
When it comes to their relationship,

105
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm on Meng Tang's side.

106
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,950
Back at Mi Shan's restaurant,

107
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,100
I hit Qin Zhuo, you saw that right?

108
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
He still has marks.

109
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,870
I think I did notice.

110
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,750
If Qin Zhuo hadn't helped me before

111
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,620
and I owe him a favor,

112
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,750
I would've hit him.

113
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,670
He helped you?

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Mm.

115
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,720
Back when we were abroad,

116
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,630
I got sick and he found me a doctor.

117
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,200
(He...)

118
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,270
(I took the blame for him.)

119
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,380
(He owed me a favor.)

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,840
Zhou Tingyan.

121
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,750
Yeah.

122
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,000
Qin Zhuo said there's nothing
with Mi Shan.

123
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,750
Then why does he keep helping her?

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,230
Did Mi Shan ever save his life?

125
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,240
Between Qin Zhuo and Mi Shan,

126
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,680
there's no life-saving grace,

127
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,450
but something else.

128
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,590
Like what?

129
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,720
I promised Qin Zhuo,

130
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,910
it's his secret.

131
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,590
I can't tell anyone.

132
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,270
Alright.

133
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,510
Back when I used to pray to the Buddhists,

134
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,360
I would always wish

135
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,950
that

136
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,950
Qin Zhuo would like Tang too.

137
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,160
And that Tang's wishes would come true.

138
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,930
But now?

139
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,390
I'm actually really glad

140
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,270
that Qin Zhuo doesn't like Tang.

141
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,510
That's really great.

142
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,110
Why?

143
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,230
Because…

144
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,270
Qin Zhuo has Mi Shan.

145
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,310
Qin Zhuo will protect her for life.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,160
That's absolutely not okay.

147
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,560
No woman could accept

148
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,670
her partner guarding
another woman forever.

149
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,860
Even if there's no romantic feeling?

150
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,440
He doesn't love Mi Shan.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,070
He just feels indebted.

152
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,510
If Qin Zhuo only loves Tang,

153
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,030
it's fine, isn't it?

154
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,590
No, still not okay.

155
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,390
Some men are...

156
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,560
very responsible.

157
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,440
Like repaying a life-saving favor

158
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,870
with lifelong commitment.

159
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,870
Who said I married you
just for that favor?

160
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,510
She doesn't even answer your calls?

161
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,790
Dad.

162
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,750
Why do you get so worked up

163
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,830
whenever it's about Cheng?

164
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,670
You have changed.

165
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
How could it be the same now?

166
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,450
She's Zhou Tingyan's wife now.

167
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,470
But Dad,

168
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,390
we're in the middle
of a new product seminar.

169
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,160
The staff are all waiting for us.

170
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,260
You need to be more mindful.

171
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,500
Forget the seminar.

172
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,500
Zhou Tingyan took two projects
from Changsheng Group.

173
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,130
And he's invested in two of
our rival companies.

174
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,940
Everyone thinks he's suppressing us.

175
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,700
Yet he turns around
and protects our turf.

176
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,140
Do you know why?

177
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,260
You mean it's because of Cheng?

178
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,920
What do you think?

179
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,260
Everyone else is clueless.

180
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
But I see it crystal clear.

181
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,110
Zhou Tingyan once said,

182
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,780
the rise and fall of Changsheng
is tied to Cheng.

183
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
If Cheng's doing well,
Changsheng will thrive.

184
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
If Cheng's not, Changsheng will struggle.

185
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,820
He's proving that statement.

186
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,680
You're not that clueless.

187
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,660
Man, right now I...

188
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,580
Every time I close my eyes,

189
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,300
I see her losing it

190
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,540
and that Zhou Tingyan

191
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,060
pointing a baseball bat at me.

192
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,910
(Cheng)
Dad said,

193
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,900
we can sign the share transfer agreement.

194
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,740
On my way.

195
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,580
What did you say?

196
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,340
In your name,

197
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
I tell Cheng it's nine percent.

198
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,540
And get her to sign.

199
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,540
She's on her way.

200
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
When we talk later, pay extra attention.

201
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,340
In case that troublemaker
sets me up again.

202
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,580
(Looks like I have to sign today.)

203
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,860
(Let me think.)

204
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
(Maybe I can still get more benefits)

205
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,100
(out of Zhou Tingyan.)

206
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,420
Oh right, the bracelet that

207
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,340
President Zhang's nephew sent over.

208
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,130
Put it on the desk later.

209
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,340
Dad, Wenqian will be back in a few days.

210
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,640
She loves little trinkets like that.

211
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,060
Better save that bracelet for her.

212
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,540
Cheng isn't into those things.

213
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,540
You...

214
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,700
You're closest

215
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
with Wenqian.

216
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,860
Talk to her properly

217
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,940
and help her find someone to marry soon.

218
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,860
Not to be so picky.

219
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Then we can focus on
dealing with Zhou Tingyan.

220
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,760
- Dad.
- Hey.

221
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,180
You're here too.

222
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,440
Didn't go to that date?

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
It's already set.

224
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,100
Chairman Wang's daughter.

225
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,740
Our families are meeting this week.

226
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,660
I was just about to tell you.

227
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,890
Make sure Zhou Tingyan comes too.

228
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,820
(Wang Niannian and Jian Youhui?)

229
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,300
Why are you playing matchmaker again?

230
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,460
What do you mean by that?

231
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,700
Your brother and she really match well.

232
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,220
A good match? Jian Youhui.

233
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,820
Do you think you're worthy of her?

234
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,060
It's like putting a rose
in the wrong place.

235
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,300
Jian Cheng.

236
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,060
Dad.

237
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,540
I have a meeting.

238
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,900
Uh-huh.

239
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,420
Jian.

240
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,420
Wang Niannian's health isn't great.

241
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,660
Pick someone else to hassle.

242
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,140
H-h-hassle? What do you mean?

243
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,660
This is called a win-win partnership.

244
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,380
It's just business.

245
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,700
You don't get it.

246
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,460
Fine, I don't get it.

247
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,220
That's why I'm here today.

248
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,940
Hand me my nine percent shares.

249
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,940
I need to practice
with Changsheng Group.

250
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,140
Why do you always target me?

251
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,420
If not you, then who?

252
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,980
You don't care about me anyway.

253
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,060
I...

254
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,820
How do I not care about you?

255
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,980
You want money, I give it to you.

256
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,480
You want something, I give it to you.

257
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,660
I handed 9% share to you just like that.

258
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,980
That was because

259
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,940
I married Zhou Tingyan

260
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,060
and I'm his wife.

261
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,320
You didn't use to be like this.

262
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,900
How did I treat you before?

263
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,820
Alright, you want to hear it?

264
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,700
Then let me list all your wrongs.

265
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,700
In the first year Jian Wenqian came,

266
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,740
she set her eyes on my favorite doll.

267
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,660
You and Ms. Mei made me give it to her.

268
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,420
Even though you both knew

269
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,660
that was my most treasured doll.

270
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,510
In the second year Jian Wenqian came,

271
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,580
she clearly fell off the swing herself,

272
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,340
but you only listened to her.

273
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,220
You said I was young

274
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,820
and wasn't supposed to be so cruel.

275
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,300
In the third year Jian Wenqian came,

276
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,220
my piano teacher

277
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,860
gave me four tickets to a concert.

278
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,550
She mentioned,

279
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,410
she wanted to go with you,
Ms. Mei, and Jian Youhui.

280
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,620
You all left me alone at home.

281
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,160
How could you?

282
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,530
That was supposed to be my ticket.

283
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,420
In the fourth year Jian Wenqian came,

284
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,100
on my birthday that year,

285
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,300
she pretended to be possessed.

286
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,900
I caused a scene.

287
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,100
You slapped me twice.

288
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,540
Ever since then,

289
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,460
you never celebrated my birthday again.

290
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,400
In Jian Wenqian's fifth year here,

291
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,940
she set her sights on my bedroom.

292
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,940
You and Ms. Mei told me
to give it to her.

293
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,100
I refused.

294
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,580
And what did you do?

295
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,700
You locked me
in the basement storage room.

296
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,960
It was her birthday that day.

297
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,820
You took her out to celebrate

298
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,460
and completely forgot about me.

299
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,460
It was the middle of winter

300
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,060
and I was only in a thin layer of clothing.

301
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,820
I was locked in there for a whole day.

302
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,420
If Grandma hadn't come back,

303
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,540
I might've starved to death

304
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,510
or died of thirst, or suffocated.

305
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,220
In Jian Wenqian's sixth year..

306
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
Alright, alright.

307
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,180
I get it, I understand.

308
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,420
Miss, let me help you.

309
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
No need, no need.

310
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,980
Go check on Jian.

311
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,220
His blood pressure's acting up.

312
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,100
Get him some tea, calm him down.

313
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,940
Okay.

314
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,980
Chairman Jian, are you okay?

315
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,060
Dad's right.

316
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,420
Every time you come,
you act like a burglar.

317
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,300
Just spit it out.

318
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,940
Dad's trying to set me up
with Wang Niannian.

319
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,920
Her dad didn't like
that I'd been married.

320
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,070
He kept brushing it off.

321
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,300
Now that you're married to Zhou Tingyan.

322
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,880
Dad approached him again

323
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,900
and he agreed,

324
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,460
probably trying to
get close to Zhou Tingyan.

325
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,740
So, what are you trying to say?

326
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,460
I've met Wang Niannian,

327
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,740
and I don't want to marry her.

328
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,820
She doesn't either.

329
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,100
But she can't stand up to her father,

330
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
and I can't convince Dad.

331
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,940
So,

332
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,420
can you help me out?

333
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,060
Why should I help you?

334
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,580
You've never been good to me.

335
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,580
You know,

336
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,340
I'm a mess
when it comes to relationships.

337
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,980
You and Wang Niannian were classmates,

338
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,580
and your reaction tells me,

339
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,820
you don't want her
to marry a mess like me.

340
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,820
At least you know you're a mess.

341
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,820
Guess you know your limits.

342
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,820
Go on.

343
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,060
What exactly do you want?

344
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,480
This week, we're having dinner together.

345
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,740
I need you to be there.

346
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,460
Right there in front of everyone,

347
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,840
tell them you're not into Wang Niannian

348
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,460
and don't want her as your sister-in-law.

349
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,700
Your backing is Zhou Tingyan.

350
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
No one would blame you.

351
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,180
(Oh, great.)

352
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,940
(He wants me to take the fall)

353
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,780
(for his romance.)

354
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,940
Actually…

355
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,940
Mom's not a fan of Wang Niannian either.

356
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,220
I'll go talk to her.

357
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,060
She'll work with...

358
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,900
Hold up.

359
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I never agreed to this.

360
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,420
I'm your actual brother.

361
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,140
Right.

362
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,460
You really are my brother.

363
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,820
Jian said you've been eyeing this too

364
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,580
and want to give it to Jian Wenqian.

365
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,580
But he saved it especially for me.

366
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
Youhui.

367
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,740
Back then, you cared about me the most.

368
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
You'd spent

369
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,460
your pocket money
on toys and snacks for me.

370
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,340
You'd give me the best things.

371
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,830
You said,

372
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,060
as long as you're still my brother,

373
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,300
you'd make any wish of mine come true.

374
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,780
Cheng.

375
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,300
Youhui.

376
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,180
I still can't figure it out.

377
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,060
Why has everyone changed so much?

378
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,860
Ever since Jian Wenqian came,

379
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,900
all of you started acting differently.

380
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,660
Youhui,

381
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,340
before all this,

382
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,410
I never did anything unforgivable, right?

383
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,750
Then why...

384
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,780
Why did you suddenly
stop caring about me?

385
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,580
Cheng, I...

386
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,900
What happened?

387
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,660
She talked back to you again?

388
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,240
It's all my fault.

389
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,470
If I hadn't brought Wenqian back then,

390
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,860
none of this would've happened.

391
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,540
You can't hide a fire with paper.

392
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,480
If you want it to be a secret,

393
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,300
then you better hide it forever.
