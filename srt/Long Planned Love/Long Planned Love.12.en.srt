17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,720
Cheng,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,470
you're married now.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,840
I can tell Zhou Tingyan treats you
pretty well.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,860
If he really treats me well,

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,140
what are you trying to do?

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,460
Since early last year,

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,460
I've been looking for a girl
for your brother.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,140
Logically speaking, your brother
is very outstanding.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,020
But a few people always can't see it.

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,020
They say,

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,420
even with his qualities,

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,740
he's still been married before.

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,260
Finding someone of a lower status
would be easy.

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,420
But in our social circle,

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,140
we'd have to get someone
a bit less ideal.

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,380
That's nonsense.

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,770
So what if he has been married once?

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,560
Even though, your brother
is still the best.

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,340
Those people just have no insight.

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,700
One day, they'll regret it.

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,540
Look at you now.

38
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,260
You're married to Zhou Tingyan.

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
So you should help your brother more.

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,940
Get him to spend more time
with your brother.

41
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,860
When there's a dinner,
bring your brother along.

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,220
Let him work more with Changsheng.

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,980
Am I right?

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,940
Yeah?

45
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,710
Ms. Mei,

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,260
anything else at home I can help with?

47
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,500
Well,

48
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,620
your sister.

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,140
I've introduced her

50
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,020
quite a few promising young men.

51
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,020
But she's not interested.

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Your dad asked me to worry
about it more.

53
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,740
I've introduced everyone I could.

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,080
May I ask if you can find one

55
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,400
from Zhou Tingyan's circle?

56
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,740
Help me keep an eye out.

57
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,020
Alright, both jobs are on me.

58
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,020
(Cheng has finally matured.)

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,560
Ten million for one.

60
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,300
20 million for both.

61
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,420
If you pay me today,

62
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,580
I will do it tomorrow.

63
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,500
Why do you always bring up money?

64
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,140
You're really obsessed with it.

65
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,150
Every time you come back,
you take things from Dad and Youhui,

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,580
like a swarm of leeches passing by,

67
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
with nothing left behind.

68
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,020
Didn't you always told me to learn
from Jian Wenqian?

69
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,860
I'm just doing exactly that.

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,940
When I was little, my toys,

71
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,380
if she liked them,

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,780
you'd give them all to her.

73
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,500
The gifts I got over the years,

74
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,260
whether expensive or not,

75
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,100
as long as she glanced at them twice,

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,820
you'd hand them over to her too.

77
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,260
She's even living in my bedroom now.

78
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,660
I've been learning from her all along.

79
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,660
So I learned to take whatever I want.

80
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,900
The only difference is

81
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,380
that I have to fight for myself,

82
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,660
and she's got all of you

83
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,380
fighting for her.

84
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,500
You say I'm taking advantage of Jian.

85
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,060
How is it possible?

86
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,380
I'm just taking back what's mine.

87
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,280
Everything Jian owns
belongs to the Jian Family.

88
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,260
Before Grandma passed away,
she made it clear.

89
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,260
Everything in the Jian Family

90
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,500
belongs only to me and Youhui
in the future.

91
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,460
It has nothing to do with Jian Wenqian.

92
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Stop trying to sway me, it won't work.

93
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,980
Unless you can tell me

94
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,620
why you're so biased
toward Jian Wenqian.

95
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,620
Otherwise,

96
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,700
everything from the Jian Family

97
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,080
is off limits to Jian Wenqian.

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,970
Have you thought this through?

99
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,260
My daughter

100
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,230
has been sweet and sensible
since she was little.

101
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,220
She's sharp, witty,

102
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,940
and incredibly caring.

103
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380
When she was little,

104
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,220
her favorite place
was the amusement park.

105
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,660
Right?

106
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,740
Yeah.

107
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,100
I remember Cheng loved going
to the amusement park as a kid.

108
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,380
Every holiday, she pestered us to go.

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
But it was always crowded.

110
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,940
We had to queue for ages each time.

111
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,580
Oh, I remember,

112
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,620
Dad, didn't you say you'd give her
an amusement park?

113
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,900
It's been years now.

114
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,290
You still haven't kept your promise.

115
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Yeah.

116
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,500
I've always been too busy.

117
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,780
It's my fault I never made it happen.

118
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,940
I owe Cheng an apology.

119
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,820
Oh, by the way, Tingyan,

120
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,860
I heard

121
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,980
that you secured
the Tianyu Amusement Park Project.

122
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,460
Let's put that project aside for now.

123
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,700
I have a personal matter

124
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,750
that I'd like to discuss privately
with Chairman Jian.

125
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,020
We're all family now.

126
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,220
Just say whatever's on your mind.

127
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,660
Chairman Jian,

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,140
you've laid so much groundwork,

129
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,700
all because you want
to take a bigger share

130
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,880
of the amusement park project.

131
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
I can take you in.

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,360
But I've got one condition.

133
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,020
Go ahead, say it.

134
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,100
We're family now.

135
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,820
I want to know

136
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,380
the real reason

137
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,580
why you adopted Jian Wenqian back then.

138
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,500
Do you think Jian Cheng truly
wants to marry you?

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,390
She has had feelings for Zhou Yufeng
for so many years.

140
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,590
How could she forget all this?

141
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,260
She said she hurt her head.

142
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,460
Did she really?

143
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,180
Zhou Tingyan,

144
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,940
she's just using you

145
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,700
to get back at Zhou Yufeng.

146
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,480
Oh, right.

147
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,700
There's something I need to ask you.

148
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,180
What is it?

149
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,220
Jian Cheng said you planned the incident
in high school.

150
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
It seems

151
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,380
you were involved too.

152
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,180
I want to know

153
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,260
the real reason
why you adopted Jian Wenqian back then.

154
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,500
Wenqian's father

155
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
was one of our company's veteran staff.

156
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,610
And he had an accident in our company.

157
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,700
Spare me the things
everyone already knows.

158
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,600
My patience has limits.

159
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,060
I want to know

160
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,460
the real reason
why you adopted Jian Wenqian back then.

161
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,580
If you want to make this a condition,

162
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,100
then I can only say no comment.

163
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,340
You can't keep the truth hidden forever.

164
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,380
If you want to hide it,

165
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,340
then keep it buried for good.

166
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,980
What did you

167
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,380
talk about with Jian Wenqian
in the living room today?

168
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,440
Just some work-related matters.

169
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,140
(Jian Wenqian is trying
to steal my man, isn't she?)

170
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,340
Tingyan.

171
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,300
Yeah.

172
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm prettier than Jian Wenqian,

173
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,740
smarter than her,

174
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
and way more well-behaved.

175
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,700
So you'd better not let her charm you.

176
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,780
I like only you.

177
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,340
I'll always like only you.

178
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,740
Wow.

179
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,410
(Yunqing)
What do you think?

180
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,790
Wow.

181
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,580
Uncle Jian really splurged this time.

182
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,740
Looks like you should
bring Zhou Tingyan home more often.

183
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,580
I took so many things
from Jian this time.

184
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,100
He must be feeling the pinch now.

185
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,220
Normally around this time,

186
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,420
he would've called me
a hundred times already.

187
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I get rich!

188
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,540
(Jian)
Sorry. The person you're calling

189
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:52,364
is busy making money.

190
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,170
- His call.
- Please send a transfer if it's urgent.

191
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,500
Send one even if it's not.

192
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,940
Thanks.

193
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
What's going on, Jian?

194
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,560
Cheng, I thought for a long time
yesterday.

195
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,820
There's something
I've always felt guilty about.

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,110
So I want to take this opportunity
on your birthday

197
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,940
to throw you a grand celebration,

198
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,220
to make up for our relationship.

199
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,780
Cheng.

200
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,100
Tang, stay out of it.

201
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,940
Hello?

202
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,690
Something happened to Cheng.

203
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,670
What happened?

204
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,980
Since Cheng turned ten,

205
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,100
that awful Jian Wenqian

206
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,180
would always act possessed
on her birthday,

207
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,100
so Cheng never celebrated her birthday.

208
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,500
Her Grandma always felt

209
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,620
deeply guilty about it.

210
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,340
Before she passed away, she told Cheng

211
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,340
her 18th birthday must be grand.

212
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,220
As a result, Cheng was kidnapped
at her party.

213
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,800
Just now Uncle Jian gave her a call,

214
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,690
saying he wants
to throw Cheng a birthday party.

215
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,480
That's her biggest sore spot.

216
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,940
Why bring up her birthday at all?

217
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,940
That's the one thing she minds most.

218
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,820
I forgot.

219
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,580
Does it hurt?

220
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,260
It was them.

221
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,220
They got me worked up first.

222
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,980
I was just so angry.

223
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm not usually like this.

224
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,420
I...

225
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
Does it hurt?

226
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,100
No, it doesn't.

227
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,980
Let Zhou Lu take you to get patched up.

228
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,730
Mm.

229
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,420
Come on, let's go.

230
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,900
Ting... Tingyan,

231
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,700
Cheng loses her temper sometimes.

232
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
Tingyan, you've got to keep calm.

233
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,820
We're still Cheng's parents after all.

234
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,460
And we're your elders.

235
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,700
- I know what you're up to.
- Put the stick down first.

236
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,580
Put it down, OK?

237
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,700
I expect you to drop
whatever you're plotting.

238
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,940
If you don't care about her,
stop using her.

239
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,340
From this moment on,

240
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,180
Changsheng's future

241
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,740
depends on how you treat Jian Cheng.

242
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,020
Yes, yes.

243
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,640
If you dare mess with Jian Cheng again,

244
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,220
this photo frame will be
Changsheng's fate.

245
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,180
We get it.

246
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,340
Alright, alright.

247
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,100
Jian.

248
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,820
Does it hurt?

249
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,820
Zhou Lu,

250
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,340
was I scary just now?

251
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,460
A little bit.

252
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,060
(Zhou Tingyan saw me lose my mind.)

253
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,580
(I'm doomed.)

254
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,100
(Will he...)

255
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
Can you come to me
for this kind of thing next time?

256
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm better at it than you.

257
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,100
I can break this old house
with just two hits.

258
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,660
You're bluffing.

259
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,340
Sorry.

260
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,300
I got here too late.

261
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,250
Zhou Tingyan,

262
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
what took you so long?

263
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,380
It's my fault.

264
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,940
I was wrong.
