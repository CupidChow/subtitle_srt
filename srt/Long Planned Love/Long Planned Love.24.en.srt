the number you dialed

Please try again later.

23
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
Before this,

24
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,660
I never dared to hope for anything.

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,300
I love you.

26
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,700
But today,

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,820
I caught a glimpse of light.

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,980
I want to hold onto it.

29
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,260
We'll face

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,220
everything together.

31
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,220
Yeah.

32
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,500
(I thought I had caught the light.)

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,020
(But light can't be held.)

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,140
Uncle Zhou has found out the truth.

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,050
Back then,

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,140
it was Jian Wenqian

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,820
who told her cousin

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,730
to abduct Jian Cheng.

39
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,540
What did you just say?

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,580
She's in the mountains.

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,580
Can she not lose her dignity?

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,260
Do you want people talking about you forever?

43
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,700
Son,

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,900
think about it.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,820
Your grandpa cared about your dad.

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,780
If it hadn't been for your uncle,

47
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,380
Qianyi Group

48
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,860
would've belonged to your dad.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
And your dad's

50
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,740
would've been yours.

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,540
Jian Cheng saved

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,780
your uncle at this point.

53
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,980
She just doesn't love you.

54
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,900
Trust me on this.

55
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,460
I've protected myself.

56
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,580
Jian Cheng,

57
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,220
I trust you.

58
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,940
But I'm just not ready yet.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,540
(Turns out)

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,380
(when she needed me the most,)

61
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,180
(I trusted others and gave up on her.)

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,300
Yawei...

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,540
Does she know about this?

64
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,860
Of course.

65
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,260
A few people ganged up on you.

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,210
So you let go of Jian Cheng...

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,120
Stop talking.

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,400
You lost Qianyi...

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,270
Stop talking!

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,500
It was bound to happen.

71
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,260
Jiang Yawei.

72
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,110
Your own personal hell

73
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,980
has arrived.

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,820
If you want a better future,

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,340
listen to Mom's advice:

76
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,460
Get a divorce.

77
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,980
Before things turn ugly,

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
ask for more money

79
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,700
and move to another city.

80
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,020
Live your own life well.

81
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,140
If you keep being stubborn,

82
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,470
in the end,

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,830
this mismatched marriage

84
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,240
will drain you into someone bitter.

85
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,900
Eventually,

86
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,700
you'll end up with nothing.

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,140
Zhou Yufeng.

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,380
Zhou Yufeng.

89
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,060
Zhou Yufeng!

90
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,580
Speak.

91
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,780
Let's get divorced.

92
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,830
Jiang Yawei,

93
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,380
in this lifetime,

94
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,180
I will never divorce you.

95
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,220
Let go.

96
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,820
Let me go.

97
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,050
I wanted to apologize to Jian Cheng,

98
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,700
but now I can't even face her.

99
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,860
If it weren't for all that happened,

100
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,140
maybe we could've been friends.

101
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,060
So...

102
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,780
you came to me,

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,620
hoping I'd play peacemaker.

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,140
Sorry.

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,340
On this matter,

106
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm siding with Cheng.

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,340
I heard

108
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,100
you're concerned
about Qin Zhuo and Mi Shan.

109
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,980
What are you trying to say?

110
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,500
Five years ago,

111
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,580
Mi Shan was drugged by her agent

112
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,460
and sent into Qin Zhuo's room.

113
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,820
Qin Zhuo was too drunk,

114
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,290
but he realized it and left.

115
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,180
A Sasaeng fan still

116
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,500
snuck in and took photos.

117
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,340
Next day, Mi Shan's scandalous photos
were everywhere.

118
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,860
Out of guilt,

119
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,270
Qin Zhuo claimed to be her boyfriend

120
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,660
and explained about the photos.

121
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,060
It also saved her career.

122
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,020
So,

123
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,420
the two of them

124
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,720
really had nothing going on.

125
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,180
Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,420
Then...

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,180
why are you telling me all this?

128
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
Because

129
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,450
you're someone important to Jian Cheng.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,490
If you're happy,

131
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,780
Jian Cheng will be happy too.

132
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,460
It's kind of

133
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
my way of making amends.

134
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,580
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,340
I want to speak for him

136
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,660
and apologize to you.

137
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,940
Even his apology

138
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,660
has to come through you.

139
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
There are some things

140
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,620
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

141
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,580
Don't say it.

142
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,420
I feel like

143
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,700
maybe being friends

144
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
