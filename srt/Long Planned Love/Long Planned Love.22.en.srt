The people Zhang Zhen sent got taken down.

18

Zhou Tingyan will soon
trace it back to you.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,250
I'll give you an account.

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,390
Get out of sight for a while.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,780
(Li Shui, Jian Wenqian's uncle)

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,840
Why drag my people into this?

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,900
Are you out of your mind?

24
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,760
Look what happened.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
The plan fell through.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,790
And they ended up caught.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,150
I admit I rushed things.

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,640
Su Yun has to leave Jiangyu soon.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,950
We can't upset Director Mei.

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,950
The film has to be made.

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,920
If we lose this chance,

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
by next time,

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,790
Jian Cheng might already have a kid.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,740
Zhou Tingyan will only protect her more.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,760
You once told me

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,590
Jian Cheng was sold to the mountains.

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,760
That must've left a deep scar.

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,430
I just meant to scare her.

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,490
Besides,

40
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,920
Zhou Tingyan didn't follow up on it.

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
That's enough.

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,150
As long as it involves Jian Cheng,

43
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,350
Zhou Tingyan will never let it slide.

44
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,400
From now on, without my consent,

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,790
don't contact my people again.

46
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,790
(Maybe I can use her)

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,400
(to distract Zhou Tingyan for a while.)

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,190
My guys dug up something.

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,840
Jian Wenqian's private accounts

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,910
is moving big sums overseas via Shenghui.

51
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,800
Could she have sensed something?

52
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,960
With such a thing happening,

53
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,630
should I give Chairman Jian a heads-up?

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,870
Letting Wenqian go abroad

55
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,430
was indeed my decision.

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,080
It's also the best way to handle

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,430
her and Youhui's issues.

58
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,630
The best way?

59
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,030
I don't think so.

60
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,240
What do you mean?

61
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,150
All these years,

62
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,310
Jian Wenqian has used the connections

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,870
of Changsheng
to pull in a lot of contacts.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,840
She's got big ambitions,

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
and she's capable too.

66
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,310
If we send her abroad,

67
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,120
it could come back to bite us.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
(Absolutely.)

69
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,150
(Half of Changsheng's resources
are in her hands.)

70
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,000
I think the best place for her

71
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,920
is away from the center of power,

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
but still within our control.

73
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
She handled the mess

74
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,840
Shenghui left behind well.

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,280
To outsiders,

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,430
it looks like Wenqian's been loyal
to Changsheng.

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
After this,

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,150
we can separate Shenghui and her
from Changsheng.

79
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,710
Whatever happens to Shenghui and her

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
won't affect Changsheng anymore.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Sacrifice the small

82
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,710
to protect the big.

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,030
What could possibly happen to them?

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,470
Chairman Jian,

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,630
motives can be unpredictable.

86
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,910
Whatever happens to Shenghui and her

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,630
won't affect Changsheng anymore.

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
Dad.

89
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,810
Dad.

90
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,190
I just received a transfer notice.

91
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,080
I know you're still upset with me

92
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,560
and don't want to see me anymore.

93
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,590
I'll agree to go abroad.

94
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,240
Changsheng Group's overseas project

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,630
needs further follow-up.

96
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,360
I'll take it as a business trip.

97
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,270
No need.

98
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,910
Youhui is already on it.

99
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,800
Shenghui needs someone in charge

100
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,630
to oversee the property rectification.

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,150
If you really want to

102
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,000
earn back your credit,

103
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,870
go stay at Shenghui.

104
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,480
Handle Shenghui's public image issues

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
and you'll have

106
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,680
the leverage to stand firm in the Group.

107
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,070
But I...

108
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,240
Shenghui is a key branch of Changsheng.

109
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,160
If you manage Shenghui well,

110
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,430
it'll be yours in the future.

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,510
(Zhou Tingyan.)

112
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,390
(It must be Zhou Tingyan again.)

113
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Move the plan ahead.

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,190
Since you know Wenqian is overly ambitious,

115
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,390
why keep her in Changsheng?

116
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,630
That's not a smart move.

117
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,000
Now everything is finally taking shape.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,240
But key evidence is still missing.

119
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,430
If we let her slip abroad now,

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
it's going to be tough

121
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
to catch her later.

122
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,670
Wenqian.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
Didn't I tell you

124
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,750
to go to Shenghui this afternoon?

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,270
Why are you still here?

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,510
What a pretentious family.

127
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,030
What's wrong?

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,270
Now I'm useless to you, is that it?

129
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,070
Or is it...

130
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,050
This time it's my turn, like Jian Cheng,

131
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,720
to be the one sacrificed.

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
Jian.

133
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,190
(Jian Cheng)
If you want to know why I'm adopted,

134
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,430
come back at 1 pm

135
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,950
and you'll know the truth.

136
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,500
What does she mean by that?

137
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,640
Jian Cheng.

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,820
You think you're the one

139
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,160
who walked away from them,

140
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,070
but actually,

141
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,720
they sacrificed you for their own gain.

142
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,870
Cheng.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We took Wenqian in back then

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
because

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,390
your brother made a mistake as a kid.

146
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,270
That year,

147
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,390
he was six years old.

148
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,310
He couldn't stay put at home.

149
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,600
So I brought him to Changsheng Group.

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
I never expected

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,840
he...

152
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,630
accidentally started a fire,

153
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,480
which led to Wenqian's biological father

154
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
losing his life in the flames.

155
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,190
It was my lack of supervision

156
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,160
that caused this tragedy.

157
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
It's all my fault.

158
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,630
It's all my fault.

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,830
That year when it happened.

160
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,160
Changsheng Group was about to go public.

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
If this gets out,

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,240
it'll definitely hurt Changsheng Group.

163
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,190
Back then, your dad

164
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,270
had just taken over Changsheng Group.

165
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,000
It would've hit him hard too.

166
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,240
But most importantly,

167
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,800
if the truth was exposed,

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,830
it could affect your brother for life.

169
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,350
And then?

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
Later on,

171
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,560
your brother was already twelve,

172
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,190
yet still trapped
in that fire's nightmare.

173
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,380
His energy and spirit kept fading.

174
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,930
So I resorted to

175
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,810
a fortune teller.

176
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,590
He did a reading

177
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,310
and said,

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,190
we need to atone for our sins.

179
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,270
So I hurried to find Wenqian and her mom

180
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,190
and brought Wenqian back.

181
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,070
And then later on,

182
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,530
I became the daughter
Mom always dreamed of.

183
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
But you

184
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,830
kept straying further from her plans.

185
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,720
She loved taking me out

186
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
because it made her proud.

187
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
After what happened in high school,

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,030
she avoided taking you anywhere.

189
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,960
She even thought

190
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
it'd be better if you never came back.

191
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,670
That way,

192
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,880
when people talked about you,

193
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,120
they'd only feel sorry for her,

194
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,910
sympathizing with a mother
losing her child,

195
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,030
instead of pointing fingers now, saying,

196
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,240
"Look,

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,910
Mei Lan's daughter

198
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,750
was taken deep into the mountains,

199
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,030
was hurt by others.

200
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
She lost her dignity

201
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,840
and suffered a mental breakdown.

202
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,120
The reputation of the Jian Family

203
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,140
was completely ruined by her alone."

204
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Mom,

205
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,550
am I wrong?

206
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,800
Jian Wenqian,

207
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,080
you've lost your mind!

208
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,150
Yes.

209
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,390
It's all my fault.

210
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,870
I deserve the worst.

211
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,960
I grew distant from my own daughter

212
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,910
and treated you, an adopted girl,
like royalty.

213
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,910
But in the end,

214
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,630
I raised you into someone so ungrateful.

215
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,510
Karma really works.

216
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,390
It's karma, no doubt.

217
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,080
Does Grandma know

218
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,840
Jian Youhui's wrongdoing?

219
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,350
She knows.

220
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,790
This is the mess you created.

221
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,250
Why should I be the one to repay it?

222
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,870
You said Grandma knows.

223
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,480
No way.

224
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,200
Grandma definitely doesn't know.

225
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,360
She even gave me her dowry,

226
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,550
Changhuai Road, to me.

227
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,200
She loves me the most.

228
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,350
You're lying.

229
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,120
Grandma doesn't love me out of guilt.

230
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,360
She really doesn't.

231
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,320
It's not because she's making amends.

232
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,120
Jian, I'm giving up my shares
in Changsheng

233
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,120
and Changhuai Road too.

234
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm giving it all

235
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,000
to you.

236
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,790
I'll get Zhou Tingyan to work with you.

237
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,240
Just tell me,

238
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,120
none of this is real, right?

239
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,870
No...

240
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,960
It's all my fault.

241
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,910
I was difficult and willful.

242
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,500
I was arrogant and overbearing.

243
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,360
It's all my fault.

244
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,750
Dad.

245
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,150
Tell me.

246
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,910
I'm not your…

247
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,240
sacrifice for atonement.

248
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
Am I right?

249
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,750
I'm not a sacrifice for your gain,

250
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,910
am I?

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Youhui.

252
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,560
Youhui.

253
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
Please, tell me.

254
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Liars.

255
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,720
You're all liars.

256
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,750
Cheng.

257
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,260
Grandma doesn't love me to atone.

258
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm not a sacrifice.

259
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,320
Grandma never saw me as the sacrifice.

260
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,240
She's not like you people.

261
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
Cheng.

262
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,000
She's different.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,390
You're all liars!

264
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,620
Cheng.

265
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,780
(Jian Cheng,)

266
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,770
(starting today, you'll see)

267
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,560
(what it means to lose everything.)

268
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Mr. Zhou,

269
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,100
Madam and Su Yun

270
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,940
are trending.

271
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,330
What? Jian Cheng is

272
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,540
(Jian Cheng involved in Su Yun's romance)
the other woman.

273
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,720
She got cheated on,

274
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,740
so she got back on others.

275
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,320
(Su Yun's financial backer Zhou Tingyan)

276
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,960
Pull that topic down now.

277
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,800
Got it.

278
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,240
- The number you dialed is not reachable.
- Hello?

279
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,720
Su Yun.

280
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,180
You're behind that trend, aren't you?

281
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,550
Trend?

282
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,510
What trending topic?

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,550
Please get your facts straight.

284
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,720
Zhou Tingyan wanted to marry Jian Cheng.

285
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
She doesn't even know
your issue with him.

286
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,630
It's Zhou Tingyan who owes you a debt.

287
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,320
Why are you picking on Jian Cheng?

288
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
- I...
- Didn't I warn you last time?

289
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,150
Fix things however you want,

290
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,670
but leave Jian Cheng out of it.

291
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,750
You'd better clear this up right now.

292
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,540
Or even your brother can't save you.

293
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,780
(Jian Cheng involved in Su Yun's romance)

294
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,360
What's going on with this trend?

295
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Was this your doing?

296
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,510
How could I pull that off?

297
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,590
Zhang Zhen.

298
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,390
That wasn't a question.

299
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,360
It was a statement.

300
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,550
Your professionalism is seriously lacking.

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,030
I finished shooting Director Mei's film.

302
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,240
And you're making such a scene.

303
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,550
What exactly do you want?

304
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,390
If things blow up,

305
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,390
what will happen to the film?

306
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
I promise,

307
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
it won't happen.

308
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,670
Director Mei's film

309
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,870
will be released smoothly.

310
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
You promise?

311
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,120
Zhou Tingyan is a married man.

312
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I, a trending star,
get tangled up with him.

313
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,480
You sure nothing will happen?

314
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,870
Or is it that you've got

315
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,790
another card up your sleeve?

316
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm sure

317
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,030
because Zhou Tingyan

318
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,390
owes you.

319
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
He wouldn't ruin you.

320
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,350
Owes me?

321
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
You mean my brother.

322
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,630
Indeed,

323
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,270
Zhou Tingyan gave me resources

324
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,360
because he felt guilty.

325
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,510
So you made such a big move,

326
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,630
even risking my career,

327
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,670
just to take that gamble,

328
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,150
betting Tingyan will shield me
out of guilt and duty.

329
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,030
Is that it?

330
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
Everything I did was for you.

331
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,100
For me?

332
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,950
Do you even know

333
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,030
Zhou Tingyan hates being threatened?

334
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,790
Yet you forced him online.

335
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,910
Doing this will only make him think

336
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,600
that I'm exploiting my brother's death

337
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,580
as leverage just to take from him.

338
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,910
I'll clarify this myself.

339
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,030
From now on,

340
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,030
don't intervene.

341
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,550
Is Jian Cheng home?

342
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,390
Cheng just left.

343
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,380
Has she seen the trend?

344
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,240
You mean…

345
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,320
The trending topic?

346
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,630
She…

347
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,200
Maybe she hasn't checked her phone.

348
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,200
Assistant Pan, what's with that trend?

349
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,120
Everyone, about the trending topic,

350
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,480
you can check your phones.

351
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,630
See the trending topic now.

352
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,790
(Zhou Tingyan's first love)
Mrs. Zhou,

353
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,030
Jian Cheng, is my first love.

354
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,480
And beyond that,

355
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,630
I have never loved anyone else.

356
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,670
The reporters are upstairs.

357
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
Miss Su.

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,510
Don't mind me speaking frankly.

359
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,030
Mr. Zhou is disappointed
in you this time.

360
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,390
He's already told me

361
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,240
to start terminating Qianyi Group's

362
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,360
partnership with your studio

363
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,200
and related business projects.

364
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,390
I'll be blunt.

365
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,200
If you insist on going your own way,

366
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,390
you and Mr. Zhou might...
